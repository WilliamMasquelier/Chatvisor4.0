Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 25\nLength: 855 words\nByline: Alex Gluyas\nBody\nPeter Edwards is chairman of Victor Smorgon Group and co-chief investment officer of the Global Multi-Strategy \nFund, which has returned 40.6 per cent annually since its 2019 inception. The Melbourne-based firm oversees \nmore than $1 billion in assets.\nThe global fund has returned 22.6 per cent so far this financial year. What has driven that performance? | The fund \ninvests in several themes including gold, automation, decarbonisation, and emerging markets. Over the past three \nmonths, performance has been led by investments in gold and decarbonisation.\nThe largest contributor has been Australian gold miner Red 5, which has moved from developing an asset into \ncommercial production. We've been a substantial shareholder since March 2021, and we have supported it through \nthe development financing phase to its profitable production today.\nJapanese company Hitachi has also added significant returns over the past two years. It's divested its legacy \nconstruction machinery, chemicals, and metals businesses to focus on producing higher margin products with \ngreater returns on capital, and with a higher propensity for cash flow generation. It has also sharpened its focus on \nreturning cash to shareholders and growing dividends per share at a compound annual growth rate of 13.6 per cent \nover the past five years.\nHow much further do you expect the copper price to run and which stocks do you own? | We expect that copper \ndemand will remain strong, with price upside driven by structural supply constraints.\nWe like miners with strong leadership and proven records in creating shareholder returns and value low \njurisdictional risk and higher-grade orebodies with expansion potential.\nFor producing companies, we like Canadian miners Lundin Group and Capstone Copper.\nAnother company we support is US-based mineral exploration company Ivanhoe Electric, which is developing the \nSanta Cruz project and exploring for new major copper deposits in North America.\nPage 2 of 2\nThe stocks fuelling Victor Smorgon's 40pc returns Fundie Q&A\nWe are also involved in BMC Minerals, which is developing one of the most exciting volcanogenic massive sulphide \n(sources of copper, zinc, gold, silver) districts globally.\nDo you expect the disconnect between gold prices and mining stocks to abate? Which stocks are best positioned? | \nWe have noticed that a large majority of recent gold demand has come from BRICS nations, which are increasingly \ntransacting with each other in their local currencies and settling the surplus with physical gold. This demand from \nnon-Western buyers will continue to support the gold price.\nWestern gold investors are preferring to invest in gold mining equities, and are less enthused by the gold bull \nmarket, which has created this disconnect. If this trend continues, we believe it's more likely that gold equities will \nreflect the gold price.\nHistorically, the bottom of the cycle typically sees gold mining equities trade at a discount to the spot gold price and \nhistoric average multiples. As the cycle peaks, analysts start to imply a forward price greater than spot, and a \nmarket multiple above average.\nAssuming the future rhymes with history, the greatest gains will be with smaller, higher-cost gold producers and \nexplorers. For this reason, we like Ramelius Resources and Canada's Agnico Eagle.\nWhat's a stock you're bullish on that investors might not have heard of? | Copper miner Metals Acquisition listed on \nthe ASX this year after acquiring the NSW CSA copper mine in 2023. It's run by Mick McMullen, who has a track \nrecord of turning around major mining companies globally.\nWe believe the company's inception as a US-listed special purpose acquisition company and the capital structure \ntied to its initial acquisition has turned many potential investors away. Additionally, CSA was previously owned by \nGlencore, whose exit likely led people to perceive that the asset is of low quality.\nHowever, we view Glencore's retained equity in Metals Acquisition as an endorsement of the asset and \nacknowledgement that the business will improve under a focused management team. The company has recently \ntaken several steps to simplify and improve its balance sheet which we also see as accretive.\nWhat's a stock you'd like to own but can't (for whatever reason)? | Semiconductors are a critical resource of the \nmodern world. With this view, ASML is a company that if it traded back to our target buy level, it would be added to \nthe portfolio.\nThe company has a dominant position in the semiconductor lithography market, benefiting from pricing power and \nstrong customer relationships, and is poised to continue benefiting from the increased demand for computing \npower.\nWhat is your favourite local restaurant and your go-to order? | A local favourite restaurant is Terrace cafe, inside the \nBotanic Gardens. Great place to be on a beautiful day, and the chicken avocado salad is delicious.\nAre there any podcasts that you'd recommend? | I spend a bit of time in the car, so love a good podcast. Currently, \nI'm listening to Pivot by Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway, The Grant Williams Podcast, and the Australian Strategic \nPolicy Institute have recently launched a weekly show called Stop the World.\nLoad-Date: June 2, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# The stocks fuelling Victor Smorgon's 40pc returns Fundie Q&A\n## Australian Financial Review\n### Alex Gluyas\n### May 31, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Ramelius Resources, to report.

Ramelius Resources is highlighted as a promising investment opportunity within the gold mining sector, particularly for smaller, higher-cost gold producers and explorers, indicating a potential for significant gains as market conditions evolve.\n\n2. The article notes a disconnect between gold prices and mining stocks, suggesting that if this trend continues, gold equities, including Ramelius Resources, are likely to better reflect the gold price in the future, which could enhance investor interest.\n\n3. The demand for gold from BRICS nations is mentioned as a key factor supporting gold prices, which could indirectly benefit companies like Ramelius Resources as they navigate the changing landscape of gold investment preferences.\n\n4. The commentary on historical market cycles implies that Ramelius Resources, as a smaller player, may experience volatility but also opportunities for growth as the market transitions from a downturn to a peak, aligning with historical trends in gold mining equities.",
