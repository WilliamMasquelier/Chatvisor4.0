Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 12\nLength: 568 words\nByline: Mark Wembridge\nBody\nThe US government relaxed some of the strictest criteria for hydrogen producers seeking billions of dollars in tax \ncredits, giving Australian green fuel hopefuls a reprieve after a torrid 2024 reduced their ambitions.\nThe administration of outgoing US president Joe Biden on Friday (Saturday AEDT) finalised the Congress-\napproved 45V provisions aimed at reducing the cost for companies to make clean hydrogen.\nThe US hydrogen scheme endured a complex and long-winded review that concluded with the easing of stringent \nrules on how producers source their energy. Hydrogen producers now have two extra years to find adequate \nrenewable power, deferring a problem that proponents had feared would stymie the industry's formative years.\nThe original proposal required producers to run their electrolyser machines - which split hydrogen from water - \nstrictly during the operating hours of wind or solar farms. Producers now have until 2030.\nSeveral Australian companies have hydrogen interests in the US including Woodside Energy's H2OK project in \nOklahoma and Fortescue's Arizona Hydrogen, both of which stand to potentially benefit from Washington's tax \ncredits.\n\"Will it be a shot in the arm [for the sector]? Yes, overall, it's positive,\" said Nick O'Loughlin, managing director at \nhydrogen start-up Sparc Technologies, which has a joint venture with Fortescue and the University of Adelaide.\n\"But unless we can get power prices down, the cost of green hydrogen will remain above the cost at which people \nare willing to purchase it. That is a fundamental barrier that the industry is facing to get these projects up and \nrunning, with or without credits.\"\nThe Albanese government is pouring billions into green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable energy, \nthrough its $4 billion Hydrogen Headstart Program.\nDespite the push headed by Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen, multiple homegrown projects were \nshuttered or downgraded as the sector's economics came into question.\nPage 2 of 2\nAussie hydrogen hopes buoyed by US rule change\nIn July, Fortescue axed 700 jobs and slowed its push into green hydrogen and ammonia by pulling back from its \nlarge-scale complex at Gibson Island in Queensland.\nOther local setbacks included Woodside icing two projects in Australia and New Zealand, Province Resources \nputting its Western Australian facility on hold, while Origin Energy abandoned its hydrogen venture in the NSW \nHunter Valley.\nWoodside said it was reviewing the new US tax credit regime and \"how it may impact our project in Oklahoma\", but \ndeclined to comment further yesterday.\nThe group's flagship green energy project has been repeatedly delayed since it was first earmarked for board \nsanction in 2022 and remains idled.

The broader All Ordinaries index fared slightly \nworse, shedding 1.4 per cent to close at 8033.6 points.\nThe dollar was flat against the greenback, buying US65.19c.\nOvernight on Tuesday, Wall Street stocks slipped amid growing doubts that Federal Reserve chairman Jerome \nPowell has done enough to tame inflation following hotter than expect job vacancies and factory output data.\nWhile Fed policymakers reaffirmed their view that it would cut rates three times this year, bond traders trimmed their \nrate bet on rate cuts to only two, while yields on US 10-year treasuries rose five basis points to 4.36 per cent.\nNabTrade director of investor behaviour Gemma Dale said the recent pullback in the expected timing and speed of \nrate cuts by the US central bank was helping to cement the view that the Reserve Bank would keep interest rates \nhigher for longer.\n\"We tend to adopt a similar mentality here, particularly because our rates are still currently lower,\" Ms Dale said.\n\"There's no reason for the RBA to rush.\" After the benchmark had hit record highs at the end of the March quarter, \nWednesday's sell-off had also been motivated by profit-taking, Ms Dale added.\n\"Cash is looking extremely healthy at the moment \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 that's a clear sign for investors that they're going to put a little \nbit aside at this point in time,\" she said.\nPage 2 of 2\nFaltering US rate hopes hit ASX\nLocally, technology stocks were the biggest laggards on the benchmark index, diving 3.9 per cent, as sector \nheavyweights Wise-Tech tumbled 5 per cent to $90.20, and Xero dropped 5.7 per cent to $125.01, while \nTechnologyOne shed 2.6 per cent to $16.32.\nThe real estate sector also finished sharply lower, falling 3.2 per cent, with losses led by Charter Hall, which fell 4.6 \nper cent to $13.01, Vicinity Centres, down 4.8 per cent at $2, and Scentre off 3.6 per cent at $3.26.\nInvestors flocked to gold miners, as the safe haven commodity traded at a record high above $US2288 an ounce, \nwhile oil stocks also benefited as Brent crude prices neared just shy of $US89 a barrel amid escalating conflict in \nthe Middle East.\nIn corporate news, shares in Ramelius Resources added 5.3 per cent to $1.905 after the gold miner posted \nquarterly production of 86,928 ounces, eclipsing its previously issued guidance of up to 77,500 ounces.\nRival gold miner Westgold plunged 14.8 per cent to $2.36 after it revised its production guidance for the 2023-24 \nfinancial year to between 220,000 and 230,000 tonnes.\nKaroon Energy was flat at $2.18 after it bolstered its forecast capital expenditure to $117m-$134m, up from $50m-\n$57m.\nSantos fell 0.13 per cent to $7.83, while fellow energy major Woodside gained 0.03 per cent to $30.51. Among the \nresource giants, BHP shed 0.6 per cent to $44.86, and Fortescue lost 0.9 per cent to $25.19, but Rio Tinto gained \n0.38 per cent to $123.06.\nLoad-Date: April 3, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOrganization Context: Noted as an energy major that had a slight increase in its stock price.\n\nOutput ONLY a number from -5 to 5 and nothing else.\n",
