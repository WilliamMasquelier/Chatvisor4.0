Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 11\nLength: 630 words\nByline: Aaron Patrick\nBody\nIn February 2023, businessman Andrew Forrest decided to shame his home state newspaper, The West Australian, \nfor engaging in what he said was commercial retaliation over a missed contract.\nThe move didn't work.\nSince Dr Forrest recorded a video that criticised reporting in The West, the Kerry Stokes-controlled paper has \npublished 78 articles about him or his company, Fortescue Metals Group, according to the paper's website. Sixty-\nfive had a negative slant.\nThey included coverage of job cuts and executive departures (\"The list of those walking away from Forrest keeps \ngrowing\"), business problems (\"Andrew Forrest the new victim of nickel price agony\"), and Dr Forrest's separation \nfrom his wife, Nicola Forrest (\"Shock twist in Andrew Forrest's marriage breakdown\").\nOne of the few articles about Dr Forrest available free on the paper's website reports a denial, which Dr Forrest \nmade to another paper, that he fathered three illegitimate children. Another wrote that Dr Forrest had described \nhimself as his staff's \"humble servant\" - and was published with a photo of him wearing a cravat.\nThe latest, two weeks ago, suggested Fortescue's dividends might be cut. Fortescue shares have risen 80 per \ncent since October 2022, when the paper's reporting seemed to turn negative.\nThe coverage raises a question: is Mr Stokes' power in Western Australia so great that it cannot be challenged, \neven by a billionaire five times as rich?\nMr Stokes, who denies giving his newspaper instructions, was Australia's 12th-richest person last year, according to \nthe Financial Review Rich List. Dr Forrest was second.\n\"Editorial decisions have nothing to do with Kerry Stokes,\" a spokesman for the billionaire said. \"To put that \nproposition to him would be totally misguided.\"\nA spokeswoman for Dr Forrest, who was in Washington yesterday, said he would not comment.\nPage 2 of 2\nAfter losing a deal, Stokes' newspaper pursued Forrest Business dispute\nDr Forrest has asserted that the coverage was triggered by Fortescue's decision to buy a hydrogen-powered fleet \nof trucks from a Swiss-German manufacturer instead of WesTrac, a construction equipment business owned by \nSeven Group Holdings, which is controlled by Mr Stokes. Dr Forrest had received mostly positive coverage in the \npaper, which lasted until a few months after Fortescue struck the truck deal in June 2022, after negotiations with \nWesTrac stalled over the vehicles' fuel systems.\n\"I made it really clear if they don't change that stance, I don't bluff,\" he said in February last year when asked about \nthe contract.\nSome of the critical stories appeared on the front page, hurting Dr Forrest's reputation and likely damaging morale \nat Fortescue.\nThe West Australian does not have a state-based competitor, and Mr Stokes controls the Seven television network, \nwhich broadcasts the most popular news bulletin in Perth. Facing off against a local media monopolist, Dr Forrest \ndecided to record the video for his staff to present his side of the story.\n\"Everyone loves positive disruption and improvement in technology and in society, except perhaps when it happens \nto them,\" he said. \"This, I believe, is the case and what has inspired the biased, inaccurate reporting of The West.\"\nMr Stokes, 83, comes from an era when media proprietors freely used their outlets to help their business interests. \nHe feels that he is unfairly criticised by bigger media companies based on the east coast, according to a person \nwho knows him.\nSeven West Media, which owns The West Australian, is worth $310 million. Nine Entertainment Co, which owns \nThe Australian Financial Review, is worth $2.5 billion.\nLast month, Seven West Media said it had decided to terminate a contract to print the Financial Review in Perth. \nThe print edition of the paper won't be available in the city from May 22, further strengthening the power of Mr \nStokes' paper.\nLoad-Date: May 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Businessman, CEO of Fortescue Metals Group | \"I made it really clear if they don't change that stance, I don't bluff.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Businessman, CEO of Fortescue Metals Group | \"Everyone loves positive disruption and improvement in technology and in society, except perhaps when it happens to them.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
