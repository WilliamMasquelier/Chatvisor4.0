The three deny the allegations and say Element Zero's technology was developed \nindependently of the work they under-took at Fortescue, and \"is very different from anything Fortescue is doing or \nhas done in this space\".\nThe documents released on Wednesday show private detectives hired by Fortescue followed Dr Kolodziejczyk and \nDr Winther-Jensen for weeks before the Federal Court issued orders authorising raids on their properties, including \nwatching Dr Kolod-ziejczyk's family when the former Fortescue chief scientist was away on a business trip.\nA report provided to independent lawyers that carried out the raids - as is required under Federal Court rules that \nauthorise privately obtained search warrants - said Fortescue's investigators lost track of Dr Kolod-ziejczyk when \nhe flew out of Melbourne in early May.\n\"Dr Kolodziejczyk's whereabouts have been unknown since Saturday, 4 May, 2024,\" the report said. \"In the \nmeantime, surveillance continues at the Victoria residence, where Dr Kolodziejczyk's wife and child are \npermanently residing.\" There are also Google Maps images of Dr Kolodziejczyk's property in Victoria and floor \nplans contained in the report.\n\"The private investigator noted that there appeared to be a home office set up within the ... Victoria residence in the \nroom to the right-hand side of the front entry door,\" the report said.\nThe dossier includes photographs of Dr Kolodziejczyk's wife and five-year old daughter and surveillance shots of Dr \nWinther-Jensen's wife and 16-year-old daughter who, the report noted, had been watched as she left for school and \nreturned home on one day. \"The private investigator has observed Dr Winther-Jensen at and around his residence \nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue hired PIs to spy on ex-staff\n(in Scarborough, just north of Perth). (He) does not appear to be working and has been observed conducting \neveryday activities such as watering plants, attending the gym, and going shopping,\" it said.\nFurther pictures included in the report were taken on April 22, showing the interior of Element Zero's \"principal place \nof business\" in Malaga, WA.\nThe former Fortescue executives are trying to have the iron ore giant's case thrown out of court for \"egregious \nmaterial non-disclosures\" when Fortescue won legal permission to launch raids on their homes and offices.\nAppearing for Element Zero, John Hennessy SC told the court the original orders were won on the basis of \"the \nweakest of weak prima facie cases\" and the case was causing ongoing reputation damage to all three men and \ntheir business. \"We say the order was improperly obtained, off on the back of what was egregious mat-erial non-\ndisclosure, and so we don't want it to continue any longer than it must out there in the marketplace,\" he said.\nFurther documents show specialist forensic cyber business Cyter was engaged to assist in carrying out the raids. \nMr Kolodziejczyk, Mr Winther-Jensen and Fortescue have been contacted for comment.\nLoad-Date: July 3, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
