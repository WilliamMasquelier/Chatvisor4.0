It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nGladstone turtle centre laments rusty nail found in shell, praises workers for separate rescue involving crane\nGladstone turtle centre laments rusty nail found in shell, praises workers for \nseparate rescue involving crane\nABC Premium News (Australia)\nJanuary 20, 2024 Saturday\nCopyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved\nLength: 570 words\nHighlight: From human-inflicted cruelty to dramatic crane rescues, this turtle rehabilitation centre has seen it all. \nWith hatching season getting underway, rescuers are urging everyone to be on the lookout.\nBody\nA green sea turtle is fighting for her life after rescuers found a five-centimetre rusty nail in her shell which was likely \nshot by a nail gun.\nFemale green sea turtle Midori was found in the mouth of the Calliope River in central Queensland late last year, \nfloating near the top of the water.\nA local man saw the turtle was unwell while out in his boat and she was taken to the Quoin Island Turtle \nRehabilitation Centre in Gladstone.\n\"She was in really poor condition because she already had boat strikes that had been healing but had heavy \nparasite load in there as well,\" Kim van Oudheusden, the centre's general manager, said.\n\"When we started cleaning those wounds up, we noticed what looked like a skin tag.\"\nOn closer inspection the wound was a 5cm rusty nail, completely embedded in the shell.\nMs van Oudheusden said for a nail to have penetrated the shell that deeply, it was likely embedded with a nail gun.\n\"It's pretty heartbreaking that somebody would do something like that to a turtle, we just quite can't quite \ncomprehend why somebody would do such a thing,\" she said.\nShe said the nail was in the area of where Midori's lungs were located and she was now on antibiotics for infections \nfrom various wounds and was undergoing other treatments.\n\"We don't know if she's going to make it, but we're keeping all our flippers crossed,\" she said.\nPage 2 of 2\nGladstone turtle centre laments rusty nail found in shell, praises workers for separate rescue involving crane\n\"Hopefully she's going to pull through.\"\nShe said it wasn't something the centre had seen before, though 35 per cent of the turtles treated were affected by \nhuman impact, including boat strikes, fishhooks or fishing line entanglements.\nSuccess story\nThough Midori's fate is still up in the air, the centre had a recent success story with fellow green sea turtle Moana.\nIn July, workers at the Queensland Alumina Limited (QAL) refinery found Moana stuck in mud in the Gladstone \nHarbour.\nAfter checking the cameras, the crew realised she had been there a long time, they called the Quoin Island team, \nand the recommendation was to get Moana out to be assessed.\nAs the 76-kilogram turtle was in deep, slippery mud, at the bottom of a steep three-metre rock wall, the team \ndecided to get the crane involved.\nQAL employee Corey Bruton has worked with cranes for more than 10 years, but this was the first time he had used \none to rescue a turtle.\n\"As we got the planks down there, the plan was to organise the shift crane operator to come down with a certified \nlifting basket, and safely put her onto the cage,\" he said. \nMoana was manoeuvred into Quoin Island's boat and taken to the island.\n\"When she was here, we quickly noticed that she had soft-shell syndrome,\" Ms van Oudheusden said.\nOn average, turtles stay on the island for about 77 days. Green sea turtle Moana \u2013 a species listed as vulnerable \u2014 \nended up staying for 165.\nMaking a full recovery with a newly hardened shell, she was recently released into the waters off Quoin Island by \nthe team, making her the 321st turtle successfully rehabilitated by the centre.\nIt rescues turtles from Yeppoon in the north, to Baffle Creek in the south, and sees a 73 per cent rehabilitation \nsuccess rate among the turtles it rescues.\nWith turtle nesting and hatchling season underway, Ms van Oudheusden urged boaties and others in coastal areas \nto be mindful.\nThat included watching speeds while boating on the water, not approaching nesting turtles, and turning lights off \naround beachfronts at night time, to avoid confusing emerging hatchlings.\nLoad-Date: January 20, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
