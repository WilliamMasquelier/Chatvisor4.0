Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 17\nLength: 645 words\nByline: Peter Ker and Brad Thompson\nBody\nFortescue has quietly taken ownership of two Queensland wind farm projects previously owned by private \ncompanies controlled by its biggest shareholders, Andrew and Nicola Forrest.\nThe Prairie and Wongalee wind projects near the Queensland town of Hughenden are now owned by Fortescue \nrather than subsidiaries of the Forrest family's privately owned Squadron Energy, according to documents filed to \nthe Australian Securities and Investments Commission.\nDr Forrest, Fortescue's executive chairman, said last week that the iron ore miner would slow its push into green \nhydrogen and would instead focus on generating renewable energy. Fortescue executives presented the \ncompany's quarterly production report to investors yesterday.\nThe Forrest family owns 36.74 per cent of Fortescue, which has pivoted to clean energy in the past five years.\nSquadron bought 75 per cent of wind power developer Windlab in 2020, under a deal that meant Federation Asset \nManagement owned the remaining 25 per cent. Windlab has been developing wind farms, including the \nundeveloped Prairie and Wongalee wind projects in Queensland.\nA Windlab subsidiary - Wongalee Renewable Energy Farm - applied to federal environment regulators last year for \npermission to install 175 wind turbine generators across 48,000 hectares of land near Hughenden.\nWindlab's shareholding in the Wongalee subsidiary was transferred to Australian Fortescue Future Industries on \nFebruary 23 - the day after Fortescue's half-year financial results were released. Fortescue has not mentioned the \nacquisition of the Wongalee project in any market filings.\nOwnership of the Prairie wind farm has followed a similar path.\nA Windlab subsidiary - Prairie Renewable Energy Farm - applied to regulators in 2022 for permission to build 116 \nwind turbines near Hughenden. But documents lodged with the corporate regulator show that, on February 23, \nWindlab's ownership of the subsidiary was transferred to Australian Fortescue Future Industries.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrests' wind farms sold to Fortescue after blow to hydrogen plan\nThe closest Fortescue has come to disclosing its connection to the Prairie and Wongalee projects was in \nNovember 2022, when the company issued a press release - but not a market filing - that said Fortescue would \n\"partner\" with Windlab on a renewables \"super hub\" that included the two projects.\nThat statement did not say that Fortescue would take ownership of the two wind farms, or whether the company \nwould help fund construction.\nThe Wongalee and Prairie wind projects have not been mentioned in Fortescue's annual report, financial results or \ncapital spending schedules in the 20 months since the November 2022 press release.\nAsked about the wind farms yesterday, Fortescue energy boss Mark Hutchinson said the company had originally \nthought they could supply clean energy to its proposed green hydrogen projects in Queensland.\nFortescue will not build any large-scale green hydrogen projects in Queensland any time soon and its small \nhydrogen project at Gladstone will purchase power from the grid.\nMr Hutchinson said the wind farms could be \"repurposed\" to supply power into the national electricity grid, but that \nwould probably require the Queensland government to build the CopperString electricity transmission project \nbetween Townsville and Mt Isa.\nMr Hutchinson said Fortescue would not incur any significant spending on Wongalee nor Prairie \"for a few years\" \nat least.\nASIC filings suggest Australian Fortescue Future Industries acquired Wongalee and Prairie for an initial \npeppercorn price of $1 each. It is understood the agreement between Windlab and Fortescue would see further \npayments made to Windlab if certain construction and energy generation milestones are achieved.\nWindlab has said construction on the wind farms could begin as soon as 2025, with first power as early as 2027. \nHowever, Mr Hutchinson hosed down those expectations, saying yesterday that it was \"very early days\".\nLoad-Date: July 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue energy boss | \"The wind farms could be 'repurposed' to supply power into the national electricity grid, but that would probably require the Queensland government to build the CopperString electricity transmission project between Townsville and Mt Isa.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue energy boss | \"Fortescue would not incur any significant spending on Wongalee nor Prairie 'for a few years' at least.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue energy boss | \"It was 'very early days'.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
