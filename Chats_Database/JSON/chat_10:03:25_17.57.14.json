It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nIron awe at Fortescue\nIron awe at Fortescue\nTownsville Bulletin (Australia)\nFebruary 23, 2024 Friday\nTownsville Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 27\nLength: 379 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nFortescue has declared a $1.08 a share interim dividend on the back of last year's surge in the iron ore price, with \nthe company declaring a $US3.3bn net profit for the half.\nThe dividend represents a payout of 65 per cent of the company's first-half profit, and comes after Fortescue \nbooked EBITDA of $US5.9bn, up 36 per cent on the first half of the previous financial year.\nThe dividend will deliver a $1.2bn payout to the commercial and charitable interests of Andrew and Nicola Forrest, \nwhose business and philanthropic affairs remain intertwined despite their separation last year.\nFortescue's Energy division booked a $US320m EBITDA loss for the half, up from $US302m in the first half of the \nprevious financial year. The energy division now includes UK technology business WAE, which booked revenue of \nabout $US26m for the year.\nFortescue's policy is to pay out 50 to 80 per cent of its net profit in dividends, and the mid-range payment - the \nsame as its total payout ratio across last financial year - comes as the company looks to ramp up spending on its \nPilbara iron ore mines and its green energy projects.\nThe iron ore giant spent $US1.52bn on capital projects in the first half of the financial year, with about $US1bn of \nthat on sustaining capital for its existing Pilbara miners. Another $US165m was spent on Fortescue Energy \nprojects across the globe, and another $US104m on decarbonising the company's iron ore operations.\nFortescue says it expects to spend $US3.3bn to $US3.7bn in capital for the full financial year, with about $US500m \nof that to go towards green energy projects and $US300m to $US500m on decarbonisation.\nFortescue's first half result comes after the company received an average $US108 a dry metric tonne for its iron \nore shipments in the half, up from $US87 a tonne in the prior corresponding period, with the company booking \n$US9.5bn in revenue, up 21 per cent.\nCash production costs lifted 2 per cent to $US17.77 a wet metric tonne for the period, as Fortescue kept \ninflationary pressures in the Pilbara largely under control.\nPage 2 of 2\nIron awe at Fortescue\nCiti analyst Paul McTaggart said the results had beaten analyst consensus estimates of a $US5.6bn EBITDA and a \n$1.04 dividend. Fortescue shares were up 2.9 per cent to $28.03 in a flat market late on Thursday morning.\nLoad-Date: February 22, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
