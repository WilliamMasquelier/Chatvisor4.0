The company has taken a number of major writedowns in recent years and shares have tumbled more \nthan 80pc from their peak in 2021.\nLene Skole, the chairman of Orsted, said: \"The impacts on our business of the increasingly challenging situation in \nthe offshore wind industry, ranging from supply chain bottlenecks, interest rate increases, to a changing regulatory \nlandscape, mean that our focus has shifted. Therefore, the board has today agreed with Mads Nipper that it's the \nright time for him to step down and the board has appointed Rasmus Errboe to take over as chief executive.\"\nThe downturn has already forced Orsted, which is building the Hornsea 3 windfarm off the Norfolk coast, to cut \nhundreds of jobs and pull out of several international markets.\nOrsted has warned of a significant fall in its wind farm output, meaning it could build 1,500 fewer turbines.\nThe upheaval led to the departure of the company's former chairman, finance chief and chief operating officer last \nyear. Mr Nipper survived that cull, vowing to \"fight with everything I've got\" to restore investor confidence.\nPage 2 of 2\nOffshore wind giant axes top boss as push for net zero stutters\nBut the company has taken a fresh blow as the outlook to the renewable energy sector darkens with the return of \nDonald Trump as US president. Mr\nTrump, who has vowed to reverse the US policy on renewables and revert to oil and gas, has already signed an \nexecutive order suspending new leases for offshore wind. Orsted this month announced fresh writedowns of \n12.1bn Danish krone (\u00a31.4bn) on its US business, which it blamed on rising interest rates and market uncertainties.\nMr Nipper said: \"Leading Orsted through four challenging yet rewarding years has been a great privilege. Despite \nthe obstacles we've faced, we've achieved many significant milestones, and I'm immensely proud of our colleagues' \nefforts and dedication.\"\nMr Errboe, who joined Orsted in 2012, said: \"I'm looking forward to taking the lead on the transformation necessary \nto navigate the headwinds that Orsted and our industry currently face.\"\nHe added: \"Offshore wind remains crucial for the green transition, and we're deeply committed to pursuing our \nvision of a world that runs entirely on green energy.\"\nLoad-Date: February 1, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**ENTITY**: [Organization Name]\n**TYPE**: [Type of organization - e.g., Company, Government Agency, NGO, etc.]\n**DESCRIPTION**: [Brief description of how the entity is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**ENTITY**: Tesla, Inc.\n**TYPE**: Company\n**DESCRIPTION**: Main subject of article, discussing Q4 earnings report\n\nOnly include entities that are meaningful to the article's content.
