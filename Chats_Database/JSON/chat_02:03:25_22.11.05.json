The business, which is controlled by the Danish \ngovernment, has become one of the UK's leading developers of offshore wind, with 12 wind farms in UK waters.\nThey include Hornsea 1 and 2 off the Yorkshire coast - together comprising one of the world's largest wind farms.\nThe company produces 7pc of the UK's power and is planning further expansion including two more wind farms \nnear Hornsea and a massive floating one off Scotland. However, its ventures into new technologies and regions \nhave hit the company hard this year, with Mads Nipper, group president and chief executive of \u00d8rsted, announcing \na total of 3.9bn kroner of impairments.\nThe FlagshipONE project would have used renewable electricity to produce hydrogen that could then be combined \nwith CO2 to produce methanol.\nThe aim was to produce 55,000 tons of methanol a year, enough for one large container vessel, making it a large-\nscale pilot project.\nPage 2 of 2\nGreen fuel factory axed in net zero blow\nMr Nipper said the company had been unable to secure long-term contracts to buy its e-methanol at a viable price. \nHe said: \"The liquid e-fuel market in Europe is developing slower than expected, and we have taken the strategic \ndecision to deprioritise our efforts within the market and cease the development of FlagshipONE.\n\"We will continue our focus and development efforts within renewable hydrogen, which is essential for \ndecarbonising key industries in Europe and closer to our core business.\"\n\u00d8rsted suffered a second impairment totalling 2.1bn kroner at its Revolution wind farm project near Martha's \nVineyard, off the US east coast. Construction delays at its onshore substation are the key cause. Mr Nipper said: \n\"Despite encouraging progress on our US offshore wind project, Revolution Wind, the construction of the onshore \nsubstation for the project has been delayed.\n\"This means that we have pushed the commercial operation date from 2025 into 2026, which led to an impairment.\n\"This is, of course, unsatisfactory.\"\nThe company reported a pre-tax profit of 3.9bn kroner, up from 2.4bn kroner in the same period last year, and net \nprofits of 931m kroner.\nTancrede Fulop, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said \u00d8rsted had outperformed expectations especially in \noffshore wind, but the impairments \"underscore the impact of project delays\".\n\u00a3172m The cost of \u00d8rsted's decision to scrap the FLAGSHIPONE project in Sweden amid a lack of demand from \ncustomers\nLoad-Date: August 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Green fuel factory axed in net zero blow\n## The Daily Telegraph\n### Jonathan Leake\n### August 16, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Orsted, to report.

The decision to scrap the FlagshipONE project reflects a broader trend among energy companies retreating from large-scale renewable projects, indicating challenges in the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources.\n\n3. \u00d8rsted's CEO, Mads Nipper, highlighted that the liquid e-fuel market in Europe is developing slower than anticipated, prompting the company to deprioritize its efforts in this area and refocus on renewable hydrogen, which is crucial for decarbonizing key industries.\n\n4. The company has also faced significant impairments totaling 3.9 billion kroner this year, including a 2.1 billion kroner impairment related to construction delays at its Revolution Wind project in the US, pushing back its commercial operation date to 2026. \n\n5. Despite these setbacks, \u00d8rsted reported a pre-tax profit increase to 3.9 billion kroner, indicating strong performance in its offshore wind sector, although analysts note that project delays are impacting overall expectations.",
