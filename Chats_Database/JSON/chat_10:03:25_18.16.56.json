But here's the problem: \nlaw firms act under instruction.\nSomebody at Fortescue instructed Davies Collison Cave Law to pursue the three men in the way that happened - \nor, at the very least, authorised the steps taken.\nThose, as a quick reminder, include: pictures of a teenager leaving school, following a family on a shopping trip to \nKmart, grubbing through their mail - and, given Fortescue is still trying to keep the actions of its spies secret, \nprobably a fair bit worse that is not yet in the public domain.\nIf Fortescue employees weren't overseeing the behaviour of their contractors, they should have been. Forrest's \ndisavowal of knowledge of their actions will only have meaning if there are internal consequences for those that \nauthorised them.\nOr, at the very least, a public apology to the families whose privacy has been violated. Until the court case is done, \nwe will not know whether Fortescue's underlying complaint is a reasonable one, and it would be foolish to prejudge \nthe outcome of the court case.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest 'surprised to learn of the investigations'\nBut the fact remains that the damage has been done. Start-up tech companies rely on investors to get them through \nearly stages of their commercialisation process. Any sniff that the intellectual property they are developing could be \nchallenged in court would scare off investors - a potentially fatal problem for a nascent business. Even if dropped \ntomorrow, Fortescue's legal action has already irreparably damaged the reputation of its former employees and \ntheir business. Justice should be done in public. The fact that Fortescue is still trying to keep its actions secret - so \nfar helped by the court - makes it difficult to see how that pillar of the Western judicial process can be upheld in the \nface of this case.\nLoad-Date: July 10, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Nick Evans\nDate: July 11, 2024\nTitle: Forrest 'surprised to learn of the investigations'\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Forrest 'kept in the dark' about spying\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Brad Thompson\n### Date: July 11, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nForrest 'kept in the dark' about spying\nForrest 'kept in the dark' about spying\nAustralian Financial Review\nJuly 11, 2024 Thursday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our ongoing \nsuccess.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest 'kept in the dark' about spying\nIt is the first time the Fortescue founder and major shareholder (alongside Nicola Forrest) has responded to the \nspying revelation.\nElement Zero and the three men reject the allegations of intellectual property theft and counter that the Element \nZero technology was developed independently and is very different from anything Fortescue has done.\nMr Masterman worked for Fortescue in senior roles for many years and, along with Dr Kolodziejczyk, was part of a \ngroup that travelled the world with Dr Forrest in 2020 on a hunt for green energy projects.\nThe surveillance was carried out as Fortescue mounted its case for search and seizure orders covering family \nhomes and Element Zero business premises. Vulnerable people, including partners and children, must be identified \nbefore any raids.\nJustice Brigitte Markovic described Fortescue's request for comprehensive suppression orders as an \"ambit claim\" \nand a suppression application from Element Zero as more nuanced.\n\"Ultimately, I'll have to resolve how much of the material truly is confidential. There's real issue about how much of \nthis material is confidential,\" she said. Justice Markovic said that, for instance, she could not understand a \nFortescue application to suppress signatures.\n\"Thousands of affidavits are filed in this court every day signed by individuals,\" she said. \"Hundreds of judgments \nare released every week signed by our associates. People's signatures are publicly available, so I do not \nunderstand that application.\"\nChris McMeniman, acting for Element Zero and founders Mr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk, said his clients were \nseeking the redaction of residential addresses and pictures of children in the private investigator reports, but were \nnot opposed to the release of other details.\nMr McMeniman said the Fortescue side wanted to redact \"the entirety of the investigation reports that run to some \n600 pages concerning 19 days of surveillance that was undertaken of all the respondents and their employees and \nsome family members and wives, following people to Kmart, sifting through mail and the like\".\nThe legal teams were instructed to see if they could find common ground on the suppression order and redactions \nand report back to Justice Markovic.\nDavies Collison Cave was contacted for comment.\nLoad-Date: July 13, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Brad Thompson\nDate: July 11, 2024\nTitle: Forrest 'kept in the dark' about spying\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Court told of Fortescue's spy campaign before raids\n## Media outlet: The Daily Telegraph (Australia)\n### Author: Angelica Snowden, Nick Evans\n### Date: July 11, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nCourt told of Fortescue's spy campaign before raids\nCourt told of Fortescue's spy campaign before raids\nThe Daily Telegraph (Australia)\nJuly 11, 2024 Thursday\nTelegraph Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 6\nLength: 305 words\nByline: Angelica Snowden and Nick Evans\nBody\nFortescue detectives spied on family shopping trips to Kmart, rummaged through mail and watched the wives and \nchildren of former executives for 19 days, the Federal Court has heard.\nFurther details about the iron ore giant's efforts to monitor its green steel rivals, Element Zero, and their executives \nBart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen before launching raids on their homes and offices over allegations \nthey stole intellectual property were revealed on Wednesday.\nFederal Court Judge Brigitte Markovic also told Fortescue's lawyers they should revise the \"ambit\" of their broad \nsuppression order requests, which included a bid to keep the entire 600 pages of a report produced by private \ninvestigators secret.\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Fortescue's executive chairman Andrew Forrest effectively conceded that the \ncompany's lawyers had overstepped the mark in their pursuit of the three men saying the engagement of Davies \nCollison Cave Law was under review.\n\"I was surprised to learn of the investigations and have been advised by Fortescue's legal team that they were \nnecessary in order to be granted search orders from the Federal Court,\" Dr Forrest said.\n\"Fortescue's external legal team have been reminded that they also have an obligation to comply with the \ncompany's values and their engagement is now under review,\" he said.\n\"Fortescue is a first mover which invests significant time and resources into its intellectual property.\" A report was \nprovided to independent lawyers who carried out the raids - which is required under Federal Court rules authorising \nprivately obtained search warrants - and showed pictures had been taken Dr Winther-Jensen's wife and 16-year-old \ndaughter who, the report noted, had been watched as she left for school and returned home on one day.

All three quit the would-be green \nenergy giant to start their own green metal firm in 2022.\nAfter Fortescue accused them of stealing intellectual property relating to its carbon dioxide-free iron technology, it \nsuccessfully obtained orders from the Federal Court in May to search the offices and homes of Element Zero and \nits staff. Computers and electronic devices were seized in those raids.\nElement Zero denies the allegations and says its technology was developed independently to that of Fortescue's.\nSuch has been the veil of secrecy cast over the case that its existence was not revealed until two weeks after the \nsearch orders were granted (on May 14), and elements of the matter are still suppressed.\nDuring a brief case management hearing on Wednesday, Chris McMeniman, the barrister appearing for Element \nZero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman, told the court that for 19 days Fortescue's private investigators pursued \nhis clients, their families and Element Zero staff.\nHe said Fortescue claimed it was \"too difficult\" to redact residential addresses and photos of minors included in a \n600-page report completed for them, and therefore wanted the whole thing kept secret.\nThat report contains details about the extraordinary surveillance conducted by Fortescue, including that private \ninvestigators followed \"wives to Kmart\", sifted through mail \"and the like\" and that Element Zero staff beyond those \nlisted in the court filings were followed.\n\"They want the entirety of that redacted,\" he said.\nFortescue barrister Wen Wu told the court that since an interim suppression order was granted on May 9, the \ncompany had since lodged a further two applications.\n\"The reason \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 why a further suppression application was brought is because the initial suppression was to \nsuppress -material that was confidential to Fortescue and not known to the individual respondents,\" Mr Wu said.\n\"The second suppression -application made \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 covers confidential information which is known to individual \npersons but not to the world at large.\" Mr Wu agreed that Fortescue's bid for a suppression order covering the 600 \npages of private investigator reports was \"broader\" than Element Zero's.\nJustice Markovic described Element Zero's application as \"more nuanced or selective\".\nShe said she would need to \"sift through\" the vast amounts of material filed and examine what was sought to be \nredacted.\nIn relation to one of Mr Wu's suppression applications, Justice Markovic said: \"I would like your side to consider \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \nnarrow applications\".\nHall and Wilcox were hired by Fortescue's external lawyers Davies Collison Cave Law to act as independent \nsolicitors and carry out the raids in May.\nAccording to a letter sent from Davies Collison Cave Law to Hall and Wilcox that summarised Fortescue's \nallegations against Element Zero, Dr Winther-Jensen sent emails to his personal email address attaching \nconfidential Fortescue technical documents.\nAs well, Fortescue claimed Dr Kolodziejczyk accessed confidential technical documents on his work-issued laptop \nusing a USB and deleted a file shortly -before he left.",
