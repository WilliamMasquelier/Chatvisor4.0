The Fund performance compared to a 21% sterling return \nregistered by the Gold Bugs Index and the GDXJ equity ETF. However, we anticipate that the lag in performance of \nthe smaller equities held in the Fund will catch-up with larger peers given their relatively attractive valuations.\nGold was one of the stronger commodities with the price rising over 9% during March to new all-time highs. Silver is \nlatterly starting to catch-up, registering a 10% price increase over the month. Prices held despite a more hawkish \nmove in US FED rate expectations after FOMC minutes indicated broader US labour markets were stubbornly \nresilient despite relatively tepid economic growth. Increasingly there appears to be a focus on ever growing \ngovernment debt levels which have shown little sign of reversing, as evidence by the latest US congression Budget \nOffice projections.\nRecent physical gold buying has been led by China, with a pick-up in retail demand showing in import data. This \nhas been potentially driven by broader concerns on the economy, particularly the weak regional property sector. \nAlongside this is the healthy net central bank demand: People's Bank of China (PBoC) data showed China's gold \nreserves continued to rise with the addition of 0.39 Moz in February taking official reserves to 72.6Moz (+10% year-\non-year). Physical gold ETF's showed a pick-up in buying but aggregate holdings nevertheless ended 246k ounces \nlower over the month. We believe gold hitting all-time highs despite steady ETF selling is a positive, as would also \nbe the case should ETF's turn steady buyers, further tightening the market.Page 3 of 4\nMonthly Investor Report - March 2024\nWest African Resources and Fortuna Gold and Silver were strong contributors to performance. This was closely \nfollowed by Australian gold producer Karora which received bid interest from ASX-listed Ramelius, as well as \nreports of a further interested party also in discussion with the company. While we do not focus our stock selection \nspecifically on M&A targets, we believe quality undervalued assets should result in a higher probability of them \nbecoming targets. The sector remains short of growth projects, and so we would anticipate a pick-up in M&A activity \ngoing forward. This should help close the discounts of junior miners to the larger. Calidus was the primary detractor \nto performance with the group undertaking an equity funding, in which the Fund participated, as part of a broader \nrestructuring of its debt and gold hedging.\nGross Leverage5 (%) Commitment Leverage6 (%)\nGolden Prospect Precious Metals Limited 111 11\n1\nCQS (UK) LLP\n4th Floor, One Strand, London WC2N 5HR, United Kingdom\nT: +44 (0) 20 7201 6900 | F: +44 (0) 20 7201 1200\nCQS (US), LLC\n152 West 57th Street, 40th Floor, New York, NY 10019, US\nT: +1 212 259 2900 | F: +1 212 259 2699\nTavistock Communications\n18 St. Swithin's Lane, London EC4N 8AD\nT: +44 20 7920 3150 | goldenprospect@tavistock.co.uk\nSources: 1,2 CQS as at the last business day of the month indicated at the top of this report.
