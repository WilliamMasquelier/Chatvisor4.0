It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nCoffs Harbour couple shocked to find tiny egg inside an egg\nCoffs Harbour couple shocked to find tiny egg inside an egg\nABC Premium News (Australia)\nSeptember 23, 2024 Monday\nCopyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved\nLength: 354 words\nHighlight: Rachael Ward and her fiance were were making their morning meal in Coffs Harbour when they cracked \nopen an egg and received a shock.\nBody\nRachael Ward and her fiance Jamie were preparing their weekend breakfast when they cracked open an egg and \nreceived a shock. \nInside the unassuming chicken egg was another tiny, fully formed egg.\n\"Jamie cracked the egg and said, 'What's that?',\" Ms Ward said.\n\"At first, I said, 'Oh, it's a double yolker', and then I touched it, and it was a tiny little egg.\n\"[I was] just amazed that it was an egg inside an egg.\"\nThe couple weighed and measured the egg, which was more than 1 centimetre long and weighed just 2 grams.\nMs Ward said the egg it came from was slightly smaller than a regular-sized chicken egg.\nThey have held onto the tiny egg, but have not looked inside.\n\"I'm not game to crack it open \u2026 it could be a yolk, or just the white, I'm not sure,\" Ms Ward said.\nThe Coffs Harbour resident bought the egg from local hobby farmer Gerald Gauci.\nHe has about 100 chickens and sells eggs at his farm gate.\nMr Gauci said the hen responsible for the double egg remained a mystery.\n\"It's amazing \u2026 never in my life have I seen anything like that \u2026 I am 60 years old and grew up with chooks, my \nfather used to show chooks,\" he said.\nPage 2 of 2\nCoffs Harbour couple shocked to find tiny egg inside an egg\n\"I've seen eggs before coming out maybe soft inside a shell, but this one is a fully formed little egg \u2026 in a hard little \nshell.\"\nHow did it happen?\nThe phenomenon of an egg forming inside an egg does occur occasionally.\nOther , although in those cases, a egg was enclosed inside a much larger egg.\nIn this case, the enclosed egg was notably small.\nBrian Alley, a poultry breeder based at Lorne on the NSW Mid North Coast, said it was a rare occurrence.\nAn egg inside an egg can occur after two yolks have been released, and one, already with a formed shell, moves \nnear the other one at some point while the second shell is still being formed.\n\"It normally happens due to the ovulation of the chook,\" Mr Alley said.\n\"She drops one down [into the oviduct] to put a shell down, and she's dropped two at the same time, and shell has \nformed around both of them \u2026 one has gone inside the other [during the forming phase].\n\"You very rarely hear of it \u2014 I've been around livestock for 69 years, and I've never seen one.\"\nLoad-Date: September 23, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
