It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 3\nAndrew Forrest charity IEJF named in ExxonMobil defamation lawsuit\nAndrew Forrest charity IEJF named in ExxonMobil defamation lawsuit\nABC Premium News (Australia)\nJanuary 8, 2025 Wednesday\nCopyright 2025 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved\nLength: 822 words\nHighlight: Andrew Forrest and his charity IEJF have been accused in a defamation lawsuit by Exxon Mobil Corp of \n\"a campaign to compete by turning the wheels of American justice to the company's self-interested purposes\".\nBody\nAndrew Forrest and his charity have been accused in a defamation lawsuit by Exxon Mobil Corp of \"a campaign to \ncompete by turning the wheels of American justice to the company's self-interested purposes\".\nExxonMobil also accused California Attorney-General Rob Bonta and several environmental groups of conspiring to \ndefame it by making statements about the efficacy of its plastics recycling technology.\nDr Forrest's Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund (IEJF) is named among the defendants, alongside the \nSierra Club, San Francisco Baykeeper, Heal the Bay, and the Surfrider Foundation, in the lawsuit filed in \nCalifornia's Eastern District.\nThe lawsuit claimed IEJF retained US lawyers Cotchett to engage in \"political activities\", including filing a lawsuit \nagainst ExxonMobil.\n\"Together, Bonta and the US Proxies \u2014 the former for political gain and the latter pawns for the Foreign Interests \n\u2014 have engaged in a deliberate smear campaign against ExxonMobil, falsely claiming that ExxonMobil's effective \nand innovative advanced recycling technology is a 'false promise' and 'not based on truth,'\" the company said in its \nlawsuit.\nIt seeks unspecified damages and retractions of \"defamatory statements\" from Mr Bonta and the groups.\nAccusations against Forrest\nExxonMobil claims that IEJF is a subsidiary of Minderoo, a philanthropic organisation founded and chaired by Dr \nForrest, the billionaire founder of Fortescue.\nPage 2 of 3\nAndrew Forrest charity IEJF named in ExxonMobil defamation lawsuit\nIt claims after Dr Forrest allegedly failed to garner interest in the US market for his \"levy\" on virgin plastics in 2019, \nhe, Fortescue, and Minderoo became strident critics of the plastics industry in general, and ExxonMobil in \nparticular.\nIn the first Plastic Waste Makers Index, published in 2021 by Minderoo, it alleged ExxonMobil is the largest \nproducer of plastic polymers which are then turned into single-use plastics, the lawsuit says.\nExxonMobil denied this claim and said it does not make single-use plastics.\nThe lawsuit goes on to claim Minderoo made several false and deceptive statements concerning ExxonMobil, \nplastics waste, and advanced recycling in its reports.\n\"Why would a philanthropic organization conspire with the US Proxies to defame and interfere with ExxonMobil \u2014 \nattacking the same technologies (advanced recycling) that they themselves recognized were essential to solving \nthe issue of plastic waste only five years earlier?\" the lawsuit read.\nA Minderoo spokesperson said Minderoo's reference in the complaint is incorrect in terms of its relationship with \nIEJF, and in connection with the publication of the Plastic Waste Makers Index and its ongoing advocacy.\n\"Minderoo stands by both Plastic Waste Makers Index reports which were prepared in conjunction with respected \nresearch and analysis partners, with the application of the research methodology independently reviewed,\" they \nsaid. \nExxonMobil further alleged in the suit, Fortescue, which Minderoo is a substantial shareholder in, hired an \nAmerican law firm to bring claims against ExxonMobil on behalf of the US proxies; which later became funded by \nIEJF.\nFortescue competes with Exxon in low-carbon solutions and the energy transition sector, the lawsuit said.\nThe suit alleged IEJF paid Cotchett \"hundreds of thousands of dollars in consideration for legal services provided in \nconnection with the US Proxies' plastics lawsuit\".\nIn a statement Dr Forrest said: \"This lawsuit is no surprise and right out of the oil and gas industry playbook.\n\"I am personally delighted Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-\nexamination,\" he said.\n\"The fossil fuel industry is \u00adgetting increasingly desperate at maintaining its toxic grip on \u00adsociety. Their only priority \nis to maximise their profits and \u00adproduce as much oil and gas as possible.\"\nA Fortescue spokesperson made note it was not a named defendant but was mentioned several times in \nthe lawsuit. \n\"Fortescue rejects the assertions that Exxon Mobil has made against Fortescue in the complaint, including \nthe assertions that the Company has orchestrated litigation against Exxon to gain a competitive \nadvantage,\" they said. \nBonta connection\nExxonMobil also claimed the law firm Cotchett and its members are directly tied to Mr Bonta, having donated tens \nof thousands of dollars to his political campaigns.\nA spokesperson for the California Department of Justice called the lawsuit \"another attempt from ExxonMobil to \ndeflect attention from its own unlawful deception\" and said Mr Bonta looks forward to \"vigorously litigating\" the case.\nIn its lawsuit filed in September, Mr Bonta's office said that less than 5 per cent of plastic is recycled into another \nplastic product in the US even though the items are labelled as \"recyclable\".Page 3 of 3\nAndrew Forrest charity IEJF named in ExxonMobil defamation lawsuit\nAs a result landfills and oceans are filled with plastic waste, creating a global pollution crisis, while consumers \ndiligently place plastic water bottles and other containers into recycling bins, the lawsuit alleges.\nABC/AP\nLoad-Date: January 8, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
