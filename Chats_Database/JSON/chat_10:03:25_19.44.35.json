Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue metals chief executive | \"Getting this new industry off the ground will require wisely invested public and private sector funds.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue metals chief executive | \"The whole of industry is calling for bold policy to establish a new green iron industry.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue metals chief executive | \"This week's announcement by the WA government to invest $75m in the NeoSmelt project clearly shows that government shares our view of the importance of establishing this new green industry.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue metals chief executive | \"While a final investment decision on the NeoSmelt project is anticipated in 2026, Fortescue will already be producing high-purity green iron from our pilot plant at Christmas Creek, using green hydrogen.\" | N.A. |\n| Dr. Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's founder | \"Fortescue wants help in the form of approvals and infrastructure.\" | N.A. |\n| Tim Day | BHP WA iron ore asset president | \"You have to start this with something. For us, a gas supply is required. You need that energy initially and then what will happen over time is we'll get to more green energy.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
