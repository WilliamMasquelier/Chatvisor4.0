Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: CHANTICLEER; Pg. 32\nLength: 1335 words\nByline: MARK DI STEFANO and HANNAH WOOTTON\nBody\nForrest's Minderoo is sitting on billionsAndrew Forrest didn't become one of Australia's richest men, or make \nFortescue one of its most valuable companies, by spending all his money.\nBut while he's been happy to enjoy the finer things in life since making his riches - private jets, yachts and luxury \nhotels abound - it seems his charity Minderoo is still taking a spendthrift approach.\nThe Minderoo Foundation's net assets jumped $500 million last financial year to $8.1 billion, its latest accounts \nshow, largely funded by its surprise status as the biggest beneficiary of Twiggy and Nicola Forrest's divorce. \nDespite this, its \"impact expenditure\" (which is how Minderoo's bean counters phrase what money it hands out to \nthe various good causes it supports) fell $20 million to $229 million.\nSmall change when you consider the 2024 financial year was its first full year of reaping the rewards of the $5 \nbillion in Fortescue shares it received as part of the former Forrest couple's divorce settlement.\nAt the time, the donation of shares was touted by this masthead as the biggest philanthropic gift in Australian \nhistory. But does it count as philanthropy if a charity, especially one owned by the donors - just banks the cash?\nThe accounts show the trust got a tidy $775 million in Fortescue dividends for the year despite the iron ore price's \nfreefall. Add in a surplus of $537 million, and you'd be forgiven for thinking Minderoo might have loosened its purse \nstrings a little.\nBut the charity has been in simplification mode since the split. Its corporate wages bill was down more than $2 \nmillion for the financial year after it cut about a third of its workforce last April. We hear several future projects are \nalso n the works. It's trying to do fewer things, but do them better. A familiar mantra for Fortescue's recently \njobless, too.\nGiles adds to her\nbulging workload\nPage 2 of 3\nREAR WINDOW Forrest's Minderoo is sitting on billions\nAt the apex of the nation's professional fixers is there ever a lack of demand for services rendered by lawyer \nRebekah Giles? She and a handful of others (including Melbourne's Leon Zwier) are on speed dial from corporates, \ncelebs and corporate celebs who need reputation help, or a rapid defamation notice drafted.\nTake Taylor Auerbach, the steak-and-cocaine TV producer who went nuclear on the Seven network and rapist \nBruce Lehrmann at a key moment in the latter's defamation trial last year. Barrister Sue Chrysanthou was already \nrepresenting former Ten presenter Lisa Wilkinson in her defence against Lehrmann, so it fell to Giles to front Justice \nMichael Lee on behalf of Auerbach. Less than 24 hours after the infamous Lehrmann judgment, Giles followed it up \nby negotiating a large defamation settlement for Jewish student Ben Cohen from Seven after the network \nmisidentified him as being behind the Bondi Westfield attack.\nPoint is, she always seems busy, which is why her recent addition to an arcane racing position seems strange. Last \nmonth, Giles was appointed to the board of Racingcorp Pty Ltd.\nRacingcorp was established after the privitisation of Tabcorp in the 1990s, and operates as the gathering place for \nracing bigwigs to negotiate for their slice of gambling revenues. The corporate entity's other directors include \nRacing NSW chief executive Peter V'landys, chairwoman Saranne Cooke, Australian Turf Club chairman Peter \nMcGauran and Harness Racing NSW chief executive Peter Buckman.\nGiles was added to the Racingcorp board because she's also the deputy chair of Greyhounds NSW. Not for us to \nquestion whether she has a secret love for the dish lickers, but Giles has been on the sport's board since 2019. The \npeak organisation is mired in a full-scale inquiry into the sport's welfare and integrity. There's no better hired gun \nthan Giles at a time like this.\nRacingcorp is in effect a holdover corporate entity that we're told rarely meets because the separate racing bodies \ndo their own negotiating direct with Tabcorp. So while Giles' addition might be a formality, it does signal her \nimportance to Greyhounds NSW in matters like its commercial talks. The organisation collected $31 million in Tab \nrevenues in 2024 - its second-largest source of income.\nAnd like a short-priced bolter at Wenty Park, Giles has form. In November, she strode out of the Fair Work \nCommission alongside Adam Rytenskild, the recently ousted CEO of Tabcorp. Rytenskild got a green light to sue \nhis former employer, which he argued left him no choice but to resign over a disputed vulgar remark he made \nearlier in the year. It was Rytenskild's swift exit that led to former AFL chief Gil McLachlan's coronation at the ASX-\nlisted company.\nRytenskild became Tabcorp CEO in 2022 after an audacious (failed) bid from Matthew Tripp's Betmakers to take \nover the company. Around the same time Betmakers added Giles to its board. As we've noted before, Betmakers \ndoesn't deal with Tabcorp directly, but it does make betting tech for its online gambling rivals. That is, Giles is \nrepresenting a star client suing Tabcorp, she sits on a board that helps companies take market share from Tabcorp, \nand is now the figurehead of a sport that negotiates revenue from Tabcorp.\nNIMBY or YIMBY? Charlton's identity crisis\nWhether getting called a NIMBY or a YIMBY is an insult or a badge of pride depends on what circles one moves in. \nHow confusing for federal Parramatta MP Andrew Charlton, then, that voters are calling him both.\nThe former Accenture executive, who is touted as a future Labor leader, is sticking his neck out to oppose \ndevelopment plans for 2500 new homes in North Parramatta. He's even launched a petition.\nThe (Labor) state government thinks the development will help enable a plan for 12,000 more jobs along Sydney's \nfavourite new toy, the light rail, and a new Sydney University campus that will support Westmead Hospital. All good \nthings, you'd think.\nNot to Charlton and others. He's worried it will jeopardise a world heritage application - it's already got a national \none - for the Female Factory, an 1818 prison, workhouse and hospital for unmarried female convicts in Sydney.Page 3 of 3\nREAR WINDOW Forrest's Minderoo is sitting on billions\nCue the YIMBY frenzy online. It's whiplash for Charlton, who is usually painted as positively socialist in terms of \nhousing development plans by the Liberal Party and its supporters.\nNo wonder, amid a flurry of social media posts on the issue in recent weeks, he declared on LinkedIn: \"I'm no \nYIMBY or NIMBY\".\nWe aren't arguing against the worthiness of heritage listings - as Charlton says, you can \"build Parramatta's future \nwhile preserving its past\". He also has a fairly strong track record on housing - his seat boasts the No.1 local \ncouncil in NSW for new housing approvals, and he's backed projects to build around 20,000 new homes. Just \nsomewhere else.\nAfter all, he knows better than most the perks of cracking the property market. He moved from a $16 million \nBellevue Hill house to a four-bedder in North Parramatta when he dropped into the seat, then added an apartment \n(just the sub-penthouse - he's a man of the people) to his $4 million western Sydney property portfolio when he \ncouldn't renovate as planned. He also dropped a cool $12 million on a Palm Beach home last March.\nBut opposing more housing is an interesting move from an MP who was accused of not understanding western \nSydney when he was parachuted from the eastern suburbs into his safe Labor seat. Some locals are keen for the \nheritage application to be prioritised, but for many, the housing and cost of living are most in front of mind.\nThe powers that be in Canberra know this. Last week, Albo swung by Parramatta with Charlton to spruik new \ntransport infrastructure funding. The goal? More housing in the west!\nCharlton is happy to compromise. He says he will be satisfied with just \"pressing pause\" on the rezoning until \nUNESCO makes its decision on the heritage application.\nOr he's happy for it to go ahead now, just 200 metres down the road - but the bureaucrats at Macquarie Street don't \nlike that.\nThat deadline is in 2029. There are two federal and one state election before then.\nLoad-Date: February 2, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
