It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nStonepeak-backed Ampyr buys Shell's NSW battery stake; Street Talk\nStonepeak-backed Ampyr buys Shell's NSW battery stake; Street Talk\nAustralian Financial Review\nFebruary 3, 2025 Monday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2025 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Street Talk; Pg. 18\nLength: 305 words\nByline: Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood and Emma Rapaport\nBody\nRenewables developer Ampyr Energy Global is set to become the sole owner of NSW's 1000MWh Wellington \nbattery energy storage system after agreeing to buy out co-investor Shell's 50 per cent stake, as it shoots for a 20 \nper cent market share of Australia's 16GW battery supply by 2030.\nAmpyr Australia, whose Singaporean parent is backed by infrastructure investor Stonepeak, was able to lap up the \nstake via private negotiations with Shell. The duo in 2022 began developing Wellington, which has ticked off all \napprovals and is preparing to kick off construction in July or August.\nThe battery's first stage, which will cost about $400 million to build, will see Ampyr turn on 600MWh by mid-2026 \nwith the remaining capacity to follow in 2027.\nThe site is located close to the central nodes in Trangrid's transmission backbone and geographically within the \nCentral West Orana Renewable Energy Zone. About two thirds of its capacity is expected to be taken up by the \nnearby 300MW Wellington solar farm, which is owned by Lightsource BP.\n\"We're grateful for Shell's contributions to the Wellington BESS project, and we are excited about accelerating its \ndevelopment to bring this vital project to market,\" Ampyr Australia CEO Alex Wonhas told Street Talk. \"Reliable, \ncost competitive electricity is a cornerstone of Australia's economic growth.\"\nOf note, Ampyr Australia is actively hunting through M&A as well as organic opportunities as it aims for a 3GW \nbattery portfolio by 2050, or about 18 per cent of the 16GW that the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) \nhas forecast the country needs to support the shift from coal-fired plants to renewable sources.\nThe Ampyr Energy Group is the renewables platform of Singapore-headquarted AGP Sustainable Real Assets, \nwhich in late 2023 attracted a billion-dollar investment from US's Stonepeak.\nLoad-Date: February 5, 2025\nPage 2 of 2\nStonepeak-backed Ampyr buys Shell's NSW battery stake; Street Talk\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
