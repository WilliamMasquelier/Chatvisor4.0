complex\nABC Premium News (Australia)\nJuly 30, 2024 Tuesday\nCopyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved\nLength: 713 words\nHighlight: The NSW Building Commission is stepping up its efforts to address building defects in homes in the \nIllawarra lifestyle marina community of Shell Cove and is urging more owners to come forward.\nBody\nThe NSW Building Commission is ramping up pressure on a builder and an Illawarra council to fix \"shocking\" \ndefects to more than 300 homes in the lifestyle marina community of Shell Cove.\nShellharbour Council and Frasers Property are in a joint venture to deliver homes in the area.\nThe Singapore-based developer has self-identified defects in 325 of the 354 homes it has built on the since 2019.\nAssistant Commissioner Matt Press said it was \"a really shocking scenario\".\n\"Ninety-two per cent have defects, mainly waterproofing,\" Mr Press said.\n\"It has definitely been affecting residents' lives, particularly with bedrooms and other rooms that are essentially \nunusable because the carpets are wet and soggy.\n\"Front doors don't shut particularly well, so a whole range of defects.\"\nMr Press said the Commission has asked Frasers and the Shellharbour Council to commit to a formal undertaking \nto fix the defects to ensure \"rigour around the remediation process\".\n\"We'd like things like an agreed end date, an agreed process about how we're going to triage the homes,\" he said.\n\"We're going to make sure that, regardless of who out of those two parties is liable financially or otherwise, that the \nwork is done and we can get these 300 buildings fixed as quickly as possible.\"\nHe said Frasers had been working through the issues.\nPage 2 of 3\nMore than 300 homes with 'shocking' defects in Illawarra lifestyle complex\n\"We've only really got a few fragments of information so far, so we really want to use our local presence to get into \nthis and tie at all together in a much more robust process,\u201d mr Press said.\nThe state government recently announced a permanent office in the Illawarra, with two new inspectors.\nMore residents asked to come forward\nMr Press said only nine residents had made formal complaints to the Commission, so it was distributing pamphlets \nin the area. seeking more community feedback.\nHe said, once information had been gathered, affected buildings would be inspected and the evidence used to \n\"force the issue with Fraser\". \n\"If we can't agree to an undertaking, then we can use our powers to issue rectification orders,\" he said.\nFrasers already has a project in the Sydney suburb of Chippendale, the One Central Park high-rise building that's \nbeen served with a building rectification order.\nPush for industry rating \nMr Press said he was concerned Frasers did not have an iCIRT (Independent Construction Industry Rating Tool) \nwhich gives the state government information about the company's character and financial resilience.\nThe voluntary rating tool was adopted by the NSW Building Commission in 2022.\nThe Building Commission hopes it will be adopted by developers, builders, sub-contractors, certifiers and \nconsultants that shows a rating of between one and five stars.\nMr Press said the ratings were resulting in practical benefits for consumers.\n\"In the Illawarra, there are about seven projects in the design stage that will get latent-defect insurance because of \ntheir ratings from the scheme,\" he said.\n\"The new insurance product provides the home owner with a 10-year warranty on their building.\" \nThe council and Frasers declined the ABC's requests for interviews about whether they would enter into a formal \nundertaking to fix the defects. \nBut in a statement, Shellharbour Council said:\n\"Frasers Property Group is the builder of the townhomes in Shell Cove and issues regarding home warranty, \noutstanding rectification works or housing numbers should be directed to Frasers Property Group.\"\nThe council said it expected the builder to conduct any outstanding rectification works as a priority and to \ncommunicate regularly with property buyers.\nIt also stated that the council was not \"managing, funding or delivering any warranty works as per the partnership of \nthe Shell Cove Project'\".\nCommitted to fixing issues\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Frasers said it was committed to fixing the issues.\n\"The Building Commission NSW is fully aware of the commitment, approach and resources we are dedicating to the \nprogram.Page 3

\nprocess, including key milestones and timeframes, and we continue to provide support to customers while works \nare underway.\"\nFrasers said it hoped to complete the work by 2026 and was in the process of gaining iCIRT accreditation.\nLoad-Date: July 30, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
