It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nDO OR DIE ON GREEN PROJECT\nDO OR DIE ON GREEN PROJECT\nThe Daily Telegraph (Australia)\nJanuary 26, 2024 Friday\nTelegraph Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 28\nLength: 472 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nFortescue hit by Iron Bridge troubles Fortescue Energy boss Mark Hutchinson says the company is likely to make \na decision in February on whether to push ahead with its biggest Australian green hydrogen project as the \ncompany's mining division hits more troubles with its Iron Bridge magnetite project.\nFortescue delivered its December quarter production report on Thursday, blaming ongoing troubles with the water \nsupply to Iron Bridge for a decision to again slash production guidance, and saying another $US140m ($213m) \nwould need to be spent on work to get the plant running at full tilt.\nIt is the second time in six months that Fortescue has cut export guidance from the troubled operation, after initially \nflagging exports of 7 million tonnes for the full financial year. In September, Fortescue said it expected to ship \nabout 5 million tonnes of magnetite concentrate from Iron Bridge this financial year, but has so far managed only \nfive cargoes.\nThe company, which is controlled by billionaire Andrew Forrest, said shipments from the facility could reach as little \nas only 40 per cent of that 5 million tonne guidance, with a new range of 2-4 million tonnes.\nFortescue said it was still having trouble with supply from its borefields for the water-hungry operation, where a \nhigh pressure water line keeps springing leaks.\n\"Work is under way to evalu-ate options to de-risk and improve the performance of the high-pressure section \n(65km) of the raw water pipeline, where the leaks have occurred. It is anticipated that replacing this section of the \npipeline would not materially impact Iron Bridge's ramp up schedule and would require investment of approximately \n$US100m (Fortescue's share),\" it said.\nIt has said it still expects to ship 192-197 million tonnes for the full-year, despite the troubles at Iron Bridge and a \nderailment on its iron ore line in the Pilbara, which stopped trains for four days over the New Year weekend.\nAfter falling short of its promise to reach a final investment decision on as many as five green energy projects in \n2024, it was likely to make a call on its biggest planned hydrogen project in Australia, Mr Hutchinson said.\nPage 2 of 2\nDO OR DIE ON GREEN PROJECT\nFortescue announced the approval of two projects from its energy division in November, ticking off plans for small \nhydrogen production plants in Phoenix in the US and at Gladstone in Queensland.\nAt the time, Fortescue said it would fast-track a decision on larger projects in Norway, Kenya and Brazil.\nBut the company put off any decision on its Gibson -Island proposal in Brisbane, where Fortescue has been \nworking with Incitec Pivot on a green hydrogen feed for Incitec's mothballed fertiliser plant.\nMr Hutchinson told reporters and analysts that a final decision on the plant was likely at Fortescue's board meeting \nin February. Fortescue shares closed up 2 per cent to $28.97.\nLoad-Date: January 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
