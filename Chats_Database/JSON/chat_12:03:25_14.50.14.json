Elixir, chaired by coal seam gas entrepreneur Richard Cottee, late last month \nreported a successful flow of gas to the surface from its Daydream-2 well in the area.\nOmega, which is backed by Queensland coal seam gas pioneer Tri-Star Group and Brian Flannery's Ilwella Group, \nis now moving the rig used by Shell for its wells to its Canyon site where it expects to start drilling a well on \nSeptember 20 to test the flow of gas in its acreage for the first time.\n\"If we're successful here this could be the next big wave of development post the coal seam gas wave,\" said \nOmega CEO Trevor Brown, a former vice president geoscience at Santos.\nHe said that while the Beetaloo Basin was more advanced in terms of proving up the flow of gas, the Taroom \nTrough had several compelling reasons that gave it a quantifiable commercial advantage.\nLoad-Date: September 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Shell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes\n## Australian Financial Review\n### Angela Macdonald-Smith\n### September 10, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Shell, to report.

Shell's recent gas flare in Queensland's Taroom Trough has sparked optimism in the industry regarding a potential new energy source that could alleviate gas shortages in the east coast market, particularly as output from existing major supply sources declines.\n\n2. The Taroom Trough is positioned advantageously near existing pipeline infrastructure, making it a more accessible exploration site compared to the more remote Beetaloo Basin, which could enhance the feasibility of gas extraction in the region.\n\n3. Analysts suggest that if Shell can successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of horizontal drilling in this area, it could unlock significant additional gas reserves, potentially adding several trillion cubic feet of gas to the east coast supply.\n\n4. Shell is currently drilling three appraisal wells in the Bowen Basin as part of its early-stage exploration efforts, with the results expected to inform future exploration strategies, indicating a commitment to developing this new potential resource.\n\n5. The success of Shell's exploration efforts is critical, especially as the east coast faces supply challenges due to declining production from the Bass Strait fields, highlighting the urgency for new gas sources to meet domestic demand.",
