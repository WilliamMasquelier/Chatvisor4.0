Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 711 words\nHighlight: It's easier to manage concentration risk if you hold direct shares, but not so simple if you're an ETF \ninvestor.\nBody\nInvestors with exposure to artificial intelligence and weight loss drugs have done well in recent years. Stocks like \nNvidia and Novo Nordisk have skyrocketed and now comprise a far larger percentage of portfolios. Too much of a \ngood thing is a problem, however, reducing diversification and introducing concentration risk.\nIt was two decades ago that Nvidia replaced Enron in the S&P 500. Since then, Nvidia's shares have collapsed by \nmore than 50 per cent three times.\nBack then, SMSF investors either invested directly via shares or indirectly by paying an active fund manager. If they \nwere worried investments that did brilliantly like Cisco would fall, they could sell it (or part of it) to de-risk their \nportfolio. They locked in profits and reduced risk.\nFor those types of investors today, nothing has changed. But for investors in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) - the \nsingle most disruptive trend in asset management over the past two decades - things are different. ETFs are \npassive, rules-based investments that - unlike active fund managers - cannot deviate from what the market does.\nExposure problem\nETF investors cannot sell the best performing parts of an ETF to de-risk it. They either own the entire ETF or they \ndon't. So they face a new risk - when stocks do brilliantly, they can't reduce exposure without selling the entire \ninvestment.\nSome of the most popular international ETFs in Australia include iShares S&P 500 ETF, Betashares Nasdaq 100 \nETF and iShares Europe AUD ETF. These offer cheap and easy access to the global themes of AI and weight loss \ndrugs.\nNvidia is up 149 per cent (in USD) to June 30, last month briefly overtaking Apple and Microsoft as the largest \nstock. Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic, is up 41 per cent (in EUR) YTD and is the largest company in Europe.\nTo put these in perspective, at the end of 2022 Nvidia comprised 1.1 per cent of the iShares S&P 500 ETF, today it \nis 6.3 per cent. Over the same period Nvidia jumped from 3.3 per cent of Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF to 8 per \ncent. In Europe, Novo Nordisk in the same period has jumped from 2.4 per cent to 4.2 per cent of the iShares \nEurope AUD ETF.\nPage 2 of 2\nWhat to do if you have big wins in your share portfolio\nInvestor options\nConcentration risk in industries like tech or pharmaceuticals is normal, but it is higher than normal now.\nSo if you own a tech ETF, a US ETF or a Europe ETF, parts of your portfolio have drastically outpaced others and \nyou now face a dilemma.\nConcentration risk has given great returns, but will these stocks keep going up forever? Or will they eventually lose \nmarket share to competitors and fall\nWhat goes up eventually comes down, as evidenced by Cisco and Intel in 2000. What should SMSF investors do?\nFor those wanting even higher Nvidia exposure, there's an ETF for you. You could invest in the triple-leveraged \nsingle-stock Nvidia ETF with an 888 per cent return to June 30. It sounds more like gambling, but each to their own.\nThe more cautious can reduce their Nvidia exposure. If you're invested in the Nasdaq ETF, shifting to the broader \nS&P 500 ETF would reduce (but not remove) your Nvidia exposure. Other options could include iShares S&P Mid-\nCap AUD ETF or BetaShares S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (where every stock is capped at 0.2 per cent of the ETF).\nPerhaps counter-intuitively, don't reduce your exposure. An ETF captures the entire market (or sector) \nperformance. If Nvidia keeps rising, you'll do well. If Nvidia loses market share, its AI competitors will gain market \nshare. The same applies to Novo Nordisk and its competitors.\nIf an ETF owns the entire market, what you lose on one stock you gain on its competitors. By owning the entire \nNasdaq or the S&P 500, you don't need to time your buys or sells and you don't care if Nvidia wins the AI race - you \njust care that the AI race keeps running.\nVeteran US investor Peter Lynch once said, \"Everybody is a long-term investor until the market goes down.\"\nWhen Nvidia eventually loses steam in a correction, investors will obviously be tempted to reduce exposure. But \ninvestment choices shouldn't depend on what Nvidia does, but rather whether investors believe AI has peaked or \nhas further to run.\nIf the AI enthusiasm continues in 2024 and into 2025, it's hard to see how all the dominant tech stocks won't \nrecover after any short-term correction.\nLoad-Date: July 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Cisco.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
