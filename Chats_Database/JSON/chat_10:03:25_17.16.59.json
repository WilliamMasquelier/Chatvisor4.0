Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1421 words\nHighlight: This week, gold crashed through a historic high, leaving many analysts and other market watchers \nlooking for explanations.\nBody\nSecurity is tight. \"No hoodies!,\" proclaims a sign to customers as they are buzzed by intercom through locked \nreinforced doors in a nondescript downtown city building.\nA steady stream of unpretentious city types, migrant workers, high-viz tradies, delivery drivers and well-dressed \ntravellers file through the foyer.\nLink to Image\nEddie Jim\nThey are here primarily to buy and sell gold, the precious metal whose allure in the 1850s gold rush reputedly made \nMelbourne the richest city on earth.\nThe Collins Street building in the city is gold central: at least 15 bullion traders are scattered across 16 levels \namong multiple jewellers, gemstone and diamond merchants. An odd assortment of legal offices, pawnbrokers and \nimmigration agents fill in the gaps.\n\"There's probably more value in this building than any other in Australia,\" a casual conversation with a gold seller \nbehind the counter at Bullion Now, on the sixth floor, reveals. \"It's staggering.\"\nThe precious metal he is selling, bullion, is on a record run. This week, it crashed through a historic high of \n$US2200 ($3325) an ounce. Bullion is pure gold, different from 24-carat or 18-carat gold which has other alloys \nadded to strengthen if for jewellery making, diminishing its value.\nGold's almost daily ascent since mid-February has left many analysts and other market watchers looking for \nexplanations, as there is no clear catalyst for the rally.\nGold tends to spike in response to globe-shaking geopolitical or economic events, but nothing earth-shattering has \nhappened in the past few months to justify the latest surge.\nBut people are cashing in, says Michael Pepper, Bullion Now's owner. He, and other traders in the city's golden \ntower, say record high prices are prompting customers to sell rather than buy.\nPage 2 of 4\n'Speculate in bitcoin, hoard gold': Precious metal's value soars\n\"We're seeing a large number of sell backs coming through the doors at the moment. People are diversifying into \nproperty and cryptocurrencies,\" Pepper says.\nThe peaking prices are also weighing on purchasers. Custom has fallen 10 per cent to 20 per cent. \"I would also \nargue that the size of purchases has shrunk a little bit as well,\" he says.\nIn a small two-person partitioned booth on the floor above, Michael Kay, from Melbourne Gold Company, is also \nbuying more than he is selling.\n\"There wasn't much selling during COVID, although people were cashed up,\" Kay says. \"People were concerned, \nscared and had the money to buy gold.\" Now they want to exit and get Bitcoin instead. \"People like to speculate in \nBitcoin and hoard their wealth in gold.\"\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrency's volatility far outpaces gold's movements.\nBitcoin plunged from a peak of about $87,000 in November 2021 to below $24,500 two years later, before soaring \nto its current record high near $103,000. Gold, by contrast, moved from $US1500 to $US2200 over the same \ntimeframe.\nThe gold traders' clientele range from self-managed super funds owners, they often buy the largest sums, to people \nselling homes who want to transfer their equity into gold.\nFarmers, who understand of commodity markets, are also frequent buyers, as are migrants from Asia, India and \nEast Europe, the traders say.\n\"Most people do keep it under the bed, so to speak, or leave it here,\" Kay says, noting that many dealers provide \nsecure storage for a fee. \"People are maybe questioning the high price. Is it going to remain here? Will it keep \ngoing? I'm pretty bullish. Gold always shines with inflation,\" he says.\nPrices didn't have to move far before they hit record territory.\nGold has been trading for months at around the $US2000 mark. That level was viewed by many as stratospheric \njust a few years ago, but the metal pushed through the barrier in 2020 as the pandemic stormed across the globe.\nUnusually, prices are trading at elevated levels despite sky-high interest rates that are typically bad for gold, which \ndoesn't pay interest, and in defiance of a strong US dollar, which tends to keep the price of gold lower and more \ncontrolled.\nHowever, big geopolitical factors are underpinning the precious metal's stellar performance: Speculation over the \nUS Federal Reserve's pivot to looser monetary policy, Israel's unravelling Gaza crisis, the disastrous Russia and \nUkraine war, and buying by central banks, led by China, are helping spur momentum.\nLink to Image\nTrevor Collens\nGold is frequently viewed as an inflationary hedge.\n\"The reality is gold is a hedge against uncertainty. Over the last few years, that uncertainty is creeping in across a \nmyriad of factors,\" says Cameron Alexander, general manager of commercial development at The Perth Mint, one \nof the world's biggest gold refineries and mints.\n\"A combination of banking crisis, economic concerns, and geopolitical factors are driving investors to gold,\" \nCameron maintains.\nFormer US President Donald Trump's trade war with China, and the weaponizations of the US dollar following the \nWest's freeze of Russia's offshore assets, incentivised some wary central banks to buy heavily.Page 3 of 4\n'Speculate in bitcoin, hoard gold': Precious metal's value soars\nYoutube link\n\"China, over the last couple of years, has been very aggressive in building their own reserve, diversifying and \nmoving away from the US dollar,\" Cameron said. They are not alone. Other South East Asian bankers are doing the \nsame, albeit on a much smaller scale.\nThe World Gold Council's Gold Demand Trends January report shows the central bank buying streak continues at a \n\"blistering\" rate. Demand reached 1037 tonnes last year - the second-highest on record and down just 45 tonnes on \nthe previous year, it said.\nMichael Scantlebury, a resource analyst at Perth-based ASX listed broker and investment bank Euroz Hartleys, \nsays the share price of Australia's gold producing miners and ASX-listed gold-focused exchange traded funds are \nlagging gold's soaring price.\n\"It doesn't make any sense, right? We aren't too surprised, given the lack of interest over the last three years in the \ngold equities,\" he says.\n'We're very confident that this gold price increase will convert to proper margin and proper cash flow.'\nMichael Scantlebury, from investment bank Euroz Hartleys\nGold's last big run started after the pandemic's mayhem primed the world's latest inflationary surge, but investors \nwho expected gold miners' profit margins to follow the gold price upwards were disappointed.\n\"Cost inflation for gold producers basically squeezed that margin to the point where gold producers were breaking \neven, essentially, despite the gold price increases,\" Scantlebury says.\nGold equities in Australia underperformed as a result, and investors still remain sceptical. However, Scantlebury \nsays discussions with mining contractors and industry suppliers shows pressures are easing, be it wage rises or \nfuel prices.\n\"The rate of cost inflation has definitely come off, so we're very confident that this gold price increase will convert to \nproper margin and proper cash flow,\" he says.\nThat's a shift Euroz Hartleys expects to show up in the March quarterly reports of miners like Northern Star \nResources, Evolution, Ramelius, Perseus, West African and Gold Road Resources. Euroz Hartleys would expect \ninvestors to then focus on smaller producers and explorers after a re-rate in these larger miners occurs.\n\"Assuming the gold price stays equal, gold producers in Australia should definitely re-rate,\" Scantlebury says.\nANZ commodity strategists Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari said gold's latest rally isn't being derailed by the \nmarket's expectation that the Fed may push back expected cuts in interest rates, delaying a move that would signal \nit has US inflation under control.\n\"While speculators have increased their bullish bets recently, positions are not matching the intensity of the latest \nprice rally. Moreover, disinvestment in gold-backed exchange-traded funds has been continuing,\" they said in a \nresearch note last week.\n\"A pull-back in gold prices is likely in the short term, as [the] recent rally has surpassed macroeconomic and \ngeopolitical developments,\" they maintain.\nAt Bullion Now, Pepper also anticipates things to calm down. \"We're expecting a pullback in the shorter-term,\" he \nsays. But there will always be people buying gold as a value store, and for its portability, he says.\nA kilo gold bar about the size of a mobile phone is now worth about $116,000, Pepper says. \"I can put that in my \npocket, travel to London and get for the same for it in the UK as what I paid in Australia. It's a worldwide \ntransferable asset,\" he said.Page 4 of 4\n'Speculate in bitcoin, hoard gold': Precious metal's value soars\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

Ramelius Resources, along with other Australian gold producers, is expected to benefit from the recent surge in gold prices, which have reached a historic high of $US2200 an ounce, potentially leading to improved profit margins and cash flow in upcoming quarterly reports.\n\n2. Despite the rising gold prices, Ramelius Resources and its peers have faced challenges with cost inflation, which has previously squeezed profit margins, leaving investors skeptical about the immediate financial benefits of the gold price increase.\n\n3. Analysts from Euroz Hartleys anticipate that as cost pressures ease, Ramelius Resources may experience a re-rating in its stock value, particularly if the gold price remains stable, indicating a potential shift in investor sentiment towards smaller producers and explorers in the gold sector.\n\n4. The article highlights a general trend among gold traders, including those dealing with Ramelius Resources, where customers are increasingly selling gold to diversify into other assets like property and cryptocurrencies, reflecting a shift in investment strategies amidst fluctuating market conditions.",
