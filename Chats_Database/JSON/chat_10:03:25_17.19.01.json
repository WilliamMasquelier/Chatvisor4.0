We can expect it to continue to dominate \nthe M&A landscape, but not in isolation, with the gold industry bringing together regional asset portfolios and \nbuilding operational scale,\" he said.\nThe string of gold deals in the past 12 months has spanned Red 5 and Silverlake, Ramelius and Musgrave, \nEmerald and Bullseye, and Genesis and Dacian.\nWestgold completed its $2.5 billion merger with Toronto-listed Karora last week to create a mid-tier gold producer.\nMr Andrews said Ramelius, which has done seven deals in six years, was \"at it again\" grabbing a near 18 per cent \nstake in Spartan.\nPage 2 of 2\nBig gains turn miners' eyes to M&A Returns\nSpeaking after Ramelius released June quarter results last week, chief executive Mark Zeptner said his company \nwould take a wait and see approach on Spartan and its Never Never discovery.\n\"Whilst we'd like to have Never Never in our portfolio, we actually look at it as a nice to have, rather than a need to \nhave,\" he said at the time.\nRamelius' $87 million spending spree on Spartan stock came after revelations Ramelius had been in takeover \ntalks with Westgold late last year and that the two gold producers had agreed to a 12-month \"mutual standstill\".\nWestgold moved on through the Karora merger.

The company has been actively pursuing mergers and acquisitions, recently acquiring an 18% stake in Spartan Resources, indicating a strategic move to enhance its portfolio and operational scale in the competitive gold sector.\n\n3. Despite its interest in Spartan's Never Never discovery, Ramelius CEO Mark Zeptner emphasized a cautious approach, viewing the acquisition as a \"nice to have\" rather than essential, reflecting a measured strategy in the current volatile market.\n\n4. Ramelius has a history of aggressive expansion, having completed seven deals in six years, which underscores its commitment to growth through strategic acquisitions in the gold mining industry.\n\n5. The company was previously involved in takeover discussions with Westgold, which highlights the dynamic nature of the gold sector and the ongoing consolidation trends as companies seek to adapt to market changes following Newmont's acquisition of Newcrest Mining.",
