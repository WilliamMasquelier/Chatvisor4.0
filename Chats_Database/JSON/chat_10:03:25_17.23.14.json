That \nrepresented a nil to 8.5 per cent premium to the last close.\nA term sheet seen by Street Talk said the \"industry participant\" already owned 4.75 per cent of the register and \nwanted to inch up to at least 10 per cent. \"The Acquirer has no current intention to acquire control or make a \ntakeover offer for SPR,\" it added.\nFund managers know it's only would-be-bidders or strategics that lap up shares at a premium to the last close.\nBut in Spartan's case, they might have to wait for a while before the buyer is ready to make a move.\nIn 2021, when it was still called Gascoyne, the company fielded a scrip bid from the now $1.2 billion Westgold \nResources. Nothing came of the talks, and Westgold has since moved on its scrip-and-cash bid for Canada-listed \nKarora Resources.\nInterestingly, another listed gold player, Ramelius Resources, has sniffed around Spartan in the past. Ramelius \nboss Mark Zeptner's made no secret he's on the M&A trail as the company stares down a big production slump in \nFY25, thanks to its ageing Edna May mine.\nSo far this year, Zeptner's had to walk away from Karora - the same company being bought by Westgold. To make \nmatters worse, Ramelius also approached Westgold to explore a $3 billion-plus merger, but was turned back. The \ncompany is now at the Takeovers Panel, nit-picking its rival's Canadian acquisition.\nGiven the recent events, it wouldn't be surprising if Ramelius pops up with a substantial shareholding notice at \nSpartan Resources come this morning. However, fund managers who asked Citi to name last night's buyer were \nmet with silence.\nPage 2 of 2\nMystery buyer raids gold play Spartan's register; Street Talk\nSpartan had a $916.8 million market capitalisation and has run up a whopping 382 per cent in the past 12 months. \nIn April, the company raised $80 million via Canaccord Genuity, Euroz Hartleys and Sternship Advisers.

Another key area of focus has been the development of its CMA mine pit underground extension to the \nYaoure Gold Mine.\nMeanwhile, Chinese groups may be in the strongest contention for Akyem when it comes to price, but Newmont will \ntake into consideration whether the buyer is a responsible owner of the asset, so it may not get sold to the highest \nbidder.\nNewmont is offloading mines globally following its $24bn purchase of Australia's largest gold mining company \nNewcrest.\nIt is also working with advisory firm BMO to sell mines in Canada and North America, including the Musselwhite, \nCripple Creek (US) and Eleonore (Canada) projects, potentially worth a combined $1.5bn.\nThe contest is expected to attract North American miners.\nPage 2 of 2\nPerseus drops out of the contest for Ghana asset - DATA ROOM\nLast on the block will be Newmont's Telfer gold mine in Western Australia, which Macquarie Capital is mandated to \nsell. Greatland Gold has first right to buy the asset and there's been some market chatter that perhaps the \nnegotiations are already afoot, despite floating at Telfer's tailings dam causing production delays.\nThere was also a suggestion that Ramelius Resources could be interested. However, judging by the trading in \nSpartan Resources, it appears Ramelius's interest lies elsewhere.\nThe Australian listed gold miner that last year held merger talks with near-by rival Westgold Resources told the \nmarket on Thursday it had purchased 8.9 per cent of the $994m listed gold miner Spartan after a major holding \nfrom Tembo Capital was on offer through Citi.\nHowever, it added that it had no current intention to acquire control or make a takeover of the business that owns \nthe Dalgaranga Gold Project, 65km northwest of Mt Magnet in Murchison, Western Australia, where Ramelius \nowns a gold processing hub.\nStill, it gives Ramelius deal certainty should it be keen to move in on the target in the future.\nDataRoom reported in April that Spartan was on the radar of Ramelius. Spartan was previously called Gascoyne \nand had to undergo a string of emergency equity raisings since 2019 following losses, with a mill far bigger than its \nproduction capacity being its downfall.\nThe strategic move by Ramelius resembles Silver Lake's with Red 5, buying 11 per cent last year ahead of a scrip \nmerger deal later with the $1.2bn company.\nThe share price of Red 5 post the merger has been lagging, down about 20 per cent in the past month and taking \nits market value to $2.5bn. Some Silver Lake assets now part of Red 5 are also close to Spartan's. Australian listed \ngold mining companies are under pressure to consolidate to attract global institutional investors that want gold \nmining investment opportunities of scale.\nLoad-Date: June 27, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Bridget Carter\nDate: June 28, 2024\nTitle: Perseus drops out of the contest for Ghana asset - DATA ROOM\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Wild ride as investors tally mining's FY24 winners and losers\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Nick Evans\n### Date: July 01, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nWild ride as investors tally mining's FY24 winners and losers\nWild ride as investors tally mining's FY24 winners and losers\nThe Australian\nJuly 1, 2024 Monday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 18\nLength: 854 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nBHP's failed bid for Anglo American dominated attention in the second half of the 2024 financial year, but the \nsearch for value in the mid-tier mining sector was dominated by the resurgence of gold and the fall from grace of \nthe critical minerals sector.\nWith one exception at the top of the list, gold companies delivered the best returns for the full -financial year within \nthe mid-cap resources sector, with seven of the top 10 total returns - including share price movements and \ndividends - on the S&P/ASX 300 Metals and Mining index coming from gold miners.\nThe copper price recovery helped Sandfire Resources return to grace, as the last major pure play miner of the \ncommodity on the Australian bourse.\nSandfire shares ended the year on a slide though, alongside the copper price, closing on Friday at $8.73, 14 per \ncent below its annual high of $10.16 in May, when the copper price was also riding high at close to $US11,000 a \ntonne.\nBut, despite the late slip, Sandfire shares still delivered a total annual return of close to 48 per cent for the financial \nyear.\nStanmore Resources' acquisition of BHP's unwanted BMC coal assets in Queensland helped the company to \nbecome one of the other exceptions, with the transformation of the scale of the miner's business putting it in eighth \nspot for the fiscal year, with dividend payments helping it to a 46 per cent total return.\nBut, despite dire circumstances elsewhere in the sector, junior lithium play Wildcat Resources topped the best 10 \nperformers, with a 162.5 per cent total return.\nEven so, with a 31.5c close on Friday, Wildcat is a long way off its $1.01 peak in November at the height of the \nlithium land grab that saw Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting, Chris Ellison's Mineral Resources and global \nmajors SQM and Albemarle put billions of dollars on the table for lithium explorers as the price of the battery metal \nplunged.\nPage 2 of 2\nWild ride as investors tally mining's FY24 winners and losers\nBut it was gold that delivered the best returns for mid-tier mining investors for the financial year, as soaring global \ninflation rates and geopolitical uncertainty helped the price of the precious metal surge.\nThe S&P All Ordinaries gold index hit a low of 6023.1 in early October 2023, and a high of 8153.4 in late May - an \nextraordinary 33 per cent gap - before softening late in the financial year to close at 7357.\nThe best returns of the year on the S&P/ASX 300 Metals and Mining index came from West Australian miner Red 5, \nwhich delivered an 89.5 per cent total return for the financial year despite a sharp fall in its share price from highs of \n49.5c in mid-May to a 36c close on Friday.\nWest African Resources was in second spot, with an 86.1 per cent return as the Burkina Faso gold miner closes in \non the start of production from its second gold mine in the country.\nAnd Morgan Hart's Emerald Resources continued its strong run after turning its Okvau gold mine in Cambodia into \na reliable production hub, worth about 100,000 ounces a year, and finally completed a long-running takeover of WA \nexplorer Bullseye Mining, adding a high-grade Australian project to its development options.\nEmerald delivered a total return of 86 per cent for the financial year, followed by the two companies competing to \nemerge as WA's next major mid-tier gold play - Westgold Resources and Ramelius Resources, which delivered \n68.7 per cent and 54.7 per cent returns respectively.\nAnd Africa-focused Perseus Mining added to its reputation as one of the Australian gold sector's most reliable \nproducers, gaining 45.3 per cent on a total return basis.\nBut while the political hype around critical minerals shows now sign of diminishing, the shine has long gone from \ncommodity prices and the ASX-listed stocks that jumped on board the green metal wagon. Any Core Lithium \nshareholders looking to indulge in a little tax-loss selling to offset taxable gains elsewhere in their portfolio will have \nbeen well-placed last week, with the company - the first major Australian victim of the lithium price plunge - finishing \nthe year down 89.7 per cent, the biggest loss on the S&P/ASX 300 Metals and Mining index.\nInvestors who jumped on the Canadian lithium bandwagon have also had a torrid time, with Sayona Mining and \nPatriot Battery Metals down 79 per cent and 67.5 per cent respectively.\nChalice Mining was the third biggest loser on the list, with a 77.3 per cent plunge for the fiscal year after delivering \nan underwhelming scoping study on its Gonneville project in WA in August last year.\nIGO was hit by falling lithium and nickel prices - while still feeling the hangover from its disastrous takeover of \nWestern Areas - and suffered a 60.6 per cent value loss for the year.\nGraphite plays Talga Group, Syrah Resources and Renascor Resources all made the top 10 loser list.\nThe list is rounded out by -Liontown Resources, which was the hottest lithium play on the market when Albemarle \nlobbed a $2.50-a-share bid in March 2023. Hancock Prospecting spoiled that takeover, however, and the falling \nlithium price - as well as cost blowouts at its Kathleen Valley project in WA - did the rest, with Liontown stock \nclosing off 68 per cent for the financial year at 90.5c.\nLoad-Date: June 30, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Nick Evans\nDate: July 01, 2024\nTitle: Wild ride as investors tally mining's FY24 winners and losers\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Big lick of Spartan Resources trades again, eyes on Ramelius; Street Talk\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood, And Emma Rapaport\n### Date: July 02, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nBig lick of Spartan Resources trades again, eyes on Ramelius Street Talk\nBig lick of Spartan Resources trades again, eyes on Ramelius; Street Talk\nAustralian Financial Review\nJuly 2, 2024 Tuesday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
