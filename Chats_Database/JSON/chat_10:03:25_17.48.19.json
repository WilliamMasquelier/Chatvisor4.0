Shaw is keen on Genesis Minerals in the sector and has a price target on the \nstock of $2.75 against $2.18 currently.\nPage 2 of 2\nTrading at near-record highs, but gold still has 'further to go' - DATA ROOM\nUBS has a target price of $2.25 on Genesis but that's assuming a long-term gold price of $US1950 per ounce and \nan Australian dollar exchange rate of US75c.\nCanaccord favours Evolution Mining, Northern Star Resources, Resolute Mining and Ramelius Resources among \nthe Australian gold miners. Evolution had improved balance sheet capacity and a \"unique investment offering\" given \nit also has copper exposure, with a dearth of quality copper names on the ASX.\nCashed up Northern Star also had plenty of room to move should attractive deals emerge, Canaccord said.\n\"Northern Star maintains exceptional leverage to rising gold prices, owing to the scale of its operations,\" the broker \nsaid.\n\"Its FY25 production profile is more than double the next biggest ASX gold producer ... \"Northern Star retains \n$1.5bn in available undrawn debt facilities for total liquidity of over $2.7bn. In our view, this offers the company good \noptionality around deleveraging, special dividends and potential M&A.\"\nLoad-Date: September 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**PERSON**: [Full Name]\n**ROLE**: [Person's role or position]\n**CONTEXT**: [Brief description of how the person is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**PERSON**: Elon Musk\n**ROLE**: CEO of Tesla and SpaceX\n**CONTEXT**: Primary subject of article, discussing company strategy\n\nOnly include people who play a meaningful role in the article's content.
