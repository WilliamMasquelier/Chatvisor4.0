Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue Metals CEO | \"Putting all the focus on the safeguard mechanism to address emissions reduction in WA is concerning.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue Metals CEO | \"In the mining sector, the safeguard mechanism is entirely compromised by other initiatives such as the diesel fuel tax credit. We encourage the federal government to bring forward its review, so the mining sector can focus on investing in decarbonisation.\" | N.A. |\n| Bronwyn Grieve | Fortescue's Director of Global Sustainability and External Affairs | \"The government should consider tying the lucrative fuel tax credit to decarbonisation efforts for major miners.\" | N.A. |\n| Barry Sterland | Productivity Commission Commissioner | \"I don't think that necessarily works at cross purposes, I think there's a different complex argument to be had about the transport fuel space.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
