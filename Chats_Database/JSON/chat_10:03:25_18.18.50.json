This clumsy, boneheaded remark, uttered in \nthe midst of a cultural audit at the company, is typical of a proud oaf like Ellison. He wouldn't have the slightest clue \nthat it's the women of MinRes, far more than the men, who rely so heavily on flexible working arrangements - and \nit's women, strangely, who he's still so eager to attract to his workforce.\nMinRes has had a longstanding problem with women. Its most senior have departed and its leadership team is \nstacked with Chris's and Marks and Mikes and Darrens.\nThere are six chief executives in the upper levels of the executive, allmen. There's not even a pretence of diversity, \na feat in itself. The place is a giant, heaving man-cave, a boys club stinking of chauvinism and Lynx Africa.\nOne of the most senior women to work with Ellison was lawyer Bronwyn Grieve. She arrived in August 2022 as \nchief people officer and had been tasked with revamping culture at the mining company. In other words, it was her \njob to make the place more amenable - or just slightly less repellent - to women. Blocked at every turn, she quit \nwithin a year.\nSo did executive general manager Shelley Robertson, who quit MinRes in March 2023. Grieve and Robertson have \nsince ended up at Fortescue, as Margin Call has learned, both now occupying seats on Andrew Forrest's \nexecutive. Robertson was promoted this month to chief operating officer and Grieve is Fortescue's global \nsustainability and external affairs lead.\nNot to mention the profusion of women elsewhere at MinRes who have walked out over some shabby treatment. \nTania Champion, MinRes's principal tenement adviser, started at Fortescue two months ago as the principal of \napproval planning. Courtney Kelley, MinRes's in-house counsel, ended her two years at the company at the same \ntime, according to LinkedIn.\nPage 2 of 2\nMinRes's best bail to Fortescue\nMeanwhile, Ellison, a year on from his outright dismissal of flexible work, is back to making more bold \npronouncements - this time about his commitment to hiring more women. Here he is at a Macquarie Australia \nconference in May talking about his vision for a \"safer work environment\" for women.\n\"I'm building a daycare centre so, ladies, if you want to come and work for me, 20 bucks a day for your kids, we're \ngoing to be able to accommodate about 140 kids, so all our workforce.\" This wasn't satire. Nor was the hiring of \ncompany \"ambassador\" Julie Bishop to star in a video spruiking the miner as modern and female-friendly.\nOh, if only she knew that the women who get anywhere near the MinRes leadership are out of that place faster than \na Manhattan rat in a kitchen.\nEllison's problem isn't just hiring women, it's keeping them - and losing the best of them to Fortescue.\nEarly exit Meanwhile, what to make of Richard Harding's premature exit as CEO of Insurance and Care NSW?\nHarding had been booked to leave in October but was quietly desaparecido'd earlier this month, leaving the agency \nand the government flat-footed in finding a replacement.\nNo change to his LinkedIn, of course; according to that, he hasn't left at all. But he has, and there's been little \nprogress identifying a successor.\nPart of the problem seems to be a tiff between iCare's chair, John Robertson, and the responsible minister, Sophie \nCotsis. Their beef centres on control of the appointment process and a broader argument around the agency's \nindependence.\nThe other snag is the board. Once upon a time it was stacked with Liberal Party donors and toadies. Now it's \nLabor's turn to try that on.\nDeputy chair Michael Cameron disappeared in November (apparently rissoled for being a Liberal Party member) \nand a month later Unions NSW secretary Mark Morey appeared with a directorship. That's worth at least $100,000, \nand even more if he chairs a subcommittee. Robertson, a former union boss himself, receives $200,000 as chair. \nAll of it's easy money for just nine meetings a year.\nNevermind that there's no one on the board with any actual experience in the realm of insurance. The only person \nwho comes close is Stuart Farquharson, formerly a CFO at Zurich. He's not on the board but rather acting in \nHarding's role as interim CEO, so he's allowed to sit in the room.\nIn any case, all this bickering over who gets to run the appointment process is awkward when one considers \nRobertson's position. Cotsis might put up a fight but she knows - or should - that Chris Minns was chief of staff to \nRobbo while he was opposition leader.\nLoad-Date: July 23, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Yoni Bashan\nDate: July 24, 2024\nTitle: MinRes's best bail to Fortescue\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Forrest's Fortescue boosts spending to keep green hydrogen dream alive\n## Media outlet: The Sydney Morning Herald\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: July 25, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nForrest's Fortescue boosts spending to keep green hydrogen dream alive\nForrest's Fortescue boosts spending to keep green hydrogen dream alive\nThe Sydney Morning Herald (Australia) - Online\nJuly 25, 2024 Thursday 4:31 AM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The division's \noperating expenditure would rise from a maximum of $500 million to $700 million, the company said.\n\"I want to make it really clear: Fortescue is steadfast in our commitment to green hydrogen,\" Hutchinson said. \n\"However, our financial discipline always comes first, and we will never do projects that are not economically \nviable.\"\nSince 2020, Forrest has toured the world promoting the virtues of green hydrogen and seeking to partner with \ngovernments that have areas suitable for producing the vast amounts of wind, solar or hydropower required.\nGreen hydrogen is considered a promising future fuel due to its potential to displace fossil fuels and help \ndecarbonise industrial processes, such as steel-making, that cannot be simply electrified. However it remains \nPage 2 of 2\nForrest's Fortescue boosts spending to keep green hydrogen dream alive\nprohibitively expensive to make and is not yet viable at scale, with most of today's hydrogen still made using fossil \nfuels.\nHutchinson on Thursday said it had become apparent that the ability to source renewable electricity at a cost of \naround $US30 ($45.80) a megawatt-hour was essential for a project to be viable.\nIn jurisdictions where power was more expensive, he added, Fortescue would invest in plans to build renewable \nenergy generators, including in Western Australia and Queensland.\n\"Where the power costs are not at this level, we will work steadfastly with those economies to help bring down the \ncost of electricity by producing electrons,\" he said.\nFortescue will initially focus on four key green hydrogen projects in Australia, the United States, Norway and Brazil. \nFurther projects in Morocco, Oman, Egypt and Jordan would follow, the company said.\n\"We totally believe green hydrogen is what the world ultimately needs, that is why we will continue to maintain a \nsignificant portfolio of projects,\" Hutchinson said.\nThe update on Fortescue's green hydrogen strategy came as the company reported record quarterly exports of the \nlucrative steel-making raw material iron ore from its mines in WA.\n\"It's been an outstanding quarter by the team who rallied together to deliver record iron ore shipments of 53.7 \nmillion tonnes, which was 10 per cent higher than the June quarter last year,\" Fortescue Metals chief executive \nDino Otranto said.\n\"This record result demonstrated the efficiencies gained through our recovery plan following the ore car derailment \nin December 2023.\"\nThe Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day's trading.

Macquarie \nestimates Fortescue's break even price at about $US40 a tonne - lower than that of BHP at about $US32 and Rio \nat about $US35.\n\"Fortescue has addressed market downturns in the past with a focus on cost and flexibility. With the recent \nSimandou approval and a higher break-even vs peers, FMG's premium may come under pressure,\" Macquarie \nanalysts said.
