It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 3\nLabor's hydrogen goal stalls as Fortescue trims ambitions\nLabor's hydrogen goal stalls as Fortescue trims ambitions\nAustralian Financial Review\nJuly 18, 2024 Thursday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 1\nLength: 1053 words\nByline: Peter Ker and Angela Macdonald-Smith\nBody\nFortescue will cut 700 jobs and slow its push into green hydrogen in a blow to the Albanese government's plan to \nmake Australia a hydrogen superpower, supported by more than $8 billion of taxpayer-funded incentives.\nFortescue chairman Andrew Forrest said low carbon \"green\" hydrogen still had a bright future, but his immediate \nfocus would shift to renewable electricity as he jettisoned a target for Fortescue to produce 15 million tonnes of \ngreen hydrogen by 2030.\nThe concession comes after a six-year period in which Dr Forrest was one of the world's leading advocates for \nhydrogen and as Fortescue works to break down a corporate structure that had previously treated its energy and \niron ore mining divisions as separate companies.\nThe decision out of Perth stokes speculation that the Albanese government's flagship Hydrogen Headstart program, \nwhich proposes a $2 per kilogram subsidy to hydrogen producers, could be insufficient to spur the industry into \ncommercial reality. Woodside Energy has struggled to get a US hydrogen project signed off without enough \ncustomers willing to pay a premium for low-carbon fuels.\nDr Forrest said lower energy prices were the priority for world leaders at a time when war in Ukraine and the Middle \nEast had roiled commodity markets, driven up the cost of energy and challenged the economics of hydrogen, which \nis more expensive than natural gas. \"In that environment, you're not going to bring in major sources of green \nhydrogen, which relies on cheap energy prices,\" he said. \"We are not going to swim against the tide.\"\nThe Albanese government promise of $6.7 billion of production tax credits for hydrogen arrived barely a year after \npumping $2 billion of taxpayers' funds into the Hydrogen Headstart policy.\nAnd energy sources say Japanese importers are increasingly looking at hydrogen only as a long-term alternative, \npreferring in the nearer term substitutes that are compatible with existing transport and utility infrastructure.\nGrattan Institute energy policy director Tony Wood said: \"The reality is that the queue of people being prepared to \npay Twiggy Forrest a lot of money for green hydrogen is not very long.\"\nPage 2 of 3\nLabor's hydrogen goal stalls as Fortescue trims ambitions\nGreen hydrogen is made by using renewable energy to split water into its constituent parts, and Fortescue had \nshaped as a likely beneficiary of those federal schemes.\nBut Dr Forrest said Fortescue would focus in the immediate future on generating and distributing clean power, \nrather than using that clean power to make hydrogen. \"We're going to stay where we know we can win, and that's \ngreen electricity. Nothing beats green electricity,\" he said.\nDr Forrest is already a big producer of renewable power in his private capacity through Squadron Energy, which \nowns many Australian wind farms.\nThe job cuts announced by Fortescue yesterday will continue efforts under way for close to 18 months to reduce \nduplication between the energy and mining divisions.\nOne layer of duplication will remain: energy boss Mark Hutchinson and mining boss Dino Otranto will continue to be \ndual chief executives of Fortescue and report to Dr Forrest as executive chairman.\nWhile the top three at Fortescue will remain in place, the rapid turnover of senior executives has continued, with \nenergy executive Eva Hanly and marketing director Vivienne Tieu leaving the company.\nDual company secretary-general counsel Phil McKeiver has lost the company secretary role, in a move that \nappears to be driven by his handling of a bitter legal dispute with green iron rival Element Zero.\nFortescue hired private investigators to follow and monitor the former executives behind the Element Zero start-up \nand their families as part of a lawsuit over an alleged intellectual property breach.\nYesterday, Dr Forrest said no member of the Fortescue board had been aware of the strategy and the board \n\"struggled\" to align the actions with Fortescue's values.\nMr McKeiver had offered his resignation, but it had been rejected, the iron ore billionaire said.\n\"I'm proud of the guy for taking full responsibility.\"\nFortescue appointed Mona Gill as company secretary; Mr McKeiver will continue as general counsel.\nIron ore prices are predicted to slide over the next five years as new supply from Africa and Western Australia \nenters the market, but Dr Forrest said the job cuts were not driven by this.\n\"We're going to sadly lose around 4.5 per cent of our direct workforce, 3 per cent of our indirect workforce,\" he said \nof the proposed cuts.\n\"It's not a big number in percentage terms, but we still don't like doing it. But it's not to jam operating costs down, it \nis to streamline this organisation and keep the genius of simplicity.\"\nThe job cuts will affect Fortescue staff around the world and also add to the thousands of job losses in the \nAustralian resources sector this year at loss-making nickel mines, lithium mines and Alcoa's Kwinana alumina \nrefinery.\nYesterday, Fortescue appointed Apple Paget as chief financial officer of the combined group, ending the previous \nstructure where the mining and energy divisions had their own CFOs, such as former Reserve Bank deputy Guy \nDebelle, who lasted just 143 days.\nFormer Mineral Resources executive Shelley Robertson was named as Fortescue's chief operating officer.\nFortescue will continue to push ahead with three green hydrogen projects that were the subject of final investment \ndecisions last year; one in Arizona, one in the Pilbara, and a $US150 million venture near Gladstone, which will \nstart construction this year.Page 3 of 3\nLabor's hydrogen goal stalls as Fortescue trims ambitions\nFortescue said two more hydrogen projects in Norway and Brazil remained under consideration, and the \nNorwegian project was close to a final investment decision.\nDespite abandoning the 2030 hydrogen goal, Dr Forrest said Fortescue would eventually get to 15 million tonnes \nof hydrogen production and would retain its promise to have zero greenhouse gas emissions globally by 2030 \nwithout relying on carbon offsets. It bills its hydrogen as zero carbon.\nDr Hutchinson said Fortescue would continue to make hydrogen electrolysers at its Gladstone factory at a time \nwhen many customers were enduring long waits for electrolysers to be delivered.\nBut Fortescue's plan to retrofit Incitec Pivot's Gibson Island fertiliser plant near Brisbane into a low-carbon version \nof itself is on the backburner because of high electricity costs in Australia.\nLoad-Date: July 20, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
