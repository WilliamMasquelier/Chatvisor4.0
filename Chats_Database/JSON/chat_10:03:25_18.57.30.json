A social media post blamed the \namount of travel away from his base in Darwin following a promotion last year.\n\"After taking on the Australian director role in August it meant more travel away from Darwin and the family, which I \nfound too difficult,\" Mr Gunner said in a LinkedIn post.\n\"I'm taking a bit of time before deciding with the family what I do next and am now reporting for lunchbox duty.\" Mr \nGunner was initially hired to lead Fortescue Future Industries' northern Australian operations in November 2022. \nHe was then promoted to a position as director of Australia and New Zealand in August last year.\n\"Working for Andrew and Fortescue was an incredible opportunity - a dynamic company with a bold green energy \nvision. I will always be a friend of the Fortescue family and an advocate for Fortescue and the path they are \nforging,\" Mr Gunner said.\nA Fortescue spokesman said: \"We respect Michael's decision and his personal reasons for making it, and wish him \nand his family well.\" Earlier this week the finance boss of Fortescue's energy division, Deborah Caudle, left the \ncompany after a consolidation of Fortescue's finance functions.\nA revolving door of executives have jumped ship from the company in the last 12 months as pressure grows on \nFortescue to execute a high-stakes pivot to green energy from its iron ore foundations which made its founder one \nof Australia's richest men.\nPage 2 of 2\nGunner quits Fortescue citing toll from travel\nIn August 2023, Fortescue's CEO Fiona Hick and chief financial officer Christine Morris both quit, while Dr -Debelle \nresigned as a director of Fortescue Future Industries. The company's general manager of operations planning, \nAndrew O'Dowd, also left the company in September.\nThe departures have added to the picture of turmoil at the company over the past few years, with the exit of at least \na dozen members of Fortescue's executive leadership team - and substantially more senior operational managers.\nDr Forrest last year denied responsibility for the rapid turnover at the senior ranks of the company he founded, \nsaying some new recruits had struggled in the \"boiler room\" environment at the company, but left with its best \nwishes if they were not a good fit. Fortescue received a first strike against its remuneration report at the company's \nannual shareholder meeting - with more than 52 per cent of shares voted against the motion - amid a backlash \nagainst the company's decision to give additional payouts to the company's former CEO and chief financial officer.\nLoad-Date: February 1, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
