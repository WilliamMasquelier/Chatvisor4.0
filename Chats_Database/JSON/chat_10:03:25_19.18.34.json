Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 23\nLength: 904 words\nByline: Anthony Macdonald\nBody\nThree things scare Australian fund managers and sell-side analysts off Fortescue. Andrew Forrest removed one of \nthem, yet no one's paying attention.\nThe most surprising thing on the ASX yesterday was the way investors overlooked Fortescue's big news. Its \npromise to get back to its leaner and meaner roots and ease off its green energy expansion had the stock down 1.2 \nper cent in afternoon trade, while brokers barely mentioned it in their morning notes.\nHaving heard sell-side analysts consistently poke holes in the hydrogen story - the technology, the rollout, the cost - \nand listened to fund managers talk about Fortescue spending iron ore cash flows on an unproven business and \nwatching its cost base grow, we thought the wind-back would be welcome.\nIn theory, it's a reset that could return Fortescue to its glory days in 2018 and 2019, when just about every extra $1 \nmillion in revenue fell through to the earnings before interest and tax line and its dividend machine started.\nThe job cuts and statement could also dispel fears about Fortescue's energy unit spending $1 billion or so a year in \nthe near term with no clear path to revenue or earnings.\nInstead, it was met with crickets and yesterday's share price drop. There were nervy buyers in early trade, and no \ninstant gratification for what we thought was a pretty significant announcement.\nPerhaps the most telling thing was the way sell-side analysts largely ignored the news. Macquarie's team had a \nclose look, and upped its near-term earnings per share forecasts by 20 er cent, but none of the other 15 analysts in \nBloomberg's survey had re-cut the numbers by lunchtime. UBS, not in Bloomberg's survey for the past few years \nand which called the hydrogen news \"unsurprising\", published a brief 1-pager.\nSo what's going on? It's either something simple or much more serious, depending on who you ask.\nThe simple theory is that the school holidays have sucked plenty of money managers and analysts away from their \ndesks, significantly cutting active fund domestic institution trading volumes and quant money that factors in things \nsuch as broker earnings upgrades/downgrades.\nPage 2 of 2\nNo sugar hit from Fortescue backflip Closing Bell\nThat is true, but we still see share prices go up and down on small volumes, so while it may explain the lack of \nanalyst interest, we're not sure if it explains the muted share price response.\nWorse for Fortescue would be if it shows institutional investors and all those analysts with hold/sell \nrecommendations (all 16 of them in Bloomberg's survey) are materially more concerned by the company's other big \nissues. Time will tell. One day's trade does not make or break Fortescue's strategy, but the muted response can \nstill be interesting.\nThe two other issues are the iron ore price - a perennial question that has flared up given what's going on in China \nand the arrival of Rio Tinto-backed Simandou into the market from 2026 - and Fortescue's leadership team which, \nwhile under executive chairman Forrest and his co-CEOs Dino Otranto and Mark Hutchinson, has experienced a lot \nof turnover.\nBoth come up in our talks with Australian fund managers, including the big industry funds and the domestic long-\nonly crowd, and are long-term issues that cannot be addressed or overcome with one announcement.\nThe price of iron ore is Fortescue's core earnings driver, while its leadership team and governance framework is \nimportant to its long-term value creation for shareholders. Wednesday afternoon's announcement had three more \nexecutive team appointments: Apple Paget to chief financial officer (from acting CFO), chief corporate officer \nShelley Robertson to chief operating officer and Navdeep (Mona) Gill to company secretary (from assistant \ncompany secretary).\nIn the short term, the other thing on fund managers' minds is whether there may be some residual selling from long-\ntime Fortescue-backed Capital Group, a US funds management giant that was a substantial shareholder for close \nto a decade.\nCapital sold a monster $1.1 billion line of Fortescue shares in June, and dipped below the substantial mark days \nlater. It still has at least a few billion dollars invested in the $70 billion iron ore miner.\nSometimes investors hold off from buying after these blocks, thinking there may be more stock to shake loose at \ndiscounted prices. The block also showed there was not a lot of domestic interest in Fortescue; brokers reckon the \nstock was largely acquired offshore.\nWhatever the case, Forrest and Co have more work to do selling this story to the institutional investor community. \nWhile they're the sort of pack that likes to prove the doubters wrong, it does not hurt to have a few friends out there \nor at least ones that take notice of potentially meaningful strategic pivots.\nFrom the muted reaction, we cannot help to think it's a bit of a \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" when it \ncomes to green hydrogen.\nWhile investors bagged it when Forrest was trying to ram it out, they seem to be paying little attention now he has \ntaken his foot off the accelerator. They're more interested in the iron price.\nWhat's the long-term sustainable iron ore price? You'd be hard-pressed to find too many reputable markets people \nto say it is materially more than yesterday's $US105 a tonne.\nIf it does go south, absent this green hydrogen business we've heard a lot about recently, where does Fortescue's \nshare price go? That's why there are so many \"sell\" calls on the stock and the problem today.\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
