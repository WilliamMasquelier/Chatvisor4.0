Well-\ndeveloped Cu-Au horizon identified at the Centre Forest Prospect ('Centre Forest'), interpreted to be hosted within a \nprospective regional shear corridor that follows the margins of an interpreted intrusion. Exciting opportunity to not \nonly explore for higher grade Cu-Au zones at Centre Forest but also regionally along the targeted shear corridor \n(24km of strike), where minimal exploration has been undertaken to date\nContact:\nPeter Woodman\nTel: +61 8 9322 6322\nPROJECT BACKGROUND\nUlarring, consisting of tenements E70/4686 and E70/4901 (cumulatively 187km2 ) is located 100km northeast of \nPerth. Ularring is situated within the Archaean Yilgarn Craton and borders the Southwest and Youanmi Terranes. \nPage 2 of 3\n-Constellation Resources Limited - COMPLETION OF ULARRING COPPER GOLD PROJECT ACQUISITION\nThe Ularring tenements overlie broad acreage farms and capture the Shires of Goomalling, Cunderdin and \nNortham. A series of access agreements that allow exploration within private properties are in place. The region is \nknown to host several major deposits that are intrusion related, such as the Boddington Copper-Gold mine (11Moz \nAu and 1Mt of copper produced, hosted in a sheared Intrusive related setting1 ) and Caravel Minerals' (ASX: CVV) \nCaravel Copper Project (a porphyry hosted Cu-Mo-Ag-Au deposit containing 3Mt Cu, 61Kt Mo, 895koz Au and \n46Moz Ag in Mineral Resource2 ). A separate style of deposit in the region is the recently discovered Julimar \nProject (a mafic hosted PGE-Ni deposit) owned by Chalice Mining Ltd (ASX: CHN).\nCENTRE FOREST PROSPECT\nCentre Forest is the most advanced and explored prospect within the Ularring Project. A welldeveloped Cu-Au \nhorizon has been identified at Centre Forest which is interpreted to be hosted within a prospective regional shear \ncorridor that follows the margins of an interpreted intrusion. A number of phases of drilling have been undertaken \nhistorically at Centre Forest by various exploration companies, however, there has been minimal programs in the \nlast decade. Centre Forest represents an exciting opportunity to follow-up on previous drilling with the intention of \nidentifying higher grade Cu-Au zones. The results from previous drilling programs at Centre Forest have confirmed \na continuous, broad zone of Cu-Au mineralisation over a strike length of 1.1km and remains open when utilising a \n>0.1g/t Au cutoff. The Cu-Au mineralisation is interpreted to be best developed along a highly altered sheared \nmargin of a granitoid intrusion and is hosted both in oxides (saprolite) from the surface and in the fresh rock located \ndown dip. The associated mineral assemblage comprises quartz-garnet-biotite-cordierite-orthopyroxene with a \nsulphide suite comprising of pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite with trace levels of bismuthate. Other metal associations with \nthe gold mineralisation include elevated levels of silver, bismuth, molybdenum and tungsten. The sheared contact is \nbelieved to be part of the regional Meenar Shear Corridor.\nCOMPETENT PERSONS STATEMENT\nThe information in this announcement that relates to exploration results has been extracted from an ASX \nAnnouncement dated 12 September 2024 which is available to view at www.constellationresources.com.au.

A giant new mill is currently being built at Kalgoorlie's revamped Super Pit.\nPage 2 of 2\nAs gold bounces higher, upgrades abound among stocks\n\"The upgrades for the mid-cap producers are mixed. Lower cost producers Capricorn and Ramelius see modest \nupgrades of 13 per cent and 15 per cent for FY25, while Bellevue's earnings forecast rises 19 per cent,\" Bairstow \nand Streater say.\n\"Higher-cost producers and companies that have recently completed acquisitions that carry higher depreciation \nunderpin higher upgrades.\" African producers Perseus Mining and West African Resources have seen 20 per cent \nand 13 per cent jumps in their price targets, with a number of explorers in Western Australia also seeing their price \ntargets lifted. Earnings upgrades for FY25 and FY26 are 26 per cent and 35 per cent respectively for the cohort, \nwith FY26-27 upgrades of 69-78 per cent for Perseus and 61-63 per cent for West African Resources.\nThere are some recommendation upgrades here as well. Ramelius, Bellevue and Ora Banda have all been moved \nfrom hold to buy, taking the bulk of the Australian gold sector into buy territory.\nSpartan Resources, which has risen 225 per cent over the past year as the remarkably high grades of its Never \nNever and Peppers discoveries near Mt Magnet were revealed, has been moved from a hold to a spec buy with a \n$1.55 price target.\nBairstow and Streater say their preference is for stocks with \"strong organic growth potential\", led by Genesis \nMinerals, Westgold and Capricon, with Genesis and Capricorn's five-year CAGR of 20 per cent doubling the rest of \ntheir coverage universe.\nThey say there remains strong value across the sector, with De Grey Mining, and African development plays WIA \nGold and Tolu Minerals also key picks.\n\"Our bullish outlook for the yellow metal and material upgrades to our earnings outlook underpins our shift to a \npositive view across all stocks in the sector,\" Bairstow and Streater say.\nThe bullish new gold sector upgrade from Argonaut comes after Streater initiated coverage on Turaco Gold on the \nback of a site visit at the Afema project in Cote d'Ivoire. Since acquiring the site in November last year, drilling has \nunderpinned a maiden resource of 2.52 million ounces at 1.2 grams per tonne. Argonaut has placed a spec buy \nrating and 49c valuation on the $240m junior, which plans to complete a pre-feasibility study by the first half of 2026 \nat Afema.\nFormerly in the portfolio of African gold giant Endeavour Mining, Turaco purchased its majority 51 per cent stake \nlast year, with the right to move to 70 per cent once the PFS is complete for the payment of $US8.75m in cash and \n$46.5m to JV partner Sodim.\nStreater says Argonaut estimates $425m of pre-production capex and working capital requirements will be needed, \nwith Turaco likely to move to a 100 per cent ownership level, converting Sodim's minority interest to a 2 per cent \nNSR royalty.\nThe Cote d'Ivoire government would take a 10 per cent free-carried interest in the project with a five-year tax \nholiday, 0.9 per cent NSR royalty to state miner Sodemi and 6.5 per cent state royalty on gold sales over \n$US2000/oz.

The move follows the spectacular \nsuccess of Spectrum and Spartan Resources. Both found multi-million dollar gold deposits about 300m north of \ntheir mothballed open pits and Javelin already has some intriguing drill holes about 300m north of Eureka \nsuggesting there is more gold out there.\nPerth broker Shaw and Partners already has firm commitments for $3m at $.0025 a share (including a 1 for 2 option \nexercisable at $.004 within 2 years) to fund the deal. Under the terms of the sale Delta will pick up $1.5m in cash \nand a further $1.5m in Javelin shares at A$0.003 per share.\nIf Javelin manages to get Eureka back into production or increase the inferred resource to 200,000 ounces of gold \nDelta will pick up another $1m in Javelin shares. Notably, Eureka already comes gift-wrapped with a 112,000 ounce \n1.42 gram per tonne starter resource.\nThe initial shares issued to Delta Lithium will be subject to escrow for 12 months.\nThe old Eureka open pit sits about 50km north-west of Kalgoorlie in the prospective sequence of mafic and \nultramafic rocks which forms part of the more than 290km-long\nKalgoorlie-Menzies leg of the 700km-long Norseman to Wiluna Greenstone belt.\nImportantly it is only 20kms north-west of the Paddington gold mine that has been mined for years and is well \nknown for doing toll treating deals.\nPaddington has turned out more than four million ounces during its production history from the same prospective \nrock sequence as mapped at Eureka, which is also held to be a structural setting similar to the half-million ounce \nZoroastrian gold deposit at Bardoc Gold, only 1.4km east of the Eureka deposit.\nThe Eureka mine site was mined for the most part in the early 1990's and was subject to small scale tribute mining \nagain in 2018 by Kalgoorlie identity Graham McGarry who pulled a bit over 5000 ounces from the old pit at 3.16 g/t \ngold. However, Javelin says prior drilling was poorly targeted at the project and was not deep enough to follow the \ninterpreted structures properly.",
