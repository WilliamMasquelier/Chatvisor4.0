Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 17\nLength: 770 words\nByline: Yolanda Redrup\nBody\nA Fortescue-backed hydrogen-powered plane start-up has collapsed, burning through almost $150 million in \ninvestor capital but unable to secure additional funding amid the global challenging venture capital environment.\nThe closure of Universal Hydrogen comes despite the California-based start-up successfully completing a test flight \nlast year, which made it the largest hydrogen fuel cell-powered plane to take to the skies.\nThe company, founded in 2020 by former Airbus chief technology officer Paul Eremenko, raised $US62 million in a \nSeries B round at the height of the venture capital boom in 2021.\nIts previous $US20.5 million Series A raise was led by Silicon Valley-based Australian Peter Barrett's early-stage \ndeep tech fund Playground Global, while Rich Lister Andrew Forrest's Fortescue was also an early-stage minority \ninvestor. Other investors include American Airlines, Toyota, Airbus and General Electric.\nSpeaking to The Australian Financial Review, Mr Barrett said the start-up, led by former chief technology officer \nMark Collins - who stepped into the CEO role after Mr Eremenko left earlier this year - had been trying to raise \nfunds since last year.\n\"Last year wasn't a good time to raise money, we had a lead for a very significant round, but that lead [investor] was \nunable to fund it,\" said Mr Barrett, who was also Universal Hydrogen director.\n\"There were dynamics that had nothing to do with the market or technology. There were a number of unfortunate \ntiming coincidences ... It's a really underappreciated determinant of success for these companies.\n\"We were very close to getting through this crisis. We were less than six months of runway from being in a very \nstrong position.\"\nMr Barrett, who co-founded video game developer Rocket Science Games in the 1990s and gave Elon Musk his \nfirst job, said the US government had approached Universal Hydrogen since the news of the collapse with offers to \ninject capital into the start-up to keep it afloat, but he believed it was too late to save it. However, he backed the \nteam and the technology, saying he hoped the company would \"find another home\" for its hydrogen fuel cell tech.\nPage 2 of 2\nCash headwinds ground Fortescue, Playground-backed hydrogen plane\n\"We have test aircraft flying, certification basis, we know the economics of the hydrogen plane are favourable, but \nthere is still a two-year path for certification ... That means you have to keep the development program fed and \nthere's a very small quorum of money that's in the middle,\" Mr Barrett said.\n\"It's not the $5 million cheque, or the $500 million cheque, it's the $50 million cheque that's really hard.\"\nPlayground Global, which Street Talk reports is raising a new fund, is also an investor in federal government-\nbacked PsiQuantum, Agility Robotics, Atomic AI and Ultima Genomics. More than 20 per cent of its portfolio \ncompanies have already hit $US1 billion valuations.\nA statement from Fortescue on yesterday on the collapse of Universal Hydrogen suggested the company was \nundeterred by the the venture's demise.\n\"There remains significant interest in our green energy projects and the prospect of green hydrogen and its \nderivatives,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We are proud to have some of the first green energy projects in the world at final investment decision including our \nArizona Hydrogen project in the United States and our Gladstone PEM50 project in Queensland.\"\nThe Seattle Times reported Universal Hydrogen's funding negotiations had been with a Saudi investment fund, and \nthe business had then tried to merge with Florida-based regional airline Silver Airways to stay afloat.\nWhile companies such as Universal Hydrogen have made leaps forward in developing hydrogen fuel cells to power \nplanes, there are still limitations being worked through, including storing sufficient hydrogen for long flights, given \neven in liquid form it contains about a quarter of the energy of a similar volume of jet fuel. On its test flight last year, \nonly one engine of the retrofitted aircraft was powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, the other by regular jet fuel.\nAs well as developing the propulsion system, Universal Hydrogen faced other challenges, including developing the \ninfrastructure at airports to support hydrogen-powered planes, and securing sufficient green hydrogen.\nHydrogen-powered long-haul flights are still some way off, but Mr Barrett said it was time for regional airlines to \nconvert to the fuel, with the technology already there to support short flights.\nAs well as being an early investor in Universal Hydrogen, Fortescue Future Industries had signed a memorandum \nof understanding with the US start-up in 2021 to negotiate a global offtake arrangement.\nLoad-Date: July 6, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Paul Eremenko | Founder of Universal Hydrogen | \"We have test aircraft flying, certification basis, we know the economics of the hydrogen plane are favourable, but there is still a two-year path for certification ...
