Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | CEO of Fortescue | \"We [Fortescue] raised capital this morning, only this morning, of $US9.2bn.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Chief Executive of Fortescue Metals | \"We got the first shipment out within months after signing the mining convention, but it was always our intent not to continue that operation - a high-cost trucking operation - to focus on the exploration activities.\" | N.A. |\n| Apple Paget | Chief Financial Officer of Fortescue | \"Clearly, increasing debt remains an option for us, but we do have a very strong capacity in our balance sheet and we're set up that way to take that on and look at other options as well.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
