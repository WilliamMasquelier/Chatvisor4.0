Noel is an \ninnovative thinker and passionate and for-midable Australian who will bring enormous benefit and insight to our \nboard,\" Dr Forrest said. Mr Pearson was a vocal supporter of Fortescue's \"Billion Opportunities\" program, launched \nin 2011, which promised to offer $1bn in contracts for companies that were at least 25 per cent owned by \nIndigenous Australians - a figure Fortescue now says has topped $5bn in contracts to more than 190 First Nations \nbusinesses.\nIn 2012, Dr Forrest offered $3m in funding to Queensland's Djarragun College, through Mr Pearson's Cape York \nPartnership organisation, which at the time was trying to convince the Queensland government it should be allowed \nto take over the school from the Anglican Church amid allegations of fraud under the school's previous \nmanagement.\nA decade ago, Mr Pearson drew public fire from other Indigenous leaders after becoming a prominent supporter of \nthe Fortescue founder in his calls for the establishment of cashless welfare cards to reduce alcohol dependency in \nremote indigenous communities. Mr Pearson said in a statement he was honoured to be invited to join the board of \nthe company.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest brings Pearson on board\n\"Fortescue is a proud Australian company that is led by its -values from mine site to the boardroom - something I \nhave great respect for,\" he said.\nMr Pearson joins immediately in an expansion to the eight--member Fortescue board, which also includes Dr \nForrest as -executive chairman, former chief executive Elizabeth Gaines as an executive director, British Olympic \nchampion Sebastian Coe and former CSIRO boss Larry Marshall.\nFortescue directors earned fees of at least $230,000 a year in the 2023 financial year, according to the company's \nlast annual report, plus additional fees for sitting on boardroom committees. Fortescue shares closed up 12c to \n$18.99 on Thursday.\nLoad-Date: August 1, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
