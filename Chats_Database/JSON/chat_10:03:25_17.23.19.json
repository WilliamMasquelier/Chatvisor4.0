Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1144 words\nHighlight: This week's Bulls N' Bears Runner of the Week is ... the ASX itself. The ASX 200 hit a record high of \n8083.7 points as the top end of town continued to flourish.\nBody\nGreen shoots and blue skies.\nCould it be that a difficult couple of years for small-cap companies are now starting to make their way - finally - into \nthe rear-vision mirror? Well, the signs are good, at least, after stock exchange highs emerged this week.\nThe ASX 200, for example, hit an all-time record of 8083.7 points during the week, largely on a growing expectation \nthat interest rate cuts are coming in the United States on the back of the Federal Reserve's optimism that inflation is \nreturning to target levels.\nThe big companies - such as the Commonwealth Bank, which hit a record share price high of $134.25 this week - \nhave been surfing the crest of the bull wave. Major banks, tech stocks and health care companies have also been \ndonning their boardies and bikinis for their time in the sun.\nSo, is it also now time for the small-caps to start lathering up with the Reef Oil? Many would be hoping that the \nmore-than-solid ASX runs for the four companies appearing in this edition of Bulls N' Bears Runners of the Week is \na sign of better times to come for those in the shallower end of the pool.\nThis week's Runners all centre around the red and yellow metals - for the uninitiated, that means copper and gold - \nwhich, like the ASX this week, are testing all-time highs. Traders cashing in on the pending US interest rate cuts \npumped the gold price to dizzying record levels of more than US$2480 (AU$3700) an ounce, while the global glut \nfor quality copper and copper assets continues as the red metal's price also remains near all-time highs.\nSo, to our Runners and taking out top spot this week is DGR Global, which enjoyed a sharp price hike of 290 per \ncent from a previous close of 1c, launching to a 3.9c high. The company surged in valuation on the strength of its \n6.6 per cent shareholding in TSX-listed copper-gold developer SolGold.\nLate Monday night, SolGold confirmed it had secured a US$750 million (AU$1120 million) funding package to \nprogress its tier-one Cascabel copper-gold project in northern Ecuador. The company claims the project is the \nbiggest undeveloped Latin American copper asset that is not in the hands of a major.\nThe operation has a mammoth measured and indicated resource of more than 19.1 million tonnes of copper \nequivalent.\nPage 2 of 3\nASX leads way to better market times ahead\nThe funding package from North American syndicate Franco Nevada and Osisko Royalties validates an estimated \nUS$3.2 billion (AU$4.78 billion) net present value (NPV) at an after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 24 per cent as \noutlined in SolGold's prefeasibility study (PFS) in March. Interestingly, the study is comprised of some conservative \nmetals prices for copper at US$3.85 (AU$5.75) per pound and gold at US$1750 (AU$2611) per ounce.\nThe syndicate has no doubt run some back-of-the-envelope calculations in its valuations, perhaps using the recent \nall-time price highs for copper and gold, which are more than 25 per cent and 40 per cent higher than those used in \nthe PFS, respectively.A close second placing this week goes to Labyrinth Resources, which jumped 280 per cent \nafter revealing its plan to acquire 100 per cent of two gold projects in Western Australia's Goldfields region. The \nwell-timed announcement, which saw the company's stock rise from a 0.5c close last week to 1.9c, coincided with \ngold hitting its record high.\nThe deal will see Labyrinth acquire Ramelius Resources' Vivien gold project and also affords it the option to \nacquire the remaining 49 per cent of its Comet Vale gold project.\nComet Vale, just 32km south of Menzies next to the Goldfields Highway, features a recently-updated mineral \nresource of 96,000 ounces at 4.8 grams per tonne gold. Labyrinth is aiming to bolster the high-grade resource \ninventory and capitalise on its new underexplored, high-grade mines.\nA 4.8g/t gold resource is nothing to poke a stick at by WA standards. Just last month, emerging Murchison major \nWestgold Resources penned a\"strategic alliance\" agreement with junior explorer Ora Gold to gain access to its \n240,000-ounce Crown Prince deposit that runs at an impressive 4.1g/t.\nLabyrinth has also raised $2 million through a placement and will present existing shareholders with an additional \n$2 million entitlement offer to support its endeavours to expand its high-grade resources and hopefully follow in \nOra's footsteps.\nTaking out bronze, a fitting alloy for a story with a majority copper flavour, is Miramar Resources. The company's \nshare price jumped almost 188 per cent - from 0.8c to 2.3c - after revelations of promising high-grade copper, lead \nand silver samples from its Joy Helen prospect within its new Chain Pool project in WA's Gascoyne region.\nThe project, while still not granted, shows plenty of potential after returning rock chip assays going up to 5.49 per \ncent copper, 42 per cent lead and 73.48g/t silver. Despite the impressive at-surface numbers, management says \nthe Joy Helen prospect has seen no modern and systematic exploration, nor drilling.\nThe mineralisation style is interpreted to be \"Mississippi Valley-type\" and shows some intriguing similarities to its \nneighbouring Abra lead-zinc-silver deposit that is also hosted in the Irregully rock formation.\nBut Miramar will be hoping this story doesn't turn out like that of Abra owner Galena Mining, which ran aground \nearlier this year with debts totalling some $160 million to international lenders because of a poor lead-zinc \nenvironment. Fortunately for Miramar, copper seems to be the ticket this week and maybe that's what Galena's \ndeposit was missing.\nOur final Runner for the week is Stelar Metals, which shot up more than 101 per cent this week on ... yep, you \nguessed it, copper rock chip samples.\nHigh-grade copper findings were sampled along a 3km strike at its Baratta project in South Australia, returning \ngrades of up to 28.7 per cent. It is a region Stelar says shows similarities to the prolific Central African Copper Belt \n(CACB) - the biggest and most prolific mineralised sediment-hosted copper province known on Earth.\nThe company reported 21 of the 72 samples exceeding grades of 10 per cent copper, underscoring the potential of \nthe historically-productive Baratta site featuring a mine that produced copper ore between 1896 and 1904.\nRather unfortunately for Stelar, the traditional owners in the Adnyamathanha native title organisation remains in \nadministration. The company says it will continue to monitor the native title situation and will lodge applications for \ndrilling at Baratta when the traditional owner organisation comes out of administration.Page 3 of 3\nASX leads way to better market times ahead\nIf copper is the flavour of the month, then it seems rock chip samples were this week's tipple of the week. Now, we'll \njust have to wait and see if the all-time highs for the index will overlap with a return of interest to the small end of \ntown.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

The shares will be exchanged on a one-for-four basis, giving Brightstar a circa 66.6 per cent \nownership of the combined entity.\nAs part of the deal, Canaccord Genuity and Argonaut will seek to raise about $20 million from investors, sources \nsaid.\nAlto's Sandstone project in Western Australia has been producing gold since the 19th century and has a 17.6 \nmillion tonne mineral resource estimate at 1.5 grams per tonne. It is next door to Westgold's Big Bell mine and \nRamelius' Mount Magnet. The small-cap had long been seen as a takeover target - the now $1.2 billion Westgold \nResources held a 14 per cent stake in 2022, while China's Shandong Goldsea Group Co tabled a bid in 2020.\nMerger partner Brightstar is led by Alex Rovira, who was previously a banker at Canaccord. It is drilling at the Cork \nTree Well deposit in WA's Laverton. Sources said the company has been hunting for acquisitions.\nThe tie-up comes as ASX-listed gold stocks remain a reliable source of M&A activity for bankers and investors, at a \ntime when deals have dried up in lithium and nickel amid a slump in commodity prices. Established gold players are \nbeing driven by a need to replace ageing mines, while juniors are exploring combinations to secure their future.\nAt the bigger end of the town, Westgold has acquired Toronto-listed Karora Resources - despite attempts from \nRamelius Resources to kibosh the deal. Earlier in the year, Red5 and Silver Lake agreed to a $2.2 billion merger.\nRamelius, for its part, has been scoping out targets. Recently it raided WA explorer Spartan Resources' register \nfor a 17.94 per cent stake after an unsuccessful tilt at Karora.\nLoad-Date: August 3, 2024\nPage 2 of 2\nBrightstar, Alto Metals agree to merge; kick off $20m raise Street Talk\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood, And Emma Rapaport\nDate: August 01, 2024\nTitle: Brightstar, Alto Metals agree to merge; kick off $20m raise Street Talk\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Big gains turn miners' eyes to M&A Returns\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Brad Thompson\n### Date: August 05, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nBig gains turn miners' eyes to M&A Returns\nBig gains turn miners' eyes to M&A; Returns\nAustralian Financial Review\nAugust 5, 2024 Monday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

We can expect it to continue to dominate \nthe M&A landscape, but not in isolation, with the gold industry bringing together regional asset portfolios and \nbuilding operational scale,\" he said.\nThe string of gold deals in the past 12 months has spanned Red 5 and Silverlake, Ramelius and Musgrave, \nEmerald and Bullseye, and Genesis and Dacian.\nWestgold completed its $2.5 billion merger with Toronto-listed Karora last week to create a mid-tier gold producer.\nMr Andrews said Ramelius, which has done seven deals in six years, was \"at it again\" grabbing a near 18 per cent \nstake in Spartan.\nPage 2 of 2\nBig gains turn miners' eyes to M&A Returns\nSpeaking after Ramelius released June quarter results last week, chief executive Mark Zeptner said his company \nwould take a wait and see approach on Spartan and its Never Never discovery.\n\"Whilst we'd like to have Never Never in our portfolio, we actually look at it as a nice to have, rather than a need to \nhave,\" he said at the time.\nRamelius' $87 million spending spree on Spartan stock came after revelations Ramelius had been in takeover \ntalks with Westgold late last year and that the two gold producers had agreed to a 12-month \"mutual standstill\".\nWestgold moved on through the Karora merger.
