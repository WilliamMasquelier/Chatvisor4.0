The company s single \nlargest order includes 360 autonomous battery-electric trucks, 55 electric excavators and 60 battery-powered \ndozers, it said.\n This deal is expected to create one of the world s largest zero emission mining fleets and represents a major \nbreakthrough in the pursuit of a mining industry no longer reliant on fossil fuels,  Fortescue said. The fleet will be \nused in Fortescue s iron ore operations in the remote Pilbara region in Western Australia and will cut costs in the \nlonger term while meeting its emission reduction goal.\nThe contract will help both companies meet their decarbonization targets, according to Fortescue. Liebherr and \nFortescue target to have a comprehensive and large scale zero emission mining ecosystem operational by 2030, \nthe Australian miner said.\n As part of the deal, Liebherr and Fortescue will deploy a complete autonomous battery-electric haulage solution \nfor large scale mining operations,  the statement said. The partners are also jointly developing a hydrogen-powered \nPage 2 of 2\nAustralian Billionaire Andrew Forrest s Fortescue To Spend $2.8 Billion To Electrify Mining Fleet\nheavy haul truck, dubbed  Europa,  which has recently made the 1,100-kilometer journey from Perth to the Pilbara \nregion where it will undergo site-testing at the mines.\nForrest, who founded Fortescue in 2003, has been transforming the iron ore giant into a green energy powerhouse \nand backs the development of hydrogen for fuel. With a networth of $15.3 billion that he shares with his family, \nForrest is the third-richest in Australia, according toForbes  real timedata.\n<figure>\n<figcaption>\nWilli Liebherr, member of the administrative board of Liebherr-International AG, and Andrew Forrest, executive \nchairman of Fortescue, sign Fortescue's $2.8 billion order of electric mining fleet from Liebherr,\nFortescue\n</figcaption></figure>\nLoad-Date: September 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
