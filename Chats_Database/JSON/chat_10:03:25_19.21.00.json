Pg. 16\nLength: 758 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nFortescue's sweeping restructure goes far beyond removing the duplication of back room functions between its \nenergy and mining arms, with a growing number of senior executives set to depart as the company sweeps out \nlayers of management.\nThe cost-cutting comes as the iron ore price dipped below $US100 a tonne this week in the wake of market \ndisappointment that a major Chinese Communist Party policy meeting, the third plenum, failed to deliver major \nstimulus packages that might help kickstart the country's ailing construction sector.\nFortescue said last week that it will finalise its restructuring package by the end of the month, with as many as 700 \nstaff set to depart.\nThat process is still ongoing, the company said on Wednesday, and some staff initially slated for departure may still \nbe offered -alternative roles.\n\"As we announced last week, as part of our transition to a One Fortescue model we are simplifying and \nstreamlining our structure, removing roles from all levels of the organisation, to ensure we are lean, impactful and \ncan move quickly to seize opportunities,\" the company said.\nBut The Australian understands several senior executives are likely to depart the company, including the director of \ninnovation and technology - and formerly head of strategy - John Paul Olivier.\nSources say that Fortescue's boss of its Chichester mining hub, Jay Natesan, is also set to depart the company \nafter Fortescue re-established the role of chief operating officer to oversee its mining operations, handing the \nposition to former Mineral Resources executive Shelley Robertson.\nAlso slated to depart, sources say, are global health and safety boss Zara Fisher, and the general manager of the \ncompany's remote operations centre.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue looks to shed exec layers\nFortescue said last week the -restructure was largely aimed at ending the duplication of human resources, finance \nand other support roles such as communications between its green energy and mining arms - as well as \"the \nsimplification of its structure to ensure it remains lean, impactful and agile\".\nBut The Australian understands that that simplification will include sweeping away a large section of its middle \nmanagement, with the company looking to reduce the number of roles at general manager level or above from \nabout 130, down to about 40.\nFortescue is set to deliver its -financial year production figures on Thursday, amid widespread expectations the \ncompany will miss the 192 million-tonne bottom end of its annual production guidance, with consensus expectations \nsuggesting the company will only barely break the 190 million-tonne mark.\nIf realised, the production slip would come as pricing for For-tescue's lower-grade ores comes under greater \npressure, analysts say, amid expectations the slowdown in the Chinese steel industry will translate into lower iron \nore pricing.\nThat has traditionally translated into a widening gap between pricing for higher-grade product and lower-grade ores \n- such as those exported by Fortescue.\nRio Tinto noted in its June quarter production report on Tuesday that signs of a flight to quality had emerged in the \nperiod, with premiums for lump ore rising and the differential between ore grades pricing widening.\nFortescue chairman Andrew Forrest has rejected any suggestion that the restructure represents a backdown on \nthe com-pany's strategy of expanding into the delivery of green energy, and Macquarie analysts noted last week \nthat Fortescue's share price had broken free of its traditional link to the iron ore price, suggesting that the market \nwas valuing its green ambitions at about $4.70 a share.\n\"Whilst positive for earnings and free-cash flow, we recognise the short-term sugar hit to dividend yields may be \nreceived well by investors looking to harvest fully franked returns,\" Macquarie analysts said in a client note.\n\"However, ETFs seeking hydrogen exposure, or 'long onlys' with strong energy transition mandates may seek to \nreduce -positions on these developments and a slowing of Fortescue's -external green energy business trajectory.\" \nA sharp iron ore price fall beneath $US100 a tonne would dent Fortescue's returns, but not its -viability. Macquarie \nestimates Fortescue's break even price at about $US40 a tonne - lower than that of BHP at about $US32 and Rio \nat about $US35.\n\"Fortescue has addressed market downturns in the past with a focus on cost and flexibility. With the recent \nSimandou approval and a higher break-even vs peers, FMG's premium may come under pressure,\" Macquarie \nanalysts said. Fortescue shares closed up 11c on Wednesday at $21.32.\nLoad-Date: July 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue chairman | \"Fortescue has addressed market downturns in the past with a focus on cost and flexibility.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
