While that predictive capability has \nbeen developing for some time, the company also plans to launch more capabilities that make use of generative AI \nto simplify their software and make it easier for people without technical training to operate the tools.\nSplunk, launched in 2003, developed a dashboard that allows users to search, monitor and analyse machine-\ngenerated data. It takes training to use it and generative AI helps reduce the learning curve, according to Mr Steele. \n\"Splunk has its own proprietary language, the way in which you issue commands, and you have to be reasonably \ntechnical to do that,\" he said.\n\"With the AI assistance that we've launched, you can use English language to automatically generate that \nproprietary language. You can get outcomes without having all the advanced knowledge.\" Splunk's AI would benefit \nfrom Cisco's massive amounts of data, not to mention its global presence and sales and marketing channels, Mr \nSteele said.\nGenerative AI will have other applications across Cisco's business, such as simplifying the complex task of setting \na configuration screen for a company's security policy, according to Mr Robbins. \"It's very technical. We're going to \nenable our customers to just use English language to describe what security capabilities they would like \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and \nthen we will translate that into a policy that they would review,\" he said.\nPage 2 of 2\nCisco finalises $42bn Splunk buy\nThe software will function as an assistant, simplifying and speeding up the deployment of security policy and other \nresources without replacing human operators, according to Mr Robbins.\nWhen the deal was announced in September 2023, the companies said it expected it to be completed by the end of \nSeptember 2024. The process was completed in roughly half a year. Last week, the European Union gave the deal \nunconditional antitrust approval, after regulators found it wouldn't pose barriers to competition. Networking \nequipment pioneer Cisco, founded in 1984, rode the telecommunications boom of the 1990s. It was for a time the \nmost valuable company in the world.\nLoad-Date: March 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Cisco finalises $42bn Splunk buy\n## The Australian\n### Stephen Rosenbush\n### March 20, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Cisco, to report.

Cisco Systems has successfully completed its $28 billion (approximately $42.8 billion AUD) acquisition of Splunk, marking the largest deal in Cisco's history and reflecting a significant shift towards data and AI integration in business operations.\n\n2. The merger aims to leverage AI capabilities to enhance cybersecurity by enabling customers to draw predictive insights from data across various vendor platforms, indicating a strategic focus on advanced analytics in the digital communications sector.\n\n3. Generative AI will play a crucial role in simplifying the use of Splunk's tools, allowing users to interact with the software using natural language instead of requiring technical expertise, which could broaden the user base and improve accessibility.\n\n4. Cisco plans to utilize generative AI not only for Splunk but across its entire business, aiming to streamline complex tasks such as configuring security policies, thereby enhancing operational efficiency and customer experience.\n\n5. The acquisition received unconditional antitrust approval from the European Union, suggesting that regulatory bodies view the merger as beneficial for competition, which may bolster Cisco's market position in the digital communications technology landscape.",
