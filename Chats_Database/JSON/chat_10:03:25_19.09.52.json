Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 535 words\nHighlight: The Yindjibarndi people chasing Fortescue for $500 million compensation now want the independent \nenvironment regulator to consider tightening the regulation of the high-grade Solomon mine.\nBody\nThe Yindjibarndi people of WA's Pilbara have opened another front in their war with Andrew Forrest's Fortescue, \ncalling for the WA government to impose tougher conditions on the miner to protect their cultural heritage and the \nenvironment.\nMichael Woodley, chief executive of the Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation said Fortescue's 400 square \nkilometres Solomon iron ore mine had destroyed or damaged 249 indigenous heritage sites and operated under \nmore lenient conditions than more recently approved similar mines.\n\"Our community not only endures poor environmental and cultural management, which is a source of ongoing hurt \nand distress, but out native title rights and interests have also been disrespected,\" he said.\nLink to Image\nComposite image\nFortescue received environmental approval from the WA government to develop the Solomon mine in 2011.\nWoodley said Fortescue's own Eliwana mine, approved in 2019 and Sanjiv Ridge operated by Gina Rinehart's \nAtlas Iron both had stricter requirements than Solomon.\nIn December 2023 YNAC made a detailed submission to environment minster Reece Whitby, calling on him to \nrequest the independent Environmental Protection Authority to investigate if the regulation of Solomon was \nadequate.\nYNAC wants Fortescue to be required to protect cultural heritage at Solomon and adequately consult the \nYindjibarndi.\nIt is also concerned about reduced flows into nearby creeks caused by water use at Solomon and a Fortescue \napplication to increase its use of groundwater and whether there has been any use of toxic forever chemical PFAS \nthat may have contaminated the water supply.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest's Indigenous foes call for inquiry into Fortescue mining\nWoodley said the only way to resolve the concerns was for Whitby to approve an EPA review. Whitby's office \ndeclined to comment.\nFortescue was asked if it would support changes to the conditions governing its mining at Solomon to match those \nimposed on other Pilbara iron ore mines more recently.\nA Fortescue spokeswoman said the miner takes its responsibilities to protect cultural heritage seriously and is at all \ntimes compliant with WA legislation.\n\"We have strong relationships with the First Nations people of the Pilbara ... built on open and transparent \nengagement,\" she said.\nYNAC fought Fortescue in the courts for years to establish its people had the native title right of exclusive \npossession over the area of the Solomon iron ore Fortescue has worked since 2013.\nThe battle ended in 2020 when the High Court dismissed Fortescue's application to appeal to Australia's highest \ncourt, exposing the $77 billion company to compensation claims from the Yindjibarndi for mining their land without \ntheir agreement.\nHearings for the Federal Court case on the Yindjibarndi $500 million compensation case started in August 2023 \nwith at Roebourne's Fifty Cent Hall where 15 years before negotiations between Forrest and Woodley about the \ndevelopment of Solomon failed to reach agreement.\nThe case is continuing, with further expert evidence expected later this year, followed by closing arguments in early \n2025 and a decision, perhaps, later that year.\nStart the day with a summary of the day's most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. \nSign up for our Morning Edition newsletter.\nGraphic\n \nFortescue chair Andrew Forrest and Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation chief executive Michael Woodley.\nLoad-Date: June 23, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
