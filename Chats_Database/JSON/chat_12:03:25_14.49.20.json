In all, Victoria sees potential for 13GW of offshore \nwind capacity by 2050, five times the current renewable generation in Victoria.\nThe target drew a plethora of some of the world's largest global energy companies to apply for a so-called feasibility \nlicence, and Shell was understood to have been informed late last year that it was in line to secure a permit should \nit overcome a boundary dispute.\nUntangling the dispute was seen as inevitable, but Shell determined it would not proceed with its initial application \nas it delivers on chief executive's Wael Sawan's commitment to be \"ruthless\" in focusing on financial performance. \nA Shell spokeswoman confirmed the decision, but said: \"Australia's abundant offshore wind resources have strong \npotential to help Australia achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and Shell (has) confidence in the establishment of a \nsustainable Australian offshore wind industry.\"\nLoad-Date: May 29, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Shell takes wind out of sales\n## The Daily Telegraph (Australia)\n### Colin Packham\n### May 30, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Shell, to report.

Shell has decided to abandon its plans for an offshore wind project in Victoria, marking a significant retreat from the state's renewable energy ambitions and raising concerns about the future of the offshore wind industry in the region.\n\n2. This decision is indicative of Shell's broader strategy to focus on less capital-intensive energy projects, aligning with CEO Wael Sawan's commitment to prioritize financial performance over ambitious renewable initiatives.\n\n3. Victoria has set aggressive targets for offshore wind energy, aiming for 20% of its energy needs from this source by 2032, but Shell's withdrawal may hinder progress towards these goals and diminish investor confidence in the sector.\n\n4. Despite shelving the project, Shell acknowledges the potential of Australia's offshore wind resources to contribute to net zero emissions by 2050, suggesting a complex relationship between the company's immediate business decisions and long-term sustainability goals.",
