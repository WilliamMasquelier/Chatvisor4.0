How would Australia compete against the US, Canada, \nChina and other countries that are aspiring to be global leaders in green manufacturing? \"By getting on with it,\" \nreplied the Prime Minister. Some 20 months later, the question remains unanswered: Getting on with what?\nThe two examples of promising green businesses the PM cited on that day have hardly stood the test of time. Sun \nCable, Mike Cannon-Brookes's proposal to build the world's largest solar farm and link it by an undersea cable to \nSingapore, seems less likely to come to fruition than Clive Palmer's plan to rebuild the Titanic. As for Tritium, the \nAustralian company that promised to build the world's fastest electric vehicle chargers in southeast Queensland, the \nless said the better. Tritium's future won't be built in Australia. It will be built in Tennessee, where the company has \nreceived generous assistance from President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, securing a sweetheart deal to \nbuild a giant manufacturing plant.\nThe $15bn National Reconstruction Fund Albanese promised would kickstart the industries of the future has been in \nplace for well over a year but has yet to issue a single grant.\nThe PM plans to break the impasse with the National Reconstruction Fund 2.0, optimistically named the Future \nMade in Australia Act. Underpinning the government's green superpower ambition is a breathtaking complacency \nthat assumes Australia's natural advantages in the fossil fuel-based economy can be seamlessly swapped out for \nascendancy in the brave new carbon-free world. They cannot be. Our primacy in resources was based on merely \nhaving stuff. Green manufacturing is about making stuff, which is a different game altogether.\nThe Albanese government has placed a speculative bet on green hydrogen as the key to our export success. It \nmakes the fatuous claim that Australia has an abundance of sunshine that can be turned into cheap renewable \nenergy.\nPage 2 of 3\nPM's subsidy crusade stirs ghosts of Labor's past\nIn October 2022, Energy Minister Chris Bowen announced a $13.7m grant to Andrew Forrest's company, \nFortescue Future Industries, to scope the construction of a 500MW electrolyser at Gibson Island near Brisbane. \nBowen described the project's success as \"critical\" to Australia'a ambition to be a green energy superpower.\nLast month, Fortescue boss Mark Hutchinson reinforced the project's importance, describing it as \"a litmus test for \nthe rest of the hydrogen industry in Australia\". Yet when Fortescue announced financial approval for a string of \ngreen hydrogen projects at the end of last year, Gibson Island was not one of them. \"We've been working very, very \nhard on it,\" Hutchinson told The Australian Financial Review Business Summit last month. \"But it's tough based on \nthe current power prices when we're looking at competing globally.\" To judge from Fortescue's investment portfolio \nright now, the future may be built in Norway, northern Patagonia, Brazil and British Columbia before it is built in \nAustralia. It may even be built in Kenya and Congo. The future is already being built in Buckeye, Arizona, where \nFortescue is investing $US500m ($765m) in a green hydrogen plant it says will be up and running by 2026.\nIt turns out abundant sun was not such a competitive advantage in the manufacture of green hydrogen. Low taxes, \nfiscally responsible government and cheap and reliable carbon-free energy are far more appealing drawcards for \ninvestors.\nIn 2023, manufacturing in Arizona grew faster than in any other state. It includes energy and water-intensive \nindustries such as silicon chip manufacturing, with Arizona coming from nowhere to fourth place among US states. \nApologists for the Albanese government might look for excuses in the global subsidy arms race unleashed by the \nBiden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. They might claim Arizona has easy access to a much bigger market.\nYet Arizona's hi-tech manufacturing boom started before Biden came to power and came at the expense of \nneighbouring California, where manufacturing is declining.\nIt isn't hard to work out why. Arizona's top state income tax rate is 2.98 per cent. California's is 13.3 per cent. \nCorporate tax in Arizona is 6.96 per cent compared to 8.84 per cent in California. For energy-hungry industries such \nas hydrogen and the IT sector, however, the biggest attraction is the industrial electricity price: 7.47 cents a kWh in \nArizona compared to 18 cents in California.\nAlbanese continues to talk a big game, promising jobs, industry and prosperity will flourish under the Future Made \nin Australia Act. Details are scarce, but the PM told ABC's 7.30 this month there would be new government \nprograms attached to the Act, as well as a recalibration of old ones.\nYet the long history of manufacturing decline in the past 50 years is a story of broken promises and failed industry \nwelfare programs. The Hawke government's generosity in granting $36m to the Kodak film factory in Victoria in \n1988 (roughly $100m in today's money) failed to stop the introduction of digital cameras or development of the \nsmartphone. Hundreds of millions of dollars thrown at the car industry failed to save the Holden Commodore. \nIndeed, evidence that industry assistance programs work as intended is difficult to find.\nIt's more than three decades since Bob Hawke's Labor government eschewed industry protectionism as a means to \nmake Australia globally competitive. Yet governments, state and federal, of both political persuasions, have found it \ndifficult to go cold turkey. The federal government's guide to grants lists 330 different types of industry assistance. \nIn 2019, the last year before Covid-19, the Productivity Commission calculated total government assistance to \nbusinesses at $13.9bn in tariff assistance, tax concessions and direct grants.\nThat is why we can say with some certainty that more government grants are no substitute for the economic \ndiscipline practised by the Republican administrations of governors Jan Brewer and Doug Ducey or the far-sighted \ndecision of the Arizona government in the 1980s in overseeing the construction of the second-largest nuclear \nreactor in the US. The 3.9GW Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station remains the backbone of the Arizona \nelectricity grid, producing some of the cheapest power in the country.\nAlbanese is hardly the first prime minister to enter office who has failed to learn from King Canute, instead suffering \nfrom the delusion that getting your hand on the levers of state gives you the power to alter the tides. The outgoing \ntide of deindustrialisation shows no sign of abating.
