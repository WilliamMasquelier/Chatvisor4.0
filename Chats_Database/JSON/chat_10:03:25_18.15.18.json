[Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has never had an Indigenous land use agreement with the Yindjibarndi people, despite mining on their land for over a decade, leading to a $500 million compensation claim for unpaid royalties, interest, and damages for cultural and spiritual losses, which could result in a significant financial and reputational impact on the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued in court that compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should not be based on the value of the minerals extracted from their land, despite industry standards where native title holders receive a percentage of royalties, raising concerns about the company's approach to Indigenous compensation. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest held private meetings in a Perth park with Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation leader Michael Woodley in an attempt to settle a billion-dollar compensation case, but the talks failed as the parties remain hundreds of millions of dollars apart, highlighting the ongoing dispute and lack of resolution. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue is facing a potential $1 billion compensation claim from the Yindjibarndi people, including $500 million for economic losses and an additional $500 million for the destruction of more than 240 culturally significant sites, which could have major financial and reputational consequences for the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue was left exposed to the Yindjibarndi compensation claim in 2020 after the High Court denied the company special leave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings, which found that a large part of its Solomon iron ore mining hub was built without permission from traditional owners, raising legal and ethical concerns about its operations. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued that any compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should be funded by the State of Western Australia because it granted the mining tenements, but the WA government maintains that Fortescue should pay, creating further uncertainty over the company's financial liability. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Institutional investors are increasingly avoiding Fortescue, making it the least-held stock among the 10 largest companies on the ASX, with concerns over its lower iron ore grades, high executive turnover, and heavy spending on unprofitable green hydrogen projects. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been ranked as the \"least-loved\" stock among major Australian companies in a JPMorgan survey of 50 fund managers, reflecting ongoing skepticism about its business strategy and financial stability. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Analysts and brokers have been bearish on Fortescue for an extended period, with most maintaining a sell rating on the stock since November 2022, in contrast to competitors BHP and Rio Tinto, which have never held a majority sell rating since at least 2009. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue lost its final buy rating in January after JPMorgan's head of Australian resources advised investors to take profits, with the stock subsequently falling more than 10% from its peak in early February, raising concerns about its valuation and future performance. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's unconventional management style under Andrew Forrest has left the investment community baffled, with concerns that the company's entrepreneurial approach lacks the structured management seen in competitors like BHP and Rio Tinto. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been criticized for its approach to Indigenous compensation, with an expert witness arguing in court that the company\u2019s attempt to exclude the value of minerals from compensation calculations is \"nonsensical\" and unfair to the Yindjibarndi people. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue began mining at the Solomon hub in 2013 without an agreement from the Yindjibarndi\u2019s registered native title body and instead dealt with a breakaway group, raising ethical concerns about its treatment of traditional owners. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has slammed the Biden administration\u2019s proposed hydrogen incentive rules, arguing that they could triple the cost of low-carbon hydrogen projects and stifle growth in the sector, potentially impacting the company\u2019s green energy ambitions.

It now has three electric excavators operating and says converting its entire excavator fleet to electric will \ncut diesel use by 95 million litres every year.\nThe miner's iron ore shipments slowed over three months to March, down six per cent to 43.3 million tonnes due to \na derailment late in December and weather disruptions in January and February, Fortescue Metals chief Dino \nOtranto said in a quarterly update on Wednesday.\nHowever, he said shipments hit a record level in March as the company focused on recovering its output.

The slip in exports also pushed up \naverage C1 cash costs by 7 per cent, to $US18.93 a tonne.\nAnd, while Fortescue said it still expected to meet its annual export guidance, the company said it would probably \ncome in -towards the bottom of its 192-197 million-tonne range.\nBut the company will need a heroic performance to meet even that expectation, needing to export 53.5 million \ntonnes in the June quarter, given it has only shipped 138.5 million tonnes in the first half of the financial year.\nFortescue Metals CEO Dino Otranto said Fortescue was confident it could hit that rate, despite needing to ship at \nnear record rates of about 18 million tonnes a month for the June quarter, after shipping 18.7 million tonnes in \nMarch.\n\"You can hold a lot of confidence in the performance that we've had over the last six weeks - March was an all-time \nrecord. So we're looking pretty good for the remainder of this quarter,\" Mr Otranto said.\nFortescue again downgraded expectations from its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project, saying it now only \nexpected to ship 2 million tonnes of high-grade concentrate from the massive mine and processing operations, \ndown from previous - and already substantially revised - guidance of 2-4 million tonnes.\nThe company shipped only 500,000 tonnes of concentrate from Iron Bridge in the March quarter as it struggles with \nwater supply to the operation. Fortescue is spending about $US100m ($140m) to fix flaws in the water pipeline, \nwhich is leaking in high-pressure sections.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue confident on export guidance\nThe Iron Bridge processing plant is water-hungry as it grinds hard magnetite ore into a fine paste, before separating \niron from waste rock using revolving magnetic drums. When running at its full rate, Iron Bridge will need 20 \ngigalitres of water a year to support its full production rate of 22 million tonnes of concentrate.\nMr Otranto blamed the pipeline issue on quality control issues with a 65km section of the pipeline that now leaks \nunder pressure.\nHe said Fortescue had elected to replace the pipeline section, but declined to comment on whether Fortescue \nwould be able to make an insurance claim for the replacement work or business interruption, or the status of any \nlegal claims against the manufacturer.\nMr Otranto said Fortescue expected to be able to replace the pipeline this year, and said he was confident the \ncompany would still be able to ramp Iron Bridge up to its nameplate capacity by September next year, as previously \nforecast.\n\"All our focus is on getting the water supply back. And our September quarter 2025 guidance that we gave before is \nstill unchanged,\" he said.\n\"However, it does depend on getting that water solution in play. \"The good news is that we've been able to identify \nsome other source of water - we're using our tailings facility to store some of the downpour that we have seen.\" \nFortescue also cut its capital spending guidance by $US300m-$US500m for the current financial year for its metals \ngroup, to $US2.5bn-$US2.7bn, and cut capital spending forecasts for its energy division by $US100m to $US700m. \nFortescue shares closed up 16c at $24.76 on Wednesday.\nLoad-Date: April 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Nick Evans\nDate: April 25, 2024\nTitle: Fortescue confident on export guidance\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Iron ore giant needs to hustle\n## Media outlet: The Daily Telegraph\n### Author: Nick Evans\n### Date: April 25, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 1\nIron ore giant needs to hustle\nIron ore giant needs to hustle\nThe Daily Telegraph (Australia)\nApril 25, 2024 Thursday\nTelegraph Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 24\nLength: 229 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nFortescue will need to maintain close to record export rates to hit its full-year shipment guidance, and its troubled \nIron Bridge magnetite project has registered yet another production downgrade.\nFortescue has revealed the full effect of a derailment at its Pilbara iron ore operations, saying iron ore exports had \nslipped 6 per cent as a result of the outage at its rail line.\nThe company exported 43.3 million tonnes for the March quarter, down from 46.3 million tonnes for the same period \nin 2023, and down 11 per cent from the three months to the end of December.

How would Australia compete against the US, Canada, \nChina and other countries that are aspiring to be global leaders in green manufacturing? \"By getting on with it,\" \nreplied the Prime Minister. Some 20 months later, the question remains unanswered: Getting on with what?\nThe two examples of promising green businesses the PM cited on that day have hardly stood the test of time. Sun \nCable, Mike Cannon-Brookes's proposal to build the world's largest solar farm and link it by an undersea cable to \nSingapore, seems less likely to come to fruition than Clive Palmer's plan to rebuild the Titanic. As for Tritium, the \nAustralian company that promised to build the world's fastest electric vehicle chargers in southeast Queensland, the \nless said the better. Tritium's future won't be built in Australia. It will be built in Tennessee, where the company has \nreceived generous assistance from President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, securing a sweetheart deal to \nbuild a giant manufacturing plant.\nThe $15bn National Reconstruction Fund Albanese promised would kickstart the industries of the future has been in \nplace for well over a year but has yet to issue a single grant.\nThe PM plans to break the impasse with the National Reconstruction Fund 2.0, optimistically named the Future \nMade in Australia Act. Underpinning the government's green superpower ambition is a breathtaking complacency \nthat assumes Australia's natural advantages in the fossil fuel-based economy can be seamlessly swapped out for \nascendancy in the brave new carbon-free world. They cannot be. Our primacy in resources was based on merely \nhaving stuff. Green manufacturing is about making stuff, which is a different game altogether.\nThe Albanese government has placed a speculative bet on green hydrogen as the key to our export success. It \nmakes the fatuous claim that Australia has an abundance of sunshine that can be turned into cheap renewable \nenergy.\nPage 2 of 3\nPM's subsidy crusade stirs ghosts of Labor's past\nIn October 2022, Energy Minister Chris Bowen announced a $13.7m grant to Andrew Forrest's company, \nFortescue Future Industries, to scope the construction of a 500MW electrolyser at Gibson Island near Brisbane. \nBowen described the project's success as \"critical\" to Australia'a ambition to be a green energy superpower.\nLast month, Fortescue boss Mark Hutchinson reinforced the project's importance, describing it as \"a litmus test for \nthe rest of the hydrogen industry in Australia\". Yet when Fortescue announced financial approval for a string of \ngreen hydrogen projects at the end of last year, Gibson Island was not one of them. \"We've been working very, very \nhard on it,\" Hutchinson told The Australian Financial Review Business Summit last month. \"But it's tough based on \nthe current power prices when we're looking at competing globally.\" To judge from Fortescue's investment portfolio \nright now, the future may be built in Norway, northern Patagonia, Brazil and British Columbia before it is built in \nAustralia. It may even be built in Kenya and Congo. The future is already being built in Buckeye, Arizona, where \nFortescue is investing $US500m ($765m) in a green hydrogen plant it says will be up and running by 2026.\nIt turns out abundant sun was not such a competitive advantage in the manufacture of green hydrogen.",
