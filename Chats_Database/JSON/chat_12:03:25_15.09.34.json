Your output should only consist of that one sentence.\nThis one sentence should highlight the main topic or theme of the article from the perspective of Cisco. We are interested about what is said on Cisco in the article and on this overall topic or industry: digital communications technology in the Australia market.\n\nHere is the article: Page 1 of 2\nCisco finalises $42bn Splunk buy\nCisco finalises $42bn Splunk buy\nThe Australian\nMarch 20, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: WSJ; Pg. 21\nLength: 480 words\nByline: Stephen Rosenbush\nBody\nCisco Systems has completed its $US28bn ($42.8bn) all-cash acquisition of cyber security and analytics company \nSplunk.\nThe deal, the largest in Cisco's history, was closed months earlier than projected, reflecting the extraordinary effort \nmany companies are undertaking as they remake their businesses around data and artificial intelligence.\nCisco chief executive Chuck Robbins and former Splunk CEO Gary Steele - now an executive vice-president at \nCisco - said in an interview that AI would be deeply woven into the combined companies, and that they saw no hint \nthat the current wave of business AI adoption was going to slow down or reverse course.\nThe combined company will use AI to help customers draw correlations in intelligence coming from different vendor \nplatforms, so that they can take a more predictive approach to cyber security. While that predictive capability has \nbeen developing for some time, the company also plans to launch more capabilities that make use of generative AI \nto simplify their software and make it easier for people without technical training to operate the tools.\nSplunk, launched in 2003, developed a dashboard that allows users to search, monitor and analyse machine-\ngenerated data. It takes training to use it and generative AI helps reduce the learning curve, according to Mr Steele. \n\"Splunk has its own proprietary language, the way in which you issue commands, and you have to be reasonably \ntechnical to do that,\" he said.\n\"With the AI assistance that we've launched, you can use English language to automatically generate that \nproprietary language. You can get outcomes without having all the advanced knowledge.\" Splunk's AI would benefit \nfrom Cisco's massive amounts of data, not to mention its global presence and sales and marketing channels, Mr \nSteele said.\nGenerative AI will have other applications across Cisco's business, such as simplifying the complex task of setting \na configuration screen for a company's security policy, according to Mr Robbins. \"It's very technical. We're going to \nenable our customers to just use English language to describe what security capabilities they would like \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and \nthen we will translate that into a policy that they would review,\" he said.\nPage 2 of 2\nCisco finalises $42bn Splunk buy\nThe software will function as an assistant, simplifying and speeding up the deployment of security policy and other \nresources without replacing human operators, according to Mr Robbins.\nWhen the deal was announced in September 2023, the companies said it expected it to be completed by the end of \nSeptember 2024. The process was completed in roughly half a year. Last week, the European Union gave the deal \nunconditional antitrust approval, after regulators found it wouldn't pose barriers to competition. Networking \nequipment pioneer Cisco, founded in 1984, rode the telecommunications boom of the 1990s. It was for a time the \nmost valuable company in the world.\nLoad-Date: March 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n            ",

These projects have been issued more than 840,000 carbon credits since 2013. Dozens of other polluters \nhave registered carbon projects, including Santos, Inpex and Tokyo Gas Australia.\nA spokesperson for Woodside said its carbon business was established in 2018 to \"better manage the cost and \nintegrity of our carbon credits\" and it was \"open to considering an investment in a carbon developer but is pleased \nwith our carbon business's capability today\".\n\"Woodside's priority is avoiding and reducing emissions,\" the spokesperson said.\nHowever, Woodside's decarbonisation strategy has been routinely rejected by investors as undermining \ninternational climate agreements. A historic 58 per cent of shareholders voted against the plan in April over \nconcerns the company was expanding gas projects, relying too heavily on offsets and failing to cut key emissions.\nInternational conglomerates are also players in the local carbon market. Mitsubishi bought a 40 per cent stake in \nAustralian Integrated Carbon in 2021, and Mitsui invested in Climate Friendly in 2022.\nA former staff member at Climate Friendly, who declined to be named because they feared retribution, quit last year \nafter becoming uncomfortable with the influence of Mitsui and private equity firm Adamantem.\n\"The shift went from mum and dad farmers, helping those people into the scheme, to maximising profits for \nshareholders ... How do we grow the business to make sure Adamantem are happy?\"\nThe staff member questioned the company's leadership about the new investors and was told Mitsui helped Climate \nFriendly by establishing connections with fossil fuel industry customers, both in Australia and abroad.\n\"What does Climate Friendly get out of it? It's the relationships,\" they said. \"Within the industry, you need to know \nwho is buying and selling. To sell that volume of ACCUs you need the relationship. It was millions of dollars of \ntrades.\"\nThe employee said these relationships paid off and there was an unprecedented rise in Climate Friendly's trading \nvolumes after the Mitsui investment.Page 3 of 4\n'Perverse': Woodside, Shell spend millions getting into offset game\n\"The trades were massive, like nothing we had seen before ... That's fine for a one-off, then it started happening \nmore frequently. And I was like: 'Is this going be the trajectory of the business?'\"\nClimate Friendly co-executive officers Skye Glenday and Josh Harris released a joint statement saying the \ncompany's purpose had not changed from \"profit-for-purpose\" and \"tackling climate change\" through supporting \ncarbon farming.\nThey said Adamantem's investment had allowed staff to increase from 30 to 100 people and \"scale up our positive \nclimate change impacts\" and said Mitsui had a \"strong decarbonisation plan\" that had no influence on the company \nstrategy.\n\"Our driving purpose is to decarbonise Australia's land sector, which is responsible for about 20 per cent of the \nnation's greenhouse gas emissions,\" they said in a joint statement.\n \"Our staff are clear on Climate Friendly's purpose and mission, and are united by the urgent need to scale up \ncarbon farming in line with the International Panel on Climate Change's call for the world to rapidly expand carbon \nsequestration.\" \nThis masthead can also reveal the Australian Academy of Sciences (AAS) raised concerns with the CER in 2022 \nthat the $4.5 billion taxpayer-backed Emissions Reduction Fund had become too focused on supporting the \ngrowing carbon industry rather than abating emissions.\n\"Over the decade of the [Emissions Reduction Fund] operation, the scheme has become less of a climate policy \ninstrument and more of an industry policy mechanism,\" according to an internal CER email obtained by this \nmasthead under freedom of information summarising \"key take-outs\" from the Academy's review.\n\"There is a need to reinforce that the ACCU [Australian Carbon Credit Unit] scheme is fundamentally for the \nremoval, and avoidance, of greenhouse gas emissions.\"\nThe scientists identified \"several concerns or limitations\" with two of the most common methods, avoided \ndeforestation and human-induced regeneration (HIR), which rely on \"counterfactuals\" and unreliable data that \nmakes the scheme \"vulnerable to integrity accusations\" and \"accusations of doing little to prevent carbon leakage\".\nKillin said these projects dominate the market because they were cheap to run, reducing costs for polluters while \nboosting profits for the carbon \"gatekeepers\" that own most projects and make money from trading credits.\n\"We've got a cartel running the industry in Australia,\" said Killin. \"We've had fossil fuel companies running climate \npolicy in this country for decades. Carbon is no different.\"\nIn an unpublished submission to the Chubb review, Killin said barriers to entry and poor policy had made it \n\"excruciatingly painful\" to run small-scale projects that use robust methods, such as tree planting and savannah \nburning. He called for carbon companies to split up and for fossil fuel investment in supply to be banned.\n\"I am a well-informed industry insider who knows how the market really runs, rather than the 'sweetness and light' \nthat are regularly portrayed to the public,\" the submission states.\n\"We need real carbon abatement policy and actual carbon market development that encourages direct participation \nand minimises intermediary benefits.\"\nKillin called for a \"complete overhaul\" to address the \"market failure\" where vested interests had suppressed the \nprice of carbon and resulted in low transparency for participants and poor quality projects.\n\"All of this has conspired to create a cosy 'Carbon Club' in Australia. Voices of dissent and other internal criticism \nthat do not fit the industry's vacuous view of itself are ignored repeatedly,\" he said.Page 4 of 4\n'Perverse': Woodside, Shell spend millions getting into offset game\nKillin was critical of government interventions to reduce the cost of carbon credits, pointing to the government's \n\"cost containment\" policy that caps credits at $70 for companies captured by the safeguard mechanism, when \nrobust tree planting projects can cost up to $100 per credit.\n\"It's not a real market. If there is high demand, the price should go up. But every time the price goes up, the \ngovernment intervenes to bring the price down,\" he said. \"The polluters should be made to pay.\"\nUniversity of Sydney chair of political economy Dr Gareth Bryant said governments globally had intervened in \ncarbon offset markets because high prices were \"political poison\".\nBryant said the \"elegant economic reasoning\" of market-based emissions reduction always came second to \nindustry interests, and politicians were quick to \"carve out special consideration policies\" to avoid hurting fossil fuel \nprofits.\n\"That's the contradiction of carbon offsetting. Attempts to create a profitable industry around carbon offsetting are \nalways coming up against interests which see carbon offsets as a get out of jail free card for the fossil fuel industry. \nIn that battle, usually it's the fossil fuel industry that has won, globally.\"\nClimate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen declined an interview request and did not answer detailed \nquestions on record, but a spokesperson highlighted the government's increased and legislated emissions \nreduction target, and said the safeguard mechanism and renewable energy plan meant Australia was \"now on track \nfor at least 42 per cent emissions reduction by 2030\".\nGraphic\n \nDaryl Killin is speaking publicly to improve the carbon offsets market.\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should solely be one of these three words based on your assessment: \"Positive\", \"Neutral\", or \"Negative\".
