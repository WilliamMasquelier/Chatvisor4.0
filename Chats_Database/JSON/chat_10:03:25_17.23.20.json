Some sidestep the event, instead using the build-up as an \nopportunity to schedule meetings in Perth, but it still attracts over 2000 delegates.\nLithium miners stole the show last year. Producers of the battery material were in favour because of the expected \nramp-up in electric vehicle manufacturing. But the lithium price has come off the boil while gold is striking record \nhighs.\n\"If you went back last year or the year before, what was remarkable was lithium, which had been a small \ncommodity, had really come to dominate the proceedings at Diggers and Dealers,\" Morgan says.\n\"The Australian-dollar gold price is high, and lithium and nickel are having a tough time of it and not likely to be as \nfocused on growth. Nickel and lithium are battening down the hatches.\" Domestic gold production growth has \nslowed over the past decade as mines approach the end of their productive lives, says IBISWorld, but it's set to \nreturn to growth as project expansions come online, capitalising on the weaker Australian dollar.\nThe industry's annual revenue is about $27.9bn and growing at a rate of 4.4 per cent as the metal continues to act \nas an inflation hedge and benefits from central bank purchases.\nAustralia is the third-largest producer globally with 293.8 tonnes in 2023, behind China and Russia, according to the \nWorld Gold Council.\nLithium miners dominated the mergers and acquisitions landscape in the resources industry last year, with \nAlbemarle bidding for Liontown Resources (it later abandoned the deal), SQM acquiring Azure Minerals, Chalice \nMining looking for a backer and speculation about a move on Patriot Battery Metals by Pilbara Minerals, which was \nsitting on a $3bn cash pile. But investment bankers have turned their attention to gold.\nHeading into Diggers and Dealers, there has been talk Regis and Gold Road Resources might merge. Ramelius \nResources is also in focus with an 8.9 per cent stake in Spartan Resources, West Gold and Ramelius have held \ntakeover talks and there's the perennial takeover target De Grey Mining.\nGenesis Minerals boss Raleigh Finlayson has emphasised his focus is on operations rather than deals, but the \ncompany is surrounded by consolidation opportunities in Western Australia's Leonora gold district, while it's \nexpected Northern Star will return to deal making to gain further scale after the country's largest gold miner \nNewcrest was taken over by Newmont.\nDriving M&A, Bramwell says, will be producers with cash. \"This is a time when the producers are cashed-up and \nthe explorers and the people in the middle are cash-strapped.\" Also of interest this year will be uranium miners like \nBoss Energy and Paladin, as the fuel remains at the centre of the energy debate and demand grows, with a lack of \nsupply to the West from Russia. \"There's a lot of enthusiasm towards the sector. Its prospects are still high and \nhave not dimmed as much as lithium or nickel or rare earths have,\" Morgan says. Another positive for gold could be \nnickel producers such as BHP mothballing projects, making workers available.\nLoad-Date: August 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Bridget Carter\nDate: August 05, 2024\nTitle: Gold shines again at Diggers and Dealers but developers are struggling - DATA ROOM\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Battle for relevance a key driver for more gold mining deals - DATA ROOM\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Bridget Carter\n### Date: August 07, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nBattle for relevance a key driver for more gold mining deals - DATA ROOM\nBattle for relevance a key driver for more gold mining deals - DATA ROOM\nThe Australian\nAugust 7, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 339 words\nByline: EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER\nBody\nGroups that mine more than 400,000 ounces of gold annually are more likely to get attention from investors \nallocating a shrinking pool of funds to listed Australian stocks in the sector, says Westgold Resources boss Wayne \nBramwell.\nThe managing director of the $1.3bn Westgold said the concept of remaining relevant was top of mind for chief \nexecutives of mid-tier gold miners on the Australian Securities Exchange, and it would likely drive mergers and \nacquisitions in the space.\n\"Capital markets are shrinking in certain areas, so it is not just about being profitable but relevant,\" he said.\nMr Bramwell said being relevant meant mining at least 400,000 ounces of gold a year.\n\"Under that space, you may be interesting, but less relevant to a broader audience,\" he said.\nHis comments at the Diggers and Dealers conference in Kalgoorlie come after Mr Bramwell struck a $2.2bn deal to \nmerge with the Canadian-listed Karora.\n\"Now we have moved above that space, we are more relevant to a broader audience,\" he said.\nRival ASX miner Ramelius Resources, which was also in earlier talks to buy Karora, lobbed an objection to the \nTakeovers Panel about the deal.\nThe process exposed mergers and acquisition talks between the Mark Zeptner-led Ramelius and Westgold late \nlast year that involved standstill terms between the pair.\nRamelius owns two production and processing hubs at Mt Magnet and Edna May, both in Western Australia, and is \ndeveloping its Rebecca and Cue Gold Projects.\nMr Bramwell confirmed there were talks late last year with Ramelius, which were likely to be similar to what the \ncompany had with Karora.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 24\nLength: 1326 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nKalgoorlie postcard The high hopes of last year have faded.\nDarren Stralow and Simon Lawson shook hands and said their goodbyes. The young gold bulls had just met and \nthought they were about to die together in a plane crash.\nIt was 2011, the gold price was about $1300 an ounce and Northern Star Resources was starting its rise from the \nranks of penny dreadful to where it sits today, the biggest ASX-listed producer.\nThe plane, its engines dead after sucking in dirty fuel, eventually glided to an emergency landing in Paraburdoo, \nWestern Australia.\n\"Everyone was looking out of the window, you could see the fire engines rushing to the side of the runway for the \nlanding to make sure that we weren't going to burst into flames,\" recalls Stralow.\nLawson and Stralow, working for Northern Star at the time, bonded over the near-death experience and shared a \nfew cold beers that night in town.\nThese days, Stralow is chief executive of Bellevue Gold. Lawson is the managing director of Spartan Resources.\nSpartan shares soared from 22\u00a2 to as high as $1.33 in the past 12 months on the back of the Never Never \ndiscovery about 800 kilometres south of their emergency landing. Bellevue has been as high as $2.10, although it \nnow hovers near a 12-month low of $1.25.\nLawson and Stralow were two of the star attractions at the Diggers & Dealers mining conference in Kalgoorlie, \nwhere gold was centre stage. The critical minerals presenters did their best to sound upbeat but were a reminder of \nfickle commodity markets and how quickly high-flyers can crash.\nKalgoorlie is relying on gold as it deals with the fallout from the collapse of the nickel industry and failures to launch \nin lithium in the wider Goldfields region.\nPage 2 of 3\nGold saves the day as Diggers deals with the rout\nSmoke still pours from the 150-metre-high main chimney stack at the BHP nickel smelter outside the town, but it will \nstop soon after 51 years.\nAbout 10 kilometres away, on the edge of town, Northern Star is investing $1.5 billion on a giant crusher to boost \noutput from the fabled Superpit and underground mines. Those operations cover ground that has already produced \nabout 65 million ounces of gold worth about $222 billion at today's spot price of $US2398 ($3700) an ounce.\nStralow reminds everyone of how tough it can be to get new mines into production and running, even with price \ntailwinds.\nHe needed to do so as an explanation of Bellevue's decision to raise $150 million last month, a move that caught \nthe market by surprise. At least Bellevue could raise money. Commodity analysts Citi and others have predicted the \ngold price could reach $US3000 an ounce by this time next year under a bullish scenario.\nRaising money appears a forlorn hope for lithium projects, with benchmark prices for the concentrate produced in \nWA slumping to $US870 a tonne this week. Liontown Resources managing director Tony Ottaviano, who has just \ndefied the odds to bring the Kathleen Valley mine to life, told the conference it was now impossible to fund a lithium \nproject with equity alone.\nLithium veteran Ken Brinsden, who piloted Pilbara Minerals through near ruin, suggested the federal government \ncreate something akin to the former Australian Wheat Board to help fund strategically important rare earths \nprojects.\nWhile the Kalgoorlie pubs did a roaring trade, the BHP stand inside the conference's main marquee stood almost \nempty. All it had to offer was advice on where there might be other jobs after the mothballing of the nickel smelter \nand mines that were the lifeblood of towns such as Leinster and Kambalda.\nLawson brought his gold company back to life after a triple bypass. It failed twice when known as Gascoyne \nResources. He was sacking workers two years ago but has had remarkable success with the drill bit since then \nunder the Spartan moniker.\nSpartan's most exciting discovery is Never Never, part of the Dalgaranga project. And it is one reason that mid-tier \nminer Ramelius Resources has grabbed a near 18 per cent stake in the company amid a flurry of M&A in the WA \ngold sector. The Diggers organisers showed a sense of theatre when Spartan boss Lawson and Ramelius boss \nMark Zeptner spoke back-to-back on Wednesday. Lawson has stirred the pot by suggesting that with a market \ncapitalisation of $1.2 billion, Spartan might now be too much to bite off for $2.16 billion Ramelius.\nLess than a year ago, he was hoping Ramelius, Westgold or Silver Lake would come knocking about a deal and \nbemoaning a timid approach to M&A in the gold sector.\n\"I stand by that,\" Lawson said this week. \"There was a little confusion about why no one had moved on me earlier. \nWhy did [Ramelius] wait until it cost them $185 million to get less than 20 per cent of my company? I'm still \nconfused as to why cashed-up gold producers, who are actually running at a pretty good premium and with \npremium gold prices, are not more active in that M&A space.\"\nNorthern Star, valued at $16.3 billion, made many of its acquisitions at times when the gold price was in the \ndoldrums.\nBoth Northern Star boss Stuart Tonkin and Evolution Mining executive chairman Jake Klein said this week that they \nwere less inclined to make acquisitions at a high gold price.\nDespite the impressive size and grade of Never Never, one hurdle for Lawson has been the stigma associated with \nGascoyne. \"One particular fund manager said he hated Gascoyne, it had torched $35 million of his fund and that it \nreally left a bad taste in his mouth,\" Lawson says. \"He said he wasn't interested in hearing our story, but he turned \nup, sat in a corner and pretended not to listen. Eight minutes later he wanted 5 per cent.\"Page 3 of 3\nGold saves the day as Diggers deals with the rout\nLawson is also backing his mate Stralow to deliver with Bellevue despite some grumblings about the capital raising \nat a big discount. \"There's more money in the tank now [at Bellevue], and he's running the highest-grade gold mine \nin Australia. It's going to be very profitable,\" he adds.\nLast year at Diggers, lithium was all the rage, with Albemarle about to up its bid for Liontown to $6.6 billion and Gina \nRinehart and Chile's SQM working up to a joint $1.7 billion takeover offer for explorer Azure Minerals.\nAndrew Forrest-backed Wyloo had just completed its $760 million acquisition of nickel miner Mincor. BHP was \nplanning to build a 1000-bed village at Kalgoorlie to accommodate the workforce needed for a major overhaul and \nupdate of its nickel smelter.\nA year later, the Wyloo mines are mothballed and BHP has written down the value of its nickel business by $5.4 \nbillion. Glencore and IGO Limited have the only nickel mines still standing in WA - and they are just hanging on.\nIGO sold its 30 per cent stake in Tropicana, one of WA's biggest gold mines, to Regis Resources in 2021 as part of \na big punt on battery minerals that involved acquiring stakes in the Greenbushes lithium mine and a still mis-firing \nlithium hydroxide refinery.\nThe same green metals strategy led to the disastrous acquisition of nickel miner Western Areas.\nThose deals were done before Ivan Vella arrived as chief executive. He remains optimistic on lithium but isn't so \nsure about a nickel revival in the face of growing supply from Chinese-backed producers in Indonesia.\n\"What we do know is a lot of WA nickel mines are actually quite old. As you get further into the mine life, it does get \nharder and more costly,\" he says.\nGlenn Wilson, the mayor of Kalgoorlie, says the town is feeling the impact of the nickel collapse and BHP workers \nleaving.\n\"We're starting to see houses hit the market.",
