In addition to the \\nquarterly report, we've also released a presentation that we'll largely speak to during the call. Both documents have \\nbeen uploaded on the ASX platform and will be available on the website shortly.\\nPage 2 of 6\\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\\nOnce again, I'm joined by our CFO, Darren Millman. Darren will provide some detail on the financials after I've run \\nthrough the highlights and touched on the operational performance and our development projects. As always, there \\nwill be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions at the end.\\nFor those who have downloaded the presentation deck, I'll be initially speaking to Slide 3. I'll focus on the highlights \\nand key achievements for the quarter. I would like to point out that there is a large amount of detail on exploration, \\noperations and project development within the quarterly report itself.\\nSo on Slide 3, operationally and financially, the December quarter was exceptionally strong, with the business \\ngenerating a record and also sector-leading AUD 174.5 million in underlying free cash flow. After considering our \\nadditional investment in Spartan during the quarter of AUD 68 million and the payment of our FY '24 AUD 0.05 per \\nshare dividend, our closing cash and gold position was just over AUD 500 million.\\nOur quarterly gold production was 85,311 ounces, which was a 37% increase on the prior quarter, noting also just \\nshy of our record production, which occurred in the March 2024 quarter. The increase in production was mainly due \\nto the introduction of ore from Cue, which performed extremely well during the quarter and also improved grades \\nfrom Penny. I'll talk to these points in more detail shortly.\\nLooking at the costs, we saw a 25% decrease in our all-in sustaining costs down to AUD 1,491 for the quarter. Now \\nwhilst we were guiding for a reduction in all-in sustaining costs across the year, the all-in sustaining cost for the \\nquarter was below our expectations and obviously benefited from the outperformance of Cue. Importantly, our \\nguidance for FY '25 remains unchanged at 270,000 to 300,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of AUD 1,500 to \\nAUD 1,700 an ounce.\\nWhilst we are encouraged by the indicative overperformance of Cue grades, it is still relatively early days, and we \\nwill continue to assess this during the March quarter as more data becomes available as mining and milling \\nprogresses.\\nUnfortunately, during the quarter, we did record our first LTI since May 2023. Whilst this is extremely disappointing, \\nthe incident itself, which is detailed in the quarterly report, was not of a serious nature. We do strive to ensure that \\nall employees and contractors remain healthy -- safe and healthy under our watch. The total recordable injury \\nfrequency rate, or TRIFR, at the end of December was 8.33, which was only marginally higher than that recorded \\nlast quarter.\\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\\nThere were several milestones and advancements in our key projects across the quarter with haulage to [Cue] \\ncommencing mid-November following the completion of the Great Northern Highway intersection upgrade and also \\ndelivery of the Rebecca Roe PFS, which is demonstrating strong economic returns.\\nFor the immediate future, our focus is on delivery of the Eridanus and Mt Magnet mill upgrade studies and \\nassociated mine plan in this quarter and the Rebecca Roe DFS, which is targeting a final investment decision in the \\nSeptember quarter. Exploration and resource definition activities during the quarter were largely focused on \\nEridanus, Penny West and the Lena pit at Cue.\\nOn Slide 4, I will draw your attention on -- sorry, we're looking here at the quarterly production breakdown for the \\nlast 12 months. If you look at the yellow Mt Magnet bars, you can see the previous September quarter, we focused \\nlargely on the development of Cue. And now we see that asset in production, along with improved grades at Penny, \\nhas been the main driver of increased production in the December quar\",\n    \"media_outlet\": \"Seeking Alpha\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"date\": \"2025-02-03\",\n    \"title\": \"ASX posts big intraday loss; CBA falls 1.5pc; Equities\",\n    \"sentiment\": 2,\n    \"content\": \"Page 1 of 2\\nASX posts big intraday loss; CBA falls 1.5pc; Equities\\nASX posts big intraday loss; CBA falls 1.5pc; Equities\\nAustralian Financial Review\\nFebruary 4, 2025 Tuesday\\nPrint & First Editions\\nCopyright 2025 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

            "content": "The significant peak in positive sentiment surrounding Ramelius Resources between December 31, 2024, and February 9, 2025, was primarily driven by strong financial performance, strategic acquisitions, and favorable market conditions. A key catalyst was Ramelius' record free cash flow of AUD 174.5 million in Q2 2025, which underscored its financial strength and operational efficiency (Seeking Alpha, Jan 29, 2025). Additionally, its increased stake in Spartan Resources to 19.9% signaled aggressive expansion and confidence in future growth (The Australian, Jan 7, 2025). The broader gold market also played a role, with gold prices surging towards USD 3,000 per ounce due to geopolitical tensions and central bank demand, benefiting gold miners like Ramelius (The Australian, Feb 10, 2025). Investor optimism was further bolstered by Ramelius' inclusion among top-performing gold stocks, with its share price rising 75% over the past year (The Australian, Feb 10, 2025). These factors collectively contributed to the positive sentiment peak, reflecting strong financials, strategic growth, and a favorable market environment.",
