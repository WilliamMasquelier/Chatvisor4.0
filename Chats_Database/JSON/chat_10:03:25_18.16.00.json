[Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has never had an Indigenous land use agreement with the Yindjibarndi people, despite mining on their land for over a decade, leading to a $500 million compensation claim for unpaid royalties, interest, and damages for cultural and spiritual losses, which could result in a significant financial and reputational impact on the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued in court that compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should not be based on the value of the minerals extracted from their land, despite industry standards where native title holders receive a percentage of royalties, raising concerns about the company's approach to Indigenous compensation. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest held private meetings in a Perth park with Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation leader Michael Woodley in an attempt to settle a billion-dollar compensation case, but the talks failed as the parties remain hundreds of millions of dollars apart, highlighting the ongoing dispute and lack of resolution. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue is facing a potential $1 billion compensation claim from the Yindjibarndi people, including $500 million for economic losses and an additional $500 million for the destruction of more than 240 culturally significant sites, which could have major financial and reputational consequences for the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue was left exposed to the Yindjibarndi compensation claim in 2020 after the High Court denied the company special leave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings, which found that a large part of its Solomon iron ore mining hub was built without permission from traditional owners, raising legal and ethical concerns about its operations. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued that any compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should be funded by the State of Western Australia because it granted the mining tenements, but the WA government maintains that Fortescue should pay, creating further uncertainty over the company's financial liability. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Institutional investors are increasingly avoiding Fortescue, making it the least-held stock among the 10 largest companies on the ASX, with concerns over its lower iron ore grades, high executive turnover, and heavy spending on unprofitable green hydrogen projects. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been ranked as the \"least-loved\" stock among major Australian companies in a JPMorgan survey of 50 fund managers, reflecting ongoing skepticism about its business strategy and financial stability. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Analysts and brokers have been bearish on Fortescue for an extended period, with most maintaining a sell rating on the stock since November 2022, in contrast to competitors BHP and Rio Tinto, which have never held a majority sell rating since at least 2009. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue lost its final buy rating in January after JPMorgan's head of Australian resources advised investors to take profits, with the stock subsequently falling more than 10% from its peak in early February, raising concerns about its valuation and future performance. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's unconventional management style under Andrew Forrest has left the investment community baffled, with concerns that the company's entrepreneurial approach lacks the structured management seen in competitors like BHP and Rio Tinto. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been criticized for its approach to Indigenous compensation, with an expert witness arguing in court that the company\u2019s attempt to exclude the value of minerals from compensation calculations is \"nonsensical\" and unfair to the Yindjibarndi people. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue began mining at the Solomon hub in 2013 without an agreement from the Yindjibarndi\u2019s registered native title body and instead dealt with a breakaway group, raising ethical concerns about its treatment of traditional owners. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has slammed the Biden administration\u2019s proposed hydrogen incentive rules, arguing that they could triple the cost of low-carbon hydrogen projects and stifle growth in the sector, potentially impacting the company\u2019s green energy ambitions. [Australian Financial Review, Peter Ker, April 22, 2024]. - Fortescue's iron ore shipments fell 6% in the March quarter compared to the same period last year due to a derailment in late December and weather disruptions, raising concerns about the company's logistics resilience and ability to meet its full-year shipment targets.

[The Age, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has forecast that its full-year iron ore shipments will likely come in at the lower end of its guidance range due to operational setbacks, including a derailment and adverse weather, which could impact revenue and investor confidence. [Seeking Alpha, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's Iron Bridge magnetite project has suffered another production downgrade, with expected shipments now reduced to just 2 million tonnes, significantly below previous guidance, highlighting ongoing challenges in ramping up the project. [The Australian, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's iron ore exports dropped 11% from the December quarter, and the decline in shipments pushed up average C1 cash costs by 7% to $18.93 per tonne, increasing operational expenses and potentially squeezing profit margins. [The Australian, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue will need to maintain near-record export rates to meet its full-year shipment guidance, requiring an ambitious 53.5 million tonnes in the June quarter, which may be difficult given recent logistical and operational setbacks. [The Daily Telegraph, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's Gibson Island hydrogen project has been sidelined despite receiving a $13.7 million government grant, with the company citing high Australian power prices as a major obstacle, raising doubts about the financial viability of its domestic green hydrogen ambitions.

Long-serving executive Julie Shuttleworth, Mr \nHutchinson's predecessor as Fortescue Energy CEO, called time on her 11 years with Fortescue this week.\nMs Shuttleworth's most recent role was leading the development of the company's Belinga iron ore project in \nGabon.

To get out \nof that awkward era as soon as possible is the responsibility for any good government,\" Dr Forrest said.\n\"Any government of Australia which goes out of its way to annoy its biggest customer is probably going to stop \nbeing that customer's favourite supplier.\n\"You can't run around kicking your customers and still expect to sell a lot of boots.\" Dr Forrest's stake in his iron ore \nminer Fortescue Metals, whose main customer is China, has made him one of the richest men in Australia. He is \nnow driving the company to push into hydrogen and the production of \"green steel\".\nHe was also critical of Peter Dutton's recent decision to flag that he would abandon Australia's 2030 carbon-\nreduction targets if he came to power.\nHe said maintaining the goal was critical for business planning, and warned that scrapping the target could lead to \nAustralia missing out on the enormous economic opportunity around the global -energy transition.\n\"Barnaby Joyce and others know I am likely to call out behaviour which is going to be directly against the standard \nof living, the national interest, the economic growth of Australia,\" he said.\n\"Causing fear and division or claiming you can run a business, let alone a country, without targets just says to me \nyou've obviously never employed anyone, you've never created value from scratch.\" Slowing down the energy \nPage 2 of 2\n'Awkward': Forrest hails an end to 'puerile' politics\ntransition by scrapping the target, he said, would mean slowing down the economic growth opportunities associated \nwith the transition.\n\"The reason why we can drive potentially the next big economic wave, the biggest economic growth, the highest \nemployment multiplier and economic multiplier in Australia's recent history is thanks to the necessity to address \nclimate change,\" he said.\n\"There is a serious economic opportunity here for every single Australian. You wouldn't want to stand in the road of \nthat.\" The Chinese Premier's visit to Fortescue's Perth facility will centre on the efforts the company is putting into \ndeveloping hydrogen-fuelled trucks and a battery-powered locomotive it has named \"the infinity train\".\nDr Forrest will also detail Fortescue's plans to develop an Australia-China green iron supply chain. \"We have the \nleading tech in the world now,\" he said. \"I see this as a really key historical step to creating the next wave of major \neconomic growth and employment for Australia.\" Dr Forrest said this week's visit showed China too had shifted its \ndiplomatic approach. \"You can see wolf diplomacy failed, and the dip-lomacy of Premier Li is absolutely the right \nstep,\" he said. \"We've always been able to export and drive the standard of living we have in Australia. Now the last \nthing we want to do is start hurting that standard of living, hurting that economic growth, and a strong relationship \nbetween China and Australia is absolutely necessary to continue the growth of the economies of both countries.\"\nLoad-Date: June 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Paul Garvey\nDate: June 18, 2024\nTitle: 'Awkward': Forrest hails an end to 'puerile' politics\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Fortescue shares dive\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: June 19, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nFortescue shares dive\nFortescue shares dive\nAustralian Financial Review\nJune 19, 2024 Wednesday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Fund managers were being offered the shares at $21.60 apiece, representing a 6 \nper cent discount to Fortescue's share price on Monday before the sale. Shares fell $1.19 in trade yesterday to \nclose at $21.78. It is their lowest point since October. Fortescue shares have fallen more than a quarter since the \nstart of the year. It has been a tumultuous period for the Andrew Forrest-chaired iron ore and energy group, with a \nstring of executive departures over the last year. Last week, Julie Shuttleworth, one of Dr Forrest's most trusted \nlieutenants and the executive in charge of Fortescue's fledgling iron ore operations in Gabon, announced her \ndeparture. She had previously been the company's deputy chief executive and run Fortescue Future Industries, as \nthe energy division was then known.\nTamboran eyes NY\nNatural gas explorer Tamboran Resources has detailed plans for a $US175.5 million ($265.3 million) initial public \noffering on the New York Stock Exchange. The company is offering 6.5 million shares at a price range of $US24 to \n$US27 apiece. Taboran told investors that it was seeking to raise capital to fund the drilling, completion and \ninfrastructure requirements to reach plateau rates for its proposed Shenandoah South Pilot Project. The joint book-\nrunning managers on the IPO are Bank of America, Citi and RBC Capital Markets. \"We are excited to be launching \nour IPO in the US to support funding of our proposed Shenandoah South Pilot Project in the Beetaloo Basin,\" \nTamboran Resources chief executive Joel Riddle said. \"The US market has deep knowledge of the development of \nshale gas resources and a long history of supporting gas companies to fund their developments.\" Mr Riddle added: \n\"Our board of directors believe the US listing will deliver Tamboran shareholders a greater reflection of the value of \nTamboran's assets.\" The company last raised money 12 months ago, taking a $70 million capital raise to Australian \ninvestors following offtake agreements with Shell and BP. But the junior explorer faces an uphill task to secure the \nenvironmental approvals it needs and proceed into development amid staunch opposition from green groups and \nothers due to the impact on emissions and worries about damage to land and water.

What we need you to do is go back to \nAustralia and work out how to combine the vast renewable energy resources you have up there in the Pilbara, with \nyour supply chain for iron ore. Bring those -together in Port Hedland or at the Rio Tinto ports, and convert that iron \nore into green iron and be able to ship it to us',\" Mr Masterman said.\n\"The best place in the world to take the carbon emissions out of iron steel making is in northwestern Australia.",
