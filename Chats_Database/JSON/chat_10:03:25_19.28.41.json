Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Chris Kourtis | Portfolio Manager at Ellerston Capital | \"Following the sharp de-rating, we believe FMG now offers a compelling entry point at current bombed-out levels.\" | N.A. |\n| Chris Kourtis | Portfolio Manager at Ellerston Capital | \"Negative sentiment around sluggish but flat Chinese steel demand, elevated China port inventory and an improving iron ore supply outlook from West Africa have weighed on the big three Australian iron ore producers.\" | N.A. |\n| Sean Fenton | Portfolio Manager at Sage Capital | \"We anticipate iron ore and lithium to remain weak due to excess industrial capacity created in China due to domestic policy that encourages the economy to diversify away from housing.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
