It operates in the digital communications technology, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Cisco based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Cisco is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Cisco.\n\nIf Cisco is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nNvidia hits valuation top in echo of dotcom boom\nNvidia hits valuation top in echo of dotcom boom\nThe Australian\nJune 20, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: WSJ; Pg. 21\nLength: 839 words\nByline: ASA FITCH\nBody\nNvidia has become the US's most valuable listed company because of the demand for its artificial-intelligence \nchips, leading a tech boom that brings back memories of one from earlier this century.\nNvidia's chips have been the workhorses of the AI boom, essential tools in the creation of sophisticated AI systems \nthat have captured the public's imagination with their ability to produce cogent text, images and audio with minimal \nprompting.\nThe last time a big provider of computing infrastructure was the most valuable US company was in March 2000, \nwhen networking-equipment company Cisco took that spot at the height of the dotcom boom.\nCisco was riding the wave of a different revolution - the internet - where its products powered that budding industry. \nLike Nvidia, Cisco also surpassed Microsoft to become the most valuable company.\nJohn Chambers, who was chief executive of Cisco during the dotcom boom, said there were some parallels, but \nthe dynamics of the AI revolution were different from previous ones such as the internet and cloud computing. Mr \nChambers, now a venture investor, has made big bets on AI in cybersecurity and other arenas.\n\"The implications in terms of the size of the market opportunity is that of the internet and cloud computing \ncombined,\" he said.\n\"The speed of change is different, the size of the market is different, the stage when the most valuable company \nwas reached is different.\" Nvidia, a 31-year-old company, became the world's most valuable firm on Tuesday. Its \nstock closed at $US135.58, giving the chip maker a valuation of $US3.335 trillion ($5 trillion), just above Microsoft \nat $US3.317 trillion.\nIt marks the first time a company other than Microsoft or Apple has held the title of largest company since February \n2019, when Amazon.com briefly topped the list. Nvidia was ranked fifth largest by market valuation a year ago and \nwas 10th largest two years ago. Five years ago, it wasn't in the top 20 largest companies.\nPage 2 of 2\nNvidia hits valuation top in echo of dotcom boom\nThe scramble among tech -giants such as Microsoft, Meta and Amazon to lead the way in AI's development and \ncapture its hoped-for benefits has led to a chip-buying spree that lifted Nvidia's revenue to unprecedented heights. \nIn its latest quarter, the company brought in $US26bn, more than triple the same period a year before.\nNvidia's stock was the best performer in the S&P 500 in 2023, and has more than tripled in value over the past 12 \nmonths. The company's value hit $US3 trillion this month, less than four months after it reached $US2 trillion.\nNvidia split its shares 10-for-one this month, a move aimed at lowering the price of each share and making it more \naccessible to investors.\nThe stunning rise has won plaudits from analysts who agree with chief executive Jensen Huang's assertion that AI \nis the foundation of a new industrial revolution to which the company is the key supplier. Mr Huang says Nvidia is \nbuilding \"AI factories\" that take in data and churn out -intelligence.\nNvidia \"will be the most important company to our civilisation over the next decade as the world becomes more AI-\ndriven,\" CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said recently. The chips Nvidia pioneered would be the most \nimportant invention of this century, he said.\nThe insatiable flow of money into AI has raised eyebrows among investors uncertain that the boom can continue \nwithout pause. Some $US50bn has been invested in Nvidia's chips since the boom began, according to a Sequoia \nCapital estimate in March, but generative-AI start-ups have only brought in $US3bn in sales.\nThat imbalance, Sequoia partner Sonya Huang said at the time, meant \"we've got some real problems to fix\". \nCapital Economics chief economist Neil Shearing on Monday said the AI bubble would probably help keep US \nstocks rising for the next year and a half, although it would eventually burst, with the US market \"destined for a \nperiod of significant underperformance\" to follow.\nNvidia and its chief, Mr Huang, are showing few signs of concern, despite an array of challenges around them, from \nfeisty competitors to regulators increasingly scrutinising the company's dominance in the AI-chip market, where \nanalysts suggest it has a share of above 80 per cent.\nMr Huang early this month was in Taiwan, where he gave an address and announced new details about a future \ngeneration of AI chips set to arrive in 2026.\nWith the rise of the stock, he has taken on an aura of stardom usually reserved for pop singers and athletes, not 61-\nyear-old tech executives. At the company's annual conference in March, Mr Huang gave his keynote speech in an \n11,000-capacity arena.\nMr Chambers said Mr Huang was working from a different playbook than Cisco, but was facing some similar \nchallenges. Nvidia has a dominant market share, much like Cisco did with its products as the internet grew, and is \nalso fending off rising competition. Also like Nvidia, Cisco benefited from investments before the industry became \nprofitable. \"We were absolutely in the right spot at the right time, and we knew it, and we went for it,\" Mr Chambers \nsaid.\nLoad-Date: June 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Cisco.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
