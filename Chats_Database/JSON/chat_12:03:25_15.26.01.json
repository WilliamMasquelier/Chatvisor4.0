Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Cecile Wake | Shell's country chair | \"The renewable energy agreements that minister (Chris) Bowen was speaking about between himself and the state energy ministers, let's broaden them so that we deliver successful projects across the length and breadth of our economy.\" | N.A. |\n| Cecile Wake | Shell's country chair | \"Energy is the economy. Energy is the future. And we've got a great opportunity, but we mustn't \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 squander our traditional strengths.\" | N.A. |\n| Cecile Wake | Shell's country chair | \"We need to stop demonising gas, we need to look more broadly than simply the \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 renewable penetration in the electricity mix, we need to look to biofuels.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Shell.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Shell or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
