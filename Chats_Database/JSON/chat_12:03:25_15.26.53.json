This investment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a \nPage 2 of 2\nArrow to expand Queensland gas project\nlower emissions alternative to options like coal.\" Shell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said the expansion would \nbe boon for the local community.\n\"At its core, this project promotes stronger regional communities, and it also has wider benefits for Australian \nmanufacturing and industry more broadly,\" she said.\nThe expansion will inflame environmentalists, who oppose any new gas drilling. But Australia's east coast faces a \nlooming crisis as offshore gas from Victoria's Bass Strait - the traditional bedrock of the country's supplies - rapidly \ndepletes.\nThe Australian Energy Market Operator has warned the country must urgently unlock new supplies to prevent a \ncatastrophic shortfall but new developments are struggling to secure regulatory approvals and/or the support of \nlocal communities.\nAnalysts have warned the country's $2.5 trillion economy will be significant harmed by a shortfall. The \nmanufacturing sector is particularly exposed with gas its only viable energy source, and any interruptions could \nthreaten their viability.\nHouseholds could also be disrupted. Victoria is the most gas-dependent state, relying on the fuel source to heat \nhomes, and a shortfall could make heating prohibitively expensive.\nOther states will also be hit. Gas is used as a so-called peaker, burnt to provide electricity during periods of high \ndemand or low supply from other fossil fuels or renewables. If Australia's National Electricity Market has insufficient \ngas on hand, the price of electricity will spike. Higher electricity bills was a key driver behind Australia's spike in \ninflation, which in turn forced the Reserve Bank of Australia to raise interest rates 13 times.\nWith a looming shortfall, gas developers have insisted governments fast-track applications, a request that the \nfederal Labor government has refused - insisting it must properly assess each application. The gas industry has \naccused the government of slow walking, which indicates its support for gas - a claim denied by Labor.\nLoad-Date: August 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Zoe Yujnovich | Shell's integrated gas and upstream director | \"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to market.\" | N.A. |\n| Cecile Wake | Shell Australia chairwoman | \"At its core, this project promotes stronger regional communities, and it also has wider benefits for Australian manufacturing and industry more broadly.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
