The search \norders, obtained by Fortescue in May, were granted by judge Melissa Perry based on allegations the men stole \nFortescue's intellectual property, including claims that Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen deleted emails and \ndocuments relating to the green steel concept from their personal laptops just before they resigned.\nBut the Federal Court heard on Monday that Justice Perry was not told the men were instructed to work from home \nin the weeks before they left Fortescue, and since their IT access was cut off they were forced to work on their own \ndevices and asked to delete some documents because there were copies.\n\"Her Honour is reading that material and no doubt thinking this is a classic former employee case that people on the \nway out the door \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 having resigned, have made off with highly confidential information,\" Element Zero barrister \nDavid Studdy SC said.\nEarlier, Mr Studdy said Justice Perry was repeatedly told the ex-Fortescue executives engaged in \"industrial scale \nmisuse\" of the mining giant's confidential -information.\n\"That phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 cannot be excused as a throwaway line or a barrister flourish. Her Honour was being informed \nfrom the outset \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 that in effect the respondents were dishonest,\" the court heard.\nAs well, Mr Studdy said there was \"no evidence they actually took documents, stole or made off with (the \ndocuments) unlawfully\", but that was precisely the \"picture that has been painted to Her Honour (Justice Perry)\".\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue 'portrayed former execs as dishonest', court told\nInstead, the men were required to \"finalise outstanding intellectual property work\" in the weeks after they resigned, \nthe court heard. Mr Studdy said that during raids on the homes and offices of Dr Kolodziejczyk, Dr Winther-Jensen \nand Element Zero, private material not relevant to the legal dispute was taken, including the entire contents of \nElement Zero's server, personal Google accounts used for emails, contents of personal mobile phones, a laptop \nand hardware required to run \"particular experiments\" conducted by Element Zero. Mr Studdy said his clients were \n\"very concerned\" a large amount of private and \"highly confidential\" material, including some belonging to third \nparties, was taken.\nIt was also alleged that Mr Masterman, who is a party to the proceedings, was discussing Element Zero technology \nwith Fortescue up until February this year to explain how it worked, but Justice Perry was not told about this.\nJustice Markovic said that even if the search orders were discharged, \"the fact is you can't undo what's been done\".\nMr Studdy responded that if his clients were successful, then the material collected from their homes and offices \ncould at least be returned to them and taken out of the hands of independent solicitors.\n\"The material non-disclosure and inaccurate and misleading information put before the court caused Her Honour \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to find a strong primary case contrary to the true position,\" he said.\nThe extraordinary legal fight between Fortescue and Element Zero was revealed in July, weeks after the raids \nwere carried out. Fortescue hired a private eye, Robert Lancaster, to spy on Element Zero staff and their families, \nincluding rummaging through their mail, following wives of the directors to Kmart and taking pictures of their \nchildren. Fortescue's barrister Julian Cooke will defend his client's position on Tuesday when the matter returns to \ncourt.\nLoad-Date: August 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's founder | \"Her Honour is reading that material and no doubt thinking this is a classic former employee case that people on the way out the door \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 having resigned, have made off with highly confidential information.\" | N.A. |\n| Bart Kolodziejczyk | Former Fortescue chief scientist | \"That phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 cannot be excused as a throwaway line or a barrister flourish.
