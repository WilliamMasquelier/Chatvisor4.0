Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Corien Vermaak | Cisco ANZ director of cybersecurity | \"As we do security awareness training, we now need to focus on that narrative on AI as well.\" | N.A. |\n| Corien Vermaak | Cisco ANZ director of cybersecurity | \"Where organisations are unsure, they've banned it. What that tells me is a lot of organisations are looking to put the controls in place, are looking to educate, message and see where they can improve their processes before allowing it.\" | N.A. |\n| Corien Vermaak | Cisco ANZ director of cybersecurity | \"One of the examples in our framework is that when an employee uses any generative AI tool, they have to actually disclose it.\" | N.A. |\n| Corien Vermaak | Cisco ANZ director of cybersecurity | \"There's two things that organisations and companies need to start with. That is the education part, which is critically important.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Cisco.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Cisco or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
