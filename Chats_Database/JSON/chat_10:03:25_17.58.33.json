The multi-year deal, which covers waste management \nservices across Fortescue's Pilbara iron ore operations, represents a new level of growth and autonomy for \nKingKira - a 100 per cent Indigenous-owned enterprise rooted in the leadership of founder Tammy O'Connor.\nO'Connor, a proud Palyku woman with deep Nyiyaparli and Kariyarra heritage, founded KingKira in 2014. Back \nthen, the company's partnership with Fortescue began through its Billion Opportunities program, which was aimed \nat empowering Indigenous businesses.\nReflecting on this milestone, O'Connor says: \"Fortescue, through their Billion Opportunities program, has been \ninstrumental in helping us grow as a business. I'm incredibly proud of how much we have grown and can now stand \non our own with these major contracts.\" In a decade, KingKira has gone from an ambitious startup to a company \nwith more than 119 employees, 103 mobile assets and a client base of 124 across four Pilbara locations. The \nnumbers speak to a well-earned reputation for delivering top-tier service. But for O'Connor, they also represent \nmuch more: a success story that underscores the potential of Indigenous businesses to achieve independence in \nsectors where First Nations representation is still growing.\nFortescue's Warren Fish, director of approvals, communities, and environment, emphasises the wider impact of \nthis partnership: \"We've always been committed to initiatives that foster genuine economic and employment \nopportunities for First Nations Australians,\" he notes \"Contracts like this not only help businesses like KingKira \ngrow, but they also have a ripple effect, delivering long-lasting economic benefits to First Nations communities.\" \nThe $5bn-plus that Fortescue has funnelled into Indigenous businesses through its Billion Opportunities program \nhighlights how deliberate, well-structured support can elevate First Nations enterprises into sustainable, impactful \nentities within Australia's economy.\nFor KingKira, this new contract is a testament to resilience and innovation - a company that's gone beyond simply \nholding its own to thriving alongside global players.\nPage 2 of 2\nCapitalising on Opportunities\nFor KingKira, this latest contract isn't just another business win; it's a powerful symbol of Indigenous resilience and \ncapability in Australia's economy.\nThe partnership shows that with the right opportunities, First Nations businesses can evolve from emerging players \ninto industry leaders, standing toe-to-toe with some of the world's largest corporations.\nLooking ahead, as Fortescue pursues ambitious goals for decarbonisation and sustainability, partnerships like this \none with KingKira aren't just beneficial - they're essential.\nTogether, they're setting a new standard for collaboration, where economic growth aligns with community \nempowerment and cultural integrity. This collaboration underscores a vision of the future where Indigenous \nenterprises play a central role in Australia's resources sector, building a legacy that empowers First Nations \ncommunities for generations to come.\nLoad-Date: December 10, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
