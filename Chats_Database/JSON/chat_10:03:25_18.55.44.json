Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 13\nLength: 314 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFormer prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has severed ties with Andrew Forrest's Fortescue in the latest high-profile \nexit from the iron ore miner turned renewables hopeful.\nMr Turnbull ceased to be a director of Australian Fortescue Future Industries on January 11, ending a legal \nassociation with the company that had lasted almost three years.\nAFFI is one of several wholly owned subsidiaries of Fortescue that collectively make up the iron ore miner's clean \nenergy division.\nMr Turnbull declined to elaborate on the exit yesterday, but his departure adds to the long list of Fortescue people \nwho have moved on from the company in the past three years.\nFormer Woodside chief executive Fiona Hick spent just six months as Fortescue's mining boss before leaving in \nAugust, while the chief financial officer appointed by Ms Hick, Christine Morris, lasted barely two months.\nFormer Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle was also a director of AFFI before severing ties last August.\nAFFI never directly held any operational assets and Mr Turnbull's focus during the past three years was largely on \nthe establishment of an international member association for hydrogen producers, the Geneva-registered Green \nHydrogen Organisation. Mr Turnbull was still chairman of the Green Hydrogen Organisation yesterday. His \nretirement from AFFI comes six months after Fortescue announced plans to rebrand its \"Future Industries\" division \nas \"Fortescue Energy\", and it is understood there will be some rationalisation of the subsidiaries that make up the \ndivision.\nTwo of the original architects of Fortescue Future Industries - former chief financial officer Michael Masterman and \nformer chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk - revealed last week they had launched their own green iron start-up.\nFortescue shares hit a record high this month on strong iron ore prices. The company will update investors \ntomorrow.\nPage 2 of 2\nTurnbull quits Fortescue boardroom\nLoad-Date: January 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
