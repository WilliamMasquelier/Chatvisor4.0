Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder of Fortescue | \"I was surprised to learn of the investigations and have been advised by Fortescue's legal team that they were necessary in order to be granted search orders from the Federal Court.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder of Fortescue | \"Fortescue's external legal team have been reminded that they also have an obligation to comply with the company's values and their engagement is now under review.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder of Fortescue | \"No board member knew about the private investigator and a very enthusiastic group general counsel and company secretary wanted to demonstrate that you cannot steal technology and then eliminate that technology that the company produced on the way out.\" | N.A. |\n| Phil McKeiver | Chief Legal Counsel of Fortescue | \"Fortescue chief legal counsel Phil McKeiver had offered to resign over the company's role in the surveillance excess, but that the offer had been refused by joint chief executives Dino Otranto and Mark Hutchinson.\" | N.A. |\n| Paul Dewar | Senior Lawyer at Davies Collison Cave | \"Fortescue engaged a private investigator firm, Lancasters Investigations, with the aim of establishing the identity and location of each of the respondents to the search order application.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
