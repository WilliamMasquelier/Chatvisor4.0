Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Mark Zeptner | CEO of Ramelius Resources | \"We did some work \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and thought that is an opportunity we would like to capitalise on.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Zeptner | CEO of Ramelius Resources | \"Ultimately, as the project grows, it becomes more and more attractive to others, but it is in our backyard.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Zeptner | CEO of Ramelius Resources | \"Everyone would like a Never Never in their portfolio - for us, it is a nice to have, but not a must-have.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Zeptner | CEO of Ramelius Resources | \"The panel response wasn't timely so it wasn't effective.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Ramelius Resources.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Ramelius Resources or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
