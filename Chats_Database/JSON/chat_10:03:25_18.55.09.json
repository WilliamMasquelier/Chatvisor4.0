Due Diligence\nShould Fortescue buy its way to supremacy in hydrogen?; Due Diligence\nAustralian Financial Review\nJanuary 22, 2024 Monday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 21\nLength: 1208 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nBarely three years ago, hydrogen seemed to be the panacea for all the world's problems.\nIt was touted as the next clean fuel for passenger cars, the chemical catalyst that would decarbonise the steel and \nalumina industries, an ingredient for clean fertiliser and maybe even the replacement for methane gas in kitchen \nstoves.\n\"People thought it was a floor wax and a dessert topping, and it was good for everything,\" recalls Peter Barrett, the \nfounder of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Playground Global.\n\"But it ain't.\"\nBarrett isn't a hydrogen sceptic; as a director of Californian company Universal Hydrogen, he believes the \n\"incredibly useful\" molecule can cure the carbon footprint of the aviation and maritime industries plus work for \nfertiliser. But he doesn't hesitate to use the \"b\" word - bubble - when asked to explain the capitulation in most listed \nhydrogen stocks over the past three years.\n\"Some of the valuations were chasing applications that didn't necessarily make sense,\" he says. \"We see bubbles \nlike that, we are seeing one in AI today. People pile in, and they put money into silly shit.\"\nThe euphoria in hydrogen stocks peaked between Joe Biden winning the Democratic Party nomination in mid-2020 \nand his inauguration as president in January 2021.\nThe prospect of a green political wave at a time of ultra-low interest rates led investors toward riskier investments, \nparticularly those with a decarbonisation theme.\nBut three years on, the hydrogen tide has receded.\nThe 97-year-old Norwegian company Nel belongs to the \"sensible\" end of the hydrogen spectrum; it has \nmanufactured the electrolysers that turn water into hydrogen for decades, and Australian companies like Woodside \nand Viva Energy have its order book bursting at the seams.\nPage 2 of 3\nShould Fortescue buy its way to supremacy in hydrogen? Due Diligence\nBut Nel shares are down 86 per cent over the past three years as it endures short-term pain (investment in extra \nmanufacturing capacity) to underwrite a long-term strategy.\nThe silly end of the hydrogen spectrum was best represented by Nikola Motors, the hydrogen truck aspirant that, \namong other sins, was forced to admit to US regulators that it had rolled its prototype truck down a hill to make it \nappear functional for promotional videos.\nThe incident was one of several lies or exaggerations told to investors about Nikola's progress, and late last year its \ntalismanic founder Trevor Milton was sentenced to jail for fraud.\nNikola shares peaked at $US65.90 in 2020 but were just US62\u00a2 last week.\nAnother hydrogen truck aspirant, Hyzon, has lost 96.5 per cent of its value since February 2021 after it, too, fell foul \nof regulators for misleading investors over its sales performance.\nThe irregularities found by US regulators in the accounts of Plug Power - a manufacturer of hydrogen-powered \nforklifts, electrolysers and other components - were less serious than those at Nikola and Hyzon.\nBut they haven't helped investor confidence; Plug shares are down 96 per cent over the past three years, and the \ncash-strapped stock lost almost 12 per cent on Thursday when it revealed plans to issue $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) \nof new shares.\nWhile each stock is affected by individual factors, David Tuckwell from GlobalX says the common thread has been \nhigher interest rates making future cash flows seem less attractive; a painful blow for a sector where almost all cash \nflows are far from being realised.\nTuckwell manages a hydrogen exchange-traded fund.\nAside from interest rates, he says investors have been scared away from the hydrogen sector by frequent dilutive \nshare issuances and the threat that Donald Trump could scrap President Joe Biden's hydrogen incentives if he \nregains power.\nAmid this market carnage, the International Energy Agency still reckons global demand for hydrogen will more than \ntriple by 2050 if nations keep to their \"announced pledges\". The IEA believes demand for \"low-emissions\" hydrogen \nwill rise 25-fold by 2030 if those announced pledges are kept intact, and 246-fold by 2050.\nThe hard part is determining which of hydrogen's many uses will be adopted at scale, and then how to invest in \nthose applications.\nAsset manager Mirova's sustainability equity fund took its first cautious steps into hydrogen last year when it \npurchased shares in Euronext company Air Liquide.\nAir Liquide makes a range of industrial gases, and its hydrogen is made from both fossil fuels and renewable \npower.\nMirova analyst Cindy Huang reckons investing in incumbents like Air Liquide is the best way to get insights into how \nthe hydrogen sector will evolve, even if that means investing in a stock that currently has a big carbon footprint and \ndoes not offer pure exposure to hydrogen.\n\"We try to learn first from the individual company, and then through that company understand that part of the value \nchain,\" she says.\nAir Liquide and the other industrial gas producers that dabble in hydrogen, like Linde and US company Air \nProducts, have delivered much better returns for investors over the past three years than pure hydrogen stocks.\n\"Hopefully over time [we can] expand downwards through the value chain and hopefully identify more investment \ntargets,\" says Huang, adding that electrolyser makers could offer exciting, medium term growth.Page 3 of 3\nShould Fortescue buy its way to supremacy in hydrogen? Due Diligence\nBut Huang believes companies producing hydrogen fuel cells, or hydrogen for power generation, will require much \nmore patience and risk tolerance from investors.\nA separate Mirova fund has bypassed stocks to make direct investments in hydrogen businesses like Parisian taxi \ncompany Hype, which runs 400 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles refuelling at Hype's own stations.\nNo conversation about hydrogen is complete - in Australia at least - without mentioning Fortescue, the iron ore \nminer whose founder Andrew Forrest is the nation's biggest hydrogen bull.\nFortescue has built an electrolyser factory in Gladstone and has sanctioned its first green hydrogen project, a \n$US550 million hub in Arizona that will make low carbon hydrogen and offer refuelling services to hydrogen trucks.\nFortescue would need 1363 projects the size of that $US550 million hub to achieve its goal of producing 15 million \ntonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030.\nThe hub was acquired from Nikola and the two companies are working on a long-term supply agreement. \nFortescue's North America boss and former AGL chief executive Andy Vesey is now a director of Nikola.\nFortescue is also close to Hyzon, having acquired hydrogen-powered buses from the struggling company.\nBut Fortescue's most interesting relationship is with Plug; the iron ore miner has ordered electrolysers from Plug, \nand has floated the idea of giving Plug a stake in its Arizona hub under an equity swap that would give Fortescue a \nshareholding in one of Plug's projects in Texas.\nWhen Plug boss Andy Marsh updates investors on Tuesday, it will be exactly one year since he bruised Fortescue \nby suggesting the economics of the Gladstone electrolyser factory were not attractive enough for him to invest.\nPlug shares have since slumped 84 per cent for a market capitalisation of $US1.46 billion. Fortescue's shares \nhave risen 22 per cent over the same period for an $85 billion valuation.\nWith a power imbalance like that, perhaps it is time for Fortescue to consider buying its way to hydrogen \nsupremacy, rather than building.\nLoad-Date: January 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
