Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: OPINION; Pg. 31\nLength: 1505 words\nByline: MARK DI STEFANO and HANNAH WOOTTON\nBody\nAndrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest beams out from the cover of the latest edition of TIME magazine. Hand on hip, Canadian \ntuxedo, he is shown emerging from the dust at Fortescue's Christmas Creek mine site in Western Australia: \"The \nplanet's unlikely ally\".\nTIME's slow descent from the world's most influential magazine to Boomers' outdated bathroom read is complete.\nAs TIME was pitching Twiggy for leading the global green revolution, the hydrogen bubble he has invested billions \nin is suffering. Last week, Fortescue announced it was considering halting its commissioned hydrogen projects. \nThis included its only significant project in the space: a green hydrogen refuelling plant in Arizona it has sunk \n$US550 million of capex into.\nBy sheer coincidence, last week was also when Nikola Motors filed for bankruptcy in the US.\nNikola had promised to be the Tesla of hydrogen-powered vehicles. At its peak in 2020, the car start-up was worth \n$US13 billion. It was pitching carbon-free trucks, and soon had a partnership with General Motors. Reservations \nwere coming out of its ears.\nNikola's hydrogen trucks (which are still relatively rare at a commercial scale) gained unwanted notoriety because \nof a 2018 video promo, showing one of them gliding through the desert. See it was true Nikola trucks were running \nwithout carbon-spewing engines, as the promo promised, but they weren't doing so on hydrogen. Instead, the \ncompany would admit in 2020, they were just rolling down gradual inclines.\nThen-CEO Trevor Milton was jailed for fraud. Nikola tried to push on with the hydrogen dream. It found a willing \nbuyer for its Arizona hydrogen refuelling plant in Fortescue, which paid $US24 million for the facility in 2023.\nBut any hope their trucks would one day exist at-scale was buried when the bankruptcy notice was signed by the \nhand of Nikola's former director Andy Vesey last week.\nVesey's a former CEO of AGL Energy. His current role is as the top clean energy executive in North America for \nFortescue.\nPage 2 of 4\nREAR WINDOW Twiggy's hydrogen bets might be nothing but 'philanthropy'\nTo complete the hat trick of hot air howlers, European hydrogen-powered truck outfit Hyvia also went into liquidation \nlast week. Hyvia was a joint venture by French carmaker Renault and US power company Plug Power - where \nTwiggy's interests make an appearance.\nFortescue had a memorandum of understanding to buy a stake in Plug's Texas green hydrogen project as part of \nits now-defunct expansion plans. They also planned to be partners for Fortescue's Gladstone hydrogen \nelectrolyser factory in Queensland. Neither deal eventuated.\nYou wouldn't know from the TIME article that Forrest's hydrogen plans have all the appeal of an inert gas. Instead, \nreaders bathe in marvelling at the \"climate activist-meets-zealous prosecutor\" who has \"rugged features\". It's funny \nhow these big features about Forrest are usually in northern hemisphere media. Local journos take his claims with a \nbigger grain of salt.\nTwiggy's \"crown jewel\", the TIME piece continues, is a $4 billion deal with German company Liebherr to turn \nFortescue's mining fleet green with battery and hydrogen-powered trucks. The first prototype of the latter arrived, \nnaturally, at TIME's photoshoot location in the Pilbara last year. Testing is still under way. Hopefully, there are a few \nhills around Christmas Creek he can push them down.\nBut if it doesn't work out? There is one telling concession in the TIME piece that Twiggy may be concerned that \nhydrogen is not the green money dream he envisaged. Dismissing quarterly returns as a \"lazy\" corporate fixation, \nhe tells TIME that people need to look to the medium or long term in their bets on decarbonisation. The company \nhas separately reiterated that while the timelines of its hydrogen projects have changed, the overall ambition has \nnot.\n\"And if we lose money on this in the long term, people say, well, that's philanthropy.\"\nThat is not a word you hear used to describe billions of dollars of shareholder investment for a listed company.\nNikola and Hyvia must be kicking themselves they didn't shrug off their bankruptcies to investors: Well, that's \nphilanthropy!\nAmbulance chasers circle Slater and Gordon over email leak\nIt's the circle of life, or at least of plaintiff law. The ambulance chasers at Slater and Gordon have become the \nchasees as rival compensation firms pitch for victims of the firm's mass data leak to become their clients.\nPersonal injury firm AC Lawyers, a boutique outfit on the New South Wales South Coast, posted a callout on \nFacebook. \"Impacted by the Slater & Gordon email leak? You may be able to make a claim for compensation. \nContact us for a confidential discussion,\" it shared with a link to its site.\nRivals were more subtle. Two Slaters employees affected by the leak told us they have been privately contacted by \ndifferent law firms inquiring whether staff were considering taking action.\nIt could even turn into a class action. More than 900 staff members were included in the privacy breach, which \ninvolved a \"fraudulent\" all-staff email.\nThe scandalous email, sent on Friday purportedly by the outgoing head of human resources Mari Ruiz-Matthyssen \n(which she denies sending), contained a spreadsheet detailing the salaries, bonuses, performance ratings and \ntenures of 906 staff members.\nThough Slaters has dismissed the email as full of inaccuracies, more than a dozen staffers confirmed the \ninformation it contained about their pay was correct.\nIt also contained serious allegations of misconduct by staff members within the human resources division, scathing \nassessments of their competency, and personal details. If they're true, it's a privacy complaint waiting to happen.Page 3 of 4\nREAR WINDOW Twiggy's hydrogen bets might be nothing but 'philanthropy'\nMaurice Blackburn, Slaters' main competitor, is already acting for the firm's former HR boss Alicia Gleeson in an \nemployment claim. It also took on former Slaters payroll manager Bridget Maddox's similar claim this week. Both \nmatters are unrelated to the email.\nSlaters has fought a few data breach court cases for victims before. It's even got one on foot with a massive class \naction on behalf of victims of the Optus hack. It was running one on the Medicare breach too, before it was wrapped \ninto Baker McKenzie's.\nSlaters has built its reputation on protecting employees who have been harmed in the course of their employment. \nThere must be a few corporates on the receiving end of the firm's class action tactics who are ready to watch this \nunfold with some healthy schadenfreude.\nPerhaps Slaters has picked up a few tricks on how to handle these matters if they're on the other side.\nBarrenjoey star's home sale after domestic fight\nBarrenjoey's co-head of equity markets, Dyson Bowditch, and his TV presenter wife, Jessica Bowditch, have hung \nthe \"for sale\" sign on their Victorian terrace home on Sydney Harbour.\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom house at Darling Point was recently listed by Sotheby's.\nBought by the pair for $7.9 million in 2021, it is listed for auction in a month's time. Considering its prime location, \nthere's talk that the agents and vendors are eyeing eight figures.\nDyson is one of the most high-profile bankers in Barrenjoey's stable, one level below founders Guy Fowler and \nMatthew Grounds. Jessica is a former TV presenter on Channel Seven and Ten. A night at their home has been the \ntalk of the finance community.\nIn November last year, police were called by Jessica to the home to respond to a domestic incident. A statement \nfrom police said the officers were told Jessica had allegedly assaulted Dyson. She was then charged with assault.\nThere were media reports the argument started over a watch bought overseas. There's not much more to say \nbecause Jessica is facing court in a few weeks, where it is understood she will deny the charge.\n\"The allegation is extremely minor and involves Ms Bowditch picking up a pillow and hitting Mr Bowditch with it,\" \nJessica's lawyer Paul McGirr said in a statement. \"Certainly this is not the crime of the century.\"\nDyson runs Barrenjoey's ECM unit with Jabe Jerram, with the two forming an inseparable double act in some of the \nlargest recent equity raises.\nDyson and Jabe co-ran the book on Barrenjoey's successful IPO of Guzman y Gomez last year. The duo were \nworking the room on the ASX floor in June.\nSome deals have been more successful than others. The ECM twins were behind the scenes for Star \nEntertainment's more than $1.5 billion of new equity in 2023. The first, in February, raised $800 million at $1.20 a \nshare; the second, in November, was priced at 60\u00a2 a share for $750 million. The casino group is close to \nbankruptcy, and shares are now trading at 13\u00a2. They don't all soar like the burrito rocket!\nDyson and Jabe's appetite to take on deals others won't touch means they're in the orbit of the city's largest fund \nmanagers. Dyson has been spotted a few times grabbing coffee with Regal's Phil King down by Circular Quay.\nJessica has been keeping a low profile, raising the pair's two children. Both declined to comment. Friends say \nthey're now going through a divorce, and selling the house at the centre of last year's fight is part of that.\nLoad-Date: March 2, 2025Page 4 of 4\nREAR WINDOW Twiggy's hydrogen bets might be nothing but 'philanthropy'\nEnd of Document\n\nFormat your response as follows:\nTitle: [Title of the document]\nAuthor: [Author of the document]\nMedia Outlet: [Name of the media outlet]\nDate of Publication: [Date of publication]- (extract the date in the format Month Day, Year - IN ENGLISH)\nMedia type: ['National', 'Regional' or 'Industry-specific/Trade-press']\n\nHere is an example of document provided: Document(metadata='source': \"KnowledgeBase/CompanyAnalysis/Embraer/MediaCoverage/NewsEmbraer/What near-disasters, 'SNL' jabs mean for Alaska 's reputation.PDF\", 'page': [1, 2, 3], page_content='Page 1 of 3\nWhat near-disasters, 'SNL' jabs mean for Alaska 's reputation\nWhat near-disasters, 'SNL' jabs mean for Alaska's reputation - Correction \nAppended\nThe Seattle Times\nJanuary 25, 2024 Thursday\n Correction Appended\nCopyright 2024 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved\nSection: Pg.

In het akkoord erkent Philips geen schuld voor mogelijke schade bij pati\u00ebnten, die vreesden dat ze \nkanker, astma en andere aandoeningen hadden opgelopen door het gebruik van de Philips-apparaten. Het \nconcern kondigde gisteren ook aan dat zijn verzekeraars ruim \u20ac0,5 mrd van de kosten zullen vergoeden.\nDe schikking betreft zowel de claims voor medische schade als voor medische controle voor pati\u00ebnten. \nClaimadvocaten hadden meer dan 760 zaken aangebracht. Nog eens 60.000 pati\u00ebnten hadden zich laten \nregistreren om in een later stadium aanspraak te kunnen maken op een vergoeding. Hoeveel geld afzonderlijke \npati\u00ebnten ontvangen, is nog niet duidelijk. Het is aan de advocaten om het totaalbedrag onder hun cli\u00ebnten te \nverdelen. Philips heeft zich stevig verweerd tegen de schadeclaims. Volgens het bedrijf is uit onderzoek gebleken \ndat de uitstoot van schadelijke stoffen te gering was om ernstige gezondheidsschade te kunnen veroorzaken. \nPhilips stemde toch in met een schikking omdat de uitkomst van rechtszaken moeilijk te voorspellen is. In het \nAmerikaanse rechtssysteem kunnen jury's soms onverwacht grote schadevergoedingen toekennen. Eerder \nbereikte Philips al een akkoord over economische schade voor pati\u00ebnten, evenals een schikkingsakkoord met de \nAmerikaanse medische toezichthouder, de FDA. Met de nieuwe, tweeledige schikking zijn de totale kosten voor het \nafhandelen van de apneuaffaire opgelopen tot \u20ac5,2 mrd, zo blijkt uit berekeningen van het FD.....\nHere is the output you should provide:\nTitle: Spectaculaire koerswinst Philips na schikking van apneuaffaire\nAuthor: Anonymous\nMedia Outlet: Het Financieele Dagblad\nDate of Publication: 30 april, 2024\nMedia type: National\n\nHere is a fifth example of document provided: Document(metadata='source': 'KnowledgeBase/MediaCoverageAnalytics/Swissport/NewsSwissport/Ontluisterend rapport over bagagetillen op Schiphol_ medewerkers sjouwen zich nog tien jaar een breu.PDF', 'page': [1, 2, 3], page_content=\"Page 1 of 3\nOntluisterend rapport over bagagetillen op Schiphol: medewerkers sjouwen zich nog tien jaar een breuk\nOntluisterend rapport over bagagetillen op Schiphol: medewerkers sjouwen \nzich nog tien jaar een breuk\nPZC.nl\n16 september 2023 zaterdag 01:00 AM GMT\nCopyright 2023 DPG Media B.V.
