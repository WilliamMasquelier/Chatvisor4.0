And we'll be more than pleased to \nexplain why real zero is the cut-through for financing what I call the economic transition,\" he said.\nTrump, a climate sceptic, has vowed to junk President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which is offering \n$US369 billion of subsidies and incentives to companies involved in the energy transition, including Fortescue.\nInstead, he wants the federal government to get behind a renewed expansion of the oil and gas industry, using the \nslogan \"drill, baby, drill\".\nDr Forrest conceded the slogan was \"kind of interesting, catchy\".\n\"But look where it's got us - it's got us to unreliable, unpredictable, fluctuating energy prices, which have had an \nextreme negative effect on everyone's living costs,\" he said.\n\"What I say is, 'build, baby, build': build out these [green energy] systems, replace fossil fuel completely and \nforever, and it's a great investment.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest uses dollars to make sense with Trump Energy transition\n\"What the president-elect will look at hard, climate sceptic or not, is that the best investment the US can make is \nsitting on the table.

Dr Forrest described the company as one of Australia's biggest greenhouse gas polluters at the weekend, \nbut said it could convert the burning of one billion litres of diesel equivalent a year into \"long-term profitable green \nenergy assets\" by 2030.\nLoad-Date: November 29, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Brad Thompson\nDate: November 19, 2024\nTitle: Fortescue names exec to drive unit\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: ELECTRIC VISION\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Cameron England\n### Date: November 22, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nELECTRIC VISION\nELECTRIC VISION\nThe Australian\nNovember 22, 2024 Friday\nTheList Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: Pg. 29\nLength: 989 words\nByline: By Cameron England\nBody\nWhat was once a pipe dream is becoming a reality now that mining industry giants are investing in zero-emissions \nsolutions, but there's still a long way to go. By Cameron England\nELECTRIC VEHICLES MIGHT still be a green badge of honour in our cities but, at Twiggy Forrest's Pilbara \noperations, they're part of a revolution helping to transform Australia's mining sites. Those pictures of giant, diesel-\nhungry haul trucks and trains that have defined the nation's mining sector for decades may soon be consigned to \nthe history books as resource companies go electric.\nFortescue, for example, is in the process of purchasing 360 autonomous battery-electric trucks, 55 electric \nexcavators and 60 battery-powered dozers as it joins other big miners, such as BHP, in a bid to solve the sector's \ndependency on diesel. But it's an expensive transition and with upfront capital costs up to double that of diesel, \nsome players in the mining sector are looking for government help.\nIn a recent report, the Electric Mine Consortium, which counted South32, Barminco, IGO and Sandfire as members, \ncalled for tax incentives to help drive mine electrification, arguing it could reduce operating costs to 56-88 per cent \nof the diesel-powered equivalent. The report says there were significant financial and health and safety benefits \nfrom going electric, but the cost was a deterrent. Only 60 per cent of Australian miners say they will transition to \nelectric power in their next development.\nThe report says high capital cost is the primary barrier to adopting electric equipment for 76 per cent of miners \nsurveyed, while 50 per cent lack confidence in its operational effectiveness. \"Across the Australian industry, there is \na clear consensus that the major barriers to progress are the capital cost and the confidence in new electric \nequipment,\" the report says.\nCapital tax incentives - such as Canada's 30 per cent investment tax credit and its accelerated capital cost \nallowance which allows faster depreciation - would help, according to the report. It also notes that Australia's diesel \ntax credit will cost taxpayers $37bn from 2024-30 but, not surprisingly, with such industry dependence on diesel, it \nstops short of arguing for its removal.\nPage 2 of 2\nELECTRIC VISION\nDespite the costs, the big miners are increasingly talking up their commitment to dump diesel, and some are \ndeveloping radical technology solutions as part of the transition. BHP, for example, will trial a new energy transfer \nsystem in its Caterpillar vehicles at its Jimblebar and Escondida sites. The dynamic energy transfer system \nconverts energy from the mine site's power source, uses an electrified rail system to transfer the energy to the \ntruck, and a machine system to transfer the energy to the truck's powertrain.\nCaterpillar, one of the world's biggest suppliers of diesel-powered heavy vehicles, says the rail system is a \"highly \ndeployable, mobile solution that can be customised to customers' specific site layouts\".\nBHP plans to source 500MW of renewable power and storage in the Pilbara by 2030 and says it will have its first \nall-electric truck fleet operating before the end of the decade. The global miner says it is on track to deliver \"at least\" \na 30 per cent reduction in scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 against a 2020 baseline, and has \nmaintained its aspirational target to be net zero by 2050.\nFortescue, meanwhile, has signed a $US2.8bn ($4.2bn) deal with German truck manufacturer Liebherr, which \naims to convert two-thirds of its mining fleet to zero-emissions battery technology over the next couple of years.\nPart of the Fortescue push has its genesis in Formula 1 technology: two years ago, the miner bought Williams \nAdvanced Engineering, an offshoot of the legendary F1 team founded by the late Sir Frank Williams. The \ncompany's battery technology will play a key role in enabling Fortescue to electrify its haul fleet, with rapid charging \nat the core of its strategy. The fast-charging F1 technology can charge a haul truck in 30 minutes, providing six \nhours of run-time, and Fortescue chief executive Dino Otranto says that while that's impressive, it's just the \nbeginning.\n\"We've got a concept called boost charging in the works, which could bring the current charging time of minutes \ndown to seconds,\" says Otranto. \"That will unlock even further productivity increases. As it stands, the first \ngeneration charger and power system combination is already a better offering than its diesel equivalent in the \nmarket.\" The deal with Liebherr builds on a 2022 purchase of 120 haul trucks from the German company.\nThe problem of heavy haul vehicles queued for charging is an issue for the miners, but Fortescue will use a robotic \ncharging system, which, combined with the fast charging times and autonomous vehicle operation, is designed to \nsolve that issue.\nFour autonomous trucks are now being checked at Fortescue's testing site, with the first deployment on site \nexpected in the first quarter of 2025 with validation of the complete autonomous battery-electric solution expected in \nearly 2026. Fortescue also aims to sell its technology to other companies in the mining sector, once it has been \nproved up.\nIn its 2024 Global Metals and Mining Outlook, KPMG said the resources sector would have to pull off a remarkable \nfeat in coming years - both dramatically reducing its carbon footprint while increasing minerals output. \"Global \ndemand for minerals indispensable to a low-carbon economy, such as copper, lithium, cobalt, nickel and graphite, is \nexpected to increase fourfold by 2040,\" the professional services firm said. \"At the same time, metals and mining \ncompanies are highly carbon intensive. The mining industry accounts for two to three per cent of global carbon \nemissions and metals production comprises an additional eight to 10 per cent.",
