Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 19\nLength: 539 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue chairman Andrew Forrest has told his leadership team they must commit to corporate diversity and \nsupport for same-sex couples, prompting energy boss Mark Hutchinson to issue an apology for how he handled \nbeing linked to a religious group that promotes anti-LGBTQIA+ values.\nDr Forrest and Mr Hutchinson both wrote internal messages to appease Fortescue staff on Sunday night, after Mr \nHutchinson was required to square the company's inclusive values with his directorship of Christian organisation \nAlpha International, which believes in a strictly heteronormative sexual ideology.\nAlpha International broadcasts video sermons that tell teenagers that Jesus wants to \"guide\" their sexuality and that \nthe Bible is \"clear\" that sex should exclusively occur between men and women within marriage.\nMr Hutchinson declined to comment for a fortnight when The Australian Financial Review asked him whether those \nviews were compatible with Fortescue's stated diversity values, which include support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, questioning, intersex and asexual people.\nHe broke his silence on Friday with generalised references to his love for diversity, but no explicit assurance for \nLGBTQIA+ employees. The message prompted some Fortescue staff to raise their concerns with the board.\nDr Forrest's comments appeared to validate their anguish.\n\"I understand and acknowledge exactly what you felt, and I thank you for bringing it to me,\" said Dr Forrest in the \nnote to staff. \"I would like to reassure you all on behalf of our board, that we are resolutely committed to the cause \nof equal rights. We expect and require the same of our leadership.\n\"We deeply value Fortescue's LGBTQIA+ community. At a personal level, I stand with you.\"\nMr Hutchinson issued his own apology on Sunday night when he declared his support for sexual equality at \nFortescue.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue chief to staff: 'I have let you down'\n\"After speaking with some of you over the past few days, I am aware that by failing to clarify my views on same-sex \nrelationships in my comments last week that I have let you down,\" he said.\n\"This was certainly not my intention, and I apologise unreservedly. I wish to state clearly that I am supportive of \neveryone in a same-sex marriage and same-sex relationships and value the LGBTQIA+ community. I believe that \nall of us are equal, and I accept and support every member of our team.\"\nMr Hutchinson remains a director of Alpha, according to corporate records.\n\"I have always supported and lived by all Fortescue values and policies and this is what leads me every day in my \nrole as energy CEO,\" he said.\nFortescue has two chief executives, Mr Hutchison and Dino Otranto, who runs the company's iron ore business.\nDr Forrest said Fortescue's commitment to diversity was not just about social benefit, but designed to ensure the \ncompany had access to the best minds.\n\"If we are to stop the uncontrolled march of climate change, we need every mind at the table. Focused and free. \nThat means working relentlessly to cultivate a culture where everyone feels comfortable to bring their full self to \nwork,\" he said.\nFortescue has an in-house community of LGBTQIA+ staff called Fortitude. The WA Chamber of Commerce and \nIndustry has praised the company for its work on corporate diversity.\nLoad-Date: October 31, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
