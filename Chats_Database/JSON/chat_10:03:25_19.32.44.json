Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Fortescue | Not mentioned | \"Fortescue will no longer buy voluntary carbon offsets unless required by law, as offsets have been shown to be troubled by extensive concerns about quality, lack of additionality and an inability to deliver real reductions in emissions.\" | N.A. |\n| Fortescue | Not mentioned | \"Fortescue has a plan to decarbonise our Australian terrestrial iron ore operations (Scope 1 and 2) in the Pilbara by 2030.\" | N.A. |\n| Fortescue | Not mentioned | \"We have identified the solutions needed to eliminate approximately 90 per cent of terrestrial ... emissions from our Australian iron ore operations and are actively working to identify solutions for the final approximately 10 per cent.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder of Fortescue | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
