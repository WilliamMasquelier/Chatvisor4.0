What we need you to do is go back to \nAustralia and work out how to combine the vast renewable energy resources you have up there in the Pilbara, with \nyour supply chain for iron ore. Bring those -together in Port Hedland or at the Rio Tinto ports, and convert that iron \nore into green iron and be able to ship it to us',\" Mr Masterman said.\n\"The best place in the world to take the carbon emissions out of iron steel making is in northwestern Australia. So \nthe industrial logic is there, the cost structures are there, and we believe in rapidly advancing technology to be able \nto scale up and really take emissions in this space \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to zero in a way that just cannot be done with the other \ntechnologies.\" Element Zero's technology, developed by Mr Masterman and former Fortescue chief scientist Bart \nKolodziejczyk, involves removing many of the impurities in iron ore by running renewable electricity through a \nchemical -solution.\nPage 2 of 2\nEx-Fortescue exec blasts hydrogen claims\nMr Masterman said such an approach would require less renewable energy than rival plans involving hydrogen DRI \n(direct reduced ironmaking), which require using renewable energy to produce hydrogen that is then used to \nprocess the iron ore.\n\"The reason why this technology is superior to, say, hydrogen DRI is that we don't have a loss associated with \nmaking hydrogen in the first place,\" he said.\n\"At the moment, hydrogen DRI takes green electrons, which as everybody has said is scarce, and loses 25 per cent \nwhen -converting to hydrogen \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Our technology uses the green electrons directly and it can use them on an \nintermittent basis.\" Mr Masterman had a long -association with Fortescue and Dr Forrest, having previously worked \nas the chief financial officer of the company's green energy arm Fortescue Future Industries and chairing Dr \nForrest's privately owned renewable energy group Squadron Energy.\nFortescue earlier this year won court orders authorising searches of Element Zero's offices after accusing the \nformer Fortescue employees at the company of taking its intellectual property with them when they quit. Element \nZero has described the claims as \"spurious\" and \"entirely without merit\".\nElement Zero has been testing its technologies on iron ores from across Australia, and the company is now \nplanning to build a plant in Port Hedland that will process five million tonnes a year of iron ore into 2.6 million tonnes \nof green iron. Mr Masterman says the technology is scalable so can be easily expanded over time.\nThe output, he said, would be \"vastly superior\" to that currently produced in blast furnaces around the world. \"The \nkey to actually making this business chain or supply chain work is being able to harness the great amounts of iron \nore produced out of Port Hedland with the vast renewable -assets that are available and -deployable in the Pilbara \nof Western Australia, through our manufacturing plants to produce high-quality green iron that can go to all the \nmajor steel mills of the world, and they can then save 70 per cent of their carbon emissions by taking our green \niron,\" he said.\nLoad-Date: June 18, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
