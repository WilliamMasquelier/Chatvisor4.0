Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Fiona Hick | Former Fortescue chief executive | \"I'm thrilled to be joining the board and supporting Evolution's exciting future.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue founder | \"What we have now is a literally galloping herd of people who want to see this company go green.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue founder | \"You either get on the bus or get off the bus, but you make the choice.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue founder | \"No one was pushed.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue founder | \"Executives who had left the iron ore major had struggled to cope with the 'boiler room' conditions of the company and were not following his green vision.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
