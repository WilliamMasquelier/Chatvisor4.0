Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 698 words\nHighlight: The health of China's economy will be a key focus for investors when big miners BHP, Rio Tinto and \nFortescue report their results this week.\nBody\nInvestors will this week be seeking reassurance from Australia's largest miners that there are no shocks in store \nfrom China's economy as it kicks back into gear following a week-long holiday for the Lunar New Year.\nThese issues will come under intense scrutiny when BHP reports its half-year results on Tuesday, followed by Rio \nTinto on Wednesday and then Fortescue.\nThe share prices of all three miners started 2024 at record highs, with iron ore prices soaring through the $US140-\nmark on the promise of fresh stimulus measures in China. But these stocks retreated over the past month as \nworries returned about China's economic malaise and its impact on iron ore demand.\nIt is a significant issue for BHP and Rio, which both count on China for more than half of their revenue. For \nFortescue, the figure is closer to 90 per cent.\nAnd it will be of significance in Canberra as well, with iron ore accounting for around 60 per cent of the value of \nAustralian exports to China in recent years.\n\"The first dark cloud is growing concerns about the Chinese property markets and Chinese economy,\" investment \nbanking group Jefferies said in a recent report.\nJeffries also flagged concerns about non-residential construction outside China, including the US commercial real \nestate market, which is buckling under significant debt and low valuations.\n\"The problem, in each case, is that things are more likely to get worse before they get better,\" the banking group's \nanalysts said.\nOne bright spot for China's economy is that travel and spending patterns during China's most important holiday \nbreak indicate that domestic consumption has rebounded, despite the economic struggle with deflation and a \nproperty crisis. It has primed China's sharemarkets for a strong opening this week.\nANZ senior commodity strategist Daniel Hynes doubted even a potential stimulus package from the Chinese \ngovernment - something that investors have been discussing for months - would cure the country's economic woes.\nPage 2 of 2\nMining giants BHP , Rio and Fortescue to watch China as they post results\n\"I think the stimulus will help stem the fall that we've seen in property investment and construction activity, but that \nwon't ignite another rally like we've seen in the past,\" he said.\nThis is crucial for Australian miners, as property and construction account for half of the 1 billion tonnes of steel \nChina produces annually. But Hynes said iron ore miners were helping their own cause by recognising that growth \nin steel demand is reaching its limits.\n\"They're now talking about peak steel demand and that did instigate a bit of a review of their projects,\" he said.\nHynes said he expected this to pay off over the medium term as miners balance supply and demand.\n\"We actually have the iron ore market, remaining relatively tight over the next two to three years. On the back of \nthat lower growth in supply.\"\nAccording to Macquarie Equities, consensus estimates expected a $US6.5 billion ($10 billion) underlying profit from \nBHP for the half year, a full-year profit of $US11.6 billion from Rio for the year ending December 31, and $US3.3 \nbillion from Fortescue's half year.\nWhile BHP is a diversified miner, iron ore dwarfs the contribution of the other businesses.\nMacquarie forecasts that iron ore earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will reach $US9.8 \nbillion, followed by copper with $US3.1 billion and coal at $US1.1 billion.\nBHP confirmed last week that its nickel business would make no contribution to earnings, after writing down the \nvalue of the loss-making business to zero.\nThe Albanese government subsequently added nickel to its critical minerals list, which opens access to potentially \nbillions of dollars in government funding, and the West Australian government has also offered royalty relief for the \nnickel industry.\n\"The nickel industry supported almost 10,000 jobs, and generated sales of more than $5 billion last financial year,\" \nWA Premier Roger Cook said on Saturday while announcing the package.\n\"It is also an essential component of the state's vision of becoming a global hub for the downstream processing of \nbattery metals.\"\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.
