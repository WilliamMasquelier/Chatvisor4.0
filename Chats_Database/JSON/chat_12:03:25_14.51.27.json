About 85 per cent of that money, however, stays in the Western world.\nCanadian pension fund buying a Swedish wind farm, \" he said. \"Whereas last year, green bonds in Africa were 0.1 \nper cent of the total green bond deployment.\"\nThe developing world, where populations are growing even as those in developed economies and China are \nflatlining or shrinking, doesn't have the funds to finance a transition to clean energy and, Varro says, there is no \ntime and no carbon budget (if net zero is to be achieved as targeted) for it to have a conventional industrialisation \nand then make that transition.\nThe good news, he said, is that the technology that makes a transition plausible is solar and most developing \ncountries are close to the equator. Scale \"leapfrogging\" - largely bypassing fossil fuel-based energy systems and \nPage 2 of 3\nThe two major threats to a 'net zero' world\njumping straight to solar or hydro while using natural gas as the reserve - is already occurring in Africa and \nelsewhere.\nA two-thirds renewables, one-third natural gas combination produces roughly 100 kg of carbon dioxide per \nmegawatt of power, or less than half the current European or US average, Varro said.\n(Varro and his team at Shell, a major gas producer, see the impact of electric cars resulting in peak oil demand \nsomewhere between 2025 and 2035, but see a significant future for natural gas - for use in heavy industry or as \nreserve power for renewable systems that are weather dependent - even in a net-zero environment, with carbon \ncapture and storage or removal playing a role).\n'A London every quarter'\nUnfortunately, while the developing world might be leapfrogging its way towards cleaner energy, it is also rapidly \nurbanising and building the infrastructure to accommodate the large shifts in populations towards urban centres.\n\"Urbanisation is currently running at the speed of a London every quarter,\" Varro said.\n\"This is the people who live in their villages and move to Cairo, or Nairobi or Jakarta or Karachi. That's a London \nevery quarter and that is concrete and steel and glass and plastics and aluminium. All these are very energy-\nintensive commodities; altogether representing around 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.\"\nThere's also that paucity of investment for clean energy in the developing world. Varro says Shell's best estimate is \nthat the developing world needs about seven times the level of clean energy investment that is occurring within the \ndeveloped world.\nAnd that is difficult to imagine, he said, given the segmentation of the global financial system - which makes it a \nfactor that could cause the transition to net-zero emissions to fail.\nThe maths of net zero are quite daunting. In 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that to \nachieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by 2050 the carbon budget - the cumulative emissions - \nwould be 500 gigatonnes (Gt).\nFrom the starting point of January 1, 2020 to the end of 2022, however, there has already been about 120 Gt of \nemissions. With annual global emissions of more than 40 Gt in 2023, you don't have to be Einstein to see how \nchallenging keeping within, or anywhere close to, that emissions budget will be and how significant a role \ndeveloping economies - and China - will have in the success or failure of the transition.\nGeopolitics, therefore, represents the other major threat.\nChina leads the world in the mass production of clean-energy technologies, whether it's EVs, batteries, solar \npanels, wind turbines or the processing of the critical minerals required.\nIts economy is also still heavily dependent on coal, despite a massive state-directed and subsidised deployment of \nclean-power technologies. Varro said China's domestic coal-mining output last year increased by more than \nAustralia's entire exports of LNG.\nChina is, however, the largest EV manufacturer in the world and the EV market share in its domestic market is \napproaching 50 per cent. That will affect its own emissions and, to the extent that it is able to export its EVs, those \nof third countries.\nThis month's announcement of new punitive tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, batteries, solar cells and critical \nminers by the Biden administration - made to protect the massive investments in green technologies sparked by \nAmerica's Inflation Reduction Act and also influenced by the domestic political sensitivity of the US auto industry in \nan election year - is being criticised outside America because of the impact it will have on the takeup of EVs and \nother clean energy technologies, and therefore on the rate at which carbon emissions are reduced.Page 3 of 3\nThe two major threats to a 'net zero' world\nThe higher prices for electric cars built in the US or Europe (which is close to imposing its own tariffs on Chinese \nEVs) and the need to develop their own critical minerals and battery supply chains will slow the takeup of EVs in the \nUS and Europe.\n'Predictable surprise'\nThe \"next predictable surprise\" is a flood of cheap Chinese EVs into developing economies, says Varro.\nChina's clean energy \"cluster\" has, he said, genuinely unique capabilities and, given the challenging geopolitical \ncontext, how the tensions are resolved is one of the key uncertainties, with the potential to facilitate or slow down \nthe global energy transition.\nHow the financial gap between the Western world and the developing world, and China's unique capabilities are \nmanaged can therefore \"make a difference between success or failure,\" says Varro.\nWhile he thinks there are plausible routes to net zero, they will involve massive and disruptive government \ninterventions in energy systems, economies and societies and a reduction in geopolitical tensions that have been \nintensifying rather than waning.\nToday, those outcomes do seem unlikely.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

In all, Victoria sees potential for 13GW of offshore \nwind capacity by 2050, five times the current renewable generation in Victoria.\nThe target drew a plethora of some of the world's largest global energy companies to submit an application for a so-\ncalled feasibility licence, and Shell was understood to have been told late last year that it was in line to -secure a \npermit if it could overcome a boundary dispute.\nUntangling the dispute was seen as inevitable, but Shell determined it would not proceed with its initial application \nas it delivers on chief executive Wael Sawan's commitment to be \"ruthless\" in focusing on financial performance. A \nShell spokeswoman -confirmed the decision, but said the company remained confident in the viability of offshore \nwind in Australia.\n\"After careful consideration, including more than two years of pre-feasibility work, Shell Australia withdrew from the \nfeasibility licence application process for offshore wind development in Gippsland, Victoria earlier this year,\" a \nspokeswoman said.\n\"In Australia, Shell is focusing on growing our low-carbon -energy portfolio including via -onshore wind and battery \nenergy storage projects. Australia's abundant offshore wind resources have strong -potential to help Australia \nachieve net zero emissions by 2050 and Shell continues to have confidence in the establishment of a sustainable \nAustralian offshore wind industry.\" Despite Shell's public commitment to the industry, Australia's offshore wind \nindustry was expected to be extremely expensive, industry sources said. While the industry expected costs to come \nPage 2 of 2\nShell quietly shelves offshore wind plans\ndown, industry sources said current projections had new projects costing about $300 per megawatt, well in excess \nof the current wholesale price of about $120.\nOffshore wind is substantially more expensive than onshore wind and solar, and Shell is understood to have \ndeveloped plans to focus instead on onshore alternatives.\nThere are also substantial costs associated with moving towards a final investment decision associated with \noffshore wind.\nThe 12 projects granted a feasibility licence by the federal Labor government will now begin seabed and \nenvironmental studies to confirm the suitability for an offshore wind project.\nShould all projects proceed to construction, the industry is also concerned about winners being picked.\nThe 12 projects that have -secured a feasibility licence have a combined capacity of 25GW, nearly double the target \nVictoria has offered to underwrite.\nSources familiar with the thinking of the Victorian government acknowledge that not all the 12 projects are likely to -\nmaterialise and those that do will be ready at different times.\nVictoria plans to incrementally stimulate developments. It has scheduled staggered so-called contract for different \nauditions that will determine how much fin-ancial support is offered to developers.\nThere are concerns about Victoria's capacity to pay as the state budget deficit increases. However, the industry \nacknowledges that offshore wind is vital for the country's transition.\nVictoria has Australia's most aggressive climate goals. Victoria plans to have zero emission sources account for 95 \nper cent of its energy needs by 2035 and to be net zero by 2045.\nThe target is likely to end the use of coal in the state, with EnergyAustralia's Yallourn set to close in 2028, while the \nstate's largest, AGL Energy's Loy Yang A, is expected to shutter in 2035.\nA Victorian government spokesman said: \"We're building Australia's first offshore wind energy industry and learning \nfrom global leaders in the sector to ensure our auction process is competitive and results in the timely delivery of \nprojects.\n\"It is normal for developers to explore projects and then stop work on them, for a variety of reasons internal to their \nbusiness.\" He said the 12 approved offshore wind projects could \"generate 25GW of electricity - more than enough \nto meet Victoria's energy needs\".\nLoad-Date: May 29, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Colin Packham\nDate: May 30, 2024\nTitle: Shell quietly shelves offshore wind plans\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Resources giants headed to court over $86 million clean-up bill\n## Media outlet: Brisbane Times\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: May 30, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nResources giants headed to court over $86 million clean-up bill\nResources giants headed to court over $86 million clean-up bill\nBrisbane Times\nMay 30, 2024 Thursday 3:40 AM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
