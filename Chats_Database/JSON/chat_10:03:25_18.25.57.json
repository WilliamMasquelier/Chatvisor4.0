It now has to prove itself with its ambitious \\nplan to take its production level to 500,000 ounces of gold annually.\\nBut if it pulls it off, it will become the third-largest gold miner in Australia.\\nSo far it has impressed, with the once embattled Westgold Resources soaring in value from $300m to over $1bn \\nunder Mr Bramwell's leadership.\\nAnd one of the reasons it is interested is it believes Karora had been producing 170,000 ounces of gold, when it \\nshould have been producing about 200,000, as it had earlier forecast.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nDual listing the price Westgold has to pay for deal - DATA ROOM\\nGold miners are currently cashed-up on the back of the buoyant gold price. Now the question is whether Ramelius \\nResources pounces on Spartan Resources (formerly Gascoyne), which is said to be on its radar given the close \\nproximity of its assets to Spartan's.\\nYet the speculation has been around for a while and it is still to move, leaving some to think Ramelius sees \\nSpartan as over-priced for now.\\nAs gold mining consolidation continues apace, the other deal some believe will play out over the medium term is an \\nacquisition by Northern Star of the $2.5bn De Grey Mining.\\nNorthern Star's first priority is rebuilding the processing plant of the Super Pit gold mining asset that it owns, but \\nafter that attention will likely turn to De Grey.\\nThis is why many found its presence at Newcrest's Telfer mine and Havieron processing facility on a site visit in \\nrecent weeks curious.\\nNorthern Star sources say it has no interest in Telfer, but it's very close to De Grey's assets, so perhaps it was there \\nwhile on a De Grey site visit, determining whether gold could be processed there.\\nMeanwhile, the terms of Westgold's deal will see Karora shareholders receiving 2.524 Westgold shares and 68c \\ncash a.\\nThe offer represents about $6.60 per Karora share based on Westgold's closing share price on the ASX of $2.28 on \\nApril 5.\\nIt represents a 10.1 per cent premium to Karora's closing share price on the TSX of $5.99 ($C5.36) on April 5.\\nWestgold shareholders will own 50.1 per cent of the combined company. Westgold, advised by Argonaut and \\ncurrently producing about 220,000 ounces of gold from its underground and open pit mines in Western Australia, \\nsays the business is capable of producing 400,000 ounces of gold per annum from Western Australia assets and \\nestimates operating synergies of $209m and estimated corporate savings of $281m.

The Fund performance compared to a 21% sterling return \\nregistered by the Gold Bugs Index and the GDXJ equity ETF. However, we anticipate that the lag in performance of \\nthe smaller equities held in the Fund will catch-up with larger peers given their relatively attractive valuations.\\nGold was one of the stronger commodities with the price rising over 9% during March to new all-time highs. Silver is \\nlatterly starting to catch-up, registering a 10% price increase over the month. Prices held despite a more hawkish \\nmove in US FED rate expectations after FOMC minutes indicated broader US labour markets were stubbornly \\nresilient despite relatively tepid economic growth. Increasingly there appears to be a focus on ever growing \\ngovernment debt levels which have shown little sign of reversing, as evidence by the latest US congression Budget \\nOffice projections.\\nRecent physical gold buying has been led by China, with a pick-up in retail demand showing in import data. This \\nhas been potentially driven by broader concerns on the economy, particularly the weak regional property sector. \\nAlongside this is the healthy net central bank demand: People's Bank of China (PBoC) data showed China's gold \\nreserves continued to rise with the addition of 0.39 Moz in February taking official reserves to 72.6Moz (+10% year-\\non-year). Physical gold ETF's showed a pick-up in buying but aggregate holdings nevertheless ended 246k ounces \\nlower over the month. We believe gold hitting all-time highs despite steady ETF selling is a positive, as would also \\nbe the case should ETF's turn steady buyers, further tightening the market.Page 3 of 4\\nMonthly Investor Report - March 2024\\nWest African Resources and Fortuna Gold and Silver were strong contributors to performance. This was closely \\nfollowed by Australian gold producer Karora which received bid interest from ASX-listed Ramelius, as well as \\nreports of a further interested party also in discussion with the company. While we do not focus our stock selection \\nspecifically on M&A targets, we believe quality undervalued assets should result in a higher probability of them \\nbecoming targets. The sector remains short of growth projects, and so we would anticipate a pick-up in M&A activity \\ngoing forward. This should help close the discounts of junior miners to the larger.

Limited All Rights Reserved\\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 24\\nLength: 1203 words\\nByline: Alex Gluyas\\nBody\\nIn the eight years since Collins St Asset Management was founded, chief investment officer Vasilios Piperoglou can \\nrecall only two occasions when a thematic has presented itself with enough \\\"significant asymmetry\\\" to justify a \\nmajor investment.\\nCollins St's value fund was an early backer of uranium, and its holdings in the sector jumped between 400 per cent \\nand 500 per cent over four years. The second was offshore oil services stocks, which surged between 300 per cent \\nand 350 per cent in two-and-a-half years. But Piperoglou is confident that Collins St's latest bet will produce even \\nbetter returns than both those opportunities.\\n\\\"With gold stocks, the way the asymmetry is playing out currently, I think there is a greater potential in this than the \\nother two ... we're seeing the very early signs of the start of a gold bull market,\\\" Piperoglou says.\\n\\\"At some stage, investors are going to get smacked in the face ... there will be a moment within months, not years, \\nwhere people wake up and these quality small caps will multibag.\\\"\\nA multibagger is every investor's dream - a stock that at least doubles in value. And while the best chance of finding \\none is at the smaller end of the market, those companies also present the highest risk. But Piperoglou believes the \\nlocal gold sector is filled with potential multibaggers, and it's only a matter of time before the record gold price flows \\nthrough to miners.\\nThat is why Collins St has spent the past 12 months undertaking its own due diligence by speaking to management \\nand visiting operations to construct what Piperoglou describes as a portfolio of \\\"some of the best, well-run, well-\\ncapitalised, pre-production plays on the ASX\\\".\\nAmong gold sector small caps, the value fund holds Barton Gold, Brightstar Resources, Tesoro Gold, Great \\nBoulder Resources, Meeka Metals and Odyssey Gold. At the larger end of the market, it holds Ramelius \\nResources and West Gold Resources.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nTaking a shine to the gold diggers; MONDAY FUNDIE\\nIndeed, Collins St's $200 million value fund has a long track record of spotting winners, and regularly appears \\namong the best performers in Mercer's investment survey. It was the top-ranked Australian long-only strategy in the \\nfive years to December, returning 24 per cent per annum, and also boasted a podium finish on a three-year time \\nhorizon. Its strong run of form has continued over the past nine months, with the fund returning 18.6 per cent, net of \\nfees, in the financial year to date, beating the S&P/ASX 200's 7.6 per cent gain over the same period.\\nCollins St has also reopened its special situation fund, which is targeting the local and international small-cap gold \\nsector following strong demand from clients. The firm believes that miners in North America are also looking cheap, \\nparticularly small- and mid-cap companies in Canada and the US.\\nMuch of the value fund's recent performance has been fuelled by an 11 per cent return in December when two of its \\nkey holdings - Carnarvon Energy and Link Administration - rallied sharply. While Collins St doesn't typically engage \\nin shareholder activism, the firm played a key role in rolling the board at Carnarvon in December amid frustrations \\nover its handling of its major offshore gas project majority-owned by Santos.\\nCollins St teamed up with Nero Resources Fund to raid Carnarvon's share register and force the company to \\npledge it would not acquire new assets, would cut administrative costs and work with Santos to speed up drilling at \\nthe Dorado field in which Carnarvon is a minority owner. The stock rallied nearly 44 per cent in December.\\n\\\"Usually when we buy a new position, we have no intention of being activist because it's a lot easier to make money \\nbeing passive,\\\" Piperoglou says.\\n\\\"We were willing on that occasion to throw down the gauntlet of having a pretty public fight, but thankfully it was the \\nquickest coup - within 24 hours they basically resigned.\\\"\\nThe value fund also benefited from a 60 per cent surge in Link shares in December following a $1.2 billion buyout \\noffer from Japanese financial services company Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. The bid ended a rollercoaster ride \\nfor shareholders over the past three years, when four other suitors attempted takeovers.\\nThe disastrous acquisition of a British company in 2017 also dragged Link into the messy collapse of the $7 billion \\nWoodford investment fund, which triggered heavy losses and a complex exit involving the financial regulator. \\\"At \\ntimes when we do have a significant amount of cash because we don't see much opportunity on the long end, we \\nplayed what we thought at the time was a low-risk takeover arbitrage,\\\" Piperoglou says, referring to its initial \\ninvestment in Link.\\n\\\"But that literally blew up in our face, and we were holding a position that halved in value, so we would argue that \\nwe got Link's takeover wrong.\\\"\\nPiperoglou admits that Collins St has still lost money on that investment, adding that if the fund hadn't bought \\nshares in Link, its two-year return would be at least 5 per cent higher.\\nCollins St is also bullish on energy, particularly oil and gas, and believes they will be crucial for decades to come as \\nthe world transitions towards renewable energy.\\nWhile financial institutions and governments have increasingly shied away from investing in the sector, Piperoglou \\nsays that demand for oil and gas remains robust while there is little incentive for new supply.\\n\\\"It's one of those weird disconnects, with underlying demand still going up every year, but you're not seeing enough \\ncapital expenditure on the supply side,\\\" he says. \\\"Those that are willing to participate and just be passive should \\nearn some pretty good double-digit returns.\\\"\\nThe value fund holds Beach Energy, but last month trimmed its position in the stock and reallocated that capital to \\nits investment in Carnarvon.\\nPiperoglou's first exposure to the sharemarket was at the ripe age of 12 years old when his father, a psychiatrist, \\nraided his piggy bank and bought him about $1200 of CSR shares due to its high dividend yield.Page 3 of 3\\nTaking a shine to the gold diggers; MONDAY FUNDIE\\nEvery six months, Piperoglou would study the company's dividend statement while also reading everything he could \\nabout Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway, which cemented in his mind that he wanted to run an investment \\nfund.\\nPiperoglou started investing in year 12, mainly in resources stocks, but admits he had no idea what he was doing \\nand made plenty of mistakes. His biggest winner was copper and gold miner Oxiana Resources, which he bought \\nat 8\\u00a2 and sold at $3.50.\\nFrom there, Piperoglou continued to follow financial markets and completed commerce and law degrees at Monash \\nUniversity. With few contacts in the financial services industry, he joined boutique firm Leyland Private Asset \\nManagement.\\nIt was there he met Michael Goldberg, a like-minded value investor who also believed in fundamental stock \\nanalysis. Over many lunches, the two came to the conclusion that the most efficient way to run a value-style \\ninvestment house was through a fund structure that was a standalone entity.\\nAfter five years at Leyland for Piperoglou and seven years for Goldberg, they established Collins St Asset \\nManagement in 2015 and have put their own money into the value fund.\\n\\\"We live and die by our stock picking ability,\\\" Piperoglou says.\\nLoad-Date: April 24, 2024\\nEnd of Document\",\n      \"Page 1 of 2\\nThe stocks fuelling Victor Smorgon's 40pc returns Fundie Q&A\\nThe stocks fuelling Victor Smorgon's 40pc returns; Fundie Q&A\\nAustralian Financial Review\\nMay 31, 2024 Friday\\nPrint & First Editions\\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

What has driven that performance? | The fund \\ninvests in several themes including gold, automation, decarbonisation, and emerging markets. Over the past three \\nmonths, performance has been led by investments in gold and decarbonisation.\\nThe largest contributor has been Australian gold miner Red 5, which has moved from developing an asset into \\ncommercial production. We've been a substantial shareholder since March 2021, and we have supported it through \\nthe development financing phase to its profitable production today.\\nJapanese company Hitachi has also added significant returns over the past two years. It's divested its legacy \\nconstruction machinery, chemicals, and metals businesses to focus on producing higher margin products with \\ngreater returns on capital, and with a higher propensity for cash flow generation. It has also sharpened its focus on \\nreturning cash to shareholders and growing dividends per share at a compound annual growth rate of 13.6 per cent \\nover the past five years.\\nHow much further do you expect the copper price to run and which stocks do you own? | We expect that copper \\ndemand will remain strong, with price upside driven by structural supply constraints.\\nWe like miners with strong leadership and proven records in creating shareholder returns and value low \\njurisdictional risk and higher-grade orebodies with expansion potential.\\nFor producing companies, we like Canadian miners Lundin Group and Capstone Copper.\\nAnother company we support is US-based mineral exploration company Ivanhoe Electric, which is developing the \\nSanta Cruz project and exploring for new major copper deposits in North America.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nThe stocks fuelling Victor Smorgon's 40pc returns Fundie Q&A\\nWe are also involved in BMC Minerals, which is developing one of the most exciting volcanogenic massive sulphide \\n(sources of copper, zinc, gold, silver) districts globally.\\nDo you expect the disconnect between gold prices and mining stocks to abate? Which stocks are best positioned? | \\nWe have noticed that a large majority of recent gold demand has come from BRICS nations, which are increasingly \\ntransacting with each other in their local currencies and settling the surplus with physical gold. This demand from \\nnon-Western buyers will continue to support the gold price.\\nWestern gold investors are preferring to invest in gold mining equities, and are less enthused by the gold bull \\nmarket, which has created this disconnect. If this trend continues, we believe it's more likely that gold equities will \\nreflect the gold price.\\nHistorically, the bottom of the cycle typically sees gold mining equities trade at a discount to the spot gold price and \\nhistoric average multiples. As the cycle peaks, analysts start to imply a forward price greater than spot, and a \\nmarket multiple above average.\\nAssuming the future rhymes with history, the greatest gains will be with smaller, higher-cost gold producers and \\nexplorers. For this reason, we like Ramelius Resources and Canada's Agnico Eagle.\\nWhat's a stock you're bullish on that investors might not have heard of? | Copper miner Metals Acquisition listed on \\nthe ASX this year after acquiring the NSW CSA copper mine in 2023. It's run by Mick McMullen, who has a track \\nrecord of turning around major mining companies globally.\\nWe believe the company's inception as a US-listed special purpose acquisition company and the capital structure \\ntied to its initial acquisition has turned many potential investors away.

Victor Smorgon Group's equities team, which manages in excess of $500m in \\nfunds across its equities strategies for members of the Smorgon family and private investors out of South Yarra in \\nMelbourne, has quickly made a name for itself as a stockpicker in the resources space.\\nTwo of the seven limbs of its global multi-strategy portfolio involve a gold and decarbonisation strategy, managed \\nrespectively by Cameron Judd and Ben Salter.\\nVSG's two big commodity bets have been playing out over the past seven years in gold, and three in \\ndecarbonisation, which counts its primary exposure as copper miners.\\nJudd and Salter came into VSG from their transaction with the Stawell gold mine in Victoria, a private operation that \\nexposed the gulf between the profitability of well-run gold mines and the valuations seen in equities.\\nEven with the massive rise in prices to $US2650/oz and recent pullback after Donald Trump's election win in the \\nUS, Judd remains bullish on the fundamental outlook for gold.\\n\\\"I know we've had a decent run in price, but the fundamentals for gold are very strong and I think will continue to get \\nstronger,\\\" Judd says.\\nWhile it can hold bullion, shorts and a limited number of pre-IPO opportunities, VSG is happy going long on gold \\nequities and investing in miners over physical gold, given inflationary pressures had eased and gold miners are \\ngrowing their margins.\\nJudd says the main things VSG looks for in its gold equity portfolio are liquidity, low jurisdictional risk and especially \\ncashflow.\\n\\\"In the near term we're happy with development stories but we want to be able to see growth in the near term not a \\nlong way out,\\\" he said. \\\"One of those investments was Red 5, now Vault Minerals. We started off back in 2018, \\nlooked at all the developers at the time, and Red was the one we thought had the most meat on the bones.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nBright prospects: Why gold and copper are set to shine in the next few years\\n\\\"Developers are notoriously volatile but it had more fat in that it could absorb any hiccups along the way. That's still \\na fairly large position for us, it's definitely a lot smaller than it was, but the way it's performing now and what we \\nthink it's going to be in the next 12 months, we're still very happy with that as cash generation and that's where \\nwe've positioned the -portfolio.\\\" After a merger with Silver Lake Resources, Vault is now trading at 34c with a \\nmarket cap of over $2bn.\\nOther names that fill a similar mould include Regis Resources and Ramelius Resources.\\n\\\"A gold mine should be printing cash, especially at these margins, so that's where we're positioned at the moment,\\\" \\nJudd says. \\\"We like Regis for the moment - it printed $85m in free cash in the last quarter and it should do a similar \\nor more amount in this next quarter.\\n\\\"Then we've also got the North American exposure. Calibre Mining Corp is one of those that we like that will \\nsignificantly increase their production of gold in the second quarter, they're saying, of next year, but we think a little \\nbit earlier.\\n\\\"The CEO Darren Hall is an Australian with significant experience and we think that it's an interesting project. It's \\ngoing to keep growing but also generating good cash, fully funded with a strong balance sheet.\\\" Carbon capers The \\ndecarbonisation strategy has grown from 3 per cent of the overall portfolio weighting in the global multi-strategy \\nfund to 18 per cent today.\\nMost of that is in copper, with VSG sidestepping the opaque and volatile lithium market that surged to record highs \\nin 2022 before crashing to loss-making levels this year.\\nSubstitution from aluminium and scrap could cap hopes from red metal optimists that copper could surge beyond \\nthe $US5/lb record prices seen earlier this year to $US6, $US8 or even $US10/lb. But portfolio manager Ben Salter \\nremains cautiously upbeat that supply will struggle to keep pace with demand as the electrification trend continues.\\n\\\"We're probably conservatively bullish I would say,\\\" Salter says. \\\"I'd say the market will be balanced next year but \\ntight, so not a lot of room for error. You can look at what happened in Panama (where the government suddenly \\nclosed First Quantum's Cobre Panama mine last year).\\n\\\"It took 400,000 tonnes of copper out of the market and that had a positive impact on everyone.\\n\\\"Over time, we think with the electrification of everything \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a6 probably the use of copper in grid spending especially \\nhelped by data centres (and) China electrification, we think copper will be in demand more than can be met by \\nsupply. Over the medium to long term there's a strong case for copper prices' escalation, but not immediately or not \\nspectacularly.\\\" Salter said that should facilitate good margins for producers and developers with good projects, with \\ncurrent prices around $US9000/tonne.\\nIn Australia, VSG likes MAC Copper, which owns the soon to be 50,000 tonnes per annum Cobar mine in NSW. \\nInternationally, NGEx Minerals is on its radar.
