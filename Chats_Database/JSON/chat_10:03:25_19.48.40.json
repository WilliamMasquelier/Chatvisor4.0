Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's Executive Chairman | \"this is probably the politically correct answer I need to give\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue's CEO | \"this is probably the politically correct answer I need to give\" | N.A. |\n| Shelley Robertson | Fortescue's Chief Operating Officer | \"Can someone explain the org structure? We have CEOs reporting to CEOs, directors to directors, and varying titles, despite being told it would be 'flattened'.\" | N.A. |\n| Fortescue Employee | Employee | \"Most of us can't afford a nice bottle of scotch.\" | N.A. |\n| Fortescue Employee | Employee | \"Why is the budget so tight at the minute? Are we expected to deliver world class service on a shoestring budget?\" | N.A. |\n| Fortescue Employee | Employee | \"Is there an opportunity in the future to expand on the CEO for a day initiative and participate if you are not a First Nations -employee?\" | N.A. |\n| Fortescue Employee | Employee | \"Instead of a Christmas party, can you give each department $150 per person to hold their own team party?\" | N.A. |\n| Spokeswoman | Not mentioned | \"This is just one avenue we are using to ensure our staff can continue to engage and interact with the leadership team, getting answers to the topics that matter the most to our people.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
