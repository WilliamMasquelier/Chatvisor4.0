Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 776 words\nHighlight: Tristan did not just get his own desk at Fortescue when he shared his diagnosis. He got a ticket to be \nhimself.\nBody\nWhen his son was being assessed for autism, Tristan Calder argued about various aspects of his son's behaviour: \n\"That's normal, I did that as a child\".\nThen the penny dropped.\nLink to Image\nColin Murty\nSo he got tested, too. And so in his early 40s, Calder discovered not only his son, but also himself to be autistic, as \nare one in 150 Australians.\n\"It's possibly the best thing I've ever done,\" the Fortescue worker says, of seeking the diagnosis. \"It helped me fully \nunderstand myself.\"\nCalder is clear, however, that his experiences are his alone. \"If you meet one person with autism, you've met \nexactly one person with autism,\" he says.\n\"For me, I have challenges around social interaction, communication [and] repetitive behaviours that I can't get out \nof.\"\nHe likes a plan - and is good at making them - but deals poorly with surprises.\nHe must park in the same spot every day, take the same path from the car to the same lift, and then walk to the \nsame desk - only possible because Fortescue exempted him from its hot-desking policy.\n\"I can't use these toilets,\" he says while being interviewed at the miner's Perth headquarters, \"this is how stupid it is \n- I use the toilets out there.\"\nWithout his own desk, Calder says he would be overwhelmed by dealing with different screens, different lights and \nglare, the mouse and charger in different spots, and an unfamiliar coworker beside him.\nPage 2 of 3\n'Best thing I've ever done': How a chance diagnosis transformed this WA mining worker's life\n\"These little triggers build up slowly,\" he says.\nLink to Image\nColin Murty\n\"Your body doesn't filter any of this out, so it's taking all this sensory input and ... it's all rattling around in here.\"\nCalder got his own desk because he was willing to share his diagnosis with his supervisor and say what he needed. \nTo him, having a corporate culture where workers feel comfortable sharing their concerns is key.\n\"I don't want people to start to pigeonhole people and think 'he might be autistic,'\" he says.\n\"The only way you can help an autistic person is for them to approach you.\"\nCalder says he got more than his own desk when he shared his diagnosis: he got a ticket to be himself.\nBecause of the stigma attached to neurodiversity - a non-medical term for those who experience the world \ndifferently, including ADHD, dyslexia and various other conditions as well as autism - Calder would previously \n\"mask\".\n\"Masking, in layman's terms, is cosplaying as a normal person,\" he says.\n\"You're suppressing your diagnosis ... and that comes with a massive emotional, physical and mental drain.\"\nStimming - repetitive behaviours used by people with autism to reduce stress - can look unprofessional to \nneurotypical co-workers.\nFortescue head of healthy safety and risk Zara Fisher says she has seen workers get incredibly poor performance \nfeedback for actions such as fiddling at meetings, which can be interpreted as a sign of not concentrating.\n\"Things like that have nothing to do with the person's productivity or capacity, but more about how they present \nthemselves,\" she said.\nThe fortnightly 2\u00bd-hour team meeting was a particular ordeal for Calder. Now he can rock back and forth in his \nchair without explaining himself.\n\"They know that if I interject, or I talk loud, or I say something that might be perceived to be abrupt, I'm not just \nbeing an arsehole,\" he said.\n\"Weekends for me four or five years ago would be on the couch, zoned out, trying to recover from the week of work \nI've had because I've been masking.\"\nThe diagnosis has also led Calder to seek assistance from speech and occupational therapists and understand \nhimself better, causing life to improve at home as well as work.\nNow he understands his own triggers, and works around them with the help of his wife.\n\"That helps our relationship massively,\" he says.\nCalder is part of a network of neurodiverse employees at Fortescue who support each other. They also provide \n\"reverse mentoring\" for supervisors by letting them chat with a network member with a similar diagnosis to \nsomeone on their team who they are unsure how to support.\nFor Fisher, the key for supervisors is realising that everyone - both neurodiverse and neurotypical - is different.\n\"Every one of us functions best under certain circumstances, or we might just have other things going on in our \nlives,\" she says.Page 3 of 3\n'Best thing I've ever done': How a chance diagnosis transformed this WA mining worker's life\nThe trick is creating a \"safe space\" where workers will tell the boss they are struggling and what they need.\nAnd the prize for employers? Fisher says freeing workers from exhausting themselves pretending to be someone \nelse leaves them with more energy. Not just for themselves - but also for work.\nStart the day with a summary of the day's most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. \nSign up for our Morning Edition newsletter. \nGraphic\n \n\"What it comes down to, from a neurological standpoint, is our brains are wired differently, and that comes with \ncomplexities but also comes with strengths and benefits.\"\nCalder occasionally works in a pod in Fortescue's open-plan office when he really needs to focus.\nLoad-Date: July 15, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
