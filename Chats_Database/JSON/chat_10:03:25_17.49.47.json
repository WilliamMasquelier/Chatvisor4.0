Spartan's shares closed at $1.24, after they had hit a 2024 \nhigh last month above $1.60.\nRamelius, which is in a $455m net cash position, pounced on Spartan in June, buying an 8.9 per cent stake at 92c \na share, so perhaps the stock needs to fall further before it becomes interested in a deal.\nNorthern Star is also in a strong position for a buyout, with $358m of net cash. Its most logical target is De Grey \nMining, whose shares also fell more than 5 per cent on Thursday.\nPart of the reason behind a rally in the gold price in the past two months has been expectations of geopolitical \ninstability and an uncertain outcome in the US election.\nBut the sweeping victory of Donald Trump in the race for the White House has caught out some gold traders, with \nthe result creating more certainty about US policy.\nPage 2 of 2\nGolden chance for miners to buy out rivals amid commodity sell-off - DATA ROOM\nAlso sending the gold price lower on Thursday was a rally in the US dollar following the election outcome, with the \nUS economy expected to be stronger under Mr Trump.\nHowever, while gold may be volatile for about two months as the market assesses the impact of Mr Trump's \nleadership, if he introduces trading tariffs on other countries such as China, and the US dollar remains high, that \nwould lead to global inflation.\nAnd inflation usually supports a higher gold price.\nThe same would be said about more geopolitical tension, should it occur under Mr Trump.\nGroups that were also looking to raise equity may now have second thoughts over doing so before Christmas, or \nmay raise less funds and at a lower price. Another plus for gold miners wanting to do deals following the election of \nMr Trump is that it may be easier to come across financing for transactions at better rates, sources say.\nLoad-Date: November 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**PERSON**: [Full Name]\n**ROLE**: [Person's role or position]\n**CONTEXT**: [Brief description of how the person is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**PERSON**: Elon Musk\n**ROLE**: CEO of Tesla and SpaceX\n**CONTEXT**: Primary subject of article, discussing company strategy\n\nOnly include people who play a meaningful role in the article's content.
