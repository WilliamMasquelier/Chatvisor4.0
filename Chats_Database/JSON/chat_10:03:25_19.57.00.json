            "content": "Leila Benali's position towards Fortescue appears neutral, as she played a role in brokering discussions involving the company but later refrained from publicly commenting on the matter. Her reluctance to speak suggests either a strategic diplomatic stance or a shift towards caution, indicating that her views may have evolved or that she prefers to avoid public alignment with Fortescue. This neutrality could have a stabilizing effect on Fortescue\u2019s reputation in Morocco, as it neither signals strong endorsement nor opposition, but the lack of public support may limit the company's ability to leverage governmental backing for its initiatives.",
