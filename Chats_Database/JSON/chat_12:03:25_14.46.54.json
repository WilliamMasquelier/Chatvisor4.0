It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nYou can't sell sea shells by the sea shore these days\nYou can't sell sea shells by the sea shore these days\nTownsville Bulletin (Australia)\nApril 17, 2024 Wednesday\nTownsville Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: LETTERS; Pg. 15\nLength: 546 words\nByline: Steve Price\nBody\nYou could row a coconut raft to the reef it was so calm. I remember the day, the few clouds were reflected in the \ndeep, the shimmer of reef colour in the shallows, I loved it.\nIt simply made you want to immerse yourself in its hidden wonders. Our skipper Col Hodson asked me to come for \na snorkel over the reef bowl, it was only 4 or 5 metres, and as clear as a spring dawn after the rain.\nMyrmidon reef is truly one of our local natural masterpieces. When I say local, I don't mean you can whip out there \non an orange scooter, a little far out (like this column), it's a magnificent wilderness on the outer reef. We went \nsnorkelling to see the giant clams. Transplanted from Orpheus Island apparently and now what appeared to be \nacres of them, spread across the clear sands of the sheltered area of Myrmidon.\nI doubt they are there now, after all these years and the many cyclones. It was an incredible sight, blessed to see it. \nThey are the most magnificent creatures, incredible colour, size of a volksy , and with a mantle that makes velvet \nfeel like sandpaper.\nBut what of the shell when the occupier moves on? Yes they break-up and turn to sand, or maybe the smaller ones \nwash up on the beach and become mobiles or candle holders. I've always wondered the laws on shell collecting. \nNational Parks and Marine Parks are a no no which is fair, sacred land as well, and of course if they are occupied! \nBut what of our local beaches\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. I reckon why not? Herewith, a probable letter to the Editor begins about Pricey \nand his shells. No worries, its Steven with a V.\nMy girl finds heaps of cowries, the cowrie queen I call her, why let them be battered into rubble when we can \nadmire the greatest of artisans work. I love the local shell club exhibits, my dear mum had heaps, and I have no \nidea where she got them. They're beauties. Now all over the house for the dog to trip over. I told of mum s love for \nshells to a wonderful mate of mine years ago, a trawler man, and he gave mum the most amazing cone shell \nbrought up empty from the deep. The owner moving on to better premises I guess. He would polish them up \nwonderfully, better for mum to enjoy than be lost to eternity, and I reckon the builder would be proud to. Thanks to \nthe late Neil Thomson, I still have the shell, and I think of mum and Neil whenever I look at it. It takes two of us to \nPage 2 of 2\nYou can't sell sea shells by the sea shore these days\nlift the thing so I can listen to the ocean\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the size of it I can hear all oceans. On that point, do mums and dads still \ntell the kids to lift a shell to their ear to hear the ocean???? Make sure its empty first if you do by the way.\nI still listen, and I still believe it\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6fair dinkum, but then again, I can hear the seagulls too. Better than a mobile \nphone eh.\nAs Berty Boy said: \"Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions\". Albert Einstein.\nThere was another occasion when someone found a shell. We were diving off Bay Rock collecting algae rock for \nthe aquarium, a wonderful man Chick Henderson surfaced and said \"Pricey, heaps shells down here, want one?\" I \nsaid \"No Chick, leave them if they are alive\". Typical Chick, great diver, he bought up the shell staying \"I hope its \ndead Pricey\" It was a bomb shell.\nThere's heaps out there. Don't listen to the ocean in one of them!!!! Happy Days Ooroo\nLoad-Date: April 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
