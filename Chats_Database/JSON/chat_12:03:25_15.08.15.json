But, Cisco ANZ's \ndirector of cybersecurity Corien Vermaak said trust remains a big hurdle in fuelling AI's widespread adoption. Ms \nVermaak said 27 per cent of Australian companies surveyed had banned the use of generative AI applications due \nto privacy risks.\nOf that number, 77 per cent were worried corporate information entered into AI apps could be shared publicly or \nwith competitors, while 69 per cent were concerned it could hurt their legal or intellectual property rights.\n\"As we do security awareness training, we now need to focus on that narrative on AI as well,\" Ms Vermaak said.\nThe Productivity Commission also found low levels of public trust in AI technologies could pose a \"significant \nbarrier\" to uptake. But, it said governments should act as \"exemplars\" to demonstrate the safe and effective uses of \nAI in service delivery.\nLoad-Date: February 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# A quarter of companies ban the use of AI\n## The Daily Telegraph\n### Jared Lynch\n### February 13, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Cisco, to report.
