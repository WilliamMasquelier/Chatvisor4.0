Instead new rules \naround trailing liability provisions were introduced, which could slug former owners of the licence areas with the bill, \nthereby putting the onus on them to do adequate due diligence should the assets change hands.\nThe exploration permit in the current matter was granted to Woodside, Shell and BHP Billiton Petroleum in 1997, \nwith Woodside owning a half share and the other two companies one quarter each.\nProduction from the Laminaria and Corallina oilfields began in 1999.
