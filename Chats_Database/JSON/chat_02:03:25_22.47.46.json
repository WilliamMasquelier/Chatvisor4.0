The company has also experienced problems in the US in attempting to secure tax credits.\nLast year, \u00d8rsted cancelled two big offshore windfarm projects in the US , the Ocean Wind I and II schemes, \nblaming a sharp rise in costs. It took a 28.4bn Danish kroner (\u00a33.3bn) hit as a result of the decision.\nThe company had also raised doubts over the cost of the Hornsea 3 project early last year. However, in December \nit reaffirmed its commitment to 2.9GW development, which is expected to supply power to about 3.3m homes.\nPage 2 of 2\nDanish windfarm firm \u00d8rsted to axe up to 800 jobs and pause dividend\nThe RBC analyst Alexander Wheeler said financial markets had been expecting \u00d8rsted to tap investors for funds, \n\u201cwhich would have resolved the issues quicker and removed future risk in this regard\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cHowever, we now have a period where \u00d8rsted needs to execute on various components of its plan to \nimprove its balance sheet metrics over the medium term.\u201d\n\u00d8rsted has 12 existing windfarms in the UK producing enough energy to power six million UK homes. It is also \nworking on a floating offshore wind project  in Scotland.\nSeparately on Wednesday, the turbine maker Siemens Energy, which was forced to strike a \u20ac15bn rescue deal with \nthe German government  last year, reported a \u20ac1.58bn first-quarter profit after selling a stake in its Indian unit.\nIt said orders remained lower than forecast in its turbine division, where newer models have suffered technical \nfaults, but it hoped to break even in that business in 2026.\nThe problems affecting the windfarm industry caused the Swedish energy firm Vattenfall to stop work  on the \nmultibillion-pound Norfolk Boreas windfarm last year because it was no longer profitable.\nThe Norwegian oil and gas producer Equinor posted quarterly profits of $8.68bn \u2013 down from $17bn a year earlier \nbut ahead of City forecasts \u2013 due to lower energy prices.\nMeanwhile, the British Gas owner Centrica signed an agreement to buy a million metric tonnes of liquified natural \ngas (LNG) from Spain\u2019s Repsol. The cargoes will be delivered to the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent between 2025 \nand 2027.
