We thank Julie for all she has contributed over 11 years \nand wish her the best as she enjoys some travel and time with her family,\" he said.\nMs Shuttleworth had most recently been in charge of developing Fortescue's Belinga iron ore project in Gabon.\nShe was previously a key member of the team seeking to deliver on Dr Forrest's plans to reshape Fortescue as a \nglobal green energy and hydrogen giant, as the first boss of Fortescue Future Energy.\nShe is the latest in a long line of senior executives to leave Fortescue over the last two years.\nFormer Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner also left the company this year, along with Deborah \nCaudle, the chief financial officer of Fortescue's energy division for only four months.\nA tumultuous 2023 saw the departure of chief executive Fiona Hick in August after only six months in the role, with \nnewly appointed chief financial officer Christina Morris departing within a few days.\nDr Forrest in February blamed an exodus of senior bosses on the transition from a \"fossil fuel-burning company to a \ngreen energy company\", but insists a -period of high turnover is starting to settle down.\nA revolving door of executives have jumped ship from the company in the past 12 months as pressure grows on \nFortescue to execute a high-stakes pivot to green energy from its iron ore foundations that made its founder one of \nAustralia's richest men.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue loses another exec\nDr Forrest last year said executives who left the iron ore major had struggled to cope with the -\"boiler room\" \nconditions of the company and were not following his green vision.\nHowever, Dr Forrest said in February that a degree of turnover was expected as the company transitioned from a \npure iron ore producer to a green energy company with lofty global renewable hydrogen ambitions.\nFormer prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also formally severed ties with the company, and external affairs boss \nFiona Sugden left to join the office of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\nFortescue has promised to end its use of fossil fuels by the end of the decade and become a \"real zero\" emitter of \ncarbon.\nDr Forrest said last year that former CEO Fiona Hick chose to step aside after just six months in the role following \ndifferences of opinion over the company's green transition.\nDr Forrest said Ms Hick's swift departure - confirmed just hours after Fortescue wrapped up a lavish 20-year \nanniversary party at the company's Solomon iron ore hub in the Pilbara - was an example of Fortescue's \"fail fast\" -\napproach. He said the company had chosen to lose Ms Hick, knowing that it would be criticised in the media, rather \nthan delay the decision out of fear of negative headlines.\nFortescue this month launched secret raids on the homes and offices of directors of a green steel competitor in a \nmove described by Federal Court judge John Logan as a potential \"industrial-scale forensic debacle\" amid claims of \nintellectual property theft. Fortescue won court orders authorising the searches in May, targeting the offices of \nwould-be green steel competitor Element Zero and the homes and computers of directors, including former \nFortescue chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk, long term Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman and former \nFortescue staffer Bjorn Winther-Jensen.\nLoad-Date: June 13, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Julie Shuttleworth | Former green energy boss at Fortescue | \"Julie has been an integral part of Fortescue's success.
