But an affidavit of DCC senior lawyer Paul \nDewar, released on Friday, shows that Fortescue engaged and directly instructed Lancaster Investigations in their \nsurveillance of the three men and their families.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue PIs followed former exec families to childcare centres\n\"Fortescue engaged a private investigator firm, Lancasters Investigations, with the aim of establishing the identity \nand location of each of the respondents to the search order application,\" says Mr Dewar's affidavit.\n\"Since 21 April 2024, except in relation to the days of Sunday 5 May and Monday 6 May 2024, Fortescue has \nreceived reports from Lancasters Investigations regarding each of the Respondents to the Search Order \nApplication, including their location.\" The Australian does not suggest Dr Forrest was aware of the actions of \nLancaster Investigations, and Dr Forrest has previously denied that he or any member of the board were aware of \nthe extent of the covert surveillance.\nDr Forrest has told other media outlets that Fortescue chief legal counsel Phil McKeiver had offered to resign over \nthe company's role in the surveillance excess, but that the offer had been refused by joint chief executives Dino \nOtranto and Mark Hutchinson.\n\"No board member knew about the private investigator and a very enthusiastic group general counsel and company \nsecretary wanted to demonstrate that you cannot steal technology and then eliminate that technology that the \ncompany produced on the way out,\" Dr Forrest is quoted as saying.\nInvestigators who followed Mr Masterman used covert cameras to take pictures of the Element Zero director \noutside restaurants and ahead of his attendance at meetings. Dr Kolodziejczyk was followed to cafes and \nrestaurants, photographed with his wife and young child - and even followed to a childcare centre.\nLoad-Date: August 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
