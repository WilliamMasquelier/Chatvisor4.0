Pg. 18\nLength: 854 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nBHP's failed bid for Anglo American dominated attention in the second half of the 2024 financial year, but the \nsearch for value in the mid-tier mining sector was dominated by the resurgence of gold and the fall from grace of \nthe critical minerals sector.\nWith one exception at the top of the list, gold companies delivered the best returns for the full -financial year within \nthe mid-cap resources sector, with seven of the top 10 total returns - including share price movements and \ndividends - on the S&P/ASX 300 Metals and Mining index coming from gold miners.\nThe copper price recovery helped Sandfire Resources return to grace, as the last major pure play miner of the \ncommodity on the Australian bourse.\nSandfire shares ended the year on a slide though, alongside the copper price, closing on Friday at $8.73, 14 per \ncent below its annual high of $10.16 in May, when the copper price was also riding high at close to $US11,000 a \ntonne.\nBut, despite the late slip, Sandfire shares still delivered a total annual return of close to 48 per cent for the financial \nyear.\nStanmore Resources' acquisition of BHP's unwanted BMC coal assets in Queensland helped the company to \nbecome one of the other exceptions, with the transformation of the scale of the miner's business putting it in eighth \nspot for the fiscal year, with dividend payments helping it to a 46 per cent total return.\nBut, despite dire circumstances elsewhere in the sector, junior lithium play Wildcat Resources topped the best 10 \nperformers, with a 162.5 per cent total return.\nEven so, with a 31.5c close on Friday, Wildcat is a long way off its $1.01 peak in November at the height of the \nlithium land grab that saw Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting, Chris Ellison's Mineral Resources and global \nmajors SQM and Albemarle put billions of dollars on the table for lithium explorers as the price of the battery metal \nplunged.\nPage 2 of 2\nWild ride as investors tally mining's FY24 winners and losers\nBut it was gold that delivered the best returns for mid-tier mining investors for the financial year, as soaring global \ninflation rates and geopolitical uncertainty helped the price of the precious metal surge.\nThe S&P All Ordinaries gold index hit a low of 6023.1 in early October 2023, and a high of 8153.4 in late May - an \nextraordinary 33 per cent gap - before softening late in the financial year to close at 7357.\nThe best returns of the year on the S&P/ASX 300 Metals and Mining index came from West Australian miner Red 5, \nwhich delivered an 89.5 per cent total return for the financial year despite a sharp fall in its share price from highs of \n49.5c in mid-May to a 36c close on Friday.\nWest African Resources was in second spot, with an 86.1 per cent return as the Burkina Faso gold miner closes in \non the start of production from its second gold mine in the country.\nAnd Morgan Hart's Emerald Resources continued its strong run after turning its Okvau gold mine in Cambodia into \na reliable production hub, worth about 100,000 ounces a year, and finally completed a long-running takeover of WA \nexplorer Bullseye Mining, adding a high-grade Australian project to its development options.\nEmerald delivered a total return of 86 per cent for the financial year, followed by the two companies competing to \nemerge as WA's next major mid-tier gold play - Westgold Resources and Ramelius Resources, which delivered \n68.7 per cent and 54.7 per cent returns respectively.\nAnd Africa-focused Perseus Mining added to its reputation as one of the Australian gold sector's most reliable \nproducers, gaining 45.3 per cent on a total return basis.\nBut while the political hype around critical minerals shows now sign of diminishing, the shine has long gone from \ncommodity prices and the ASX-listed stocks that jumped on board the green metal wagon. Any Core Lithium \nshareholders looking to indulge in a little tax-loss selling to offset taxable gains elsewhere in their portfolio will have \nbeen well-placed last week, with the company - the first major Australian victim of the lithium price plunge - finishing \nthe year down 89.7 per cent, the biggest loss on the S&P/ASX 300 Metals and Mining index.\nInvestors who jumped on the Canadian lithium bandwagon have also had a torrid time, with Sayona Mining and \nPatriot Battery Metals down 79 per cent and 67.5 per cent respectively.\nChalice Mining was the third biggest loser on the list, with a 77.3 per cent plunge for the fiscal year after delivering \nan underwhelming scoping study on its Gonneville project in WA in August last year.\nIGO was hit by falling lithium and nickel prices - while still feeling the hangover from its disastrous takeover of \nWestern Areas - and suffered a 60.6 per cent value loss for the year.\nGraphite plays Talga Group, Syrah Resources and Renascor Resources all made the top 10 loser list.\nThe list is rounded out by -Liontown Resources, which was the hottest lithium play on the market when Albemarle \nlobbed a $2.50-a-share bid in March 2023. Hancock Prospecting spoiled that takeover, however, and the falling \nlithium price - as well as cost blowouts at its Kathleen Valley project in WA - did the rest, with Liontown stock \nclosing off 68 per cent for the financial year at 90.5c.\nLoad-Date: June 30, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\nNone\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
