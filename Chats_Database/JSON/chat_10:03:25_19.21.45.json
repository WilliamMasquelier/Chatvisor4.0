To sustain the dividend policy, we believe \nFMG may need to increase gearing,\" Macquarie said in a client note on Friday.\nGoldman Sachs analyst Paul Young noted the company's capital spending was increasing to maintain production at \nsome of its older mines, and it may need to ramp up spending again if new green hydrogen projects in Norway and \nBrazil - now going through feasibility studies - are given the green light by the company's board.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue's green expenditure could put pressure on dividends\n\"We continue to think Fortescue is at an inflection point on capital allocation, and to fund the ambitious strategy, we \nassume the company reduces the dividend payout ratio from the current 65 per cent in the second half of FY24 to \nabout 50 per cent from FY25 onwards - the bottom end of the 50 to 80 per cent guidance,\" he said.\nFortescue narrowly missed its annual export targets, shipping 191.6 million tonnes for the year, below the bottom \nend of its 192 to 197 million tonne guidance range.\nBut after Fortescue's troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project again missed expected export rates, the company only \ncame close to its overall export target after shipping far higher quantities of a lower-grade product known as super \nspecial fines, which made up more than half of its record June quarter exports.\nThe iron ore major says it expects Iron Bridge to ramp up production rates of 5 to 9 million tonnes this financial \nyear, after shipments of only 1.2 million -tonnes in the year ending June 30.\nBut Fortescue has also wi-dened its overall export guidance target, flagging shipments of 190 to 200 million \ntonnes.\nThat suggests shipments from some of its hematite mines could taper off this year, according to Morgans analyst \nAdrian Prendergast. \"Management denied this view, commenting that changes in FY25 will only be minor, but the \nfacts are hard to dismiss,\" he said.\n\"The lack of commentary makes it hard to identify the drivers of the change, but it is clear that FMG has been \npushing some of its ageing mines hard with strip ratios rising and the need for increased mine replacement \ninvariably -increasing.\" While Mr Prendergast said he still expects Fortescue to maintain dividend yields above \nthose of its competitors, softening iron ore prices could put pressure on shareholder payouts. \"Fortescue maintains \na healthy balance sheet, but its capex-heavy mine replacement, decarbonisation, and sustainability investments are \nplacing an increasing load on its base iron ore business in terms of capital requirements,\" he said. Fortescue \nshares closed up 21c at $20.35 on Friday.\nLoad-Date: July 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Paul Young | Analyst at Goldman Sachs | \"We continue to think Fortescue is at an inflection point on capital allocation, and to fund the ambitious strategy, we assume the company reduces the dividend payout ratio from the current 65 per cent in the second half of FY24 to about 50 per cent from FY25 onwards - the bottom end of the 50 to 80 per cent guidance.\" | N.A. |\n| Adrian Prendergast | Analyst at Morgans | \"Fortescue maintains a healthy balance sheet, but its capex-heavy mine replacement, decarbonisation, and sustainability investments are placing an increasing load on its base iron ore business in terms of capital requirements.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
