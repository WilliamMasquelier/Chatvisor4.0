The Company's intention to make the \ngrants was described in its Admission Document dated 10 September 2024.\nFY24 Performance Rights and FY25 Performance Rights\nPage 2 of 9\nGrant of Employee Incentive Options\nGreatland's remuneration strategy is focused on ensuring that remuneration outcomes are aligned to the creation of \nshareholder value. For the 2024 financial year (FY24) and 2025 financial year (FY25), Greatland has granted \nperformance rights to Greatland's senior team which before vesting are dependent on the achievement of \nperformance targets outlined below.\nGreatland's senior team receives an annual grant of share-based performance rights the vesting of which is subject \nto the achievement of performance criteria over a three-year period. Performance Rights are considered an \nappropriate form of remuneration to incentivise superior performance over the longer-term and complement total \nremuneration which includes a fixed salary and performance-based short-term incentives.\nFor FY24, Greatland has granted 17,496,137 share options with an exercise price of \u00a30.001 per share (FY24 \nPerformance Rights) to its senior team members. For FY25, Greatland has granted 39,855,249 share options with \nan exercise price of \u00a30.001 per share (FY25 Performance Rights) to its senior team members, including a number \nof recently commenced team members. The FY24Performance Rights and FY25 Performance Rights are granted \nunder the Company's employee share plan with their vesting subject to achievement of the performance targets set \nout in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The performance targets will be assessed by Greatland's Board of \nDirectors (Board) at the conclusion of the 2026 financial year for FY24 Performance Rights (hence the relevant \nperformance period is from 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2026), and at the conclusion of the 2027 financial year for FY25 \nPerformance Rights (hence the relevant performance period is from 1July 2024 to 30June 2027).\nBased on the Company's performance, the Board may determine that less than 100% of the shares the subject of \nFY24Performance Rights or FY25 Performance Rights (as applicable) should vest, in which case, any unvested \nentitlements will lapse. The FY24 Performance Rights and FY25Performance Rights require that the holders remain \nemployed by Greatland at the end of the respective performance period (i.e. until 30 June 2026 for the FY24 \nPerformance Rights, and until 30June 2027 for the FY25 Performance Rights), otherwise (subject to certain limited \n'good leaver' exceptions) they will lapse.\nPerformance Rights which have vested following the conclusion of performance period must be exercised prior to \ntheir expiry date (being the tenth anniversary of the date of grant).\nTable 1: FY24 performance targets\nCategory Performance Target Description Weighting\nMarket / Investor Total Shareholder Return The Company's total \nshareholder return, including \ndividends, is equal to or greater \nthan the VanEck Junior Gold \nMiners ETF.17.5%\nInvestor Engagement The Company completes its ASX \nListing (if directed by the Board), \nactively engages with a broad \ncross section of investors and \ngrows the proportion of its shares \nheld by institutional investors, \nspecifically targeting non-private \ninvestor ownership of 40% by the \nend of the performance period, \nwith the assessed outcome being \nproportional to the increase \nachieved.12.5%\nSustainability and \nEnvironmentSustainability and Environment The Company complies with its \nobligations under \nenvironmental laws and \nregulations without serious \nbreaches or environmental \nincidents, and enhances \ngovernance, policies and \nreporting in respect of 5%Page 3 of 9\nGrant of Employee Incentive Options\nsustainability and \nenvironmental matters including \npublication of sustainability \nreports annually in the ordinary \ncourse or as approved by the \nBoard.\nNative Title The Company maintains \ndemonstratively positive relations \nwith all Native Title groups in \nrespect of the land it operates \non, preserves heritage sites of \ncultural significance as required \nto comply with applicable \npermits, and remains in \ncompliance with its obligations \nunder land access agreements \nand applicable laws and \nregulations.5%\nHavieron Havieron JV Feasibility Study The Company actively \nmanages its relationship with its \njoint venture partner and \ncritically reviews, analyses and \nprovides detailed input, based \non its review and analysis, on a \ntimely basis into the Havieron \nJV Feasibility Study.5%\nFunding and balance \nsheetFunding and balance sheet The Company has adequate \nliquidity to meet short, medium \nand long term cashflow \nrequirements, including to fund \nits share of the Havieron \ndevelopment without dilution of \nits current joint venture interest. \nThe Company maintains \npositive relationships with its \nbank lending group and other \nprospective debt financiers.25%\nPortfolio Resource Base The Company grows its Mineral \nResource base (as per the \nCompany's March2022 Mineral \nResource Estimate) by at least \n20% (noting that joint venture \nmining tenements are assessed \non a 100% basis).15%\nBusiness Development The Company demonstrates \nsuccess in pursuing portfolio \nenhancing business \ndevelopment opportunities \nthrough identifying and \npresenting such opportunities to \nthe Board for consideration.15%\nTotal 100%\nTable 2: FY25 performance targets\nPerformance Target Description Weighting\nRelative shareholder return vs \npeersThe Company's relative total shareholder return measured \nagainst an Australian mid-cap gold peer group(1)\nAchievement Outcome\n< 50th percentile 0%Page 4 of 9\nGrant of Employee Incentive Options\nThreshold:50th percentile 50%\n50th to 75th percentile pro rata 50 - 100%\n> 75th percentile 100%\n(1) Peer group comprises:Aurelia Metals Limited \n(ASX:AMI), Bellevue Gold Limited (ASX:BGL), \nCapricorn Metals Limited (ASX:CMM), De Grey Mining \nLimited (ASX:DEG), Genesis MineralsLtd (ASX:GMD), \nGold Road Resources Limited (ASX:GOR), Ora Banda \nMining (ASX:OBM), Pantoro Limited (ASX:PNR), Vault \nMinerals Limited (ASX:VAU), Ramelius Resources \nLimited (ASX:RMS), Regis Resources Limited \n(ASX:RRL), Spartan Resources Limited (ASX:SPR), \nWestgold Resources Limited (ASX:WGX)12.5%\nRelative shareholder return vs index The Company's relative total shareholder return \nmeasured against the S&P/ASX All Ordinaries Gold \nIndex (XGD)\nAchievement Outcome\n< 95% index growth 0%\n95 - 100% of index growth pro rata 0 - 50%\nThreshold: 100% of index growth 50%\n100 - 120% of index growth pro rata 50 - 100%\n> 120% of index growth 100%\n12.5%\nHavieron optimisation The Company completes a Havieron feasibility study within 12months \nfrom completion of the acquisition of Havieron and Telfer (Acquisition \nCompletion).

The Co-Investment Options are a one-off equity incentive package for Mr Horton, who \ncommenced as CFO on 1 July 2024, which serve two key purposes: aligning the interests of Mr Horton and \nshareholders by incentivising him to contribute to delivering substantial growth in shareholder value, and \nincentivising Mr Horton's retention.\nThe exercise price represents a substantial premium of approximately 86% to the Greatland closing share price of \n\u00a30.064 on 15 October 2024, demonstrating the alignment and commitment to creating substantial shareholder \nvalue. Accordingly, the Company must deliver a substantial return to shareholders before these options have any \nvalue.\nThe exercise price is the same as the exercise price associated with the Co-Investment Options granted to senior \nteam members in September 2023 (see RNS Announcement titled \"Grant of Employee Incentive Options\" dated 19 \nSeptember 2023) prior to Mr Horton's appointment, and the Co-Investment Rights held by certain of Greatland's \ndirectors (see RNS Announcement titled \"Grant of Co-investment Options and Share Options\" dated 12 September \n2022).\nThe Co-Investment Options are subject to an exercise restriction which means that Mr Horton must be employed by \nGreatland on 31 January 2027 (subject to certain limited 'good leaver' exceptions) in order to be entitled to exercise. \nIf Mr Horton is not employed by Greatland on 31 January 2027 (and is not subject to a limited 'good leaver' \nexception), the Co-Investment Options will lapse. If the service requirement is met, then Co-Investment Options \nmust be exercised into Greatland shares prior to expiry. The Co-Investment Options expire on 1 July 2027, at which \ntime any Co-Investment Options not exercised will lapse.\nSummary\nIn summary the following share options have been granted by the Company. \nTable 3: Summary of Employee Share Options granted on 16 October 2024\nType Number Exercise price % of shares on \nissueConditions / Restrictions\nFY24 Performance \nRights17,496,137 0.1p 0.17% Subject to satisfaction of \nperformance hurdles and \ncontinued service criteria; \noption holder must be \nemployed by Greatland on \n30June 2026 to exercise \nvested rights (subject to \nlimited 'good leaver' \nexceptions)\nFY25 Performance \nRights39,855,249 0.1p 0.38% Subject to satisfaction of \nperformance hurdles and \ncontinued service criteria; Page 6 of 9\nGrant of Employee Incentive Options\noption holder must be \nemployed by Greatland on \n30June 2027 to exercise \nvested rights (subject to \nlimited 'good leaver' \nexceptions)\nCo-Investment \nOptions25,000,000 11.9p 0.24% One-off issue to Mr Horton \n(CFO), subject to \nsatisfaction of continued \nservice criteria; Mr Horton \nmust be employed by \nGreatland on 31 January \n2027 to exercise (subject to \nlimited 'good leaver' \nexceptions)\nFollowing the above grant, the Company has 10,410,112,311 shares issued, and an aggregate of 643,737,961 \noptions granted over shares issued to employees and directors (of which 522,700,000 are out-of-the-money options \nwith an exercise price of either 11.9p or 25.0p).\nDirector and PDMR awards\nThe issuance of share options includes awards to Greatland's Managing Director, Shaun Day, and Chief Financial \nOfficer, Dean Horton, which are set out in Table 4.\nTable 4: Summary of Employee Share Options granted to related parties\nPerson FY24 \nPerformance \nRightsFY25 \nPerformance \nRightsCo-\nInvestment \nOptionsTotal Previously \nGranted\nOptions Performance \nRights\nShaun Day 5,320,141 5,184,721 Nil 10,504,862 85,000,000 15,898,737\nDean \nHortonNil 2,942,721 25,000,000 27,942,721 Nil Nil\nThe award of Co-Investment Options to Dean Horton is considered a related party transaction for the purposes of \nthe AIM Rules.

The box cut and decline to the Havieron \norebody commenced in February 2021. Total development exceeds 3,060m including over 2,110m of advance in \nthe main access decline (as at 30 June 2024). Havieron is intended to leverage the existing Telfer infrastructure \nand processing plant, which would de-risk the development and reduces capital expenditure.\nOn 10 September 2024, Greatland announced that certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries had entered into a \nbinding agreement with certain Newmont Corporation subsidiaries to acquire, subject to certain conditions being \nsatisfied, a 70% ownership interest in the Havieron gold-copper project (consolidating Greatland's ownership of \nHavieron to 100%), 100% ownership of the Telfer gold-copper mine, and other related interests in assets in the \nPaterson region. Completion of the acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent and is \ntargeted to occur during Q4 2024.\nGreatland has a proven track record of discovery and exploration success and is pursuing the next generation of \ntier-one mineral deposits by applying advanced exploration techniques in under-explored regions. Greatland has a \nnumber of exploration projects across Western Australia and in parallel to the development of Havieron is focused \non becoming a multi-commodity miner of significant scale.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
