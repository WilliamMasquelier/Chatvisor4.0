The company said \nIron Bridge shipments were affected by \"higher than planned concentrate moisture affecting material handling\".\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue shares take a beating\nFortescue said those issues were now largely solved, and it was working towards an alternative solution to the \nlong-running water supply issues plaguing Iron Bridge. The company has previously flagged the need to replace a \nlength of pipeline to borefields that leaks when placed under high pressure.\nThe project was now \"banking\" rainfall and surface water, Fortescue said, an option that \"may mitigate\" the need to \nreplace the high pressure section of the raw water pipeline.\nFortescue now expects Iron Bridge to produce 5-9 million tonnes of concentrate in the current fiscal year, with the \nmassive mine expected to hit its full capacity by September next year.\nFortescue mining boss Dino Otranto said the new guidance range reflected shipping constraints at the company's \noperations, and not any expectation output from Fortescue's traditional hematite mines would slip during the year.\n\"For full year 2025 the bottleneck, as magnetite ramps up, becomes shipping and it does then give us flexibility to \nramp up and down hematite and magnetite in that portfolio based on market conditions,\" Mr Otranto told analysts \non Thursday.\nThe company's realised price for its iron ore also slipped in the quarter, as the disparity between higher and lower \ngrade ores widened. Fortescue said it realised an average $US92.12 a tonne, or about 82 per cent of the \nbenchmark index for iron ore grading 62 per cent iron.\nIn the March quarter, Fortescue sales averaged $US104.48 a tonne, or 85 per cent of the benchmark price. It \nreceived an average $US103.01 a tonne for the full year.\nFortescue said its cash costs averaged $US18.53 a tonne for the quarter, down slightly, and $US18.24 a tonne for \nthe full year.\nThe mining major is flagging cost increases in the current year, however, with costs expected to run between \n$US18.50 and $US19.75 a wet tonne.\nBut despite the cost-cutting and restructuring at Fortescue, partly aimed at ending the duplication of support \nfunctions between its iron ore and energy arms, the company will accelerate spending on its green energy projects.\nFortescue chief financial officer Apple Paget told analysts about a third of the planned $US500m capital spending \non energy projects would go to the already approved green energy projects in the US, Queensland and Western \nAustralia, with another third allocated to Fortescue Zero - formerly known as WAE Technologies - which is looking \nto build hi-tech manufacturing centres in the US and the UK.\nAbout 60 per cent of Fortescue Energy's $US700m operating spend would support the development of new green \nenergy projects - including feasibility studies on green hydrogen projects in Norway and Brazil - with the rest \nallocated to Fortescue Zero, she said. Fortescue shares closed down $1.18, or 5.5 per cent, at $20.14.\nLoad-Date: July 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue mining boss | \"For full year 2025 the bottleneck, as magnetite ramps up, becomes shipping and it does then give us flexibility to ramp up and down hematite and magnetite in that portfolio based on market conditions.\" | N.A. |\n| Apple Paget | Fortescue chief financial officer | \"About 60 per cent of Fortescue Energy's $US700m operating spend would support the development of new green energy projects - including feasibility studies on green hydrogen projects in Norway and Brazil - with the rest allocated to Fortescue Zero, she said.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
