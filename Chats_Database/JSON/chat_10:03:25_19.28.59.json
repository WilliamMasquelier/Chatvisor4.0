Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's founder | \"Fortescue insists spying on families wasn't inappropriate.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke | Fortescue barrister | \"(There was) a real risk if information (about the pending court case) was provided in advance, there was a real risk that information might have been destroyed, hidden or squirrelled away.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke | Fortescue barrister | \"The discharge application has been a monumental waste of time and is a distraction from the real issues to be decided.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke | Fortescue barrister | \"Fortescue had a 'strong prima facie case' in favour of granting the search orders.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke | Fortescue barrister | \"Mr Masterman was co-operating because he wanted to persuade Fortescue there were no relevant similarities between the Element Zero electrochemical reduction process and the Fortescue electrochemical reduction process so that Fortescue would not bring a case on any such claim.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke | Fortescue barrister | \"Fortescue also claims Element Zero misused its confidential plant information.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Former Fortescue executive | \"Fortescue's pleaded case \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is (not) that the Element Zero process is the same or similar to the Fortescue particle process.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
