BHP and Woolworths \nhave also moved away from offsets.\nCompanies in the past have offered products that are \"carbon neutral\", based on the fact that consumers or the \ncompany itself had bought carbon offsets sufficient to offset the emissions from the product's production.\nThe trend now is to focus on reducing actual emissions rather than buying financial instruments to offset them. \nHowever, for many companies there is a level beyond which it is difficult to abate, and offsets remain useful.\nFortescue, founded by Andrew Forrest, is aiming for what it calls Real Zero, which involves using no fossil fuels or \noffsets in its Scope 1 and 2 emissions profiles.\n\"Fortescue has a plan to decarbonise our Australian terrestrial iron ore operations (Scope 1 and 2) in the Pilbara \nby 2030,\" the company says.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue sounds offsets alarm\n\"We have identified the solutions needed to eliminate approximately 90 per cent of terrestrial ... emissions from our \nAustralian iron ore operations and are actively working to identify solutions for the final approximately 10 per cent.\" \nMacquarie, in a research note entitled \"Carbon neutral no more\", points out that Google recently announced it was \nno longer maintaining operational carbon neutrality, having bought three million tonnes of offsets in 2022, while \nShell has withdrawn its carbon offset targets and several airlines including Delta, Easy Jet and JetBlue have \ncanned their carbon neutral schemes.\nMacquarie says this is being driven by both credibility concerns and regulatory scrutiny.\n\"In January the European Union parliament approved new regulation, under which, carbon offsets will not be \nallowed to contribute to product carbon neutrality claims from 2026,\" Macquarie says.\n\"There are also currently negotiations between the EU member states and parliament on the use of offsets for \ncompany carbon-neutral claims.\n\"In Australia, there is a strategic review of the Climate Active certification under way, with proposals to drop the \nterm carbon-neutral and tighten the use of offsets.\" Macquarie says at the moment, 25 per cent of the companies in \nthe ASX100 claim carbon neutrality or have a carbon-neutral target, and 7 per cent have a carbon-neutral product.\n\"Given greater scrutiny and greenwashing concerns, we may see a decline in the percentage of Australian \ncompanies offering carbon-neutral products or using carbon offsets to reach carbon-neutral targets, particularly \nfrom companies which are using a large volume of international offsets,\" Macquarie says.\nMacquarie says there are particular quality concerns around international offsets, and says almost 80 per cent of \nthe offsets used by Australian listed companies under the Climate Active scheme were international.\n\"Globally, according to a Bain & Company survey of 137 global companies in the fourth quarter of 2022, less than \n25 per cent of corporate respondents plan to use carbon offsets despite more than 90 per cent having a net \nzero/carbon-neutral target by 2050,\" Macquarie said.\n\"It was flagged that more than 50 per cent of corporate respondents attributed their unwillingness to participate in \nthe voluntary carbon market to market imperfections and a lack of transparency on climate impact and quality. \nFurther, about 40 per cent of companies had concerns regarding reputational as well as legal risk.\" In Australia, \nMacquarie said that while voluntary demand for Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCU) grew by 21 per cent over \nthe year to the end of March, more than half of the trade in Australian credits was being pushed by the Safeguard \nMechanism's requirements, \"and will likely be used by Safeguard entities to meet compliance obligations as \nSafeguard baselines decline\".\nThe ACCU spot price had remained stable at around $34 per tonne, however, indicating that Safeguard-driven \ndemand was not yet pushing prices higher. Last year, the Albanese government announced a review of the Climate \nActive certification, originally introduced in 2017 and rebranded in 2019, with proposed updates including removing \nthe term \"carbon-neutral\" and implementing stricter requirements.\nLoad-Date: September 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
