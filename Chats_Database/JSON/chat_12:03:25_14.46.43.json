It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nMoody's discovers financial red flags\nMoody's discovers financial red flags\nThe Australian\nJanuary 24, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 15\nLength: 657 words\nByline: DAVID ROSS\nBody\nAustralian businesses raised 708,640 warning flags in a review of shell company activity by Moody's Analytics, in a \nsign many local companies may be structured to enable financial crime.\nIn a review of global corporate arrangements, Moody's has found Australia is the second-worst country in the Asia-\nPacific for shell company structures.\nShell companies often have legitimate purposes, but Moody's notes they are often used to complicate corporate \narrangements and are associated with financial crime.\nMoody's has sent more than 1485 money-laundering risk alerts to subscribers concerning Australian companies \nsince January 2018.\nThe credit rating and research group notes a profusion of shell companies presents significant challenges for \ncompliance teams in attempting to understand a company's arrangements, \"given the level of opaqueness often \nassociated with them\".\nIn its Shell Company Indicator, Moody's says seven key features associated with shell company activity may \nindicate \"illicit activity\".\n\"These span atypical directorships, mass registration, jurisdictional risk, dormancy, financial anomalies, outlier \nultimate beneficial ownership, and circular ownership,\" Moody's notes.\nMoody's review found more than 21 million risk activity flags raised across its survey of 472 million different \ncompanies.\nBritain ranks as the worst country in the world for shell company activity, with more than five million flags recorded \nby Moody's. This is followed by China with 3.4 million flags against companies.\nAustralia ranks as the second worst in the Asia-Pacific region and well above near neighbours Singapore and New \nZealand.\nPage 2 of 2\nMoody's discovers financial red flags\nMoody's notes companies which were flagged for two or more unusual corporate structures or features were \"at a \nheightened risk of being a shell company\".\n\"The indication that an entity is a shell company gives customers the ability to further investigate whether the \ncompany is potentially being used for illicit activities,\" the report said.\nMoody's data found 650,729 flags for atypical or outlier directorships in Australia, representing individuals with an \n\"unrealistic number of directorships\".\nThe agency warned directors having a \"prolific involvement\" in many companies \"can prompt further investigation\".\nThe survey also flagged 769 companies for directors with \"outlier ages\", either improbably young or extremely old.\nMoody's found 12,177 companies had mass registration issues for sharing names, addresses or directors in what \nmay \"suggest systematic efforts to obfuscate ownership\".\nThe global survey found that more than 22,000 different companies had been registered to the Pyramids of Giza, \noutside Egypt's capital Cairo, while a further 61,000 were supposedly based in a row of shops in South Africa.\nMoody's review also flagged 2542 Australian companies for \"circular ownership\" - tangled ownership structures \n\"which can be a sign of fraudulent transactions and money laundering\".\nMoody's Analytics head of financial crime compliance practice for Europe, Africa, and Americas, Ted Datta, said \ncompanies were facing increasingly complex operating environments which made it difficult to detect \"risk corporate \nrelationships\".\n\"Our goal is to leverage our global data to arm organisations globally - across banking, insurance, corporations and \ngovernment sectors - with unprecedented detection of hidden networks of shell companies that span the globe.,\" \nhe said.\n\"By detecting these discrepancies, we can equip investigators and analysts with the tools to better investigate fraud, \nunmask the beneficiaries of financial crime, and take action against bad -actors.\" Australia has been criticised for its \nlax financial controls, with the country one of three failing to sign on to new controls to stop money laundering and \nterrorism financing, alongside Haiti and Madagascar.
