All Rights Reserved\nLength: 734 words\nByline: Contributor,\nARR.News\nBody\nLa Trobe University, Media Release, 5 December 2024\nA smart irrigation system powered by artificial intelligence will tell sugarcane farmers when and where to water their \ncrops in an advance that could one day revolutionise agriculture \u2013 and help preserve the health of the Great Barrier \nReef.\nDeveloped by Victoria\u2019s La Trobe University for far-north Queensland ag-tech company Aglantis, the intelligent \nirrigation system uses the Internet of Things to automate water pump management and monitor sunlight, \ntemperature and humidity levels without human interaction.\nAglantis, La Trobe team. Photo: La Trobe University\nThe system was initially conceived as a project to improve land management and prevent fertiliser run-off from \nfarms into the Great Barrier Reef, but with new technology making smart irrigation more affordable, Aglantis \nmanaging director Luke Malan said the potential of the product was almost limitless.\nIn addition to saving water, future AI additions could teach the system how to conserve energy, responding to solar \nor energy tariffs. It could also examine soil profiles and make intelligent choices around crop selection and yields.\n\u201cIt essentially takes the guesswork out of farming,\u201d Luke said. \u201cWith growing pressures on profitability, it\u2019s more \nimperative to know what you\u2019re doing and how you can do it better. This flips conventional thinking on its head and \nopens the doorway to new possibilities.\u201d\nPage 2 of 3\nAI supercharges smart irrigation for farms: La Trobe University\nProfessor Wei Xiang, Cisco Research Chair and Director of La Trobe University\u2019s Cisco Centre for AI and the \nInternet of Things, said the smart irrigation system was the centre\u2019s first commercial product and showed how \nindustry could drive research to tangible and groundbreaking results.\nLa Trobe is already working with the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), creating the world\u2019s first AI-\npowered three-dimensional digital twin of the Great Barrier Reef to monitor its health.\nThe new smart irrigation system \u2013 developed in a one-metre plastic tub housed in the Digital Innovation Hub at La \nTrobe\u2019s Melbourne campus - further enhances the University\u2019s reputation in the AI research space.\nThe University recently announced its bold ambition to transform research, education, student support and business \noperations by applying an \u201cAI-first\u201d approach.\n\u201cNow we've proven the technology, the next step is to add additional features to improve productivity and crop \nyields through leveraging cutting-edge AI technology,\u201d Professor Xiang said. \u201cThis will make farming on the whole \nmore sustainable.\"\nIoT researchers Kamyar Karimi and Aravindan Madasamy, who developed the system for La Trobe under the \nsupervision of Professor Xiang, said it would reduce labour costs, increase water efficiency and allow more \nprecision in farm decision-making.\nUltimately, the system design could include intelligent sequencing to determine the perfect order of irrigation across \ndifferent farm sections, predictive maintenance and continuous learning from historical data, seasonal patterns and \ncrop responses.\nAglantis, La Trobe device. Photo: La Trobe University\n\"This technology represents a major shift towards data-driven, sustainable agriculture where AI and IoT optimise \nevery drop of water for maximum farming efficiency,\" Kamyar said.\nAravindan said the development of the smart irrigation system was a transformative step forward for farmers.\n\"By automating labour-intensive processes and putting control in the hands of advanced technology, farmers can \nsave time, conserve resources and focus on other priorities without the stress of manual management.\u201d\nThe system features an ultra-compact design and precision valve control adjustable to any degree.\nIt is currently installed on an 80-hectare plot of Mark and Andrew Castelanelli\u2019s farm in the Burdekin region near \nTownsville.\nFor Mark, who has been a sugarcane farmer for 55 years, smart irrigation heralds the future of farming.\nMark said while other smart systems had been on the market for a few years, this was the first that had been \npurpose-built for the sugarcane industry.\nThe veteran farmer previously racked up 15,000 kilometres each year driving to irrigate crops within a six-kilometre \nradius on his farm.\nMark said using the smart system to irrigate with precision would save labour costs, increase efficiency and leave \ntime to focus on other things.\n\"There's endless opportunity and the power of computing is just getting smarter.\"\nGraphicPage 3 of 3\nAI supercharges smart irrigation for farms: La Trobe University\n \nAglantis, La Trobe team.
