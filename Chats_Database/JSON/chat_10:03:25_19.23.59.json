It culminated in a meeting between the pair where Dr Kolodziejczyk's job was on \nthe line.\nFortescue has accused Dr Kolodziejczyk and two other former employees of stealing proprietary IP when they left \nto start Element Zero, which they deny. The affidavit was released by the Federal Court yesterday.\nThe investigation, which was redacted from the public court file, found \"material misrepresentations and \ninaccuracies in respect of activities, positions held and qualifications listed in Dr Kolodziejczyk's Curriculum Vitae\", \naccording to Mr Huber.\nDuring his time at Fortescue, Dr Forrest became unhappy with Dr Kolodziejczyk's behaviour and attitude, and Ms \nShuttleworth - chief executive of what was then known as Fortescue Future Industries - documented this in a \npersonal letter to the chief scientist.\nIt also states Dr Kolodziejczyk resigned from FFI on June 14, 2021, and then retracted his resignation the following \nday amid apparent conflict within Fortescue's green energy division over who had oversight of the green iron \nexperiment.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue's chief scientist fudged his CV, court told\nMs Shuttleworth stated: \"We are happy you have decided to stay with FFI and look forward to moving on ...this, \nhowever, will necessitate a substantial behavioural change by you and leads me to our chairman's chief concern, to \nyour failure to be a positive and encouraging leader.\"\nThe dispute continues.\nLoad-Date: August 10, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"Dr Forrest had concerns about Dr Kolodziejczyk's conduct, namely that his criticism of colleagues threatened to create a toxic work environment.\" | N.A. |\n| Adrian Huber | Fortescue Lawyer | \"The investigation... found 'material misrepresentations and inaccuracies in respect of activities, positions held and qualifications listed in Dr Kolodziejczyk's Curriculum Vitae'.\" | N.A. |\n| Julie Shuttleworth | Former Chief Executive of Fortescue Future Industries | \"We are happy you have decided to stay with FFI and look forward to moving on ...this, however, will necessitate a substantial behavioural change by you and leads me to our chairman's chief concern, to your failure to be a positive and encouraging leader.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
