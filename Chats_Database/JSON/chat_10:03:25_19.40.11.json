More than 52 per cent of shareholders who voted last year opposed the remuneration report.\nThe backlash came after more than a year of leadership upheaval that saw CEO Elizabeth Gaines step aside, her \nreplacement Fiona Hick exit after a short stint in the top job as well as the departure of chief financial officer Ian \nWells and other executives.\nFortescue's move to pay Ms Gaines and Mr Wells special recognition payments of $1.98m and $1m respectively \nearned a rebuke for proxy advisory firms, with CGI Glass Lewis saying \"such ad hoc discretionary payments on \nretirement are unusual among ASX 100 entities\".\nFortescue does not expect to have issues with this year's remuneration report after moving to address shareholder \nand proxy adviser concerns.\n\"The board has heard this feedback and while it retains the ability to apply discretion to incentive outcomes, it will \nnot make discretionary payments that do not clearly align with shareholder interests,\" the company said in its 2024 \nremuneration report.\nThree resolutions on performance rights, including those for Mr Otranto and Mr Hutchinson, that will be put to a vote \non Wednesday are separate to the remuneration report.\nFortescue told investors Ms Gaines, now a part-time executive director and global ambassador for the company, \nhad agreed not to participate in the performance rights plan even though she was eligible.\nFortescue said that if shareholders voted down the resolutions on Mr Otranto and Mr Hutchinson it would need to \nreconsider their remuneration packages for 2025-26 and could offer equivalent cash incentives. Fortescue noted \nsome of the targets that applied to the two chief executives were market sensitive and said it would provide more \ndisclosure in the 2024-25 annual report.\nLoad-Date: November 5, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Dino Otranto | Chief Executive of Mining Division | \"Fortescue intends to grant up to 208,656 performance rights to Mr Otranto and up to 248,001 rights to Mr Hutchinson.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Chief Executive of Green Energy | \"Mr Hutchinson stands to gain up to $5.46m in addition to his fixed salary of $2.08m if he can deliver on some of Fortescue's green energy and hydrogen ambitions.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman | \"The board has heard this feedback and while it retains the ability to apply discretion to incentive outcomes, it will not make discretionary payments that do not clearly align with shareholder interests.\" | N.A. |\n| Fiona Hick | Former CEO | \"Fortescue told investors Ms Gaines, now a part-time executive director and global ambassador for the company, had agreed not to participate in the performance rights plan even though she was eligible.\" | N.A. |\n| Elizabeth Gaines | Former CEO | \"Fortescue does not expect to have issues with this year's remuneration report after moving to address shareholder and proxy adviser concerns.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
