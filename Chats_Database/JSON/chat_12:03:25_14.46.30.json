It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 3\nThe unspoilt tropical island that still uses shell money\nThe unspoilt tropical island that still uses shell money\nThe Sydney Morning Herald (Australia) - Online\nSeptember 16, 2024 Monday 4:26 AM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Instead, she settled in the Langa Langa Lagoon.\nLink to Image\nPage 2 of 3\nThe unspoilt tropical island that still uses shell money\nGetty Images\n\"It is not just any shells, they are special shells and they commuted with our first ancestors who settled in Langa \nLanga Lagoon. Shell money binds the family unit together,\" Hilda says.\n\"Men do most of the diving and polishing, and there are four types of shell: red (romu), black (kurila), brown (ke-e), \nand white (kakadu). The most prized one is red; it's like gold. And they are not just any colours, they all have \nmeaning.\n\"The red, which is the eagle, is always in the middle of the shell money; black and white represents the sea snake; \nand the brown is the octopus.\"\nWhile paper money is accepted in Malaita, shell money is commonly used for small purchases such as groceries \nas well as larger, more significant payments such as funerals, settling disputes, or paying for a dowry with the \naverage \"bride price\" set at around $10,000 Solomon Islands dollars ($1753), and a \"virgin\" fetching as much as \n$SBD50,000 in local currency ($8700).\nHilda says Edwin gave \"five units of shell money to her maternal uncles\" because she was a divorced.\n\"That's the benchmark for divorcees or widows if they remarry,\" she says. \"But deep in his heart he knows I am \nworth gold.\"\nEven dignitaries and government officials use shell money, which is growing in popularity all over the Solomon \nIslands.\n\"Even today, I go to the shops to buy a bag of rice with it. Families store their shell money in a chest or safe box. \nTo us, it is status to have lots of shell money in a safe box,\" Hilda says.\nIt's becoming, indirectly, a national symbol, according to the local, while Langa Langa Lagoon is a royal mint for \nshell money.\n\"It's more than just currency. It's our life - everything revolves around shell money.\"\nAt the Taflabana Guest House, visitors can learn the eight steps to making shell money: breaking shells; shaping; \nflattening; drilling; heating; threading; smoothing and designing.\nA simple necklace can take as long as three days to make while a typical 2.4-metre-long strand of red money can \ntake between two and three months to complete.\nLike the sea snake the black and white shell money represents, shell money is slithering back into the local \neconomy and the Solomons capital.\nBack in Honiara's Chinatown sits a small, baby-blue timber shack. Mary Sifoburi, 33, opened the Shaenkola Shell \nMoney Shop with her three siblings in 2021 to preserve the tradition of her native Malaita.\nThe shop sells necklaces, bracelets, earrings and decorative costumes, as well as offering a hire service for shell \nmoney products. A 2.1-metre-long strand costs about $175 ($SBD1000); 2.4 metres is $192 ($SBD1100); and 3.6 \nmetres is $526 ($SBD3000).\nThe store sells an average of $SBD7000 ($1227) a week worth of shell money, a figure which increases during \nfestivals and ceremonies.\nMary holds the 3.6-metre-long coil, which weighs between one and two kilograms, in her hands and considers the \nweight of reviving an ancient tradition.\n\"We decided to open the shop as we have seen the importance of shell money. The only other place you can buy it \nis in the central market,\" she says.Page 3 of 3\nThe unspoilt tropical island that still uses shell money\n\"It is our identity. It is something that's passed down from our ancestors.
