The company had been consistently increasing shareholder payouts since 2016, but due to financial struggles, it has decided to halt these payments to focus on investments without raising additional capital. This move could negatively impact investor confidence and stock performance, as dividends are a key attraction for shareholders. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company has suffered a major financial setback, reporting an EBITDA of 18.7 billion Danish kroner (\u20ac2.5 billion) for 2023, which is below its projected range of 20-23 billion kroner. A significant portion of this shortfall is attributed to a 9.6 billion kroner provision for cancellation costs related to the termination of the Ocean Wind 1 project in the U.S. This financial underperformance highlights the challenges \u00d8rsted faces in managing its offshore wind projects profitably. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has decided to cut its renewable energy project targets by at least 24%, reducing its planned capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This reduction signals a retreat from its previous ambitious expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The company is also exiting several emerging offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, limiting its future growth opportunities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company is implementing significant job cuts, with up to 800 positions being eliminated globally. The first phase will see 250 layoffs in the coming months. These job losses reflect the financial strain \u00d8rsted is under and could have negative social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s market capitalization has plummeted by more than 70% since its peak in early 2021, when it was valued at over \u20ac76.5 billion. The company, once the third-largest utility in Europe, now ranks 14th in the sector, with a market value of just \u20ac16 billion. This dramatic decline underscores the financial instability and investor concerns surrounding the company. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has incurred massive financial losses, posting around \u00a32.2 billion in losses for 2023. The company has also written off \u00a33.3 billion from its wind farm business, reflecting the severe financial difficulties it faces. These losses are largely due to the abandonment of several offshore wind projects in the U.S., which resulted in billions in impairments.

This reduction in capacity could slow the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure and impact global climate goals. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, is stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company\u2019s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company has faced significant challenges in the U.S. market, particularly in securing tax credits for its offshore wind projects. Last year, \u00d8rsted canceled two major offshore wind projects, Ocean Wind I and II, due to rising costs, resulting in a financial hit of 28.4 billion Danish kroner (\u00a33.3 billion). These cancellations highlight the financial and regulatory difficulties of expanding renewable energy in the U.S. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for the company to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s financial troubles have led analysts to speculate that it may need to seek additional funding from investors. However, instead of raising capital, \u00d8rsted has opted for cost-cutting measures, which could prolong financial uncertainty and increase risks for the company\u2019s future stability. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to implement a drastic austerity plan, including a comprehensive review of its project portfolio. The company is prioritizing projects with the highest potential returns while reducing risks in development and execution. This shift in strategy indicates a retreat from aggressive expansion and a more cautious approach to investment.

[Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to implement drastic cost-cutting measures, including the elimination of 600 to 800 jobs worldwide. This decision is part of a broader austerity plan aimed at reducing fixed costs by 130 million euros by 2026. The job cuts will have significant social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities, further highlighting the financial strain the company is under. [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]\n\n- The company has announced a suspension of dividend payments until at least 2025, a move that could negatively impact investor confidence. \u00d8rsted had previously been a reliable dividend payer, making this decision a major shift in its financial strategy. The suspension reflects the company\u2019s urgent need to preserve capital amid mounting financial losses, but it may also deter investors who rely on dividends for returns. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s market value has plummeted by 70% over the past three years, reflecting a severe loss of investor confidence. The company, once a leader in the offshore wind sector, has seen its stock price decline sharply due to financial struggles, project cancellations, and rising costs. This decline in market capitalization raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s long-term viability and its ability to attract new investments. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]\n\n- The company has been forced to scale back its renewable energy ambitions, reducing its planned offshore wind capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This represents a significant retreat from its previous expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The reduction in capacity means fewer wind turbines will be built, potentially impacting the broader offshore wind industry. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has exited several key offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, as part of its cost-cutting strategy. This retreat limits the company\u2019s future growth opportunities and weakens its competitive position in the rapidly expanding offshore wind sector. The decision to withdraw from these markets reflects the financial pressures \u00d8rsted is facing and its need to focus on more profitable projects. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024]\n\n- The company has incurred significant financial losses due to the cancellation of major offshore wind projects in the U.S. The abandonment of Ocean Wind 1 and 2 alone resulted in a financial hit of 3.7 billion euros. These cancellations were driven by rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and higher interest rates, which made the projects financially unviable. The failure to complete these projects raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. [de Volkskrant, Marc van Den Eerenbeemt, February 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles have forced it to sell off assets worth 15 billion euros in an effort to stabilize its balance sheet. This asset divestment strategy indicates the severity of the company\u2019s financial difficulties and its need to generate liquidity. However, selling off key assets could weaken \u00d8rsted\u2019s long-term growth potential and reduce its influence in the offshore wind sector. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]\n\n- The company has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have significantly increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for \u00d8rsted to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. The combination of these factors has contributed to the company\u2019s financial downturn and forced it to reassess its investment strategy. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s leadership has been in turmoil, with its chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company\u2019s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning, further complicating \u00d8rsted\u2019s efforts to recover from its financial difficulties. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024] - \u00d8rsted experienced a leadership crisis in late 2023, with the abrupt dismissal of its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Daniel Lerup and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Richard Hunter following a disastrous financial year. The company suffered a massive loss of \u20ac2.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to high write-offs from abandoned offshore wind projects on the U.S. East Coast. This leadership shake-up reflects the severity of \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles and raises concerns about stability at the top levels of management. Frequent executive turnover can disrupt strategic planning and investor confidence. [Energie & Management, Volker Stephan, February 27, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to divest a significant stake in its U.S. onshore wind farms, selling off equity ownership in four wind farms with a total capacity of 957 MW for approximately $300 million. This marks the company\u2019s second major asset divestment in the U.S., highlighting its need to generate liquidity amid financial difficulties. While \u00d8rsted retains operational control, the sale indicates that the company is struggling to maintain its ambitious renewable energy expansion without offloading assets. Such divestments could weaken its long-term market position in the U.S. renewable energy sector. [Nordic Business Report, Anonymous, March 13, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted and other offshore wind developers faced significant financial challenges in 2023, leading to the cancellation of multiple projects in the U.S. Northeast.

The money for wind turbines has been agreed as part of a government \nauction for renewable energy contracts known as the allocation round 6 (AR6). Under this system, the Government \nencourages companies to build low-carbon energy plants such as solar and wind farms by offering a minimum price \nfor the electricity generated. The money for such subsidies is eventually added to bills. The UK's power grid \noperator, National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO), calculates \"budget impact\" of the subsidies for offshore \nwind and other renewables at \u00a34bn from 2026 to 2031, in today's money.\nThe costs given exclude the additional expense of transmission lines and the expansion of the national grid to \nhandle the extra power.\nIt means more than five gigawatts (GW) of new offshore wind power is now set for construction - a stark contrast to \nlast year's botched auction round when there were no bids. The Tories offered subsidies so low - at \u00a340 per \nmegawatt hour (MWh) - that no off- shore wind developers came forward.\nPage 2 of 2\nMiliband's wind farms to cost families \u00a3150; Households to pick up \u00a33bn bill as Energy Secretary oversees \nrecord expansion of renewables\nSubsidies under Mr Miliband will be more than doubled to over \u00a382 per MWh. Solar farms will get \u00a370/MWh, with \nnewer technologies such as floating wind handed \u00a3195/MWh and tidal stream projects given \u00a3239/MWh.\nA total of 131 clean energy projects have won state subsidies in this year's auction, including 115 solar projects \nacross England and onshore wind projects mainly in Scotland and Wales.\nMany of the onshore projects are likely to prove highly controversial, with homeowners and environmentalists \nobjecting to the industrialisation of landscapes with panels and turbines.\nHowever, Mr Miliband hailed the auction results as a triumph. He said: \"We inherited a broken energy policy. Today \nwe have a record-setting round for enough renewable power for 11m homes, essential to give energy security to \nfamilies across the country. It is another significant step forward in our mission for clean power by 2030.\"\nOrsted is one of the biggest winners.\nIt has been allowed to shunt much of its Hornsea 3 project out of contracts signed under previous allocation rounds, \nwhere lower subsidies were offered, into this year's auction. A spokesman for Mr Miliband said the move had been \npermitted because otherwise Hornsea 3 - potentially the world's largest wind farm at 3GW - might never have been \nbuilt.\nCritics will argue that such contracts become meaningless if companies can simply move them from one auction \nround if a subsequent one offers better terms. Orsted was also awarded a 2.4GW CfD for Hornsea 4. Rasmus \nErrboe, of Orsted, said: \"We look forward to delivering these landmark projects, which will supply renewable power \nat a large scale to UK consumers and businesses and help the UK Government achieve its target of quadrupling \noffshore wind capacity to 60GW by 2030.\"\nScottishPower has been offered contracts for another two large wind farms, East Anglia Two and East Anglia \nThree. As with Orsted, it was allowed to move its East Anglia Three project out of the contracts signed under a \nprevious and less lucrative auction.\nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesman said it did not recognise the costs per household, but \nrenewable energy remained essential to boost UK energy security.\nLoad-Date: September 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Daily Telegraph\nAuthor: Jonathan Leake\nDate: September 04, 2024\nTitle: Miliband's wind farms to cost families \u00a3150; Households to pick up \u00a33bn bill as Energy Secretary oversees record expansion of renewables\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Lawsuits buffet US offshore wind projects, seeking to end or delay them\n## Media outlet: The Independent\n### Author: Wayne Parry\n### Date: September 18, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 3\nLawsuits buffet US offshore wind projects, seeking to end or delay them\nLawsuits buffet US offshore wind projects, seeking to end or delay them\nThe Independent (United Kingdom)\nSeptember 18, 2024 Wednesday 7:49 PM EST\nCopyright 2024 Independent Print Ltd  All Rights Reserved\nSection: CONSTRUCTION NEWS, US news, US Federal Government news, Lawsuits news & OUTSOURCING \nNEWS\nLength: 858 words\nByline: Wayne Parry\nBody\n Opponents of offshore wind around the U.S. are pelting projects with lawsuits seeking to cancel them or tie them \nup for years in costly litigation.\nThe court cases represent another hurdle the nascent industry must overcome, particularly along the East Coast \nwhere opposition to offshore wind farms is vocal and well-organized. \nThey add another pressure point for an industry already struggling with escalating prices, shaky supply chains, and \na handful of highly publicized turbine failures that opponents are seizing on as proof that the structures are \nunreliable and unsafe, something the industry denies.\nThere are 13 cases pending in federal courts targeting offshore wind projects, according to the American Clean \nPower Association, an offshore wind trade group. An undetermined number of additional lawsuits are active in state \ncourts, they said.\nRobin Shaffer is president of Protect Our Coast NJ, a citizens group that has filed numerous lawsuits in New Jersey \nagainst two offshore projects currently or previously proposed. \nShaffer said his group was at least partly responsible for scuttling two New Jersey wind farms proposed by Orsted \nthat the Danish wind giant scrapped last October, saying they were no longer financially workable.\n\"An ancillary benefit of our legal strategy is to give pause or doubt in the minds of investors in the big corporations \nthat are undertaking these projects,\" he said. \"Last year, we saw Orsted leave its commitment to build Ocean Wind \noff the southern New Jersey coast amidst the uncertainty of two lawsuits we filed, as well as another filed by Cape \nMay County.\"\nPage 2 of 3\nLawsuits buffet US offshore wind projects, seeking to end or delay them\nOpponents cite altered views of the horizon from wind turbines and concerns about what the structures might do to \nmarine life. They also cite rising projected prices for electricity generated from the wind farms, and point to recent \nturbine collapses off Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts and at Doggers Bank off the English coast as proof the \ntechnology is risky.\nSupporters say offshore wind is necessary to combat climate change, which they call the principal threat to the \nocean and its inhabitants.\n\"Offshore wind projects undergo rigorous environmental reviews and permitting processes, in addition to a lengthy \npublic comment period,\" said Jason Ryan, a spokesman for the Clean Power Association. \"The current slate of U.S. \noffshore wind projects under construction and development are among the most carefully planned and analyzed \ninfrastructure projects in U.S. history; we are confident their permits will withstand legal scrutiny.\"\nPaulina O'Connor, executive director of the New Jersey Offshore Wind Alliance, said offshore wind is needed to \ncombat climate change.\n\"On the heels of one of the hottest summers on record, it is disappointing to see another frivolous lawsuit filed by \nthose with opposing views,\" she said of the most recent lawsuit.\nThat action was filed Friday by Save LBI, another New Jersey citizen group. It claims that Atlantic Shores, the New \nJersey project furthest along its state's approval path, would violate noise ordinances during pile driving and \noperation of hundreds of wind turbines. The group says it has several other lawsuits on the way. Atlantic Shores \ndeclined to comment.\nOther litigation in New Jersey challenged Orsted's now-scrapped wind farm plan, a state tax break the company \nwould have received, and even the placement of a power cable that would bring electricity from the project onshore. \nA group of Jersey Shore towns sued Atlantic Shores, and fishing and environmental groups sued two federal \nagencies overseeing offshore wind projects. They are appealing the dismissal of their suit after a judge ruled they \nhad no legal standing to sue.\nOffshore wind foes in other states are also turning to the courts.\nIn March, The National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative watchdog group in Virginia, sued Dominion Energy \nand the federal government hoping to block a wind farm off the coast of Virginia Beach. Dominion called the suit \nmeritless and said it employs multiple layers of protection for the marine environment.\nLast year, a Rhode Island nonprofit known for its seaside mansions sued the federal government challenging the \npermitting process for offshore wind energy projects off Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. The Preservation \nSociety of Newport County said the presence of hundreds of wind turbines off the New England coast would ruin \nocean views from several of its historic properties.\nAlso in Rhode Island, the anti-wind group Green Oceans sued the federal government in April, saying it illegally \ngave Orsted permits for its South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects. Orsted declined comment on the \nlawsuit but noted that South Fork is fully operational and Revolution recently installed its first turbine.\nOn the West Coast, the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians in Oregon, whose \nculture reveres the ocean, sued the federal government Tuesday over plans to hold an offshore wind energy \nauction next month.\nAnd in March, fishermen sued California over plans for three floating wind farms.\n___\nFollow Wayne Parry on X at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC Page 3 of 3\nLawsuits buffet US offshore wind projects, seeking to end or delay them\nLoad-Date: September 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Independent\nAuthor: Wayne Parry\nDate: September 18, 2024\nTitle: Lawsuits buffet US offshore wind projects, seeking to end or delay them\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: \u00c9olien : Equinor prend pr\u00e8s de 10% dans le danois Orsted\n## Media outlet: Lefigaro\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: October 07, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 1\n\u00c9olien : Equinor prend pr\u00e8s de 10% dans le danois Orsted\n\u00c9olien : Equinor prend pr\u00e8s de 10% dans le danois Orsted\nLefigaro.fr\nlundi 7 octobre 2024 01:00 PM GMT\nCopyright 2024 SOCIETE DU FIGARO Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s\nLength: 313 words\nDateline: Danemark \nBody\n    \nLe g\u00e9ant p\u00e9trolier norv\u00e9gien&#160; Equinor&#160;a annonc\u00e9 lundi qu'il avait achet\u00e9 une part de 9,8% dans le \nsp\u00e9cialiste danois des \u00e9nergies renouvelables Orsted, devenant ainsi son deuxi\u00e8me plus gros actionnaire derri\u00e8re \nl'\u00c9tat danois.

Critics argue that such contract adjustments undermine the credibility of the auction process, as companies can move projects to rounds with higher subsidies, potentially inflating costs for consumers. This move has sparked debate over whether the government\u2019s renewable energy policies are being manipulated to benefit large energy firms at the expense of billpayers. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, September 03, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted is facing multiple lawsuits in the U.S. that seek to delay or cancel offshore wind projects, adding to the company\u2019s financial and operational challenges. Opponents, including citizen groups and environmental organizations, argue that the projects could harm marine life, disrupt coastal views, and lead to higher electricity prices. Legal battles have already contributed to the cancellation of \u00d8rsted\u2019s Ocean Wind projects in New Jersey, with opponents claiming their lawsuits created uncertainty that deterred investors. These legal challenges add another layer of risk to \u00d8rsted\u2019s U.S. expansion strategy and could further delay the development of offshore wind infrastructure. [The Independent, Wayne Parry, September 18, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles have made it an acquisition target, with Norwegian oil and gas giant Equinor purchasing a 9.8% stake in the company for approximately $2.5 billion. This investment comes at a time when \u00d8rsted\u2019s stock price has significantly declined due to project cancellations, rising costs, and financial impairments. While Equinor frames the acquisition as a strategic move to expand its renewable energy portfolio, the purchase highlights \u00d8rsted\u2019s weakened financial position and vulnerability to external takeovers. The deal also raises concerns about the increasing influence of fossil fuel companies in the renewable energy sector. [Lefigaro, Anonymous, October 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has suffered significant financial losses due to project cancellations and impairments, with the company reporting a loss of 1.7 billion Danish kroner (\u20ac225 million) in the second quarter of 2024. These losses stem from delays and the abandonment of key offshore wind projects, further exacerbating the company\u2019s financial instability. The company\u2019s ambitious goal of expanding its renewable energy capacity to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030 is now under pressure, as financial constraints force it to scale back investments. This financial downturn raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to maintain its leadership in the offshore wind sector. [Energie & Management, Georg Eble, October 07, 2024]",
