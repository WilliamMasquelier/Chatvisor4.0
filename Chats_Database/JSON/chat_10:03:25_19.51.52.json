Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Michael Woodley | Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation boss | \"This position of the state government takes us back 50 years to that colonial mentality and attitudes that they can come in and take what they want.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Woodley | Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation boss | \"This is a big area of land that has been cleared for mining. There's been interference with river systems and the environment, not to mention our heritage sites, some dating back 50,000 years, and that's worth $5m-$10m? Come on. The state government may as well say in its argument that we don't exist or shouldn't exist.\" | N.A. |\n| Kado Muir | National Native Title Council president | \"It is just a poor reflection on their thinking and where they're at.\" | N.A. |\n| Kado Muir | National Native Title Council president | \"Low-balling the deep pain and suffering of spiritual value is poor form but not unexpected given the atrocious track record of this WA government approval (of) wanton section 18 destruction and desecration of sites, compounded by their ridiculous backflip in heritage protection reform.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
