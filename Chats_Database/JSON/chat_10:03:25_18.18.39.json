Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: OPINION; Pg. 39\nLength: 777 words\nByline: Patrick Gibbons\nBody\nTransition Andrew Forrest is not alone. Many companies have suffered a similar delusion about a simple, easy and \ncheap future.\nFortescue's hydrogen dreams have come up against the hard energy reality - affordability, reliability and zero \nemissions are difficult to achieve together. But Fortescue is not alone.\nFor the past decade, many have suffered a similar energy delusion. Promises of an easy transition have given way \nto the realisation that nothing with energy or climate ambitions is simple or cheap.\nOnly this month, Google, which had claimed to be carbon-neutral since 2007, said it no longer counted offsets and \nthat it now aimed for neutrality by 2030 because the energy demand associated with AI had seen its emissions \nincrease 48 per cent between 2019 and 2023. Likewise, some Australian funds walked back climate commitments. \nOr just ask Europe.\nThe hype around green hydrogen should be a case study for those interested in the difficulties when it comes to \nenergy and climate.\nDespite green hydrogen being seen as the Swiss Army knife for difficult decarbonisation problems, buyers were \nhard to find, largely because the cost remained stubbornly high and the technical challenges more complex than \nenvisaged.\nAttempts to deliver green hydrogen at $2 a kilogram sounded great at a political level. But, like most politically \ngenerated targets, ambition is no replacement for hard analysis.\nEven with the best assumptions, analysts struggled to get it below $5 a kilogram any time soon. And as with all \nprojections, they depended on the assumptions. The rise in interest rates and equipment costs have cruelled low-\ncost scenarios.\nAs clean energy advocate Michael Liebreich noted earlier this year, when it came to hydrogen, \"expectations have \nraced far ahead of reality\".\nPage 2 of 2\nHard energy reality has mugged Fortescue's hydrogen dream\nWhile various governments and the IEA were making grandiose predictions about how much clean hydrogen would \nbe produced, they bore no relationship to the real world.\nThe Sixth Hydrogen Ministerial held last September in Japan predicted global production of renewable/low-carbon \nhydrogen by 2030 would be 90 million tonnes.\nThis would, Liebreich pointed out, require 60 times more clean hydrogen production than what's already been \nfunded. Even more risibly, he noted an annual demand of 50 million tonnes would have to be created from sectors \nthat do not use hydrogen.\nIn other words, the hydrogen story, at best, is based on wishful thinking. Less charitably, it's based on hype driven \nby subsidy chasing.\nAnd with the increasingly likely return of former president Donald Trump to the White House, the wishful thinking of \nhydrogen advocates will face even further setbacks as the new administration seeks to wind back elements of the \nBiden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. Hydrogen subsidies are on the list.\nThis isn't to say green or clean hydrogen has no future, rather its application will be more modest - green metals, \nsome transport and fertilisers.\nFortescue's about-face reflects the bigger challenge of decarbonising its Pilbara mining operations, for which it still \nclaims will be \"Real Zero by 2030\". Its mines and rail operations annually consume about\n700 million litres of diesel.\nThe push to electrify the Pilbara mines as a way of decarbonising is not straightforward.\nStarting with the diesel trucks that carry iron ore, each of these weigh more than 500 tonnes, and carry 300 tonnes \nof ore. Add in trains about 2.8 kilometres in length, all powered by diesel locomotives, there are clear challenges of \ncost-effectively electrifying what is a global logistical operation that operates 24/7.\nDoing so requires more than just the rollout of renewable energy. Realistically, the push to achieve net zero in the \nmines requires step changes in technology and its commercial deployment, all of which will take time.\nFurther, it highlights the need for a more realistic approach to the challenges of decarbonisation.\nWhether activists and some policymakers want to hear it, the world is not moving off fossil fuels any time soon. Last \nyear saw record demand for oil, coal and gas. This is not about to change.\nThe real world of energy where demand is only rising, with affordability and reliability the key criteria, is only going \nto make it harder for those companies that have overpromised.\nAnd although Fortescue has taken the hard decision to moderate its decarbonisation ambitions and in the process \nlay off 700 people, it's an open question as to who else will follow suit. There is no shortage of companies that have \nmade tough-to-meet commitments that look increasingly unrealistic.\nPatrick Gibbons is a former diplomat and partner at corporate advisory firm Orizontas.\nLoad-Date: July 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Patrick Gibbons\nDate: July 22, 2024\nTitle: Hard energy reality has mugged Fortescue's hydrogen dream\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Bowen lost in a Forrest of green energy hubris\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Nick Cater\n### Date: July 22, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 3\nBowen lost in a Forrest of green energy hubris\nBowen lost in a Forrest of green energy hubris\nThe Australian\nJuly 22, 2024 Monday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMMENTARY; Pg. 13\nLength: 1127 words\nByline: Nick Cater\nBody\nEnergy Minister Chis Bowen was remarkably sanguine last week about the implosion of Andrew Forrest's plan to \nproduce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030.\nAt lunchtime on Wednesday, Bowen told the National Press Club the green hydrogen transition was progressing \"at \npace\", putting Australia on track to become a renewable energy superpower by the end of the decade. Less than \nthree hours later, Forrest's Fortescue Metals told investors it was kicking its target down the road from 2030 to a \ndestination one stop short of Never Never Land. In the meantime, Fortescue will concentrate on what it does best: \ndigging stuff out of the ground instead of building castles in the air.\n\"Reports of the death of green hydrogen have been greatly exaggerated,\" said Bowen. Fortescue may have \"de-\nprioritised\" green hydrogen, but $200bn of investment was \"in the pipeline\". That's renewable energy speak for \"the \ncheque is in the mail\".\nA Boston Consulting survey, published last September, found that 824 green hydrogen projects with a theoretical \ncapacity of 21 million tonnes a year were in the pipeline in North America and Europe. But only 2 per cent of the \nannounced capacity reached the planning stage, and just 0.2 per cent were completed.\nGlobal energy companies are rethinking the wisdom of pumping billions of dollars of capital into an unproven \ntechnology with uncertain timing and no guaranteed rate of return. Statkraft, the Norwegian hydro-electricity giant, \nrolled back its plans last month. \"We have definitely underestimated the challenges,\" a company spokesman said. \n\"Developing green hydrogen has become much more expensive than we expected.\" Earlier this year, French \nenergy giant Engie dropped plans to build a green hydrogen plant in Portugal. Only this month, the European Court \nof Auditors criticised the European Union's 2030 green hydrogen production target of 10 million tonnes as \n\"overambitious\", saying it was unlikely to be met and, therefore, shouldn't be included in carbon reduction \ncalculations.\nIt's been less than three years since Forrest boasted about spending $1bn to build the world's largest green \nhydrogen electrolyser manufacturing plant in Gladstone, Queensland.\nPage 2 of 3\nBowen lost in a Forrest of green energy hubris\nForrest explained his plans to convert the Gibson Island ammonia factory in Brisbane to run on green hydrogen. He \nalso committed to building the world's first green hydrogen import and export facility at Port Kembla, linked to a \npower station fired by \"the miracle molecule \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. clean as the day is long \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 crystal clean, green hydrogen made \nright here at home\".\nMuch nonsense has been spoken at the National Press Club over the years, but seldom have journalists been \ntaken on a flight of fancy quite as crazy as the one piloted by Forrest back in October 2021. \"To make green \nhydrogen, you simply split water,\" he said. \"Any old water \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It can be wastewater, desalinated water, sea water \ninto hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity only.\n\"It's like a miracle molecule, the Swiss Army knife of energy and green products, versatile and able to decarbonise \neven the most challenging sectors, like, say, iron ore, cement, steel, iron fertilisers, aeroplanes, trucks, trains, cars.\" \nWe now know all this was pure fantasy. The multibillion-dollar projects he promised were technologically unproven \nand economically unfeasible. There was barely a dollar of committed finance behind them and only the flimsiest of \nbusiness cases.\nWe shouldn't be surprised. Hydrogen has been breaking hearts since 1766, when Henry Cavendish described the \nproduction of \"inflammable air\" by reacting zinc metal with hydrochloric acid. Try as they might, technologists have \nnever overcome hydrogen's fatal flaw: whatever hydrogen is asked to do, another technology will do it better, safer \nand cheaper.\nForrest's 2021 expectations about the cost of green hydrogen were somewhat wide of the mark. The cost had \nhalved, he claimed, because \"unlike fossil fuels, green hydrogen was becoming cheaper and would never run out\".\nLast week he told Nine Radio in Perth: \"We just have to work out now how to produce it cheaply enough.\" The \ncollapse of the green hydrogen bubble is a double blow for Bowen.\nGreen hydrogen manufacturing and the proposed Sun Cable solar development were supposed to provide the \nportable energy that would turn Australia into a renewable energy export power by the end of the decade. Neither \nproject is going to happen, certainly not by 2030. The collapse of the business case for green hydrogen puts the lie \nto Bowen's claim that renewable energy is cheap.\nHours before the Fortescue announcement, he was repeating his trite line at the National Press Club. Yet even \nBowen's cheer squad now doubts the claim, if it is not ready to abandon all of the hopes for a renewable future. \nGreen hydrogen still had a great future, an opinion article in Renew Economy claimed. It's just there was \"limited \naccess to the large amounts of low-cost renewable energy\". Quite.\nMany of us have been making that point for some time. The lesson for Bowen from the green hydrogen debacle is \nthat he should stop clogging his diary with carpet-bagging time-wasters and stick with the technology that actually \nexists. Bowen will never get back the hours he's spent listening to the green hydrogen salesmen peddling miracle \ncures for the planet, just as taxpayers are unlikely to see a return on the billions of dollars of poorly scoped \nsubsidies pushed their way.\nYet Bowen is part of a government that believes it understands capital allocation better than the markets. Its \nTreasurer has fallen for the neo-Marxist fantasy of values-based capitalism and the delusion that innovation should \nbe driven by the state.\nIt has a Finance Minister who lacks the wisdom to ask tough questions and a Prime Minister content to leave the \ndetails to others. Labor will respond to Fortescue's misadventures by throwing more money into its Hydrogen \nHeadstart program and associated corporate welfare schemes designed to bridge the gap between the cost of \nmanufacturing green hydrogen and the amount customers are willing to pay.\nAustralia will be caught up in the global sugar war, competing with governments in Europe and North America to \npile more sugar on the table. However, it will not have the advantage of cheap energy enjoyed by countries blessed \nwith abundant hydro-electricity or in which nuclear power is legal.Page 3 of 3\nBowen lost in a Forrest of green energy hubris\nPoliticians and entrepreneurs may be equally prone to the cognitive biases that allow bad ideas to hang around \nlong after they should've been dismissed. The redeeming grace of entrepreneurs is the profit motive, which tells \nthem when to stop throwing good money after bad.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 748 words\nHighlight: Fortescue is about to turn 21, and with age seemingly comes wisdom, as the company puts its \nenormously expensive green hydrogen plans on the backburner.\nBody\nAndrew Forrest's corporate baby, Fortescue, turns 21 on Thursday. So it seems fitting that the mining billionaire \nand climate change evangelist appears to have taken stock of what's economically and technologically achievable \nin his trailblazing quest to green the planet.\nIt's a reality check for Forrest and Fortescue, who have perhaps realised that chasing some dreams doesn't make \nsense, and wild ambition more often than not needs to be tempered with some common sense.\nWhile Fortescue is not giving up on its green aspirations, there is clearly a pivot to realism on how it can get there. \nIt is looking to move downstream to more conventional green electricity projects - wind and solar. The hundreds of \nbillions that investors around the world (including Forrest) have already ploughed into these renewables are a \ntestament to the fact that they stack up economically.\nBut what about green hydrogen, produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity? \nHas Forrest raised the white flag on the technology? Not yet, and maybe never.\nThe new strategy will lead to a number of green hydrogen projects being \"deprioritised\", Forrest told this masthead \non Wednesday, but Fortescue will still hold on to a few.\nThe way Forrest explained it, Fortescue is \"pivoting downstream along the conveyor belt\", and when green \nelectricity becomes cheap and abundant enough, Fortescue can go back to fuelling Forrest's \"green hydrogen \nobjectives\".\nMaking green hydrogen, which requires enormous amounts of energy, is expensive using today's technology, which \nis why Fortescue has decided to take a breather and support more established renewable technology.\nCosts and reassessments aside, Forrest is also seemingly facing the looming challenge of dealing with the fallout \nfrom the likely return of Donald Trump to the White House.\nTrump's not exactly a climate crusader, but Forrest seems unperturbed.\n\"What I know about President Biden and Trump is that they will turn on a dime. Both Trump and his nominated vice \npresident, J.D. Vance, will act in the best interests of America or get tossed out of government,\" Forrest said.\nPage 2 of 2\nBillionaire Andrew Forrest's green crusade cops a reality check\n\"Trump always wants to clear the swamp, [and to do that] he would want to reduce the high-cost structure of the \nswamp, which is the fossil fuel sector.\"\nLink to Image\nDomenico Pugliese\nMeanwhile, the move to reposition Fortescue's green investment will certainly find favour with the miner's \ninvestors, who have enjoyed some $49 billion in dividends and capital appreciation since the company was listed.\nWhile Forrest still has plenty of shareholders who back his mission, concerns had been raised about the large \nnumber of green projects Fortescue was investigating and the amount of money (generated from iron ore) that was \nneeded to pursue them.\nFortescue said on Wednesday that the repositioning of its priorities would lead to 700 staff, or about 5 per cent of \nthe company's workforce, being retrenched. The cuts are part of a broader plan to further consolidate the two arms \nof the company - its renewable energy arm and its iron ore division - into a single operating entity.\nEach division will retain its current chief executive, but the next level of executives will be shared across both pillars.\nThe company's chief legal counsel, Phil McKeiver, who had been running a corporate espionage claim by \nFortescue against three ex-employees in court, will no longer retain a dual role as company secretary. \n(Fortescue's legal team has been accused of using private investigators to follow three former executives and their \nfamilies. The company accused the men of copying and taking intellectual property when they left to start a rival \ngreen iron project called Element Zero.)\n\"People in senior management make the decisions they do, and we don't always agree with them,\" Forrest said.\n\"No board member knew about the private investigator and a very enthusiastic group general counsel and company \nsecretary wanted to demonstrate that you cannot steal technology and then eliminate that technology that the \ncompany produced on the way out. That's like Hitler ripping up the bridges retreating out of Poland.\n\"You can be assured that the temperature turned a little warmer around that gentleman's desk. He took it upon \nhimself to tender his resignation (as legal counsel),\" Forrest added.\nThat offer was rejected by Fortescue, with McKeiver staying on as general counsel.\nThe Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day's trading.
