[Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has never had an Indigenous land use agreement with the Yindjibarndi people, despite mining on their land for over a decade, leading to a $500 million compensation claim for unpaid royalties, interest, and damages for cultural and spiritual losses, which could result in a significant financial and reputational impact on the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued in court that compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should not be based on the value of the minerals extracted from their land, despite industry standards where native title holders receive a percentage of royalties, raising concerns about the company's approach to Indigenous compensation. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest held private meetings in a Perth park with Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation leader Michael Woodley in an attempt to settle a billion-dollar compensation case, but the talks failed as the parties remain hundreds of millions of dollars apart, highlighting the ongoing dispute and lack of resolution. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue is facing a potential $1 billion compensation claim from the Yindjibarndi people, including $500 million for economic losses and an additional $500 million for the destruction of more than 240 culturally significant sites, which could have major financial and reputational consequences for the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue was left exposed to the Yindjibarndi compensation claim in 2020 after the High Court denied the company special leave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings, which found that a large part of its Solomon iron ore mining hub was built without permission from traditional owners, raising legal and ethical concerns about its operations. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued that any compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should be funded by the State of Western Australia because it granted the mining tenements, but the WA government maintains that Fortescue should pay, creating further uncertainty over the company's financial liability. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Institutional investors are increasingly avoiding Fortescue, making it the least-held stock among the 10 largest companies on the ASX, with concerns over its lower iron ore grades, high executive turnover, and heavy spending on unprofitable green hydrogen projects. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been ranked as the \"least-loved\" stock among major Australian companies in a JPMorgan survey of 50 fund managers, reflecting ongoing skepticism about its business strategy and financial stability. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Analysts and brokers have been bearish on Fortescue for an extended period, with most maintaining a sell rating on the stock since November 2022, in contrast to competitors BHP and Rio Tinto, which have never held a majority sell rating since at least 2009. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue lost its final buy rating in January after JPMorgan's head of Australian resources advised investors to take profits, with the stock subsequently falling more than 10% from its peak in early February, raising concerns about its valuation and future performance. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's unconventional management style under Andrew Forrest has left the investment community baffled, with concerns that the company's entrepreneurial approach lacks the structured management seen in competitors like BHP and Rio Tinto. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been criticized for its approach to Indigenous compensation, with an expert witness arguing in court that the company\u2019s attempt to exclude the value of minerals from compensation calculations is \"nonsensical\" and unfair to the Yindjibarndi people. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue began mining at the Solomon hub in 2013 without an agreement from the Yindjibarndi\u2019s registered native title body and instead dealt with a breakaway group, raising ethical concerns about its treatment of traditional owners. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has slammed the Biden administration\u2019s proposed hydrogen incentive rules, arguing that they could triple the cost of low-carbon hydrogen projects and stifle growth in the sector, potentially impacting the company\u2019s green energy ambitions. [Australian Financial Review, Peter Ker, April 22, 2024]. - Fortescue's iron ore shipments fell 6% in the March quarter compared to the same period last year due to a derailment in late December and weather disruptions, raising concerns about the company's logistics resilience and ability to meet its full-year shipment targets. [The Age, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's Iron Bridge project continues to face significant operational issues, with a faulty water pipeline and plant inefficiencies slowing output, forcing the company to undertake costly repairs and reconfigure its processing plant, which could delay production targets. [The Age, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has forecast that its full-year iron ore shipments will likely come in at the lower end of its guidance range due to operational setbacks, including a derailment and adverse weather, which could impact revenue and investor confidence. [Seeking Alpha, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's Iron Bridge magnetite project has suffered another production downgrade, with expected shipments now reduced to just 2 million tonnes, significantly below previous guidance, highlighting ongoing challenges in ramping up the project. [The Australian, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's iron ore exports dropped 11% from the December quarter, and the decline in shipments pushed up average C1 cash costs by 7% to $18.93 per tonne, increasing operational expenses and potentially squeezing profit margins. [The Australian, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue will need to maintain near-record export rates to meet its full-year shipment guidance, requiring an ambitious 53.5 million tonnes in the June quarter, which may be difficult given recent logistical and operational setbacks. [The Daily Telegraph, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's Gibson Island hydrogen project has been sidelined despite receiving a $13.7 million government grant, with the company citing high Australian power prices as a major obstacle, raising doubts about the financial viability of its domestic green hydrogen ambitions.

We thank Julie for all she has contributed over 11 years \nand wish her the best as she enjoys some travel and time with her family,\" he said.\nMs Shuttleworth had most recently been in charge of developing Fortescue's Belinga iron ore project in Gabon.\nShe was previously a key member of the team seeking to deliver on Dr Forrest's plans to reshape Fortescue as a \nglobal green energy and hydrogen giant, as the first boss of Fortescue Future Energy.\nShe is the latest in a long line of senior executives to leave Fortescue over the last two years.\nFormer Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner also left the company this year, along with Deborah \nCaudle, the chief financial officer of Fortescue's energy division for only four months.\nA tumultuous 2023 saw the departure of chief executive Fiona Hick in August after only six months in the role, with \nnewly appointed chief financial officer Christina Morris departing within a few days.\nDr Forrest in February blamed an exodus of senior bosses on the transition from a \"fossil fuel-burning company to a \ngreen energy company\", but insists a -period of high turnover is starting to settle down.\nA revolving door of executives have jumped ship from the company in the past 12 months as pressure grows on \nFortescue to execute a high-stakes pivot to green energy from its iron ore foundations that made its founder one of \nAustralia's richest men.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue loses another exec\nDr Forrest last year said executives who left the iron ore major had struggled to cope with the -\"boiler room\" \nconditions of the company and were not following his green vision.\nHowever, Dr Forrest said in February that a degree of turnover was expected as the company transitioned from a \npure iron ore producer to a green energy company with lofty global renewable hydrogen ambitions.\nFormer prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also formally severed ties with the company, and external affairs boss \nFiona Sugden left to join the office of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\nFortescue has promised to end its use of fossil fuels by the end of the decade and become a \"real zero\" emitter of \ncarbon.\nDr Forrest said last year that former CEO Fiona Hick chose to step aside after just six months in the role following \ndifferences of opinion over the company's green transition.\nDr Forrest said Ms Hick's swift departure - confirmed just hours after Fortescue wrapped up a lavish 20-year \nanniversary party at the company's Solomon iron ore hub in the Pilbara - was an example of Fortescue's \"fail fast\" -\napproach. He said the company had chosen to lose Ms Hick, knowing that it would be criticised in the media, rather \nthan delay the decision out of fear of negative headlines.\nFortescue this month launched secret raids on the homes and offices of directors of a green steel competitor in a \nmove described by Federal Court judge John Logan as a potential \"industrial-scale forensic debacle\" amid claims of \nintellectual property theft. Fortescue won court orders authorising the searches in May, targeting the offices of \nwould-be green steel competitor Element Zero and the homes and computers of directors, including former \nFortescue chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk, long term Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman and former \nFortescue staffer Bjorn Winther-Jensen.\nLoad-Date: June 13, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Nick Evans\nDate: June 14, 2024\nTitle: Fortescue loses another exec\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Fortescue in reshuffle of green team\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Nick Evans\n### Date: June 15, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 3\nFortescue in reshuffle of green team\nFortescue in reshuffle of green team\nThe Australian\nJune 15, 2024 Saturday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 29\nLength: 1046 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue has embarked on a major management restructure of its energy -division amid a wave \nof new executive departures, with Argentinian rugby star Gus Pichot looming as the major winner in the shake-up.\nThe reset has been triggered by the departure of the recently appointed boss of the company's UK technology arm \nand the resignation of Fortescue's president of European operations - the second to resign from the post this year.\nFortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson has been handed -direct responsibility for running UK-based \nWilliams Advanced Engineering, renamed Fortescue Zero this month.\nFormer Argentina rugby international Pichot, a close confidant of Dr Forrest, will take charge of running the rest of \nFortescue's global energy projects in addition to its Latin American operations.\nMr Pichot has been appointed Fortescue's \"regional director - energy\", meaning the other regional directors will \nreport -directly to him, rather than to Mr Hutchinson.\nA spokesman for Fortescue said there had been no change to his position, adding the former GE executive \nremained the chief executive of Fortescue Energy and that Mr Pichot remained his subordinate.\n\"Fortescue Energy CEO Mark Hutchinson recently took on the additional role of leading Fortescue Zero, the green \ntechnology arm of Fortescue. Fortescue Zero brings together all the green technologies to accelerate commercial \ndecarbonisation rapidly, profitably and globally. This includes haul trucks, batteries, electrolysers, power \nconversion, intelligence software, trains, green shipping and green iron,\" he said.\n\"While Western Australia remains Fortescue's home, Perth is not the centre of gravity for our energy business. \nFortescue Energy's executive team reflects the global nature of the company.\" In addition to the fresh upheaval \nwithin Fortescue's energy division, the company is still to announce the appointment of a permanent chief financial \nofficer, 10 months after the sudden departure of Christine Morris from the role. Ms Morris quit after only two months \nin the job, following the exit of metals boss Fiona Hick, who herself lasted only a few months at the company.\nPage 2 of 3\nFortescue in reshuffle of green team\nThe latest restructure within Fortescue's energy division was partly triggered by the recent departure from \nFortescue Zero of Judith Judson, appointed only 10 months ago. Ms Judson remains a Fortescue employee but is \nunderstood to have elected to return to live and work in the US for family reasons.\nFortescue Europe president Bruh Terfie has also just handed in his notice. Mr Terfie previously ran the company's \nAfrican section and was made the acting president for Europe in February, when Carlos Lange quit the job after \nonly 10 months.\nMr Hutchinson will now replace Ms Judson as the interim CEO of Fortescue Zero, the former technology company \nfounded to back the Williams Formula One racing car team.\nMr Hutchinson joined Fortescue only two years ago, tasked with turning the results of Dr Forrest's grand green \nenergy ambitions into reality.\nBut from the hundreds of billions of dollars in green energy projects earmarked by the iron ore billionaire's whirlwind \nglobal tour in 2020 and 2021, Fortescue's energy division has only managed to advance three relatively minor \nprojects to the point of a final investment decision.",
