Ltd.\nLength: 315 words\nDateline: CANBERRA Aug 28\nBody\n  Australian mining giant Fortescue Ltd has reported steady iron ore production as it slows the pace of its push into \ngreen hydrogen.\n   The iron ore and energy group on Wednesday posted a three per cent rise in underlying net profit to $US5.68 \nbillion for the year to June 30 as higher iron ore prices offset inflationary pressures.\n   Fortescue reported full-year shipments largely unchanged at 191.6 million tonnes from operations in the Pilbara \nregion of Western Australia, with a second-half record of 97 million tonnes.\n   One of the world's largest iron ore companies, revenue rose eight per cent to $US18.22 billion, and cash on hand \nwas $US4.9 billion.\n   The group's $US6.2 billion decarbonisation plan includes the deployment of an additional two to three gigawatt of \nrenewable energy generation and battery storage, in addition to electric haul trucks and green locomotives.\n   By meeting the future market for green metal, Fortescue plans to become one of the world's largest consumers \nof green hydrogen.\n   But energy CEO Mark Hutchison said \"we are realistic about the pace of the current global energy transition\" and \n\"financial discipline always comes first\".\n   \"We will never make investments that are not economically viable,\" he said.\n   Executive chairman Andrew Forrest said the group remained \"resolutely committed\" to meeting its real zero target \nby 2030.\n   \"It is the responsibility of every company to join us in moving to a world that is no longer reliant on fossil fuels,\" Dr \nForrest said.\n   While the global shift was at a critical juncture, the Fortescue's emissions in FY24 were around 10 per cent less \nthan forecast, he said.\n   In the critical minerals portfolio, Fortescue has an exploration focus on copper, lithium and rare earths.\nPage 2 of 2\nFED:Fortescue steadies iron ore, 'realistic' on hydrogen\n   Fortescue declared a fully franked final dividend of 89 Aussie cents, for a total dividend of $A1.97 - up from \n$A1.75 a year earlier.\nLoad-Date: August 27, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
