RBC analysts at RBC said it came in \nbelow expectations with a net present value of $332m, with higher costs and a shorter than expected mine life.\nIt will produce about 130,000 ounces per annum.\nBut others in the market say that the findings are largely in line with what many had been anticipating.\nRBC analysts say that while the project fell below its expectations, it still offers a path for Ramelius to develop a \nsecond production hub, following the Edna May closure in the 2025 financial year.\nSources believe that Northern Star would probably be willing to part with Carosue Dam if offered the right price for \nthe asset.\nIts merger with gold miner Saracen Mineral Holdings meant it gained full control of the Super Pit gold mine, which \nwas its key objective, and it now has a very large mill in the Kalgoorlie district.\nSo does it really need the far smaller processing facilities of Carosue Dam? Northern Star's mill expansion is well \nadvanced - 77 per cent of engineering and design is complete and 84 per cent of procurement contracts have been \nawarded.\nPage 2 of 2\nNorthern Star may sell Carosue Dam to Ramelius Resources - DATA ROOM\nConstruction is on schedule.\nRamelius is developing both the Rebecca-Roe project and the Cue Gold Project, 35km north of Mt Magnet, after \nbuying Apollo Consolidated in 2022 and Musgrave Minerals the following year.\nIt owns and operates two production and processing hubs at Mt Magnet and Edna May, in Western Australia.\nRamelius purchased a 8.9 per cent stake in Spartan Resources in June. It then increased its holding to 18.3 per \ncent. It is also known to have been eyeing up other targets at a time when it is cashed up, with the gold price \nsurging to record highs this year.\nLoad-Date: December 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Northern Star may sell Carosue Dam to Ramelius Resources - DATA ROOM\n## The Australian\n### Bridget Carter\n### December 13, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Ramelius Resources, to report.

Northern Star is considering selling its Carosue Dam Operations to Ramelius Resources, with a potential price tag of around $800 million, following its recent $5 billion acquisition of De Grey Mining.\n\n2. The acquisition of Carosue Dam would strategically benefit Ramelius Resources, particularly in relation to its Rebecca-Roe project, which has recently shown disappointing pre-feasibility study results with a net present value of $332 million.\n\n3. Despite the underwhelming findings from the Rebecca-Roe project, RBC analysts suggest that the project still provides Ramelius with an opportunity to establish a second production hub, especially after the anticipated closure of the Edna May operation in the 2025 financial year.\n\n4. Ramelius Resources has been actively expanding its portfolio, having acquired Apollo Consolidated and Musgrave Minerals in recent years, and is currently in a strong financial position to pursue further acquisitions amidst rising gold prices. \n\n5. The ongoing developments at Northern Star, including its mill expansion in the Kalgoorlie district, raise questions about the necessity of retaining the smaller Carosue Dam processing facilities, indicating a potential willingness to divest if the right offer is made.",
