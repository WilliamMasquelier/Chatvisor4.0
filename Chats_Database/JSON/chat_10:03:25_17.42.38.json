Among the \nRamelius Resources assets are its Mt Magnet Gold and Edna May production hubs, and its plan has been to add \n100,000 ounces of gold a year.\nLoad-Date: March 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**PERSON**: [Full Name]\n**ROLE**: [Person's role or position]\n**CONTEXT**: [Brief description of how the person is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**PERSON**: Elon Musk\n**ROLE**: CEO of Tesla and SpaceX\n**CONTEXT**: Primary subject of article, discussing company strategy\n\nOnly include people who play a meaningful role in the article's content.
