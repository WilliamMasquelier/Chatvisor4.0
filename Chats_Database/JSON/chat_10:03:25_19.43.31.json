Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 1\nLength: 297 words\nByline: Primrose Riordan Associate editor\nBody\nAndrew Forrest uses terms of endearment freely. In interviews and around the office, he often calls people \"darl\", \n\"babe\", \"digger\". Those close to him say that's just how he communicates.\nBut for members of a small Fortescue chat group, one message that flashed across their phone screens a few \nyears ago still came as a surprise.\nSome of the group of executives and directors were in the iron ore company's Perth headquarters when they were \nalerted to a new message in their group on the Signal app. The Fortescue chairman was overseas and had clearly \nmade a mistake. The message, directed to a female employee, was quickly deleted but not before it rang alarm \nbells, according to four people with knowledge of the incident.\n\"From what I remember it said 'Jessie [not her real name], love, we need to talk, Jessie where are you? You know I \nneed to know where you are',\" says a former executive who was part of the Signal group. \"It was overly familiar, \nand the wrong tone for the conversation as it was a chat with a handful of senior people about business stuff.\"\nAnother person who saw it says: \"It was cringeworthy. People were shaking their heads.\"\nIt was sent at the tail end of the 2020-21 world tour, which involved a team of enthusiastic Fortescue staffers flying \naround the globe on the hunt for renewable energy projects to power Forrest's dream of building Fortescue into a \ngreen hydrogen powerhouse.\nThe Australian Financial Review has interviewed 23 former executives and associates, as well as Fortescue \nanalysts, who say Forrest's erratic and at times impulsive leadership style contributed to the company's dramatic \nand costly backdown from its hydrogen ambitions this year.\nFull story starts p8\nRead an edited transcript of\nThe Australian Financial\nPage 2 of 2\nInside the 'unending chaos' at Forrest's Fortescue Exclusive\nReview's interview at afr.com\nLoad-Date: January 2, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's Chairman | \"It was overly familiar, and the wrong tone for the conversation as it was a chat with a handful of senior people about business stuff.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
