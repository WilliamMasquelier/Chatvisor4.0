Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 15\nLength: 567 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue's billionaire chairman Andrew Forrest blasted his executives about their plans to acquire a coal-to-\nhydrogen project, describing it as \"the most stupid\" deal he had seen in a long time in private messages that have \ncome to light through litigation in the United States.\nIn 2022, Fortescue worked with Kid Shelleen, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' flagship investment vehicle, on a joint \nbid for gas-fired power stations in Texas and coal plants in Ohio and West Virginia. The companies wanted to \nconvert the plans to produce clean-burning hydrogen fuel. The relationship soured late in the year, with Fortescue \nlodging an unsuccessful unilateral takeover bid for the assets, refusing to pay due diligence costs accrued by Kid \nShelleen and its advisors.\nMr Tudor Jones' company is now suing Fortescue for $US6.25 million ($9.95 million) compensation. Fortescue, \nwhich has dramatically scaled back its intentions to become a hydrogen giant, has been forced to hand over \ninternal documents, emails and messages during the litigation process.\nAmong those messages is a July 2022 missive from Dr Forrest to Fortescue executives in which he describes the \nplans to buy the assets in Ohio and West Virginia as \"at least the most stupid deal I have seen for a long while.\"\nThe bid with Kid Shelleen had been devised and led by Fortescue's then-chief commercial officer David Hunt, and \nthe then-president of Fortescue's North American clean energy unit, Paul Browning. In another message sent on \nWhatsApp, Dr Forrest said the proposal \"in itself makes me wonder deeply about the commercial nous of Paul \nBrowning\".\nThe comments were made near the peak of Fortescue's interest in green hydrogen, when the company was \npromising to produce 15 million tonnes of the commodity by 2030. Fortescue has since acknowledged it will not \nachieve that goal given the slow adoption of hydrogen around the world, but continues to develop a hydrogen \nproject in Arizona and much smaller trial-scale hydrogen projects in Western Australia and Queensland. Kid \nShelleen told the court that Fortescue's attitude towards the bid appeared to change around July 2022, the same \nmonth as Dr Forrest's messages.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest blasts executives over 'most stupid' deal\nMr Browning and Mr Hunt exited Fortescue in August 2022.\nKid Shelleen claims it was told by Mr Hunt in late August that Fortescue would make a solo bid for the assets, \nrather than continue with the joint bid.\nKid Shelleen claims that Mr Hunt offered to pay for the due diligence costs. Fortescue disputes that such a verbal \npromise was made, and says it would not be legally binding even if it were made.\nMr Browning was replaced as Fortescue's top clean energy executive in North America by former AGL Energy \nchief executive Andy Vesey, who also gave testimony to the court shortly before Christmas.\nMost of Mr Vesey's testimony is inaccessible to the public. However, a snippet made available by the Connecticut \ncourt shows Mr Vesey carried a second phone with him in case he lost his primary device.\nFortescue has declined to submit messages from that second phone to the court, arguing instead that they are \nidentical to those on his primary device.\nKid Shelleen has disputed that claim, saying that while messages may be mirrored, the two phones have different \nWhatsApp messaging accounts.\nKid Shelleen has asked for Dr Forrest and Fortescue energy boss Mark Hutchinson to also give testimony, \nalthough this has not yet occurred.\nLoad-Date: February 9, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
