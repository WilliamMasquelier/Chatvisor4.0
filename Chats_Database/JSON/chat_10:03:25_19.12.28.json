But here's the problem: \nlaw firms act under instruction.\nSomebody at Fortescue instructed Davies Collison Cave Law to pursue the three men in the way that happened - \nor, at the very least, authorised the steps taken.\nThose, as a quick reminder, include: pictures of a teenager leaving school, following a family on a shopping trip to \nKmart, grubbing through their mail - and, given Fortescue is still trying to keep the actions of its spies secret, \nprobably a fair bit worse that is not yet in the public domain.\nIf Fortescue employees weren't overseeing the behaviour of their contractors, they should have been. Forrest's \ndisavowal of knowledge of their actions will only have meaning if there are internal consequences for those that \nauthorised them.\nOr, at the very least, a public apology to the families whose privacy has been violated. Until the court case is done, \nwe will not know whether Fortescue's underlying complaint is a reasonable one, and it would be foolish to prejudge \nthe outcome of the court case.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest 'surprised to learn of the investigations'\nBut the fact remains that the damage has been done. Start-up tech companies rely on investors to get them through \nearly stages of their commercialisation process. Any sniff that the intellectual property they are developing could be \nchallenged in court would scare off investors - a potentially fatal problem for a nascent business. Even if dropped \ntomorrow, Fortescue's legal action has already irreparably damaged the reputation of its former employees and \ntheir business. Justice should be done in public. The fact that Fortescue is still trying to keep its actions secret - so \nfar helped by the court - makes it difficult to see how that pillar of the Western judicial process can be upheld in the \nface of this case.\nLoad-Date: July 10, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
