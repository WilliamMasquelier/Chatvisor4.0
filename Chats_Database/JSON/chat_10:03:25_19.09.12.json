Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 19\nLength: 424 words\nBody\nFortescue shares slumped more than 5 per cent yesterday after The Australian Financial Review's Street Talk \ncolumn reported that JPMorgan was marketing a $1.1 billion block of shares in the company on behalf of an \nunknown institutional investor. Fund managers were being offered the shares at $21.60 apiece, representing a 6 \nper cent discount to Fortescue's share price on Monday before the sale. Shares fell $1.19 in trade yesterday to \nclose at $21.78. It is their lowest point since October. Fortescue shares have fallen more than a quarter since the \nstart of the year. It has been a tumultuous period for the Andrew Forrest-chaired iron ore and energy group, with a \nstring of executive departures over the last year. Last week, Julie Shuttleworth, one of Dr Forrest's most trusted \nlieutenants and the executive in charge of Fortescue's fledgling iron ore operations in Gabon, announced her \ndeparture. She had previously been the company's deputy chief executive and run Fortescue Future Industries, as \nthe energy division was then known.\nTamboran eyes NY\nNatural gas explorer Tamboran Resources has detailed plans for a $US175.5 million ($265.3 million) initial public \noffering on the New York Stock Exchange. The company is offering 6.5 million shares at a price range of $US24 to \n$US27 apiece. Taboran told investors that it was seeking to raise capital to fund the drilling, completion and \ninfrastructure requirements to reach plateau rates for its proposed Shenandoah South Pilot Project. The joint book-\nrunning managers on the IPO are Bank of America, Citi and RBC Capital Markets. \"We are excited to be launching \nour IPO in the US to support funding of our proposed Shenandoah South Pilot Project in the Beetaloo Basin,\" \nTamboran Resources chief executive Joel Riddle said. \"The US market has deep knowledge of the development of \nshale gas resources and a long history of supporting gas companies to fund their developments.\" Mr Riddle added: \n\"Our board of directors believe the US listing will deliver Tamboran shareholders a greater reflection of the value of \nTamboran's assets.\" The company last raised money 12 months ago, taking a $70 million capital raise to Australian \ninvestors following offtake agreements with Shell and BP. But the junior explorer faces an uphill task to secure the \nenvironmental approvals it needs and proceed into development amid staunch opposition from green groups and \nothers due to the impact on emissions and worries about damage to land and water. Shares last traded at 19\u00a2, \ndown 10 per cent this year.\nLoad-Date: June 21, 2024\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue shares dive\nEnd of Document\n        ",
