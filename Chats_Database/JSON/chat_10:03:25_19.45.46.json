ElliottKaren Zraick covers legal affairs for the Climate desk and the courtroom \nclashes playing out over climate and environmental policy.\nHighlight: The lawsuit, an unusual strategy for the oil giant, comes after California\u2019s attorney general sued Exxon \nlast year alleging it misled the public about plastics recycling.\nBody\nThe lawsuit, an unusual strategy for the oil giant, comes after California\u2019s attorney general sued Exxon last year \nalleging it misled the public about plastics recycling.\nExxon Mobil sued California\u2019s attorney general, the Sierra Club and other environmental groups on Monday, \nalleging that they conspired to defame the oil giant and kneecap its business prospects amid a debate over whether \nplastics can be recycled effectively.\nThe claims are an escalation in the legal conflict between oil companies and environmental groups, which have \nspent years fighting over environmental concerns related to fossil fuels, plastics and climate change.\nExxon\u2019s lawsuit singles out language used by Rob Bonta, the California attorney general, who sued Exxon in \nSeptember, alleging that the company carried out a \u201ccampaign of deception\u201d that led people to buy more single-use \nplastics by promoting the idea that the products could be recycled. Plastics are made from fossil fuels and are more \ndifficult to recycle than other materials like paper and metal. Mr. Bonta\u2019s lawsuit, filed in superior court in San \nFrancisco, denounced the company\u2019s \u201cadvanced recycling\u201d program, which refers to processes that break down \nplastics to create new materials, including fuel.\n\u201cExxon Mobil has not engaged in a decades-long secret mission to brainwash or deceive the public,\u201d the company \nsaid in its federal lawsuit, filed Monday in the Eastern District of Texas.\nExxon said Mr. Bonta later made false statements in interviews and other forums about its recycling technology, \ncausing prospective business deals to fall apart. \u201cAdvanced recycling is not a \u2018farce\u2019 or \u2018myth,\u2019\u201d the company said in \nits suit.\nA spokesperson for the California Department of Justice called the suit \u201canother attempt from Exxon Mobil to deflect \nattention from its own unlawful deception\u201d and said Mr. Bonta was looking forward to \u201cvigorously litigating\u201d the case.\nPage 2 of 3\nExxon Sues California Official, Claiming He Defamed the Company\nExxon is seeking monetary damages and retractions from Mr. Bonta and the environmental groups, which include \nthe Sierra Club, San Francisco Baykeeper, Heal the Bay and the Surfrider Foundation. These four, all based in \nCalifornia, had filed their own lawsuit against Exxon in parallel with Mr. Bonta\u2019s, alleging violations of state nuisance \nand unfair-competition laws.\nA spokesman for the Sierra Club, Jonathon Berman, called the suit \u201ca shameless attempt at intimidation\u201d and said \n\u201cExxon is clearly confused about the difference between defamation and accountability.\u201d\nAn Australian charity, Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund, was also named in Monday\u2019s lawsuit. That group \nis described in the suit as working on behalf of Andrew Forrest, the founder of an Australian mining company, \nFortescue Metals Group, that has become a critic of Exxon. Exxon said the charity had retained a law firm, \nCotchett, Pitre and McCarthy, and recruited the environmental groups that filed the parallel lawsuit as \u201cproxies.\u201d\nThe charity said in a statement on Tuesday that it was not a subsidiary of, owned or controlled by Fortescue or Mr. \nForrest\u2019s environmental foundation, Minderoo. A spokeswoman for Mr. Forrest said he had provided funds to the \ncharity in his personal capacity. Minderoo said that its work had been described incorrectly in Monday\u2019s lawsuit.\nNiall McCarthy, a partner with Cotchett, Pitre &amp; McCarthy, called the case \u201ca P.R. campaign\u201d with no merit and \nsaid the groups stood by the lawsuits. \u201cSuggesting they are anyone\u2019s \u2018proxy\u2019 is baseless, and fails to recognize that \nthese nonprofits have been at the forefront of the battle over plastics,\u201d he said.\nFortescue advocates transitioning away from oil, and instead using hydrogen as fuel. Exxon in its lawsuit described \nthe company as a competitor in the energy-transition sector. A spokesman for Fortescue said Tuesday that it \nrejected Exxon\u2019s assertions, including that the company had orchestrated the litigation to gain a competitive \nadvantage.\nMr. Forrest, in a separate statement, said that \u201cany accusation of commercial benefit\u201d related to the case was false \nand that the fossil fuel industry knows it is \u201con borrowed time and that technological solutions exist to phase out \nfossil fuels.\u201d\nThe September lawsuit by Mr. Bonta came after a more than two-year investigation that included subpoenas to \nExxon and industry groups and sought damages that he said could amount to \u201cmultiple billions of dollars.\u201d\nEnergy companies are facing numerous lawsuits from state and local governments alleging that they misled the \npublic about climate change in their quest to keep selling fossil fuels. California\u2019s plastics lawsuit had indicated a \nnew tack in that yearslong legal battle and was built on a similar premise over claims of deception.\nIn a recent report, \u201cThe Fraud of Plastic Recycling,\u201d the advocacy group Center for Climate Integrity concluded that \nrecycling plastics had largely failed because it was too expensive to do on a large scale. Even when recycling is \ntechnically possible, virgin plastic is cheaper. But oil companies and the plastics industry continued to promote \nrecycling as a solution to plastic waste, the report said.\nLess than 10 percent of plastic generated in 2018 was ultimately recycled, according to Environmental Protection \nAgency data, though the rates for some categories of plastic were much higher. The rate of plastics converted into \nenergy has grown steadily in recent years, according to the data.\nThe legal counterattack by Exxon also evoked a lawsuit that Energy Transfer, a pipeline company. brought against \nGreenpeace and other environmental groups accusing them of inciting protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline \nin 2016 and 2017. Energy Transfer said Greenpeace circulated false information to harm its reputation and damage \nits business interests. Greenpeace has denied playing a leading role in the protests. A trial is set to begin in \nFebruary in North Dakota.\nPHOTO: Rob Bonta, the California attorney general, sued Exxon in September, alleging that the company misled \nthe public about plastics recycling.
