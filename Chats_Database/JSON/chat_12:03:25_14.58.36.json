He said electric vehicle adoption needed to be pushed \"hard\" and \nliquefied natural gas would be \"critical\" in supporting the roll-out of renewables.\n\"Because of the urgency, we have to make our choices and decide where we're really going to put our emphasis,\" \nhe said.\nPage 2 of 2\nMackenzie: Focus on the best few energy solutions Exclusive\n\"We shouldn't be adding and adding and adding, if at the same time, we're not finding the things that are winning \nand getting behind that with a lot more investment and more focused investment, and just deciding this is going to \nwork in this sector, and let's get behind that because we don't have a lot of time.\"\nShell's business was built on selling oil and petrol for traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, but the \ncompany has also invested in electric vehicle charging stations, and Sir Andrew said the world needed to push \n\"hard\" on electric vehicles, and \"maybe harder than we're pushing it\".\nBut despite the rise of electric vehicles, he said the internal combustion engines that consume petrol were here to \nstay, and would enjoy longevity as the world embraced \"biofuels\" from agricultural waste and synthetically created \n\"e-fuels\".\n\"In looking at the future of oil, you look at the future of the internal combustion engine, and some would imagine \nthat the internal combustion engine would just kind of disappear. That won't happen,\" he said.\n\"Even in a world of very successful decarbonisation ... the internal combustion engine will continue, but it will be \nfuelled by biofuels, maybe by hydrogen or indeed e-fuels.\"\nThe comments come as big diesel consumers like Rio Tinto are urging the federal government to ramp up support \nfor biofuels, in the belief biofuels are the best way to reduce the emissions of iron ore trucks and trains in the \ndecade before batteries are expected to be a viable alternative.\nSir Andrew said liquefied natural gas would be \"critical\" to the energy transition.\n\"It is available now, it can be shipped everywhere, it is possible to increase its supply, and it is the lowest carbon \nfossil fuel,\" he said.\nInternational climate agreements were built on \"nationally determined contributions\", where each nation set a target \nfor emission reductions and attempts to deliver on it, he said. But the problem might be better tackled by industry \nsectors that worked collaboratively across borders.\n\"That's how some of the issues to do with the ozone hole were sorted in the end, trying to move away from CFCs.\"\nLoad-Date: June 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Mackenzie: Focus on the best few energy solutions\n## Australian Financial Review\n### Peter Ker, Lap Phan\n### June 24, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Shell, to report.
