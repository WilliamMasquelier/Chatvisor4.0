Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's CEO | \"Fortescue remains fully committed to the Belinga iron ore project and the long-term benefits a large-scale development will bring to Gabon.\" | N.A. |\n| General Brice Oligui Nguema | Military ruler of Gabon | \"Our discussions with the Gabon government remain positive and we continue to work together to advance a potential large-scale development.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue metals division chief executive | \"This project has the potential to revolutionise our portfolio and ultimately create a product that will be the envy of our peers.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
