Well-\ndeveloped Cu-Au horizon identified at the Centre Forest Prospect ('Centre Forest'), interpreted to be hosted within a \nprospective regional shear corridor that follows the margins of an interpreted intrusion. Exciting opportunity to not \nonly explore for higher grade Cu-Au zones at Centre Forest but also regionally along the targeted shear corridor \n(24km of strike), where minimal exploration has been undertaken to date\nContact:\nPeter Woodman\nTel: +61 8 9322 6322\nPROJECT BACKGROUND\nUlarring, consisting of tenements E70/4686 and E70/4901 (cumulatively 187km2 ) is located 100km northeast of \nPerth. Ularring is situated within the Archaean Yilgarn Craton and borders the Southwest and Youanmi Terranes. \nPage 2 of 3\n-Constellation Resources Limited - COMPLETION OF ULARRING COPPER GOLD PROJECT ACQUISITION\nThe Ularring tenements overlie broad acreage farms and capture the Shires of Goomalling, Cunderdin and \nNortham. A series of access agreements that allow exploration within private properties are in place. The region is \nknown to host several major deposits that are intrusion related, such as the Boddington Copper-Gold mine (11Moz \nAu and 1Mt of copper produced, hosted in a sheared Intrusive related setting1 ) and Caravel Minerals' (ASX: CVV) \nCaravel Copper Project (a porphyry hosted Cu-Mo-Ag-Au deposit containing 3Mt Cu, 61Kt Mo, 895koz Au and \n46Moz Ag in Mineral Resource2 ). A separate style of deposit in the region is the recently discovered Julimar \nProject (a mafic hosted PGE-Ni deposit) owned by Chalice Mining Ltd (ASX: CHN).\nCENTRE FOREST PROSPECT\nCentre Forest is the most advanced and explored prospect within the Ularring Project. A welldeveloped Cu-Au \nhorizon has been identified at Centre Forest which is interpreted to be hosted within a prospective regional shear \ncorridor that follows the margins of an interpreted intrusion. A number of phases of drilling have been undertaken \nhistorically at Centre Forest by various exploration companies, however, there has been minimal programs in the \nlast decade. Centre Forest represents an exciting opportunity to follow-up on previous drilling with the intention of \nidentifying higher grade Cu-Au zones. The results from previous drilling programs at Centre Forest have confirmed \na continuous, broad zone of Cu-Au mineralisation over a strike length of 1.1km and remains open when utilising a \n>0.1g/t Au cutoff. The Cu-Au mineralisation is interpreted to be best developed along a highly altered sheared \nmargin of a granitoid intrusion and is hosted both in oxides (saprolite) from the surface and in the fresh rock located \ndown dip. The associated mineral assemblage comprises quartz-garnet-biotite-cordierite-orthopyroxene with a \nsulphide suite comprising of pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite with trace levels of bismuthate. Other metal associations with \nthe gold mineralisation include elevated levels of silver, bismuth, molybdenum and tungsten. The sheared contact is \nbelieved to be part of the regional Meenar Shear Corridor.\nCOMPETENT PERSONS STATEMENT\nThe information in this announcement that relates to exploration results has been extracted from an ASX \nAnnouncement dated 12 September 2024 which is available to view at www.constellationresources.com.au.
