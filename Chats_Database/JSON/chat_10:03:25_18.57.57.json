Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 15\nLength: 577 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nA key player in Mike Cannon-Brookes' $40 billion Sun Cable venture says big renewables projects in Australia will \nstruggle to overcome \"nimbyism\" and a lack of resolve from governments.\nQuinbrook Infrastructure Partners managing director David Scaysbrook questioned the investment returns on the \nlatest round of big wind and solar farm transactions struck at big prices.\nHe also raised doubts about the feasibility of Fortescue's stalled Gibson Island green hydrogen and ammonia \nproject in Brisbane.\nQuinbrook is charged with building the solar farms and transmission lines into Darwin associated with Sun Cable in \nthe Northern Territory.\nMr Scaysbrook said location was everything in renewables, with the cost of delivery into constrained networks \n\"astronomically higher\".\nGibson Island simply couldn't access the cheapest renewable power because of its location, he argued.\n\"They're going to have to pay to transmit power all the way to Gibson Island through the high voltage system in \nBrisbane, and so paying full freight on all the transmission and distribution,\" he said.\nFortescue has said it is in talks with the Queensland and federal governments about the Gibson Island project's \nfuture and that Australia \"suffers structurally high green electricity costs\".\nThe other challenge for renewables providers is nimbyism, which will only get worse in more populated parts of \nAustralia, Mr Scaysbrook said.\n\"Community acceptance is fundamental to getting your project going because governments don't have a lot of \nspine, and they actually don't have a lot of ability to do anything about resolving community opposition,\" he said. \"It \nis becoming more acute now because the scale of the wind or solar farms that we are talking about now is greater \nPage 2 of 2\nSun Cable key player's doubts on Fortescue\nthan anything we have seen before. The scale of the projects we are doing now is 10-fold bigger than they were \neven five years ago.\"\nQuinbrook remains agnostic about the cable side of Sun Cable - a 4200-kilometre undersea transmission cable that \nwould connect Darwin and Singapore - and is focused on delivering its end of the bargain in the form of giant solar \nfarms and onshore transmission infrastructure. It is working with potential customers within the NT government's \nMiddle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct adjacent to the port, where Fortescue and French oil and gas major \nTotal have been allocated land for green hydrogen projects. Mr Scaysbrook said if Mr Cannon-Brookes' Grok \nVentures succeeded with the cable component to Sun Cable, Quinbrook would build more solar capacity to meet \nthe extra demand.\n\"Our job is to lead the development, and then we have an option to invest equity in the onshore component.\n\"Once we can prove up the delivered cost of renewable power into the MASDP, and we're getting closer to being \nable to do that, then we can say to industry that wants to locate there, 'this is what your power cost is going to be', \nremembering that just one of these factories will consume two to three times more power than the NT currently \nproduces.\"\nLast year, the NT government set aside land at the Middle Arm precinct for Fortescue and Total as well as \nBeetaloo Basin gas field developer Tamboran Resources, vanadium play Tivan and phosphate-focused Avenira.\nMr Scaysbrook said Quinbrook was focused on the NT and north Queensland, where it's looking for backers for a \n$10 billion polysilicon plant at the Lansdown eco-industrial precinct in Townsville that would supply solar panel \nmanufacturers.\nLoad-Date: February 11, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| David Scaysbrook | Managing Director, Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners | \"They're going to have to pay to transmit power all the way to Gibson Island through the high voltage system in Brisbane, and so paying full freight on all the transmission and distribution.\" | N.A. |\n| David Scaysbrook | Managing Director, Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners | \"Community acceptance is fundamental to getting your project going because governments don't have a lot of spine, and they actually don't have a lot of ability to do anything about resolving community opposition.\" | N.A. |\n| David Scaysbrook | Managing Director, Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners | \"The scale of the projects we are doing now is 10-fold bigger than they were even five years ago.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
