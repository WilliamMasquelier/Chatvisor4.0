Among the \nRamelius Resources assets are its Mt Magnet Gold and Edna May production hubs, and its plan has been to add \n100,000 ounces of gold a year.\nLoad-Date: March 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nBased on the content of the article, choose the most appropriate category from the following list: ['Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Activity', 'Financial Performance and Market Valuation', 'Gold Price Impact on Business', 'Exploration and Resource Development', 'Asset Sales and Divestments']\nYour output should solely be the name of the category chosen and nothing else.\n            ",
