Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 29\nLength: 702 words\nByline: Joshua Peach\nBody\nInstitutional investors are increasingly steering clear of Fortescue, but their scepticism of the iron ore giant's \nprospects has meant they have missed out on a record rally in the company's share price as overseas funds and \nretail shareholders pile in.\nAnalysis of more than 30 top actively managed Australian equity funds found just one portfolio manager had \ndisclosed a substantial position in the company this year.\nThat makes the West Australian miner - founded in 2003 by Andrew Forrest, now executive chairman - the least-\nheld stock among the 10 largest companies on the ASX.\nThe Australian Financial Review's analysis is in line with a survey of 50 fund managers from JPMorgan, which \nranked Fortescue as the \"least-loved\" stock relative to its size - a position it has held for much of the poll's eight-\nyear history.\nSeveral portfolio managers and analysts cited the miner's lower iron ore grades as one reason to forgo the stock in \nfavour of larger rivals BHP, Rio Tinto and Brazil's Vale.\nThey said they were also concerned about the high turnover among senior management and increased spending \non the as-yet unprofitable green hydrogen projects.\n\"For some investors over the last couple of years, it's just gone into the too-hard basket,\" said Jason Kururangi, \nportfolio manager with Milford Asset Management.\nHe also cited concerns about its green investments.\n\"Most people tend to be more comfortable in BHP. You have a similar cost structure and a higher-grade product, \nwhich generally fares through the cycle - even if you sometimes get supercharged earnings from Fortescue, like \nwe've seen in the last 12 months.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nBig investors steer clear of Fortescue, and miss major rally Commodities\nEven so, many fund managers missed out on an almost 50 per cent surge in the share price between September \nand February, after earnings were boosted by higher iron ore prices and lower than expected discounts on its \nexports. That compares to a mere 5 per cent rise for BHP and 16 per cent for Rio Tinto over the same period.\nBrokers have also been bearish for some time. Most analysts have slapped a sell or equivalent rating on the stock \nsince November 2022. In contrast, BHP and Rio Tinto have never held a majority sell rating from brokers since at \nleast 2009.\nMorningstar mining equity analyst Jon Mills said the stock had become too expensive compared to its peers.\n\"Fortescue has been really benefiting recently from a higher iron ore price and lower discounts on it products,\" he \nsaid. \"If you go back a few years, it was the exact opposite. It's in a great situation now, but is iron ore going to stay \nwhere it is? We don't think so.\n\"It's not generally liked by the wider market, but retail investors love it because it's made them a fortune over the \nyears.\"\nThe company lost its final buy rating in January after JPMorgan's head of Australian resources, Lyndon Fagan, told \ninvestors to take profits. The call proved well-timed: shares in the company fell more than 10 per cent since peaking \nin early February.\nAustralian Eagle Asset Management chief investment officer Sean Sequeira said investors had remained sceptical \nof Fortescue's prospects since its earliest days.\n\"When Andrew first put Fortescue together, it all seemed quite haphazard,\" Mr Sequeira said. \"It was the \nentrepreneurial spirit that drove the company, not standard management.\"\nMr Sequeira's fund was among the few to back the stock in 2016, when looming debt repayments and a poor iron \nore market raised fears that Fortescue was close to broke.\n\"It was an extremely contrarian investment at the time. Everyone said it was going under,\" he said, adding that the \nfund had wound down its interest in Fortescue since that time in favour of gaining exposure to copper through BHP \nand Rio.\nShares in the miner have recovered strongly since its nadir in 2016, rising 1500 per cent. BHP and Rio have risen \n150 per cent and 200 per cent respectively since then.\nMr Sequeira said Dr Forrest's unconventional approach to management had often left the investment community \nbaffled.\n\"Andrew is the type of person who goes into areas and tries to execute new methods of doing things,\" he said.\n\"That does result in the market finding it very difficult to see how these things will be pulled off because they haven't \nseen them done before.\"\nLoad-Date: April 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
