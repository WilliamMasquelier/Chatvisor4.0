Mr Cooke said Element Zero's bid to have the search orders discharged was a \"cynical attempt\" to prevent \nhis client from viewing material seized in raids and to delay filing their defence.\n\"The discharge application has been a monumental waste of time and is a distraction from the real issues to be \ndecided,\" he said.\nDocuments and emails referred to intellectual property concepts about \"green\" projects, including the green iron \nconcept, the court was told. Mr Cooke said the evidence before Justice Perry supported her conclusion that \nFortescue had a \"strong prima facie case\" in favour of granting the search orders.\nSignificantly, he denied Ele-ment Zero's claim that Justice Perry should have been told they were co-operating with \nFortescue to allay the mining giant's concerns in December last year and January this year by meeting with it to \ndiscuss technical differences between the organisations' green technologies - before she approved the search \norders.\n\"Mr Masterman was co-operating because he wanted to persuade Fortescue there were no relevant similarities \nbetween the Element Zero electrochemical reduction process and the Fortescue electrochemical reduction process \nso that Fortescue would not bring a case on any such claim,\" Mr Cooke said.\n\"Fortescue's pleaded case \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is (not) that the Element Zero process is the same or similar to the Fortescue \nparticle process.\n\"Rather, the respondent misused what's defined as the Fortescue Confidential information - the ionic liquid \nresearch and development which is fundamentally different from the Fortescue particle process.\" Mr Cooke said \nFortescue also claims Element Zero misused its confidential plant information.\nMr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk were in court for Tuesday's hearing. Federal Court judge Brigitte Markovic has \nreserved her judgment in the interlocutory matter.\nLoad-Date: August 20, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
