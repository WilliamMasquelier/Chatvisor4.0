Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 21\nLength: 667 words\nByline: Alex Gluyas\nBody\nAn army of short-sellers is nervously watching the rebound in iron ore prices this week amid signs Beijing will \nintroduce more measures to stabilise China's property crisis.\nThe iron ore spot price has climbed for three sessions to trade at $US97.90 a tonne, according to S&P Global \nPlatts. Futures added 0.8 per cent to $US99.25 a tonne yesterday, and have bounced more than 7 per cent from \nlast week's two-year low of $US91.45.\nThe swift rebound follows a 9 per cent plunge in prices last week, which added fresh momentum to Asian hedge \nfunds targeting Australia's largest mining stocks.\nShort positions in Mineral Resources hit record levels this week, and bets against Rio Tinto are at the highest in \nmore than three years.\nThat trade has paid off, with BHP, Rio Tinto, Fortescue and MinRes down more than 20 per cent this year, but \nthere are signs of that unwinding after all four miners rallied on Wednesday.\nBHP jumped 2.6 per cent from its low, Rio Tinto gained 2.7 per cent, Fortescue 4.9 per cent and MinRes 7.5 per \ncent. All four extended those gains yesterday. \"Asian hedge funds were still shorting Aussie resource stocks \n[yesterday morning], but as they saw iron ore still rallying, it looked like they went to the sidelines to see if this is a \nfalse recovery, or it keeps going and takes iron ore back above $US100,\" said Bell Potter strategist Richard \nCoppleson.\nThat \"would be a disaster for all the shorts and see some trying to cover\".\nIron ore's rapid turnaround has been triggered by reports that Beijing is considering a new funding option for local \ngovernments to buy unsold homes. It would involve the issue of so-called special bonds, which are currently \nrestructured for use in infrastructure and environmental projects.\nThe potential support follows a series of rescue packages that have failed to stabilise China's real estate market - a \nbig source of iron ore demand.\nPage 2 of 2\nShort-sellers brace for iron ore back at $US100 Commodities\nThat included 500 billion yuan ($104 billion) of funding to purchase excess housing inventory for conversion to \naffordable homes. But with market estimates indicating that between 2.5 trillion yuan and 7 trillion yuan is needed to \nabsorb the excess housing in China's property sector, traders have been left disappointed.\nAnalysts remain divided on the direction of iron ore prices and mining stocks from here.\nMorgan Stanley strategists told clients yesterday they did not expect iron ore to stay under $US100 a tonne for \nlonger than one to two months because lower prices would force higher-cost producers to curtail supply.\nThe broker estimated that about 80 million tonnes of production was making losses at current prices, with about 93 \nper cent of that coming from Chinese supply.\nMorgan Stanley also said the increase in supply from Australia and Brazil in the first half, which weighed on prices, \nlooks to have passed.\n\"Although a rebound in iron ore prices will benefit all iron ore miners, it is likely to benefit higher-cost miners more,\" \nnoted its equity analyst Rahul Anand.\nFor that reason, the broker prefers Minerals Resources followed by Rio Tinto. It has an \"overweight\" rating on both \nstocks.\nIt is \"equal weight\" BHP and remains \"underweight\" Fortescue given the company's continued spending on green \nenergy, which threatens its free cash flow generation and future dividend payouts.\nThat stands in contrast to some fund managers - including Ellerston Capital's Chris Kourtis, who sold his fund's \nBHP stake to buy Fortescue, and other brokers who have upgraded the stock to a buy.\nMorningstar also warned investors this week it was too early to jump back into beaten-up mining stocks, given \nBeijing had offered little hope of stabilising China's property sector.\nAnd Westpac, which has been one of the most vocal iron ore bears, is sticking with its view that prices of the \ncommodity will drop below $US90 a tonne this year.\n\"If we do see iron ore back into the late $US90s, we want to sell it again for that coming drop into the $US80s,\" said \nWestpac's head of commodity and carbon strategy Robert Rennie.\nLoad-Date: August 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Richard Coppleson | Bell Potter strategist | \"Asian hedge funds were still shorting Aussie resource stocks [yesterday morning], but as they saw iron ore still rallying, it looked like they went to the sidelines to see if this is a false recovery, or it keeps going and takes iron ore back above $US100.\" | N.A. |\n| Rahul Anand | Equity analyst at Morgan Stanley | \"Although a rebound in iron ore prices will benefit all iron ore miners, it is likely to benefit higher-cost miners more.\" | N.A. |\n| Chris Kourtis | Fund manager at Ellerston Capital | \"I sold my fund's BHP stake to buy Fortescue.\" | N.A. |\n| Robert Rennie | Head of commodity and carbon strategy at Westpac | \"If we do see iron ore back into the late $US90s, we want to sell it again for that coming drop into the $US80s.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
