It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 3\nHigh-flyer takes on Hollywood\nHigh-flyer takes on Hollywood\nThe Australian\nJuly 10, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: WSJ; Pg. 17\nLength: 1060 words\nByline: Jessica Toonkel, Joe Flint\nBody\nDavid Ellison mastered flying planes in his teens. Now, Hollywood's newest mogul has to avoid a hard landing in \nmerging his -Skydance Media and Paramount Global.\nHours after the merger was announced, Ellison made the kind of cautious remarks one would expect from someone \nseeking to win over sceptics across the entertainment industry, on Wall Street and among Paramount executives.\n\"We really want Paramount to be the first stop for creatives,\" he said, adding that he envisions turning the \nbeleaguered entertainment company into what he calls \"a media and tech hybrid\" to make it a viable competitor \nagainst the likes of Disney, Netflix and Warner Bros Discovery.\nBut before any of that is likely to happen, Ellison and his team are continuing plans put in place by Paramount's \ncurrent management amid a difficult media environment: cost-cutting, asset sales and layoffs.\nEllison's team has identified $US2bn in cost savings and says it will make the company cashflow positive by the \nend of 2026.\nWhen he takes over Paramount, Ellison will be rubbing shoulders with the likes of Disney CEO Bob Iger and \nWarner Bros Discovery chief David Zaslav, a remarkable ascension for the 41-year-old. The son of Oracle co-\nfounder Larry Ellison, he relied on his billionaire father's largesse to create a production company, and managed to \nturn it into a reliable maker of box office hits, an unusual feat for a company of its size.\nLike many of its peers, Paramount has been struggling with the decline in traditional TV networks while investing in \nParamount+. Cord-cutting has greatly reduced the reach of its cable networks, such as MTV and Comedy Central, \nwhich means less revenue from subscriber fees and fewer advertising dollars.\nAs a result, spending on programming for the networks has been reduced, creating something of a vicious cycle for \nthe company: less original programming means more cord-cutting, which leads to less investment.\nPage 2 of 3\nHigh-flyer takes on Hollywood\nEllison can help Paramount navigate the challenging media landscape in that he understands and appreciates the \nmovie business but also has a technical background to help grow its streaming service, says Ari Emanuel, chief \nexecutive of sports and entertainment companies Endeavour and TKO Group.\n\"A lot of people with the success he has had would never risk that to do what he is doing,\" he said. \"I take my hat \noff to him.\" Paramount's efforts to sell its BET cable network will continue as the deal progresses. Other channels \ncould also potentially go on the market, says Jeff Shell, the former NBCUniversal chief who is set to be president of \nParamount after the Skydance deal closes.\nPotential assets for sale could include TV stations owned by CBS that aren't affiliated with the broadcast network \nand hence are not core to its business.\nOne challenge facing Ellison and his team is how to make sure its Paramount+ streaming service can compete with \nbigger rivals. The service has seen decent subscriber growth over the past few years and was profitable in the US \nin the quarter that just ended. But the competitive nature of streaming requires constant investment to compete with \nthe likes of Netflix and Prime.\nSkydance said it would continue to pursue the strategy set out by Paramount's current leadership for the streaming \nservice, including exploring an international joint venture, which is where much of the financial strain lies. Shell also \nsaid Paramount+ can benefit by doing more deals to bundle itself with other streaming services.\n\"There is going to have to be some form of bundled solution\" to streaming, Shell told investors, adding that right \nnow \"they are sorting their way through the muck\" of how streaming services are currently distributed.\nEllison also said that the Paramount+ platform needs to be overhauled and become more user-friendly, which can \nbe done by improving the algorithms that make sure consumers get served the shows and movies they are most \nlikely to watch.\nEllison has been a would-be Hollywood mogul for more than a decade. He built Skydance, a production company \nthat was launched in 2010, into a powerful and profitable maker of big--budget movies and TV shows.\nAlthough Hollywood is littered with the carcasses of scions with dreams of being a player, -Ellison and Skydance \nhave thrived when much of the industry is in contraction.\nPart of the reason for Skydance's success was that it positioned itself as something of a boutique purveyor of big-\nbudget fare for streamers such as Netflix and Prime. As other studios were shying away from selling to competitors \nto focus on building their own streaming platform, Skydance saw an opening.\nPeople who have worked closely with Ellison say he is a soft-spoken and thoughtful executive and not a \nstereotypical billionaire's son. That doesn't mean he is a pushover. Ellison gets in the weeds of producing, and \nwhile his attention to detail is praised by those who have worked with him, some say he can be inflexible in a \nbusiness often based on making compromises. Some of his mentors, including the late Steve Jobs and David \nGeffen, were cut from similar cloth.\nEllison is entrusting much of the day-to-day operation of the combined companies to Shell, for whom the deal \nrepresents something of a comeback. He left NBCUniversal in 2023 after admitting to an inappropriate relationship \nwith a woman at the company. Shell joined RedBird Capital Partners earlier this year to lead its sports and \nentertainment businesses. Now, he will essentially hold the same position he held at NBCUniversal with a very \nsimilar portfolio of broadcast, cable, movie and television production and streaming assets.\nFor Skydance, explaining to investors the rationale behind the deal is key to potentially fending off shareholder \nlawsuits. Earlier this year, many of Paramount's non-voting shareholders expressed dismay about an earlier offer \nfrom Skydance, which they said was only good for Paramount controlling shareholder Shari Redstone.\nSkydance will acquire National Amusements, Redstone's private company through which she controls Paramount, \nin a deal with an equity value of $US1.75bn. Then in a second step of the transaction, Paramount will acquire Page 3 of 3\nHigh-flyer takes on Hollywood\nSkydance at a valuation of around $US4.7bn. Skydance and its backers, including Larry Ellison and RedBird \nCapital Partners, will inject $US1.5bn into Paramount's balance sheet, which it can use to pay down debt.\nLoad-Date: July 9, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
