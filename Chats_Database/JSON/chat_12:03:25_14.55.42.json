But can the young chef \nwith a passion for native ingredients who is now in charge keep it at the pinnacle?\nThe tart is gone in a few seconds. A mouthful, perhaps two.\nBut behind that fleeting moment are the countless hours spent turning a vague idea into something that can be \nbrought to life in Restaurant Botanic's kitchen.\nIt starts with the challenge of fashioning an impossibly fragile shell based on celeriac that is blended to a paste with \na mix of sugars, moulded and fried, so it shatters like the finest crystal.\nAt the tart's base is kangaroo loin, cured with juniper, cold smoked, and finely diced, then dressed with a vinaigrette \nof paperbark oil and a kangaroo \"garum\" that has been fermented for at least two months.\nBlanketing the roo is a velvety celeriac cream decorated with a garland of rosemary blossoms. And, finally, at the \ntable, a waiter tops all of this with a spoonful of Oscietre caviar taken from older sturgeon fish because the eggs \ngrow to be larger. Yes, the tart is only a mouthful, but the pleasure it delivers comes in waves: the disintegrating \nshell, momentary lushness of the cream, the tongue-pleasing texture of the meat and, finally, the lingering luxury of \nthe eggs.\nThis is the kind of complexity, repeated again and again through 20-plus courses, that has come to be expected at \nBotanic. It's the reason the restaurant was named the number one dining experience, not just in this state but the \nwhole of Australia. And it's the reason that the price of food alone is somewhere north of $300.\nIn the three years the Botanic has made this extraordinary ascent, its reputation has been inextricably linked to \nJustin James, an American with a star-spangled CV that includes Eleven Madison Park and Noma, among others. \nMore than just a chef, he was the inventor, designer, manager, advocate and guardian of his vision.\nPage 2 of 3\nNew Botanic is wild at heart\nThat all changed in April with the announcement, seemingly from nowhere, that James would be leaving. Now, after \na short break, the Botanic has reopened with someone new to chart the creative direction. His challenge: only the \nsimple task of maintaining the standard of a restaurant at the very pinnacle.\nJamie Musgrave, however, is familiar with these expectations. He has been part of the Botanic team since James \narrived and last year was appointed second-in-charge.\nRaised in Margaret River, he started cooking at an early age and, while not yet 30, had experience across kitchens \nin Perth, Sydney and Hong Kong before landing here.\nEarly in his career, while still training, he began exploring the forests and scrub around his home and elsewhere in \nthe state with an expert in foraging who introduced him to the local First Nations people. The experience was clearly \nformative and, while some bush foods were already in play at the Botanic, they are now more obvious. Musgrave \nwants us to move beyond the boundary of the orderly garden to somewhere wilder.\nOutside the shift in the kitchen, not much has changed. Full payment is still required at the time of booking, like a \ntheatre ticket. The revamped rotunda dining room continues to age gracefully and the arrangements of dried flora \nspread across the room (and even in the entry to the toilet) are wonderful.\nThe service team, while ultra-professional, could loosen up a bit and dispense with the heavily scripted \nmonologues, particularly the initial introduction. Best let the food speak for itself. Here is just a sample.\nThe starting point is a reminder of your walk through the garden, expressed in a nourishing tea of mushrooms \nsteeped with plane tree leaves and bunya branches, alongside a nasturtium flower crisp and leaf emulsion. Later, a \nDavidson plum tree is pointed out just through the window as a wedge of the fruit is presented with the flesh \nreplaced by a jelly (please don't try to eat the skin as we did).\nThese culinary horizons quickly broaden. The Botanic has always pushed to source the best and most unusual of \ningredients, wherever they happen to be found around the country.\nTurban snail, then, has come all the way from an island off the coast of Newcastle, the meat braised for 12 hours \nuntil supple, barbecued and served back in the shell on a lovely gazpacho of sea parsley, succulents and \nmacadamia. Superb urchin roe from Tasmania is laid on a butter-fried wattleseed brioche with desert lime and ice \nplant salsa. Darwin mud crab is the catalyst for a version of Japanese chawanmushi, the shells used in making a \ndashi stock for the custard, the picked meat warmed with compound butter, and a crab-based foam covering the top \nas if washed up on the crest of a wave.\nOther ingredients are presented as double acts. The kangaroo tart is accompanied by skewers of grilled roo \nsmeared in a macadamia mole (sauce). Calamari comes as a crowd-pleasing taco of fried tentacles, yellow pepper \npaste and saltbush salad in a tortilla where the lard has been replaced by, wait for it, crocodile fat. The other squid \ndish is more cerebral with shaved sheets of tube cured in kombu, fermented with bunya, rolled up with sunrise lime, \nthen arranged at the centre of a pool of squid consomm\u00c3\u00a9. These delicate, ethereal flavours risk being talked over \nby some of the more extroverted native elements, particularly when filaments of Geraldton wax leaf make an \nappearance.\nMarron, always a Botanic highlight, has similar issues this time round. A redgum-roasted tail looks exquisite but the \nanticipated pleasure of that sweet, smoky flesh is diminished beneath a barrage of other citrusy flavours, led by \nlemon myrtle and its signature lollyshop lemon quality.\nFlat fillet of emu, taken from below the rump, fares far better. Wrapped in paperbark with a smear of mountain \npepper, it is toasted directly on the embers before being hung above the fire to smoke gently. The parcel is \nunwrapped at the table before being taken away to plate up with wilted warrigal leaves and a fermented onion and \ntruffle sauce that you'd swear contained at least a touch of meaty jus. More truffle, from WA, has been shaved on \ntop to accentuate the emu's dark, savoury notes.Page 3 of 3\nNew Botanic is wild at heart\nSweet courses continue the bush adventure. The sharpness of rainforest cherry, in poached and sorbet form, \nserves as a palate cleanser. Flinders Ranges quandong also has two iterations, as fruit jelly and granita, laid over a \ndollop of smoked birch wood cream. The more pronounced smoke of a paperbark and white chocolate mousse is \nhard to get past, unfortunately, in a combination with cubes of strawberry gum jelly and fried macadamia cake that \nmight otherwise have been a loose play on a trifle. Along the way, many of the plates have been embellished with \nthe leaves, flowers, fronds and even a cross-section of cone collected from the garden. For the petit fours, however, \nthis is taken to another level, with an arrangement that looks like it was put together by a professional florist. \nCamouflaged brilliantly in this backdrop are hidden treats of macadamia chocolate, Davidson plum craquelin and, \nmost memorably, a tart of grilled riberry and elderflower cream. Like everything else, it is incredibly detailed, \ncreative and has clearly taken a load of hard yakka.\nIs Restaurant Botanic as good as previous visits? Probably not. The ride isn't as smooth, the high points more \nelusive.\nBut Musgrave has done an extraordinary job given the gulf in experience when compared to his predecessor, as \nwell as the short lead time in preparing his first menu.\nA little less exuberance, a greater sense of balance, and things are only going to get better.\nRestaurant Botanic Adelaide Botanic Garden, Plane Tree Dr, Adelaide 8223 3526 restaurantbotanic.com.au Set \nmenu $315 paid on booking Open Lunch Sun Dinner Thu-Sat Must try Red kangaroo, celeriac, Oscietre caviar; \nmountain pepper spiced emu fillet Verdict Food 16.5/20 Ambience 17/20 Service 15/20 Value 14/20 Overall 16.5/20\nAs a guide, scores indicate: 1-9 Fail; 10-11 Satisfactory; 12-14 Recommended; 15-16 Very Good; 17-18 \nOutstanding; 19-20 World Class delicious.com.au/eatout\nLoad-Date: September 13, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
