We have learned from the challenges and today, we \nare announcing a robust business plan with revised strategic growth ambitions for 2030.\u201d\nIn total, \u00d8rsted has written off \u00a33.3bn from its wind farm business.\nIt comes as Siemens Energy , which produces turbines for many UK wind farms, swung to a \u20ac1.58bn (\u00a31.35bn) \nprofit in its first quarter thanks to a one-off gain relating to the sale of an Indian subsidiary to its parent Siemens for \n\u00a31.8bn. \nThe German company is still reeling from cash struggles partly caused by quality issues affecting some of its \nonshore wind turbines.\nThis led to the business being forced to seek a financial guarantee from the German government last year. \nSiemens Energy has become a vital part of the UK wind industry, owning a turbine blade factory in Hull that \nemploys 1,200 people.\nOverall, the company employs 6,000 people in the UK.\nThe company has other profitable divisions, including producing technologies for gas generation and power grids.\nHowever, its business has struggled in the past year due to its troubled wind division, as faults in its 4X and 5X \nonshore wind turbine models led to them being taken off the market.\nThe problem, linked to faulty rotor blades and bearings, triggered repair costs of \u00a31.4bn.\nChristian Bruch, chief executive of Siemens Energy AG, said: \u201cThe solid first quarter is encouraging. Our focus \nremains on solving the quality problems in our onshore wind business and making the most of the growth potential \nfor the rest of the company.\u201d\n                     Recommended                   \nInside Amazon\u2019s British wind power grab\nLoad-Date: February 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Mads Nipper | Chief Executive of \u00d8rsted | \"Despite a year with strong underlying business progress, 2023 marked a year with substantial challenges for \u00d8rsted.\" | N.A. |\n| Thomas Thune Andersen | Chairman of \u00d8rsted | \"2023 was a challenging year for \u00d8rsted.
