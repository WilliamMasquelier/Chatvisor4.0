There's a lot more yet to be revealed.\n\"You've got Macquarie Bank out there at the moment with a great big 'sell' recommendation on Fortescue and a \nshare price tip, which is close to half what the company is at the moment.\n\"That's a big call by a big bank.\"\nMr Treadgold said iron ore remained the \"engine room\" for Fortescue.\n\"China is a big problem for Fortescue, it's a big problem for Australia and hydrogen is a peculiar problem for \nFortescue because the world is just not ready for it yet,\" he said.\n\"To make a move like this and then wrap it all up in two weeks, either something serious has happened or the \ncompany is looking at the future and saying we need to pull our head in.\"\nLoad-Date: July 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
