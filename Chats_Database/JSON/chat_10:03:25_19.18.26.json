Despite offering billions in taxpayer funds these projects are still failing to \nget off the ground.\" Mr O'Brien said the Coalition was taking a \"sensible technology agnostic approach\" to energy - \nPage 2 of 2\nGreen dream on empty\nincluding hydrogen and its controversial nuclear reactor policy. Mr Forrest launched a sweeping restructure at For-\ntescue in the face of the company's failure to deliver on its green-energy -promises. Up to 700 jobs will go in the \nmassive cutbacks after the iron ore mogul pulled back from the company's green hydrogen goal.\nLoad-Date: July 18, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
