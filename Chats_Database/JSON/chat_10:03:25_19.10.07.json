Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Michael Woodley | Chief Executive, Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation | \"We want the EPA to report on the adequacy of the implementation conditions of the Solomon Iron Ore Project and their capacity to avoid, minimise, rehabilitate and offset its impacts to our land, water, and cultural heritage.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Woodley | Chief Executive, Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation | \"The current conditions are much weaker than those in recent ministerial approvals for similar projects, including Fortescue\u2019s own Eliwana mine and the Sanjiv Ridge project on Nyamal Country.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Woodley | Chief Executive, Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation | \"The mine\u2019s lack of environmental and cultural management has been causing his community ongoing hurt and distress.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
