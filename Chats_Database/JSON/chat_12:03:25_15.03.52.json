Your output should only consist of that one sentence.\nThis one sentence should highlight the main topic or theme of the article from the perspective of Shell. We are interested about what is said on Shell in the article and on this overall topic or industry: oil and gas in the Australia market.\n\nHere is the article: Page 1 of 2\nArrow to expand Queensland gas project\nArrow to expand Queensland gas project\nThe Australian\nAugust 13, 2024 Tuesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 637 words\nByline: Colin Packham\nBody\nShell and PetroChina's joint venture Arrow Energy will expand its Surat Gas Project as it moves to capitalise on \ngrowing demand, a move likely to stoke opposition from environmentalists.\nThe expansion will be welcomed by Australia's energy industry, which is struggling to lock in supplies amid rapidly \ndepleting stocks across the east coast.\nArrow said it would expand the project in Queensland's Western Downs to produce 4000PJ of gas for long-term \ncontracts and to supply the domestic market.\nThe JV said 450 new gas production wells, a new field compression station, 27km pipeline, and road and \ninfrastructure upgrades over two phases would be developed.\nArrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said first gas from the expansion was targeted for 2026.\n\"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify \nArrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast,\" Mr Peng said.\n\"Natural gas is an important part of the energy transition, and the expansion demonstrates the faith our \nshareholders have in our ability to manage and deliver large-scale projects.\" Gas from the project will flow to the \nShell-operated QCLNG liquefied natural gas facility on Curtis Island, near Gladstone, to meet long-term contracts \nand supply domestic customers, the joint venture partners said.\nZoe Yujnovich, Shell's integrated gas and upstream director, said the expansion underscored its commitment to \nthe domestic market.\n\"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to \nmarket,\" she said.\n\"QCLNG marked its 1000th cargo at the end of last year, reflecting its significance as a gas supplier for Australia \nand the region. This investment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a \nPage 2 of 2\nArrow to expand Queensland gas project\nlower emissions alternative to options like coal.\" Shell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said the expansion would \nbe boon for the local community.\n\"At its core, this project promotes stronger regional communities, and it also has wider benefits for Australian \nmanufacturing and industry more broadly,\" she said.\nThe expansion will inflame environmentalists, who oppose any new gas drilling. But Australia's east coast faces a \nlooming crisis as offshore gas from Victoria's Bass Strait - the traditional bedrock of the country's supplies - rapidly \ndepletes.\nThe Australian Energy Market Operator has warned the country must urgently unlock new supplies to prevent a \ncatastrophic shortfall but new developments are struggling to secure regulatory approvals and/or the support of \nlocal communities.\nAnalysts have warned the country's $2.5 trillion economy will be significant harmed by a shortfall. The \nmanufacturing sector is particularly exposed with gas its only viable energy source, and any interruptions could \nthreaten their viability.\nHouseholds could also be disrupted. Victoria is the most gas-dependent state, relying on the fuel source to heat \nhomes, and a shortfall could make heating prohibitively expensive.\nOther states will also be hit. Gas is used as a so-called peaker, burnt to provide electricity during periods of high \ndemand or low supply from other fossil fuels or renewables. If Australia's National Electricity Market has insufficient \ngas on hand, the price of electricity will spike. Higher electricity bills was a key driver behind Australia's spike in \ninflation, which in turn forced the Reserve Bank of Australia to raise interest rates 13 times.\nWith a looming shortfall, gas developers have insisted governments fast-track applications, a request that the \nfederal Labor government has refused - insisting it must properly assess each application. The gas industry has \naccused the government of slow walking, which indicates its support for gas - a claim denied by Labor.\nLoad-Date: August 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n            ",
