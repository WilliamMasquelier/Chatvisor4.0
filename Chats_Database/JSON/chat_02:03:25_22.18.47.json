The company had been consistently increasing shareholder payouts since 2016, but due to financial struggles, it has decided to halt these payments to focus on investments without raising additional capital. This move could negatively impact investor confidence and stock performance, as dividends are a key attraction for shareholders. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company has suffered a major financial setback, reporting an EBITDA of 18.7 billion Danish kroner (\u20ac2.5 billion) for 2023, which is below its projected range of 20-23 billion kroner. A significant portion of this shortfall is attributed to a 9.6 billion kroner provision for cancellation costs related to the termination of the Ocean Wind 1 project in the U.S. This financial underperformance highlights the challenges \u00d8rsted faces in managing its offshore wind projects profitably. [El Economista, Violeta N.

Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s market capitalization has plummeted by more than 70% since its peak in early 2021, when it was valued at over \u20ac76.5 billion. The company, once the third-largest utility in Europe, now ranks 14th in the sector, with a market value of just \u20ac16 billion. This dramatic decline underscores the financial instability and investor concerns surrounding the company. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has incurred massive financial losses, posting around \u00a32.2 billion in losses for 2023.

These economic pressures have made it more difficult for the company to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s financial troubles have led analysts to speculate that it may need to seek additional funding from investors. However, instead of raising capital, \u00d8rsted has opted for cost-cutting measures, which could prolong financial uncertainty and increase risks for the company\u2019s future stability. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to implement a drastic austerity plan, including a comprehensive review of its project portfolio.

The failure to complete these projects raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. [de Volkskrant, Marc van Den Eerenbeemt, February 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles have forced it to sell off assets worth 15 billion euros in an effort to stabilize its balance sheet. This asset divestment strategy indicates the severity of the company\u2019s financial difficulties and its need to generate liquidity. However, selling off key assets could weaken \u00d8rsted\u2019s long-term growth potential and reduce its influence in the offshore wind sector. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]\n\n- The company has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have significantly increased the costs of its wind farm projects.

[Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s leadership has been in turmoil, with its chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company\u2019s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning, further complicating \u00d8rsted\u2019s efforts to recover from its financial difficulties. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024] - \u00d8rsted experienced a leadership crisis in late 2023, with the abrupt dismissal of its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Daniel Lerup and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Richard Hunter following a disastrous financial year. The company suffered a massive loss of \u20ac2.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to high write-offs from abandoned offshore wind projects on the U.S. East Coast. This leadership shake-up reflects the severity of \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles and raises concerns about stability at the top levels of management. Frequent executive turnover can disrupt strategic planning and investor confidence. [Energie & Management, Volker Stephan, February 27, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to divest a significant stake in its U.S. onshore wind farms, selling off equity ownership in four wind farms with a total capacity of 957 MW for approximately $300 million. This marks the company\u2019s second major asset divestment in the U.S., highlighting its need to generate liquidity amid financial difficulties.

This investment comes at a time when \u00d8rsted\u2019s stock price has significantly declined due to project cancellations, rising costs, and financial impairments. While Equinor frames the acquisition as a strategic move to expand its renewable energy portfolio, the purchase highlights \u00d8rsted\u2019s weakened financial position and vulnerability to external takeovers. The deal also raises concerns about the increasing influence of fossil fuel companies in the renewable energy sector.

Financieel staat het bedrijf er wel iets beter voor dan een jaar geleden. Afgelopen jaar maakte het \nwindbedrijf net geen verlies, terwijl het in 2023 nog forse verliezen boekte.

Voor projecten die zich nog in een \nvroeger stadium bevinden is dat nog maar de vraag. 'We zullen moeten afwachten hoe de nieuwe minister van \nenergie het presidentieel decreet om vergunningen in te trekken interpreteert.' Naast politieke problemen spelen \nPage 2 of 2\n-25% | \u00d8rsted investeert een kwart minder om financi\u00eble malaise\nook inflatie, opgelopen rente en problemen in de toeleveringsketen het Deense bedrijf al drie jaar parten. Vorige \nweek maakte \u00d8rsted bekend topman Mads Nipper te vervangen wegens aanhoudende financi\u00eble malaise. Het \nbedrijf is wereldwijd een van de grootste spelers in de markt voor wind op zee met 27 operationele windparken en \nnog eens zeven in aanbouw. In Nederland is \u00d8rsted eigenaar van een groot windpark op zee voor de kust van \nBorssele. Errboe: 'We brengen ons investeringsprogramma tot 2030 terug door strikter te kijken waar we ons \nkapitaal inzetten. We investeren voortaan alleen nog maar in de plekken en technologie\u00ebn die financieel het meest \naantrekkelijk zijn.'  Hierdoor dalen de geplande investeringen de komende vijf jaar van 270 mrd Deense kronen \n(\u20ac36 mrd) naar \u20ac28 mrd tot \u20ac31 mrd. Projecten in uitvoering worden volgens Errboe niet geraakt. Wel wordt de \norganisatie verder ingekrompen. Een jaar geleden werd al bekend dat achthonderd van de negenduizend banen \nverdwijnen. Financieel staat het bedrijf er wel iets beter voor dan een jaar geleden. Afgelopen jaar maakte het \nwindbedrijf net geen verlies, terwijl het in 2023 nog forse verliezen boekte. Volgens Errboe is het bedrijfsresultaat \nvan \u20ac3,3 mrd in lijn met de verwachtingen van het bedrijf. De windparkontwikkelaar moest in totaal \u20ac2 mrd \nafboeken op afgeblazen of te dure projecten, minder dan de afboeking van \u20ac3,6 mrd in 2023. Afgelopen jaar streek \n\u00d8rsted ruim \u20ac900 mln op aan compensatie voor twee geannuleerde windprojecten voor de kust van New Jersey. \nBeleggers reageren positief op de cijfers. De koers van \u00d8rsted sloot gisteren een kleine 7% in de plus op 300 \nDeense kronen (bijna \u20ac42), een fractie van de piek in 2021 toen het aandeel 1351 Deense kronen (\u20ac181) waard \nwas.\nWindparkontwikkelaar \u00d8rsted moest in totaal \u20ac2 mrd afboeken op te dure of afgeblazen projecten\nLoad-Date: February 17, 2025\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Het Financieele Dagblad\nAuthor: Eva Rooijers\nDate: February 07, 2025\nTitle: -25% | \u00d8rsted investeert een kwart minder om financi\u00eble malaise\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Aanbesteding van windparken op Noordzee dreigt te mislukken\n## Media outlet: Het Financieele Dagblad\n### Author: Orla Mcdonald, Eva Rooijers\n### Date: February 14, 2025\n\nPage 1 of 2\nAanbesteding van windparken op Noordzee dreigt te mislukken\nAanbesteding van windparken op Noordzee dreigt te mislukken\nHet Financieele Dagblad\n14 februari 2025 vrijdag 12:00 AM GMT\nCopyright 2025 FD Mediagroep B.V. All Rights Reserved\nSection: PAGINA 1; PAGINA 3; Blz. 1; Blz. 3\nLength: 1003 words\nByline: Orla McDonald;Eva Rooijers\nBody\nMarktsituatie is verslechterd en risico's zijn verhoogd, stellen energiebedrijven\nOrla McDonald en Eva Rooijers\nAmsterdam\nNederland loopt het risico geen energiebedrijf te vinden voor de bouw van drie grote windparken op de Noordzee. \nOffshorewindparkontwikkelaars als Vattenfall, \u00d8rsted en RWE betwijfelen ten zeerste of een investering zich zal \nterugverdienen. Energiebedrijf Engie laat al weten zich niet in te schrijven voor de aanbesteding die in september \nopent. Nederland zou de tender uit moeten stellen of aan moeten passen, zegt de windenergiesector tegen het FD.\n'Het is onder deze voorwaarden niet verantwoord om een bod te doen', zegt ceo van Engie Energie Nederland \nHarry Talen. Het Franse energiebedrijf bezit grote windparken in het Belgische en Britse deel van de Noordzee en \ndeed tot nu toe aan de meeste Nederlandse windaanbestedingen mee. 'Voor de komende tender zien we nu al dat \ner geen verdienmodel is en dan heeft het geen zin om miljoenen te investeren in het voorwerk dat nodig is voor een \nbod.' Het gaat om de vergunningenronde van drie kavels voor de kust bij IJmuiden. In totaal moet er 3 gigawatt aan \nwindenergie bijkomen, genoeg om drie miljoen huishoudens van stroom te voorzien. Dit komt bovenop de 8,5 \ngigawatt aan offshorewind die al draait of vergund is. Wind op zee was tot nu toe juist een van de succesvolste \npijlers onder de energietransitie in Nederland, maar het verdienmodel voor windparken staat al langer onder druk. \nOok in de rest van Europa. Inflatie, hoge rente en krapte in de toeleveringsketen hebben de prijzen van de bouw \nopgedreven, terwijl de prijzen die afnemers willen betalen niet zijn gestegen. Verschillende grote energiebedrijven \nschroefden recent hun wereldwijde investeringen in windparken terug. Het Verenigd Koninkrijk en Denemarken \nmoesten aanbestedingen afblazen, omdat geen enkel energiebedrijf zich ingeschreven had. Denemarken heeft \nPage 2 of 2\nAanbesteding van windparken op Noordzee dreigt te mislukken\ndaarop een nieuwe bieding uitgesteld en onderzoekt hoe die aantrekkelijker kan worden gemaakt. 'Ik hoop dat die \nmislukking een voldoende sterk signaal is voor de Nederlandse regering om ook hier aan de knoppen te gaan \ndraaien', zegt Ireen Geerbex die bij Vattenfall verantwoordelijk is voor de ontwikkeling van windparken op zee. 'Er is \neen re\u00eble kans dat de tender mislukt als het ministerie van Klimaat en Groene Groei die in deze vorm doorzet', zegt \nze. RWE geeft aan dat de markt 'behoorlijk onder druk' staat en dat het moet bekijken of de businesscase wel \nrendabel te krijgen is. Belangrijkste oorzaak van het probleem is de achterblijvende vraag naar groene stroom, \nzeggen veel van de bedrijven. De industrie heeft moeite met verduurzamen, mede vanwege het volle stroomnet. \nOok de ontwikkeling van een markt en netwerk voor groene waterstof is vertraagd.  Er zijn nauwelijks partijen die \ngrote langjarige stroomcontracten willen afsluiten met de uitbaters van windparken, zogeheten PPA's. Bouwers van \nwindparken hebben de contracten nodig om hun businesscase rond te krijgen. 'Er is onvoldoende bereidheid om \nafnameovereenkomsten te sluiten en zeker niet tegen een prijspeil dat voor ons aanvaardbaar is', zegt Jo\u00ebl \nMeggelaars van \u00d8rsted Benelux.  Vattenfall en \u00d8rsted pleiten er daarom voor om windkavels minder snel op de \nmarkt te brengen. 'De impopulaire boodschap is dat we een tandje terug moeten schakelen. Op deze weg \ndoorgaan is geen goed idee. Eerst moet de vraag naar elektriciteit in Nederland groeien', zegt Geerbex van \nVattenfall. Engie denkt, anders dan zijn concurrenten, dat de oplossing ligt in aanpassing van de aanbesteding, in \nplaats van uitstel.  Engie wil dat Nederland, in navolging van Belgi\u00eb en het VK, een nieuw subsidiemechanisme \ninvoert, in de markt bekend als een contract for difference. Ook RWE ziet daar heil in. Een energiebedrijf krijgt dan \nsubsidie als de elektriciteitsprijs onder een minimum zakt. Daar staat tegenover dat de overheid winsten af kan \nromen als de elektriciteitsprijzen heel hoog zijn. Zowel Vattenfall als \u00d8rsted waarschuwen wel dat de kosten voor \nde staat aanzienlijk op kunnen lopen als dit subsidiemechanisme wordt ingevoerd terwijl er niets wordt gedaan om \nde vraag naar groene stroom aan te jagen.  Hoewel de offshorewindsector het in heel Europa lastig heeft, zijn de \nrisico's in Nederland extra hoog, zeggen de bedrijven. Dat komt door de voorwaarden die minister Sophie Hermans \n(Klimaat en Groene Groei) aan de tenders stelt. Energiebedrijven moeten in Nederland betalen om een vergunning \nte krijgen. Bijna alle andere landen hebben dit zogeheten financi\u00eble bod afgeschaft, om bouwers niet verder op \nkosten te jagen in de huidige marktsituatie. 'Dat Nederland dit nog vraagt, is puur politiek opportunisme. Dan ben je \nals kabinet compleet losgezongen van hoe dat in de markt doorwerkt', zegt Fred van Beers, topman van Sif, de \nNederlandse bouwer van funderingen voor windmolens.\nEnergiebedrijf Engie laat al weten zich niet in te schrijven voor de aanbesteding die in september opent\nVervolg op pagina 3\nVervolg van pagina 1\nOok in de toeleveringsketen merken ze minder animo voor de Nederlandse tender. 'Normaal hadden partijen nu al \nwel gepolst of wij kunnen leveren, maar de aandacht is op dit moment gering', zegt Van Beers. \nHermans schreef eerder een consultatie uit om te horen welke uitdagingen marktpartijen hebben. Ook een motie \nvan NSC, VVD en drie oppositiepartijen roept op om de risico's te verminderen. In maart stuurt Hermans een \nKamerbrief met de stand van zaken, zegt een woordvoerder. Gerust zijn energiebedrijven er niet op dat het kabinet \nop tijd actie onderneemt, zeggen ze.  Ook voor de vorige tender afgelopen juni, genaamd 'IJmuiden Ver', was \nweinig animo. \u00d8rsted en Engie staken tijd en miljoenen in de voorbereidingen van een bod, maar zagen daar op \nhet laatste moment van af. Uiteindelijk schreven drie kandidaten zich in voor twee kavels, terwijl het kabinet bij \neerdere biedingen uit het dubbele aantal gegadigden kon kiezen. 'De laatste tender is uiteindelijk gelukt, maar met \nde hakken over de sloot', aldus Sif-topman Van Beers.\nLoad-Date: February 13, 2025\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Het Financieele Dagblad\nAuthor: Orla Mcdonald, Eva Rooijers\nDate: February 14, 2025\nTitle: Aanbesteding van windparken op Noordzee dreigt te mislukken\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Wind farm giant Orsted's chief executive quits\n## Media outlet: The Independent\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: March 02, 2025\n\n| About LexisNexis | Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions | Copyright \u00a9 2020 LexisNexis  \n \n \nUser Name:  = William.Masquelier@hillandknowlton.com  \nDate  and Time:  = 2025-03-02  \nJob Number:  = 246641408  \n \nDocuments  (111)  \nClient/Matter:  -None-  \nSearch  Terms:  ATL3(\"\u00d8rsted\"  OR \"Orsted\")  \nSearch  Type:  Boolean  \nContent  Type  Narrowed  by \nnews  Timeline:  01 Jan, 2024  to 31 Dec, 2025  Source  Location:  \nEurope  Source  Name:  Energie  & Management  Source  \nName:  FT.com  Headlines  Source  Name:  Het Financieele  \nDagblad  Source  Name:  Energeia.nl  (Headlines)  Source  \nName:  The Independent  (United  Kingdom)  Source  Name:  \nThe Guardian   (London)  Source  Name:  LesEchos.fr  \nSource  Name:  The Daily  Telegraph  (London)  Source  \nName:  telegraph.co.uk  Source  Name:  Lefigaro.fr  Source  \nName:  Proactive  Investors  (UK) Source  Name:  \nBN/DeStem  Source  Name:  NU.nl  Source  Name:  Energy:  \nUkraine  and the world  Source  Name:  London  Stock  \nExchange  Regulatory  News  Service  (RNS)  Source  Name:  \nPZC.nl  Source  Name:  Nordic  Business  Report  Source  \nName:  De Telegraaf.nl  Source  Name:  El Economista,  \nSpain  Source  Name:  The Daily  Mail (London)  Source  \nName:  Le Monde  Source  Name:  de Volkskrant  Source  \nName:  La Libre   \n \n1.

            "content": "- \u00d8rsted has been forced to cut its planned investments by 25% in an effort to stabilize its financial position. The company has faced significant financial difficulties due to rising interest rates, inflation, and supply chain disruptions, which have made offshore wind projects more expensive and less profitable. This reduction in investment raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to maintain its leadership in the renewable energy sector and meet its long-term growth targets. The company hopes to avoid a further downgrade in its credit rating, but the cutbacks could slow the expansion of offshore wind infrastructure globally. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Eva Rooijers, February 07, 2025]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has suffered massive financial losses, writing off \u20ac2 billion in 2024 due to abandoned or overly expensive projects. This follows an even larger write-down of \u20ac3.6 billion in 2023, highlighting the company\u2019s ongoing financial struggles. The impairments stem from project cancellations and cost overruns, which have severely impacted \u00d8rsted\u2019s profitability. These repeated financial hits raise concerns about the company\u2019s ability to execute large-scale offshore wind projects efficiently and profitably. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Eva Rooijers, February 07, 2025]\n\n- The return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency has created significant uncertainty for \u00d8rsted\u2019s offshore wind expansion plans. On his first day in office, Trump revoked all new permits for offshore wind projects, forcing \u00d8rsted to write off \u20ac1.6 billion on land it had acquired off the coast of Maryland. The company now faces the risk that no new offshore wind projects will be approved during Trump\u2019s term, a major setback for its U.S. growth strategy. This political uncertainty adds to \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial woes and could force the company to scale back its ambitions in the American market. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Eva Rooijers, February 07, 2025]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to lay off 800 employees as part of its cost-cutting measures to address financial difficulties. The job cuts reflect the severe strain the company is under due to rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and project cancellations. These layoffs will have significant social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities, further highlighting the instability within \u00d8rsted. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Eva Rooijers, February 07, 2025]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s stock price has plummeted by nearly 80% from its peak in 2021, reflecting a severe loss of investor confidence. The company\u2019s financial struggles, including massive write-downs, project cancellations, and rising costs, have contributed to this sharp decline. Investors remain wary of \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to recover, and the company\u2019s market value has been significantly eroded, raising concerns about its long-term viability. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Eva Rooijers, February 07, 2025]\n\n- \u00d8rsted and other offshore wind developers are struggling to make new projects financially viable due to inflation, high interest rates, and supply chain constraints. The company has warned that the current market conditions make it difficult to justify new investments, leading to concerns that offshore wind expansion could slow down significantly. This could have broader implications for the global transition to renewable energy, as \u00d8rsted is one of the largest players in the industry. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Orla Mcdonald, Eva Rooijers, February 14, 2025]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has warned that the Dutch government\u2019s current tender conditions for offshore wind projects may lead to a failed auction. The company, along with other major developers like Vattenfall and RWE, has expressed concerns that the financial model for new wind farms is no longer viable under the existing terms. If the Dutch government does not adjust its policies, \u00d8rsted and other companies may be forced to withdraw from bidding, potentially delaying the country\u2019s renewable energy goals. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Orla Mcdonald, Eva Rooijers, February 14, 2025]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s CEO, Mads Nipper, has resigned following a series of major financial setbacks, including significant asset write-downs and a sharp decline in the company\u2019s stock price. Under his leadership, \u00d8rsted\u2019s share value plummeted by 80%, reflecting investor concerns over the company\u2019s financial health and strategic direction. His departure signals instability at the top levels of management, raising questions about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to navigate the ongoing challenges in the offshore wind sector.
