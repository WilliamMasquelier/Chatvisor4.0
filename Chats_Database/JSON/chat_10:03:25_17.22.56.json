What have you seen to date since the acquisition and when do \nyou expect to -- for us to start thinking about when we should be seeing Musgrave coming through the mill?\nMark Zeptner\nThanks for the question, Steve. I will answer that. It's Mark. Look, what we're saying is that the team at Musgrave \ndid an excellent job in terms of drilling the ore body out and preparing resources and mine plans that are pretty \nclose to production ready. Our optimizations and reruns of [Indiscernible] are very similar and very close, which is \nalways company. It's not what you'll always find, I have to add. In terms of production, we hope to be developing in \nthe second half of this calendar year with -- I'd say, or first or sort of September, August, September, obviously \nramping up through that period. So perhaps, I sent it earlier than some expect. We've already submitted our mining \nproposal and we're on like the third back and forwards with the department on that. So assuming we get approvals \nprior to June, then we should be ready to go from July onwards.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nUnidentified Participant\nThat's an great sign.

Josh Gilbert, markets analyst at eToro, said the \nASX 200 fell away from record levels but \"stayed within touching distance\".\nRetail sales fell by 2.7 per cent in December, more than reversing the Black Friday-driven bump in November and \nthe weakest monthly result since the height of Covid-19 lockdowns in August 2020.\nMr Gilbert said the data backed up the view that rate cuts by the Reserve Bank were on the horizon in the middle of \nthe year. \"This is what the RBA wanted to see; sales weakening, and we're likely to see further signs of weakening \nin the months ahead,\" he said.\nInvestors were focusing on Wednesday's consumer price index data, expected to show that inflation had eased to \n0.8 per cent in the December quarter, with the annual rate falling to a two-year low of 4.3 per cent.\n\"A reading under expectations, after (Tuesday's) dismal retail print, will see the rate cut expectations brought \nforward, which could be the catalyst the local market needs to take out that record-high close,\" Mr Gilbert said.\nThe dollar ignored the retail data and was trading near US66.15c at 5pm AEDT. The tech sector was the strongest \nASX performer, with Megaport rocketing almost 28 per cent to $12.48 after a stronger-than--expected trading \nupdate.\nPage 2 of 2\nBourse toys with a record high\nHealthcare stocks also gained as biotech giant CSL rose 1.2 per cent to $296.74 and ResMed lifted 1.8 per cent to \n$28.95.\nMarket and mining heavyweight BHP was up 0.4 per cent at $47.05, while Fortescue hit a record high, closing with \na 1.5 per cent gain at $29.70.\nNickel Industries jumped almost 21 per cent to 72.5c on the back of record quarterly earnings and production, a \nhigher dividend and a $US100m share buyback.\nGold miner Northern Star Resources rose 2.9 per cent to $13.33, and Ramelius advanced 2.9 per cent to $1.58 \nafter raising its production guidance.\nEnergy stocks declined after oil prices fell, having reached their highest level since November on Monday amid an \nescalation in Middle East tensions.\nWoodside Energy dipped 0.1 per cent to $31.87 and Santos lost 0.5 per cent to $7.76.\nAustralia's biggest bank, Commonwealth Bank, reached a record high before ending with a 0.1 per cent lift at \n$116.05.\nWestpac fell 0.5 per cent to $23.82, ANZ dropped 0.2 per cent to $26.79 and NAB was flat, dipping 0.03 per cent to \n$32.13.\nClothing retailer City Chic soared 26.4 per cent to 55c as it flagged a better-than-expected interim earnings loss and \nthe potential sale of its North American business. The local sharemarket's rise followed gains on Wall Street as the \nS&P 500, up 0.8 per cent, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 0.6 per cent, both hit fresh records.\nLoad-Date: January 30, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Megan Neil\nDate: January 31, 2024\nTitle: Bourse toys with a record high\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Australia stocks lower at close of trade; S&P/ASX 200 down 0.95%\n## Media outlet: Investing\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: February 05, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nAustralia stocks lower at close of trade; S&P/ASX 200 down 0.95%\nAustralia stocks lower at close of trade; S&P/ASX 200 down 0.95%\nInvesting.com USA Edition\nFebruary 5, 2024 Monday\nCopyright 2024 Investing.com Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

The JV is operated by Cyprium, who owns 80% of the rights to base \nmetals with 20% owned by Ramelius.\nCyprium is encouraged by a drill intercept of 15 metres at 3.26% copper, 0.70 g/t gold, 7.4 g/t silver and 151ppm \ncobalt from 70 metres downhole in drill hole 24CURC004.\nThis included a 7-metre intercept at 5.04% copper, 0.81 g/t gold, 11.4 g/t silver, 197ppm cobalt and 0.11% nickel \nfrom a depth of 71 metres.  \nA second intercept in that drill hole returned 3 metres at 1.09% copper and 0.44 g/t gold from 108 metres, including \n1 metre at 2.54% copper and 1.19 g/t gold from 109 metres. \nCyprium notes that the mineralisation remains open at depth and along strike in both directions within a lightly \ntested copper soil anomaly that extends for 2.5 kilometres along strike.\n\"Potential for economic orebody\"\nPage 2 of 3\nCyprium Metals makes shallow high-grade copper discovery at Cue JV's Heeler prospect\nCyprium executive chairman Matt Fifield said: \"While the company remains focused on delivering a robust plan for \nNifty [copper project], we continue to maintain our outstanding portfolio of exploration assets.\n\"This new Heeler discovery is a great reminder of the prospective value within the company's earlier-stage assets in \nthe Paterson and Murchison provinces.\n\"Our exploration team targeted our limited drilling budget in the Murchison around the most prospective areas and \nhit outstanding grade that shows potential for an economic orebody. It's exciting to have an unexpected shallow \nhigh-grade hit show up like this.\n\"With Nifty, Maroochydore, our Murchison portfolio and our Paterson JV with IGO, Cyprium has some of the best \nassets and exploration ground in Australia to deliver into the growing global requirements for copper.\"\nUnderexplored base metals potential\n\"With Heeler, Cyprium continues to build on its copper-gold resource inventory in the Murchison,\" said Cyprium \nCOO Milan Jerkovic.\n\"We have 203,000 tonnes of copper resource and 153,0000 ounces of gold (100% basis) at the nearby Hollandaire \nand Nanadie Well deposits and follow-up work around Heeler may well bring additional grade and scale into our \nportfolio.\n\"There are assays from this program outstanding, but we're pleased to have hit shallow high-grade mineralisation.\"\nCyprium geologist Mark Styles added: \"The Cue region is an area that's known for its gold deposits but hasn't been \nwell explored for its base metals potential.\n\"At Heeler, for example, we were attracted by the large, lightly tested +100ppm copper soil anomaly up to 400 \nmetres wide and 2.5 kilometres long, historic shallow drill results with 0.3% copper in the core of the soil anomaly \nand a coincident geophysical magnetic high. \n\"These features are suggestive of a mafic-ultramafic association with base metal mineralisation in a style distinct \nfrom the felsic-hosted Hollandaire copper-gold deposit located 10 kilometres northeast of Heeler.\"\n\"We drilled four holes in our program focusing on Heeler, following up on work in 2022. So far we have assays back \nfrom a single drillhole completed in our January 2024 program. \n\"The 24CURC004 intercept showed stacked shallow sulphide mineralisation that was visible in the drill chips. We \nalso hit sulphides in the three other holes but we're expecting lower tenor assay results, <1% copper.\" \nCyprium geologist Peter van Luyt said: \"As we've looked harder at the mineralisation and the assays, this hole \nsuggests a mafic-ultramafic orthomagmatic nickel-copper-cobalt type that would be similar to a Nova-Bollinger style \ndeposit. When we have the additional assays, we will be in a position to plan follow-up work.\" \n2024 drill holes\nThe following images show the location of the four 2024 drill holes and a preliminary conceptual cross-section \nbased on assays and visual interpretation. Drill hole 24CURC003 intersected lithologies and mineralisation similar \nto 24CURC004 but with lower levels of visible chalcopyrite (copper iron sulphide). \nDrill holes 24CURC001 and 24CURC002 were drilled towards the southern end of the Heeler anomaly and \nintersected traces of chalcopyrite over wide intervals beneath the weathered carapace in lithologies similar to the \nHeeler host rocks. \nAssay results for these three drill holes are pending.Page 3 of 3\nCyprium Metals makes shallow high-grade copper discovery at Cue JV's Heeler prospect\nLoad-Date: February 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Proactive Investors\nAuthor: Meagan Evans\nDate: February 20, 2024\nTitle: Cyprium Metals makes shallow high-grade copper discovery at Cue JV's Heeler prospect\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Aussie shares take a break after hitting all-time high\n## Media outlet: AAP Newsfeed\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: March 04, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nFED:Aussie shares take a break after hitting all-time high\nFED:Aussie shares take a break after hitting all-time high\nAAP Newsfeed\nMarch 4, 2024 Monday 1:12 PM AEST\nCopyright 2024 Australian Associated Press Pty.
