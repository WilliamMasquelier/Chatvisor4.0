Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Street Talk; Pg. 14\nLength: 452 words\nByline: Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood and Emma Rapaport\nBody\nRamelius Resources is in exclusive due diligence to acquire Toronto-listed West Australian gold miner Karora \nResources, which it hopes will add a new production centre to replace its ageing Edna May asset.\nStreet Talk can reveal Ramelius boss Mark Zeptner will spend $700 million to $1 billion for the acquisition. Karora \nwill bring new production hubs with mills, and could help the company consolidate its position in the region. A \nRamelius spokesperson declined to comment.\nKarora's portfolio, located 60 kilometres from Kalgoorlie, includes 100 per cent ownership of the Beta Hunt mine, \nHigginsville gold operations and Spargos gold mine. It is expected to produce 170,000 to 195,000 ounces gold in \n2024. By contrast, Ramelius has told shareholders it would hit 272,500 ounces production this financial year.\nZeptner and his team are chasing the acquisition after a period of solid performance and perky gold prices. \nRamelius shares have risen nearly 48 per cent in the past year, giving it a $1.8 billion market capitalisation and a \nstrong balance sheet.\nIn particular, it has benefited from high-grade Penny ore being fed into the Mt Magnet Mill. Cash and gold reserves \nare expected to hit $400 million by year-end, while about $100 million in undrawn debt would further boost its \nliquidity profile.\nRamelius reported a 14 per cent increase in revenue to $348.5 million at its half-year results on February 20. \nEBITDA shot up 39 per cent to $140.2 million, thanks to a 12 per cent jump in realised gold price.\nRamelius' biggest asset is the Mt Magnet production centre, which it started building via a $40 million acquisition in \n2010. Now, 14 years on, Mt Magnet speaks for 62 per cent of the group's gold reserves.\nWhen combined with the Vivien gold deposit and Penny gold mine, it is 53 per cent of the total net present value, \naccording to Macquarie Capital analysts. Production is expected to reduce significantly by the 2029 financial year.\nPage 2 of 2\nRamelius in exclusive talks to buy Canada-listed gold miner; Street Talk\nBut the more pressing matter for Zeptner has been finding a replacement for Edna May, which it bought from \nEvolution Mining in 2017. It is now just 2 per cent of the reserves, with a significant production slump ahead in the \n2025 financial year.\nOther bets like the Rebecca project are still a long way from spitting out cash.\nPut that all together, and it's not surprising management has been on the prowl for acquisitions.\nSources told this column logical targets had included Spartan Resources as well as Northern Star's Carosue Dam \ngold mine. However, the former isn't operational, while the latter may have been hard to prise from its current \nowner.\nThe mooted acquisition at Karora comes after Ramelius acquired ASX-listed gold junior Musgrave Minerals in \nSeptember.\nLoad-Date: March 10, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**ENTITY**: [Organization Name]\n**TYPE**: [Type of organization - e.g., Company, Government Agency, NGO, etc.]\n**DESCRIPTION**: [Brief description of how the entity is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**ENTITY**: Tesla, Inc.\n**TYPE**: Company\n**DESCRIPTION**: Main subject of article, discussing Q4 earnings report\n\nOnly include entities that are meaningful to the article's content.
