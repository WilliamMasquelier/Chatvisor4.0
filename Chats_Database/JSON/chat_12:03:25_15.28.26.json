BP, the FTSE 100 constituent, is set to unwind 2030 targets to cut oil and gas production targets and \ndrop its low-carbon deployment goal when it updates its capital allocation strategy later this month.\nEquinor chief executive Anders Opedal said that cutting capital expenditure on renewables would help address \nchallenges in the offshore wind industry, and increase \"value creation\". The company expects to produce free \ncashflow of $US23bn by 2027, $US11n of which will be returned to shareholders as dividends.\nIn December, Equinor combined its British oil and gas assets with Shell under a new 50-50 joint venture, which \nthey claimed would create the largest independent producer in the maturing North Sea.\nHowever, its ambitions in the North Sea were dealt a blow last week when the Scottish courts quashed consent for \nRosebank, which is co-owned by Ithaca Energy, and Shell's Jackdaw field after a legal challenge brought by the \ncampaign groups Greenpeace and Uplift against the government's decision in 2023 to greenlight the projects.\nShell's Jackdaw gas field and Equinor's Rosebank oilfield must now reapply for government permission because \ntheir original approvals failed to consider the emissions that will be generated when the oil and gas is burnt. \nPage 2 of 2\nOil group Equinor cuts green spending\nHowever, the companies have been allowed to continue development work in the meantime. Equinor has spent \n\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a32.2bn on Rosebank so far.\nPhilippe Mathieu, executive vice-president for exploration and production international, said that the project would \ncontribute to Britain's growth agenda and create about 2000 jobs in the construction phase.\nThe fate of the fields will be a test of the government's approach to the North Sea. British Energy Secretary Ed \nMiliband has vowed to stop issuing new North Sea oil and gas licences and described Rosebank as a \"colossal \nwaste of taxpayer money and climate vandalism\" while in opposition.\nMr Mathieu said the project would boost domestically produced oil and gas and reduce reliance on imports.\n\"If you don't have Rosebank oil for the UK, then you have to import it from somewhere else \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 how much CO2 is \nthat going to cost?\" he said.
