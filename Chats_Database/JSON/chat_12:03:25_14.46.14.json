Photo: DPIRD\nThe Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) said the number of rock lobster on the \nmove offshore was influenced by several factors including ocean temperature.\nThe higher the temperature, the earlier and stronger the migration will be along WA\u2019s west coast.\nOn the back of a very strong run last year, comparatively fewer they predict will make the journey this year with \nDPIRD research showing water temperatures are about one degree Celsius warmer in the shallows, so the run is \npredicted to start earlier than normal from about November 20.\nEvery year, DPIRD scientists measure sample numbers of western rock lobster (Panulirus cygnus) puerulus (baby \nlobsters) from ocean-based collectors at strategic locations along the west coast.\nDPIRD principal research scientist Simon de Lestang said the tiny lobsters naturally settled onto floating seaweed \naround nearshore reefs, which helped them sneak past predators on their way to settling into crevices and holes \nwithin coastal reef systems.\n\u201cThe number of puerulus measured four years earlier is the strongest influence on the whites run, which occurs \nwhen the three-and-a-half to four-year-old immature lobsters start to move out to deeper breeding areas,\u201d he said.\nIn the process, the lobsters moult from a red shell into a special light pink to whitish shell, helping them blend in \nmore with the seafloor sand as they walk out to offshore grounds.\nPage 2 of 2\nWhites run to start earlier this year DPIRD predicts\nDr Lestang said the journey to deeper water always attracted a lot of interest from fishers.\n\u201cThis is a popular time of year for recreational fishers, because while the whites are walking, we estimate they are \nthree times more catchable, hiding in pots during the day while they\u2019re migrating.\n\u201cCommercial fishers also eagerly anticipate the whites run, because it generally coincides with the approaching \nfestive season when seafood and especially rock lobsters are always popular choices.\n\u201cThe annual migration of lobsters is expected to continue over January into February when Chinese New Year \ncelebrations lift the demand for lobsters again.\n\u201cCommercial fishers can catch quite a lot of their quota during this time, sell it easily and maintain good prices.\u201d\nThis article appeared on Yanchep News Online on 15 November 2024.\nGraphic\n \nWhites run lobsters moult into a lighter shell colour.
