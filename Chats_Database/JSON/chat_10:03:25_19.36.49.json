However, as soon as we became aware \nof the incident we took immediate action.\n\"We take all matters relating to safety seriously. While we have policies, training, reporting and support services in \nplace, this improvement notice reinforces the work already under way and the need to continuously improve.\" In a \njoint statement last week, the Forrests said it was an appropriate time to step aside as co-chairs with Minderoo's \n2030 strategy finalised and being rolled out. Dr Forrest also said he wanted to focus on his role as executive chair \nof iron ore miner Fortescue.\nThe WorkSafe revelations come amid rumblings about the workplace culture at Minderoo, where 150 staff have \nbeen shown the door since April as part of -efforts to ensure more funds go -towards causes that include helping \nvulnerable communities and protecting oceans.\nOne former employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they had concerns about psychosocial safety at \nMinderoo. \"There is clearly a cultural problem, I don't think that is a great secret,\" the employee said.\nAnother source at Minderoo spoke of unrealistic workloads and being pressed to work on tasks outside their \nemployment contract. Some of the concerns were borne out in a staff survey.\nOthers have praised the Forrests and Minderoo CEO John Hartman for their achievements in philanthropy and \nleadership through the foundation's overhaul.\nMinderoo became one of world's biggest philanthropic foundations in June last year when the Forrests tipped in 220 \nmillion shares in iron ore miner Fortescue. The shares were worth about $5bn at the time and represented about a \nfifth of their total shareholding in the miner.\nThe foundation, started by the couple more than 20 years ago, subsequently went through a shake-up and staff \nclean-out. The reset included a new structure and executive team, and cutting the workforce from about 350 to 200.\nApart from Mr Hartman, the rest of the Minderoo nine-member executive team are women.\nThe foundation made one of its biggest grants last year to a gender fund aimed at achieving a fairer world for \nwomen and girls.\nThe watchdog took Fortescue to court last year, alleging the miner had failed to supply work safety authorities with \ndocuments relating to 34 cases of -alleged sexual harassment.\nFor-tescue was charged with 34 counts of refusing or failing to comply with a requirement to provide documents to \na WorkSafe inspector within a specified period.\nThe legal showdown involved legislation introduced after a WA parliamentary inquiry shed light on sexual \nharassment and assaults on women in the mining industry. Fortescue said at the time that it did not want to reveal \nthe identity of those mentioned in the documents to WorkSafe inspectors, but was \"committed to upholding the \nhighest standards of workplace health and safety and has zero tolerance for inappropriate behaviour in the \nworkplace\". WorkSafe's dropped the charges after reaching agreement with Fortescue on an \"enforceable \nundertaking\" that included handing over the documents. and a commitment to tackle inappropriate workplace \nbehaviour.\nLoad-Date: October 20, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
