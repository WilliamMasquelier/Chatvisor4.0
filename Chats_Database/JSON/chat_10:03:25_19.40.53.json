Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"The amount of horsepower in the tank of China's economy and the ability to self-stimulate is phenomenal. You've seen just the edge of it.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"I know that they (China) have so much ready to roll that, whichever way it goes, Australia is going to be all right.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"If you have a look at the IRA, it might get adjusted ... we need clarity.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"The reason why we're not hammering into it is because we need clarity around some of the rules, which has been put off to after the election.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"He's toed the election line.

Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
