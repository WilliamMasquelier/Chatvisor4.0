Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 8\nLength: 401 words\nByline: Tom Rabe and Elouise Fowler\nBody\nFortescue says the Albanese government should consider tying a lucrative fuel tax credit to decarbonisation efforts \nfor Australia's mining giants, but insists it is not advocating for the subsidy to be scrapped for farmers and minor \nplayers.\nThe Commonwealth's diesel fuel excise covers the costs of maintaining public roads, and all users, including mining \ncompanies, pay it. But companies can claim a tax rebate when the diesel is used on private roads - such as those \non mine sites or farms - as these are maintained by their owners.\nFortescue maintains the diesel tax credit provides more disincentives than incentives for miners to decarbonise, \nand is pushing for change.\n\"The government needs to think about levelling the playing field so that companies that do want to decarbonise and \nshift to clean fuel sources are on a level playing field with those that stay in the current environment,\" said the \ncompany's director of global sustainability and external affairs, Bronwyn Grieve.\n\"It could look at structuring the diesel fuel tax credit in a way that allows some companies - the big fossil fuel users, \nyour top, big-tier mining companies - to be eligible for some of those credits, only where they are willing to invest \nthose credits into a proper decarbonisation program.\"\nThe world's biggest miner, BHP, declined to comment on Fortescue's proposal. But the company's support for the \nfuel credit remains steadfast. Rio Tinto also declined to comment.\nThe mining giants are collaborating on battery/electric-haul truck trials in the Pilbara.\nThe Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, which counts Fortescue as a member, said it backed clean \nenergy incentives, but didn't want the fuel credit to change.\n\"We do not support proposals to change the diesel fuel rebate,\" said AMEC chief executive Warren Pearce.\nPage 2 of 2\nTie diesel fuel credits to emission cuts: Fortescue Energy rebate\n\"Fortescue has been having discussions with government about the introduction of incentives to encourage \ndecarbonisation within industry. That's something that industry can support, and our member companies are \nworking hard to reduce our emission in line with net zero targets.\"\nMs Grieve insisted Fortescue was not advocating for the fuel credit to be scrapped for farmers and smaller miners, \n\"nor are we pushing for an immediate cessation or removal of the diesel fuel tax credit\".\n\"We think there are much more nuanced and sensible solutions in the near term that can be adopted,\" she said.\nLoad-Date: October 14, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
