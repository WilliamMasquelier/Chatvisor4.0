Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Carlos Lange | President of Fortescue Energy's European operations | \"Mr Lange was appointed as the president of Fortescue Energy's European operations in March 2023, tasked with helping Fortescue make good on its big promises about the production of green energy and hydrogen across Europe.\" | N.A. |\n| Cameron Wilson | Long-term company secretary of Fortescue | \"We are delighted that (Cameron) has agreed to continue with the company on a part-time basis to ensure a smooth transition.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Gunner | Former Head of Northern Australia at Fortescue Energy | \"Initially appointed as Fortescue Energy's Head of Northern Australia in late 2022, Mr Gunner finished his period with Fortescue as the head of business development for Australia and New Zealand.\" | N.A. |\n| Deborah Caudle | Former chief financial officer of Fortescue Energy | \"This year Fortescue Energy also lost the services of chief financial officer Deborah Caudle, less than five months after she was appointed to the role.\" | N.A. |\n| Malcolm Turnbull | Former prime minister and former associate of Fortescue | \"Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also formally severing ties with the company.\" | N.A. |\n| Fiona Sugden | Former external affairs boss at Fortescue | \"External affairs boss Fiona Sugden leaving to join the office of current Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
