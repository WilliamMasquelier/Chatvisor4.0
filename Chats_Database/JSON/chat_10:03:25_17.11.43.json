It operates in the Mining, exploration and drilling of gold, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Ramelius Resources based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Ramelius Resources is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Ramelius Resources.\n\nIf Ramelius Resources is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nRegis may take the merger road - DATA ROOM\nRegis may take the merger road - DATA ROOM\nThe Australian\nJune 19, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 14\nLength: 490 words\nByline: EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER\nBody\nLarge mining companies love to announce big ticket mergers and acquisitions before the annual Diggers & Dealers \nconference in August, and the next one to arrive could involve Regis Resources.\nThe $1.3bn gold miner has pinned its growth hopes on its McPhillamys Project in NSW but, as it has transpired, \ndeveloping the project will come at a significant cost, creating questions around whether it is better placed to carry \nout a merger or acquisition deal instead.\nOne dance partner currently on the sidelines that could be a good match is Gold Road Resources.\nGold Road Resources is not officially for sale, but with investors not keen for it to carry out expensive acquisitions \noverseas, and few buying opportunities in the local market, perhaps a deal with another group is one of its few \noptions.\nThe merits for merging with Gold Road could be strong.\nBoth have non-operating stakes in assets - Regis has 30 per cent of the Tropicana gold mine whereas Gold Road \nhas a half share of Gruyere.\nThe Gruyere gold mine stake in Western Australia, while not an operating one, is still a top-quality asset.\nAnd a merged Regis and Gold Road would have more fire power to buy gold miner De Grey Mining if that was on \nthe agenda.\nGold Road has a 17 per cent stake in the De Grey Mining business. Perhaps when construction costs ease in line \nwith lower inflation, and should the gold price remain strong, there would be a time when the development of \nMcPhillamys - one of Australia's largest undeveloped open-pittable gold deposits - makes financial sense.\nThe final investment decision is slated for late in the 2025 financial year, with two years taken to build.\nPage 2 of 2\nRegis may take the merger road - DATA ROOM\nUntil then, a deal with Gold Road could provide earnings growth in the meantime. It's worth noting that its chief \nexecutive, Jim Beyer, who previously ran Mt Gibson until 2018, is considered to take a conservative approach on \nthe M&A front, but perhaps he has run out of options.\nBut he did purchase a 30 per cent stake in the Tropicana gold mine in 2021. At that time, it went head to head with \nGold Road Resources, which made a final offer that was less than $700m.\nGold mining M&A activity has been hot in recent years due to the soaring commodity price, including a curious \nmove by West Gold and Ramelius Resources to hold merger talks last year before West Gold went on to embark \non a $2.2bn merger with Canada's Karora.\nWorking for Gold Road Resources is advisory firm Gresham, and should there be a deal, the timing could coincide \nwith the Diggers & Dealers event in Kalgoorlie in August, capping off the long run of M&A in the Australian gold \nmining sector.\nWith a $1.7bn market value, a merger of equals could stack up. Elsewhere, 1.6 per cent of Fortescue Metals shares \nwere sold on Monday night for $21.60 a share, a 6 per cent discount to the last close, in a $1bn-odd trade handled \nby JPMorgan. The seller was an Australian institutional investor that was part of a fund clean-up exercise.\nLoad-Date: June 18, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Ramelius Resources.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
