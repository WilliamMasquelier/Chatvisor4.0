We are committed to seeing this matter settled so \nthe Yindjibarndi people can receive the benefits they deserve,\" a Fortescue spokeswoman said.\n\"Fortescue has offered compensation to the Yindjibarndi people in the past, and we continue to be ready to settle \nthis by paying compensation.\"\nThe company refused to answer questions about why Dr Forrest opted to meet Mr Woodley in a public park, and \nwould not discuss whether it had put forward a settlement offer that varied from its standard compensation \nagreements with other traditional owner groups in the Pilbara.\nFortescue, valued at $79 billion, also declined to comment on whether its settlement offer diverged from its legal \narguments made in the Federal Court.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest's meetings in park with YAC over $1b claim\nFortescue has argued any compensation should be funded by the State of Western Australia because it granted \nthe mining tenements covering the traditional lands of the Yindjibarndi. The WA government maintains Fortescue \nshould pay.\nThe Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation is arguing it is entitled to compensation for economic losses estimated by \none expert witness at more than $500 million, and more because it alleges Fortescue destroyed more than 240 \nculturally significant sites - including rock shelters - for which it is also seeking around $500 million.\nIt is also arguing Fortescue divided the community by backing a breakaway group known as the Wirlu-Murra \nYindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation in a novel third element to its legal fight.\nThe scope of potential damages is $1 billion.\nFortescue was left exposed to the compensation claim in 2020 after the High Court denied the company special \nleave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings that in effect meant a large part of its Solomon iron ore mining hub was \nbuilt without permission of traditional owners.\nThe Federal Court had granted exclusive native title over 2700 square kilometres in the iron ore-rich Pilbara. This in \neffect recognises the Yindjibarndi as private owners of the highest legal standing with a spiritual connection that \nallows them to decide who mines the land.",

[AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 16, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has legally destroyed dozens of significant Yindjibarndi cultural sites since mining began at its Solomon hub in 2013, extracting iron ore worth an estimated $50 billion without paying any compensation to the recognised native title holders, raising serious concerns about the company's treatment of Indigenous land rights. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 16, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been accused of causing deep divisions within the Yindjibarndi community by financially backing a breakaway group, Wirlu-Murra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation, which accepted a mining deal in 2010 after reportedly paying people $500 each to vote in favor, leading to lasting social rifts and conflicts among traditional owners. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 16, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has never had an Indigenous land use agreement with the Yindjibarndi people, despite mining on their land for over a decade, leading to a $500 million compensation claim for unpaid royalties, interest, and damages for cultural and spiritual losses, which could result in a significant financial and reputational impact on the company. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 16, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued in court that compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should not be based on the value of the minerals extracted from their land, despite industry standards where native title holders receive a percentage of royalties, raising concerns about the company's approach to Indigenous compensation. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 16, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest held private meetings in a Perth park with Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation leader Michael Woodley in an attempt to settle a billion-dollar compensation case, but the talks failed as the parties remain hundreds of millions of dollars apart, highlighting the ongoing dispute and lack of resolution. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue is facing a potential $1 billion compensation claim from the Yindjibarndi people, including $500 million for economic losses and an additional $500 million for the destruction of more than 240 culturally significant sites, which could have major financial and reputational consequences for the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue was left exposed to the Yindjibarndi compensation claim in 2020 after the High Court denied the company special leave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings, which found that a large part of its Solomon iron ore mining hub was built without permission from traditional owners, raising legal and ethical concerns about its operations. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued that any compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should be funded by the State of Western Australia because it granted the mining tenements, but the WA government maintains that Fortescue should pay, creating further uncertainty over the company's financial liability.
