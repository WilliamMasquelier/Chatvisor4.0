Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 445 words\nHighlight: A month after shedding 700 workers Andrew Forrest's iron ore miner Fortescue has posted an annual \nprofit of $8.4 billion supporting a $2.2 billion pay out to the company founders family's interests.\nBody\nFortescue has beefed up its dividend payout for the full year despite posting a modest jump in profit, handing a \n$2.24 billion windfall to the miner's biggest shareholders Andrew and Nicola Forrest.\nThe iron ore miner on Wednesday posted an underlying net profit of $US5.7 billion ($8.4 billion) for the 12 months \nto June, slightly below forecasts, as it battled higher costs and a slump in iron ore demand from its key customer \nChina. Revenue for the period edged up 8 per cent to $US18.2 billion.\nFortescue received an average of $US103 a tonne for the 192 million tonnes of iron ore it shipped in the financial \nyear, however the price of the steelmaking ingredient has dropped by more than a third since January.\nThe miner announced a final dividend of 89\u00a2 a share, taking its full-year dividends to $1.97 a share (a payout ratio \nof 70 per cent), higher than the payout ratio of 65 per cent a year earlier. Andrew and Nicola Forrest own a 36.7 per \ncent stake in Fortescue.\nLink to Image\nPeter Milne\nThe latest results come as Fortescue has had to re-evaluate its green energy ambitions, cutting 700 jobs in July, \nas it scaled down its plans to become a green hydrogen superpower. The company had earlier set a target of \nproducing 15 million tons of green hydrogen (produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules using \nrenewable energy) a year by 2030.\nFortescue is also more exposed to the dip in iron ore demand, compared to its more diversified rivals - BHP and \nRio Tinto. Iron ore accounts for almost 90 per cent of Fortescue's operating sales revenue.\nJarden's analysts said on Wednesday that while the miner's underlying earnings met consensus expectations, net \nprofit after tax for the year fell short by 10 per cent due to increased depreciation. They added that continued falls in \nthe iron ore price would put the miner's future dividends under pressure, forcing Fortescue to keep a tight leash on \ncosts.\nFortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said the result was the third-highest earning in Fortescue's history.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue dividend delivers for Forrest despite modest profit jump\nMeanwhile, Fortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson said the division had achieved its two final \ninvestment decisions during the year to produce green hydrogen in Arizona and Queensland.\nThe company expects to spend up to $US3.8 billion on capital works in its mining division, and the nascent clean \nenergy business will be funded with about $US700 in operating expenses and $500 million of capital expenditure.\nFortescue shares were trading 1.8 per cent weaker at $18.30 in afternoon trading.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.
