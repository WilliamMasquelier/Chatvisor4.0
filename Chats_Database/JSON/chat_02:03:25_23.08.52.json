            "content": "The media portrayal of Daniel Lerup and Richard Hunter is overwhelmingly negative, framing them as executives ousted from \u00d8rsted amid financial turmoil, massive losses, and restructuring efforts. Their departures are linked to the company's disastrous economic performance, including a \u20ac2.7 billion loss and the cancellation of major offshore wind projects, reinforcing a narrative of failure and mismanagement. In contrast, Ed Miliband receives a more mixed portrayal; while some coverage criticizes his renewable energy policies for increasing household bills and benefiting foreign companies, other reports highlight his role in expanding the UK\u2019s green energy infrastructure. His portrayal is more policy-focused, with both praise and criticism, rather than being personally vilified like Lerup and Hunter.",
