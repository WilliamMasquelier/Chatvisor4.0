Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 3\nLength: 710 words\nByline: Tom Rabe\nBody\nInfluential crossbench MPs say unwinding a lucrative fuel tax credit for major mining companies will be a key \nobjective after the next election, where they could wield the balance of power in a minority government.\nTeal independent Kate Chaney from the mining state of Western Australia is working to build support in parliament \nfor changes to the diesel fuel tax credit system for big miners, and aims to pursue the reforms in future parliaments \nif she's re-elected.\nShe already has the backing of several east-coast colleagues, including Wentworth MP Allegra Spender and \nindependent ACT senator David Pocock, who have confirmed they will pursue an overhaul to the tax credit system \nafter the next election.\n\"This will stay on the agenda... it creates headwinds for decarbonisation that we can't afford to have when we need \nto make sure Australia doesn't get left behind,\" Ms Chaney told The Australian Financial Review.\nMs Spender said a minority government scenario could prove the best opportunity to pursue bold economic reform, \nand agreed the fuel credits should be linked to decarbonisation efforts for major miners.\n\"I know that Kate is passionate about this, and so am I,\" Ms Spender said.\n\"We need to have long-term reform in the tax system and the diesel fuel rebate is an example of that.\n\"There is an opportunity for broader economic reform that I would certainly back that would be sympathetic to what \nminers are seeking as well.\"\nThe diesel fuel excise levied on drivers at the bowser covers the costs of maintaining public roads, but companies \ncan claim a tax credit when the fuel is used on private roads, including mine sites.\nIron ore and coal miners received about $2.3 billion of the diesel fuel tax credits paid out in 2020- 2021, according \nto Parliamentary Budget Office figures, which amounted to about a third of the overall amount paid.\nPage 2 of 2\nCrossbench eyes tax credit overhaul Exclusive\nThe independent MPs argue the fuel credit system is undermining decarbonisation in the resources sector, and \nmajor miners should only be provided credits if they spend it on efforts to reduce their carbon emissions.\nSenator Pocock said the tax credits amounted to \"a fossil fuel subsidy\" for major miners.\n\"It is locking in the use of diesel because if you stop using diesel, you stop getting the fuel tax credits. Let's reshape \nit and tie it to decarbonisation,\" he said.\nAs polls suggest the Albanese government is at risk of losing its majority in the next federal election, due by May, \nthe support of independent MPs could prove crucial for any future government.\nBut Federal Resources Minister Madeleine King said there was no appetite to overhaul the tax credit system, which \nwas critical for farmers.\n\"We are not changing the diesel fuel rebate. Farmers and miners get the rebate for vehicles that only operate on \nprivate roads that are not funded by the taxpayer,\" she said.\nThe crossbench foray into the debate comes just weeks after mining giant Fortescue also advocated for fuel tax \ncredits to be tied to decarbonisation efforts, putting it at odds with its competitors and paving the way for a potential \nfight within the resources industry.\nMs Chaney said she had spoken with Fortescue representatives about the reforms, and that the credit should \nremain in place for farmers. She said any company that claims less than $50 million should receive the original \ncredit, which would capture most farmers.\nMinerals Council of Australia chief executive Tania Constable pushed back at Fortescue and Ms Chaney's \nsuggestions, saying removing the credits would weaken the economy.\n\"We already have effective mechanisms to reduce emissions; tinkering with our tax system won't help us achieve \nthese goals,\" she said.\nTeal independent member for Warringah Zali Steggall agreed with her crossbench colleagues that the credits \nshould not be taken away from farmers, but said miners should not receive them at all, regardless of whether they \nwere tied to decarbonisation efforts.\nSenator Pocock accused mining companies of hiding behind farmers on the issue, given agriculture had more \nsocial capital than the resources sector.\nThe Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, which counts Fortescue as well as Rio Tinto, BHP and \nHancock Prospecting as members said it did not support changes to the tax credit system.\nLoad-Date: November 6, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
