The company had been consistently increasing shareholder payouts since 2016, but due to financial struggles, it has decided to halt these payments to focus on investments without raising additional capital. This move could negatively impact investor confidence and stock performance, as dividends are a key attraction for shareholders. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company has suffered a major financial setback, reporting an EBITDA of 18.7 billion Danish kroner (\u20ac2.5 billion) for 2023, which is below its projected range of 20-23 billion kroner. A significant portion of this shortfall is attributed to a 9.6 billion kroner provision for cancellation costs related to the termination of the Ocean Wind 1 project in the U.S. This financial underperformance highlights the challenges \u00d8rsted faces in managing its offshore wind projects profitably. [El Economista, Violeta N.

Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s market capitalization has plummeted by more than 70% since its peak in early 2021, when it was valued at over \u20ac76.5 billion. The company, once the third-largest utility in Europe, now ranks 14th in the sector, with a market value of just \u20ac16 billion. This dramatic decline underscores the financial instability and investor concerns surrounding the company. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has incurred massive financial losses, posting around \u00a32.2 billion in losses for 2023.

These economic pressures have made it more difficult for the company to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s financial troubles have led analysts to speculate that it may need to seek additional funding from investors. However, instead of raising capital, \u00d8rsted has opted for cost-cutting measures, which could prolong financial uncertainty and increase risks for the company\u2019s future stability. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to implement a drastic austerity plan, including a comprehensive review of its project portfolio.

The failure to complete these projects raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. [de Volkskrant, Marc van Den Eerenbeemt, February 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles have forced it to sell off assets worth 15 billion euros in an effort to stabilize its balance sheet. This asset divestment strategy indicates the severity of the company\u2019s financial difficulties and its need to generate liquidity. However, selling off key assets could weaken \u00d8rsted\u2019s long-term growth potential and reduce its influence in the offshore wind sector. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]\n\n- The company has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have significantly increased the costs of its wind farm projects.

[Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s leadership has been in turmoil, with its chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company\u2019s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning, further complicating \u00d8rsted\u2019s efforts to recover from its financial difficulties. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024] - \u00d8rsted experienced a leadership crisis in late 2023, with the abrupt dismissal of its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Daniel Lerup and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Richard Hunter following a disastrous financial year. The company suffered a massive loss of \u20ac2.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to high write-offs from abandoned offshore wind projects on the U.S. East Coast. This leadership shake-up reflects the severity of \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles and raises concerns about stability at the top levels of management. Frequent executive turnover can disrupt strategic planning and investor confidence. [Energie & Management, Volker Stephan, February 27, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to divest a significant stake in its U.S. onshore wind farms, selling off equity ownership in four wind farms with a total capacity of 957 MW for approximately $300 million. This marks the company\u2019s second major asset divestment in the U.S., highlighting its need to generate liquidity amid financial difficulties.

This investment comes at a time when \u00d8rsted\u2019s stock price has significantly declined due to project cancellations, rising costs, and financial impairments. While Equinor frames the acquisition as a strategic move to expand its renewable energy portfolio, the purchase highlights \u00d8rsted\u2019s weakened financial position and vulnerability to external takeovers. The deal also raises concerns about the increasing influence of fossil fuel companies in the renewable energy sector.

These losses stem from delays and the abandonment of key offshore wind projects, further exacerbating the company\u2019s financial instability. The company\u2019s ambitious goal of expanding its renewable energy capacity to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030 is now under pressure, as financial constraints force it to scale back investments.

Het bedrijf zette enkele \njaren geleden de transitie van fossiel naar duurzaam in en ontwikkelde zich daarna tot 's werelds grootste \nproducent van windstroom op zee. Sinds 2021, toen de beurskoers even hoog was gestegen als veel van de \nreuzenwindturbines die het concern liet bouwen, heeft het aandeel Orsted volgens berekeningen van Reuters 83 \nprocent van zijn waarde verloren.\nNa de pandemie en de Russische inval in Oekra\u00efne kampte Orsted net als de rest van de Europese windsector \nmet hoge rentes, dure grondstoffen en kostbaar personeel. Waar veel reguliere energieconcerns weer meer \naandacht kregen voor fossiele brandstoffen en daar flink aan verdienden, stapelde Orsted verlies op verlies. De \nafgelopen weken volgde een nieuwe dreun, nadat de Amerikaanse president Donald Trump zijn banvloek had \nuitgesproken over Amerikaanse offshore windenergie. Orsted zag zich gedwongen een afschrijving op zijn \nAmerikaanse activiteiten te plegen van 1,7 miljard dollar (1,6 miljard euro). Daarop verloor de beurskoers nog eens \n17 procent.\nOok heeft Orsted zijn plannen in de koelkast gezet voor investeringen ter waarde van 20 miljard dollar in de \nAmerikaanse windsector.

Hij wordt vervangen door financieel directeur Rasmus Errboe. Nipper liet vrijdag weten \ndat hij gepassioneerd blijft over het idee de wereld volledig te laten draaien op duurzame energie.

Der Gewinn f\u00fcr 2024 liegt im erwarteten Rahmen.\nOrsted weist wieder Gewinn aus. Das Jahr 2024 beendet der weltgr\u00f6\u00dfte Betreiber von Offshore-Windparks mit \nrund 2,2 Milliarden Euro auf der Habenseite. Das aktuelle Ergebnis der D\u00e4nen ist auch eine Folge von \nKurskorrekturen und \u00c4nderungen im Management nach einem desastr\u00f6sen Jahr 2023 mit 2,7 Milliarden Euro \nVerlust.\nDas seit Februar von CEO Rasmus Errboe gef\u00fchrte Unternehmen lenkt in einer Mitteilung vom 6. Februar den Blick \nbesonders auf das operative Gesch\u00e4ft (Ebitda). Dieses war auch 2023 noch positiv verlaufen (2,5 Milliarden Euro), \ndas Gesamtminus war damals auf das Konto von Abschreibungen auf aufgegebene Offshore-Projekte in den USA \nund Wertberichtigungen gegangen. Der operative Gewinn liegt jetzt bei 4,3 Milliarden Euro (plus 1,8 Milliarden \nEuro).\nIn diesen Bereich fallen allerdings auch Einnahmen aus R\u00fcckstellungen, die Orsted nach dem Aus von Projekten \naufl\u00f6sen konnte. Dies sind f\u00fcr 2024 rund 1 Million Euro. Ohne Erl\u00f6se aus neue Partnerschaften und \nR\u00fccktrittskosten kommen die D\u00e4nen auf ein Ebitda von etwa 3,3 Milliarden Euro und damit 700 Millionen Euro \nh\u00f6her als 2023. Der Wert liege genau im Rahmen der Erwartungen, die mit 3,2 Milliarden bis 3,4 Milliarden Euro \nbeziffert waren.\nDie Ertr\u00e4ge aus dem Offshore-Segment entwickelten sich leicht positiv auf 3,2 Milliarden Euro, der Anstieg betr\u00e4gt \nknapp eine halbe Milliarde Euro. Orsted schreibt dies vor allem den neu in Betrieb genommenen \nMeereswindfarmen in Taiwan, in den USA und in der deutschen Nordsee zu (Gode Wind 3, nordwestlich der Insel \nNorderney).\nPage 2 of 2\nKurskorrektur bei Orsted bringt die erwarteten Ergebnisse\nAbgesagte und verz\u00f6gerte Meereswindparks vor den USA, erschwerte Bedingungen f\u00fcr die Windindustrie und die \nAufgabe der E-Fuels-Produktion hatten Orsted zu einer einschneidenden Kurskorrektur veranlasst (wir \nberichteten). Vom Ausbaupfad bis 2030, der auf eine installierte Leistung von 50.000 MW hinauslaufen sollte, sind \nnoch rund 38.000 MW \u00fcbrig.

Een grote opdracht voor het \nNederlandse Van Oord staat daardoor onder druk. De maritiem dienstverlener won in 2022 het contract voor de \nontwikkeling van de offshoreparken. \nGisterochtend maakte Mitsubishi bekend dat het 52,2 mrd yen (\u20ac330 mln) moet afschrijven op de parken. Ook \nworden de bouwplannen 'herzien vanwege economische veranderingen'. De markt voor offshorewind is veranderd \nna de corona- en energiecrisis, door inflatie, een krappe toeleveringsketen en stijgende rentes, zegt Mitsubishi. Ook \nChubu, een groot Japans energiebedrijf, kondigt een afschrijving aan op de parken van 18 mrd yen (\u20ac110 mln).  \nVan Oord ontwikkelt de Japanse parken met een van zijn installatieschepen. Het levert alle ondersteunende \ncomponenten die nodig zijn voor de bouw, behalve de windturbines. Van Oord doet dat in een joint venture met de \ngrootste bouwgroep van Japan, Kajima. Het is de eerste klus van dit formaat in Japan, zei het bedrijf in 2022. Van \nOord heeft Mitsubishi ondersteund in de beginfase van de projecten, maar de daadwerkelijke bouw moet nog van \nstart gaan. Hoeveel het contract waard is en of Van Oord een annuleringboete heeft bedongen, is niet bekend. Van \nOord wil geen commentaar geven en verwijst naar Mitsubishi.  De dochteronderneming van de Japanse automaker \nkondigde in 2021 de bouw aan van twee parken in Noord-Japan en \u00e9\u00e9n voor de kust van Tokio.

            "content": "- \u00d8rsted has suffered a significant financial setback due to the slow permitting process in the U.S., which led to rising construction costs and uncertainty over tax benefits. As a result, the company was forced to write off \u20ac4 billion on its U.S. projects. To mitigate financial losses, \u00d8rsted has implemented drastic cost-cutting measures, including suspending dividend payments until at least 2025 and laying off 800 employees. These actions reflect the severe financial strain the company is under and raise concerns about its long-term viability in the U.S. market. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Orla Mcdonald, February 01, 2025]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s CEO, Mads Nipper, has been ousted after overseeing an 80% collapse in the company\u2019s share price, which resulted in \u00a348 billion being wiped off its market value. The company has struggled with rising costs, supply chain disruptions, higher interest rates, and regulatory changes, particularly in the U.S. market. The leadership change signals a desperate attempt to restore investor confidence, but it also highlights the instability at the top levels of management. [The Daily Mail, Geoff Ho, February 01, 2025]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to cut hundreds of jobs and withdraw from several international markets due to financial difficulties. The company has also warned that it may build 1,500 fewer wind turbines than originally planned, which could slow the global transition to renewable energy. These drastic measures highlight the severe financial strain \u00d8rsted is under and raise concerns about its long-term viability in the offshore wind industry. [The Daily Telegraph, James Warrington, February 01, 2025]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has announced fresh writedowns of 12.1 billion Danish kroner (\u00a31.4 billion) on its U.S. business, citing rising interest rates and market uncertainties. This latest financial blow follows a series of impairments and project cancellations, further eroding investor confidence. The company\u2019s stock has already lost more than 80% of its value since its peak in 2021, reflecting deep concerns about its financial stability. [The Daily Telegraph, James Warrington, February 01, 2025]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s offshore wind expansion strategy in the U.S. has turned into a financial disaster, with the company writing off \u20ac1.6 billion due to project delays and regulatory setbacks. The Sunrise Wind project, located off the coast of New York, has been particularly affected by supply chain disruptions and rising interest rates, leading to significant financial losses. This failure underscores the risks associated with large-scale offshore wind investments in an uncertain regulatory environment. [de Volkskrant, Bard van de Weijer, February 01, 2025]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s decision to expand aggressively into the U.S. offshore wind market has backfired, with the company now facing major financial losses and project cancellations. The return of Donald Trump to the presidency has resulted in a freeze on new offshore wind permits, effectively halting \u00d8rsted\u2019s expansion plans. The company has already written down \u20ac1.6 billion in assets and faces the possibility that key projects like Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind may never be completed. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Orla Mcdonald, February 01, 2025]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s stock price has plummeted by 80% from its peak in 2021 due to a combination of rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory uncertainty. The company\u2019s financial troubles have been exacerbated by inflation, higher interest rates, and difficulties in securing long-term contracts for its renewable energy projects. These challenges have forced \u00d8rsted to scale back its ambitions and reconsider its investment strategy. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Orla Mcdonald, February 01, 2025]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has announced a 25% reduction in planned investments by 2030 as part of its efforts to recover from financial difficulties. The company\u2019s previous CEO, Mads Nipper, oversaw an 80% decline in share value due to rising interest rates and the end of the green stock boom. This drastic cut in investment raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to maintain its leadership in the offshore wind sector and meet its renewable energy targets. [Business World Agency, Anonymous, February 06, 2025]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to abandon several offshore wind projects due to financial difficulties, leading to a significant reduction in its renewable energy capacity targets. The company had originally planned to install 50 GW of capacity by 2030 but has now scaled this back to 38 GW, effectively cutting a quarter of its expansion plans. This retreat from its ambitious goals raises concerns about the company\u2019s ability to contribute to the global transition to renewable energy.
