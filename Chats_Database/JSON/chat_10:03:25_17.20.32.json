A giant new mill is currently being built at Kalgoorlie's revamped Super Pit.\nPage 2 of 2\nAs gold bounces higher, upgrades abound among stocks\n\"The upgrades for the mid-cap producers are mixed. Lower cost producers Capricorn and Ramelius see modest \nupgrades of 13 per cent and 15 per cent for FY25, while Bellevue's earnings forecast rises 19 per cent,\" Bairstow \nand Streater say.\n\"Higher-cost producers and companies that have recently completed acquisitions that carry higher depreciation \nunderpin higher upgrades.\" African producers Perseus Mining and West African Resources have seen 20 per cent \nand 13 per cent jumps in their price targets, with a number of explorers in Western Australia also seeing their price \ntargets lifted. Earnings upgrades for FY25 and FY26 are 26 per cent and 35 per cent respectively for the cohort, \nwith FY26-27 upgrades of 69-78 per cent for Perseus and 61-63 per cent for West African Resources.\nThere are some recommendation upgrades here as well. Ramelius, Bellevue and Ora Banda have all been moved \nfrom hold to buy, taking the bulk of the Australian gold sector into buy territory.\nSpartan Resources, which has risen 225 per cent over the past year as the remarkably high grades of its Never \nNever and Peppers discoveries near Mt Magnet were revealed, has been moved from a hold to a spec buy with a \n$1.55 price target.\nBairstow and Streater say their preference is for stocks with \"strong organic growth potential\", led by Genesis \nMinerals, Westgold and Capricon, with Genesis and Capricorn's five-year CAGR of 20 per cent doubling the rest of \ntheir coverage universe.\nThey say there remains strong value across the sector, with De Grey Mining, and African development plays WIA \nGold and Tolu Minerals also key picks.\n\"Our bullish outlook for the yellow metal and material upgrades to our earnings outlook underpins our shift to a \npositive view across all stocks in the sector,\" Bairstow and Streater say.\nThe bullish new gold sector upgrade from Argonaut comes after Streater initiated coverage on Turaco Gold on the \nback of a site visit at the Afema project in Cote d'Ivoire. Since acquiring the site in November last year, drilling has \nunderpinned a maiden resource of 2.52 million ounces at 1.2 grams per tonne. Argonaut has placed a spec buy \nrating and 49c valuation on the $240m junior, which plans to complete a pre-feasibility study by the first half of 2026 \nat Afema.\nFormerly in the portfolio of African gold giant Endeavour Mining, Turaco purchased its majority 51 per cent stake \nlast year, with the right to move to 70 per cent once the PFS is complete for the payment of $US8.75m in cash and \n$46.5m to JV partner Sodim.\nStreater says Argonaut estimates $425m of pre-production capex and working capital requirements will be needed, \nwith Turaco likely to move to a 100 per cent ownership level, converting Sodim's minority interest to a 2 per cent \nNSR royalty.\nThe Cote d'Ivoire government would take a 10 per cent free-carried interest in the project with a five-year tax \nholiday, 0.9 per cent NSR royalty to state miner Sodemi and 6.5 per cent state royalty on gold sales over \n$US2000/oz.

Ramelius Resources has received a modest earnings upgrade of 13% for FY25, reflecting the company's position as a lower-cost producer in the current favorable gold pricing environment.\n2. The stock has been upgraded from a \"hold\" to a \"buy\" recommendation by Argonaut, indicating a positive shift in market sentiment towards Ramelius Resources amidst rising gold prices.\n3. The overall bullish outlook for gold, driven by factors such as inflation and rising US government debt, is expected to benefit Ramelius Resources, aligning with the broader trend of upgrades across the Australian gold sector.\n4. Despite the positive upgrades, Ramelius Resources' growth potential is considered modest compared to higher-growth peers, as highlighted by Argonaut's preference for stocks with stronger organic growth potential.",
