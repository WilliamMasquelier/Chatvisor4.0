Focus on how the article portrays Cisco in terms of its actions, reputation, performance, and impact. The tone should be categorized as one of the following:\n\nPositive: The article reflects well on Cisco, highlighting favorable aspects.\nNeutral: The article presents information about Cisco in a balanced, objective manner without any strong positive or negative bias.\nNegative: The article is critical of Cisco, highlighting challenges, controversies, failures, or unfavorable developments.\n\nProvide the final tone assessment as \"Positive,\" \"Neutral,\" or \"Negative.\"\n\nHere is the article content: Page 1 of 2\nCisco finalises $42bn Splunk buy\nCisco finalises $42bn Splunk buy\nThe Australian\nMarch 20, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: WSJ; Pg. 21\nLength: 480 words\nByline: Stephen Rosenbush\nBody\nCisco Systems has completed its $US28bn ($42.8bn) all-cash acquisition of cyber security and analytics company \nSplunk.\nThe deal, the largest in Cisco's history, was closed months earlier than projected, reflecting the extraordinary effort \nmany companies are undertaking as they remake their businesses around data and artificial intelligence.\nCisco chief executive Chuck Robbins and former Splunk CEO Gary Steele - now an executive vice-president at \nCisco - said in an interview that AI would be deeply woven into the combined companies, and that they saw no hint \nthat the current wave of business AI adoption was going to slow down or reverse course.\nThe combined company will use AI to help customers draw correlations in intelligence coming from different vendor \nplatforms, so that they can take a more predictive approach to cyber security. While that predictive capability has \nbeen developing for some time, the company also plans to launch more capabilities that make use of generative AI \nto simplify their software and make it easier for people without technical training to operate the tools.\nSplunk, launched in 2003, developed a dashboard that allows users to search, monitor and analyse machine-\ngenerated data. It takes training to use it and generative AI helps reduce the learning curve, according to Mr Steele. \n\"Splunk has its own proprietary language, the way in which you issue commands, and you have to be reasonably \ntechnical to do that,\" he said.\n\"With the AI assistance that we've launched, you can use English language to automatically generate that \nproprietary language. You can get outcomes without having all the advanced knowledge.\" Splunk's AI would benefit \nfrom Cisco's massive amounts of data, not to mention its global presence and sales and marketing channels, Mr \nSteele said.\nGenerative AI will have other applications across Cisco's business, such as simplifying the complex task of setting \na configuration screen for a company's security policy, according to Mr Robbins. \"It's very technical. We're going to \nenable our customers to just use English language to describe what security capabilities they would like \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and \nthen we will translate that into a policy that they would review,\" he said.\nPage 2 of 2\nCisco finalises $42bn Splunk buy\nThe software will function as an assistant, simplifying and speeding up the deployment of security policy and other \nresources without replacing human operators, according to Mr Robbins.\nWhen the deal was announced in September 2023, the companies said it expected it to be completed by the end of \nSeptember 2024. The process was completed in roughly half a year. Last week, the European Union gave the deal \nunconditional antitrust approval, after regulators found it wouldn't pose barriers to competition. Networking \nequipment pioneer Cisco, founded in 1984, rode the telecommunications boom of the 1990s. It was for a time the \nmost valuable company in the world.\nLoad-Date: March 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should solely be one of these three words based on your assessment: \"Positive\", \"Neutral\", or \"Negative\". Nothing else\n                ",
