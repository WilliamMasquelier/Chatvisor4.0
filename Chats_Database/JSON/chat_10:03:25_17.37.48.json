The broader All Ordinaries index fared slightly \nworse, shedding 1.4 per cent to close at 8033.6 points.\nThe dollar was flat against the greenback, buying US65.19c.\nOvernight on Tuesday, Wall Street stocks slipped amid growing doubts that Federal Reserve chairman Jerome \nPowell has done enough to tame inflation following hotter than expect job vacancies and factory output data.\nWhile Fed policymakers reaffirmed their view that it would cut rates three times this year, bond traders trimmed their \nrate bet on rate cuts to only two, while yields on US 10-year treasuries rose five basis points to 4.36 per cent.\nNabTrade director of investor behaviour Gemma Dale said the recent pullback in the expected timing and speed of \nrate cuts by the US central bank was helping to cement the view that the Reserve Bank would keep interest rates \nhigher for longer.\n\"We tend to adopt a similar mentality here, particularly because our rates are still currently lower,\" Ms Dale said.\n\"There's no reason for the RBA to rush.\" After the benchmark had hit record highs at the end of the March quarter, \nWednesday's sell-off had also been motivated by profit-taking, Ms Dale added.\n\"Cash is looking extremely healthy at the moment \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 that's a clear sign for investors that they're going to put a little \nbit aside at this point in time,\" she said.\nPage 2 of 2\nFaltering US rate hopes hit ASX\nLocally, technology stocks were the biggest laggards on the benchmark index, diving 3.9 per cent, as sector \nheavyweights Wise-Tech tumbled 5 per cent to $90.20, and Xero dropped 5.7 per cent to $125.01, while \nTechnologyOne shed 2.6 per cent to $16.32.\nThe real estate sector also finished sharply lower, falling 3.2 per cent, with losses led by Charter Hall, which fell 4.6 \nper cent to $13.01, Vicinity Centres, down 4.8 per cent at $2, and Scentre off 3.6 per cent at $3.26.\nInvestors flocked to gold miners, as the safe haven commodity traded at a record high above $US2288 an ounce, \nwhile oil stocks also benefited as Brent crude prices neared just shy of $US89 a barrel amid escalating conflict in \nthe Middle East.\nIn corporate news, shares in Ramelius Resources added 5.3 per cent to $1.905 after the gold miner posted \nquarterly production of 86,928 ounces, eclipsing its previously issued guidance of up to 77,500 ounces.\nRival gold miner Westgold plunged 14.8 per cent to $2.36 after it revised its production guidance for the 2023-24 \nfinancial year to between 220,000 and 230,000 tonnes.\nKaroon Energy was flat at $2.18 after it bolstered its forecast capital expenditure to $117m-$134m, up from $50m-\n$57m.\nSantos fell 0.13 per cent to $7.83, while fellow energy major Woodside gained 0.03 per cent to $30.51.
