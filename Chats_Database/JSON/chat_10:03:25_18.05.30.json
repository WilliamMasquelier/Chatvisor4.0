This is not an exhaustive list, but rather a \nglimpse into the varied and multifaceted careers these leaders excel in, from corporate boardrooms to grassroots \nenterprises\nColleen Hayward AM Colleen Hayward's appointment as an independent non-executive director at Mineral \nResources (MinRes) is more than just a boardroom position, it's a testament to the company's commitment to \nmeaningful Indigenous engagement and leadership.\nAs a highly respected Noongar Elder from Western Australia with extensive experience across health, education, \nand community development, Hayward brings a unique and invaluable perspective to the operations of Mineral \nResources.\nThroughout her life, Hayward has been resolute about the importance of authentic engagement with Aboriginal \npeople.\n\"Every bit of business that happens in this country happens on Aboriginal land,\" she points out, underscoring the \nneed for businesses to recognise and respect this reality by engaging meaningfully with traditional owners and \nIndigenous communities.\nThis mission is evident in MinRes' procurement strategy, which has seen an extraordinary increase in spending with \nIndigenous-owned businesses.\nFrom just $2.6m in FY21, the company's engagement skyrocketed to $68m in FY24, benefiting 44 Indigenous \nbusinesses.\nThis growth is not just about meeting targets; it's about fostering real, sustainable economic development.\nPage 2 of 5\nThe game changers\n\"It's not procurement for procurement's sake,\" Hayward explains. \"It's about partnering with the most capable \nindividuals to deliver the services we require.\" MinRes' approach goes beyond transactional relationships, with a \nrange of program in place to support Indigenous businesses through initiatives such as Business Startup Grants, \ntailored finance solutions through dedicated finance facilities, and in-house support for business set-up and \nsustainable growth.\nThe impact of these efforts is perhaps best illustrated by the personal stories that emerge from MinRes' \ncollaborations. Hayward shares one particularly inspiring example: \"I was at a lunch recently, and there were a \ncouple of the traditional owners there \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and they were over the moon in terms of their personal experience. In 10 \nmonths, because of their engagement with MinRes they were buying their own house, and they had never been \nable to do that before.\" This story, one of many, underscores the transformative potential of MinRes' strategic \nsupport for Indigenous businesses, enabling them to achieve economic stability and growth in ways that have a \nprofound impact on the broader community.\nDespite these achievements, Hayward acknowledges that there is still a long way to go, particularly in increasing \nIndigenous representation at the highest levels in corporate Australia.\nCurrently, there are only four Indigenous directors on ASX 300 boards. This figure starkly contrasts with the \nincreased public sentiment calling for greater Indigenous involvement.\n\"People don't know the skills and expertise that we can bring \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and when you don't know, you get a bit scared. \nFear breeds paralysis. But it's actually time, in this country, for everyone to be a bit brave,\" she says.\nIt's clear that companies like MinRes continue to make bold steps to address this disparity across the country, and \nin so doing not only enhance their own governance and community engagement but also lead by example for \nothers to follow. Hayward's leadership at MinRes serves as a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when \nIndigenous voices are not just included but are actively shaping the future of corporate Australia.\nMike Westerman Glencore Copper industrial lead Mike Westerman oversees a global workforce of 30,000 \nemployees. His formative years growing up on sheep and cattle stations, combined with his education in the Tom \nPrice community in the Pilbara, gave him a first-hand introduction to the mining industry and shaped his leadership \nstyle. Drawing on his rural and Indigenous heritage, Westerman emphasises the importance of fostering strong \nrelationships at both grassroots and corporate levels. In discussing the First Nations business landscape, he \nhighlights that true success lies in the ability to add value and deliver tangible results, affirming that dedication and \neffectiveness can drive achievement in any endeavour.\n\"My career has involved a fair bit of sacrifice, including living in places others wouldn't and taking on responsibilities \nothers didn't want. There have also been some risks involved, such as moving to new locations or taking on \nchallenging jobs. And, of course, a bit of luck - being in the right place at the right time and showing up when \nneeded.\"\nGordon Cole Noongar man and Cole Supplies chief executive Gordon Cole has a strong entrepreneurial spirit that \nhas led him to work across various industries within the Indigenous business sector. Since co-founding the \nIndigenous-owned wholesaler in 2013, specialising in workwear, safety, health, medical and industrial products, \nCole has held key roles, including board director at First Australians Capital and chair of the Noongar Chamber of \nCommerce and Industry. He describes the Indigenous business sector as vibrant, healthy and on an unprecedented \ngrowth trajectory.\n\"I've really enjoyed my time in business and have started to explore further opportunities for our sector in business, \ntrade and investment, where we aim to scale up and become greater participants in the economy.\"\nWayne Bergmann Wayne Bergmann is the managing director of Leedal Pty Ltd, where he focuses on fostering \neconomic independence and opportunities for Aboriginal communities in the Kimberley region. He previously \nserved as the CEO of the Kimberley Land Council, negotiating multibillion-dollar native title agreement. He is \nexecutive chair of the National Indigenous Times and Professor of Practice at the University of NSW.Page 3 of 5\nThe game changers\nA published author, Bergmann's strategic leadership has driven commercial success by advocating for Indigenous \nbusiness participation, securing significant investments and facilitating partnerships that empower Aboriginal people \nto achieve economic self-sufficiency.\n\"All my life in business I have been told 'you can't do that', such as with the National Indigenous Times. To see the \nthings that I've put effort into, in the Indigenous space, where it has failed in the past, and to see it become \nsuccessful, has become an incredible feeling to make things happen that no one else believed could happen. With \ngrit and determination you can do anything.\" \"Business has been a single value of my whole life. Working for a \nliving. But for the first 30 years, most of my life was about social justice and the biggest challenge was pivoting and \nfinding the balance between that mission and being an entrepreneur.\"\nNoel Pearson Hailing from the Guugu Yimidhirr community of Hope Vale on the southeastern Cape York Peninsula, \nNoel Pearson is a prominent Indigenous lawyer, academic and activist who founded the Cape York Partnership in \n2004. The non-profit organisation focuses on empowering Indigenous families and communities to pursue lives of \nvalue, freedom and prosperity. Pearson has long championed Indigenous self-determination and economic \ndevelopment, with a focus on tackling systemic inequalities and promoting practical solutions for community \nempowerment. His influential work has shaped national discussions on reconciliation, Indigenous policy reform and \neconomic participation. Recently, Pearson was appointed to the board of Fortescue Metals Group, further \nextending his influence into corporate leadership and the resource sector.\nAmanda Healy Under Amanda Healy's leadership, Warrikal has become one of Australia's most successful \nIndigenous-owned engineering companies, providing significant employment and training opportunities for \nIndigenous people in the resources sector.\nSimultaneously, as CEO of Kirrikin, she champions Indigenous artists by transforming their works into globally \nrecognised fashion statements, bridging culture and commerce.\nHealy has spoken extensively about her leadership journey, and the impact she aims to make through her \nbusinesses. Reflecting on her early career in the mining industry, she notes she had to be tough to succeed in a \nmale-dominated environment, but she has always focused on building strong relationships with both employees and \ntraditional owners. She emphasises the importance of leading by example and leveraging entrepreneurship to \nsupport Indigenous artists and communities, such as through Kirrikin, her luxury fashion brand that returns profits to \nthe artists and supports small Indigenous businesses.\nAt Warrikal, Healy aims to provide opportunities for Indigenous workers and has grown the company to a significant \nsize with a diverse workforce. She acknowledges the challenges in achieving a 20 per cent Indigenous workforce \ntarget but remains committed to expanding opportunities for Indigenous participation in the industry. Healy is also \npassionate about using her platform to address the lack of generational wealth among Indigenous communities, a \nchallenge she has personally faced and strives to overcome through her business ventures.\nAmanda is clear on the future when it comes to Indigenous business leaders: \"We need to have a bigger say in it \nand we're never going to get there unless we are taken seriously, unless people start to see us functioning and \noperating at the highest possible level, and understand that we're just as smart as everyone.\"\nBen Wyatt Renowned as the first Indigenous treasurer (WA) for any Australian state or territory and the first \nIndigenous person appointed to the board of an ASX-200 company, Yamatji man Ben Wyatt continues to be a \nsignificant force in economic reforms and fiscal management. Speaking on the positive growth within the \nIndigenous business landscape, Wyatt highlights the increasing opportunity for Indigenous entrepreneurs. In his \ncurrent role as an independent non-executive director on the boards of Rio Tinto and Woodside Energy, he \nemphasises that the resources sector can play a pivotal role by ensuring Indigenous communities are included in \neconomic opportunities through partnerships, procurement and investment in Indigenous-owned businesses.\nDaniel Tucker AM Wongatha and Mirning man Daniel Tucker AM founded and sits at the helm of Carey Group, a \nFirst Nations mining, construction and training company, as its managing director. With more than 30 years of \nexperience in the mining industry and a background in senior executive roles within ASX-listed companies, Tucker Page 4 of 5\nThe game changers\nestablished the Carey Education Trust in 2007 to support Aboriginal education. Honoured with an Order of Australia \nMedal in 2020, he is a prominent champion for reconciliation, cultural preservation and community development. \nTucker continues to advocate for greater investment in Indigenous-led education and the need to address systemic \ninequalities within Indigenous communities.\nAdam Goodes Former AFL legend, two-time premiership winner and dual Brownlow Medallist Adam Goodes is a \nproud Adnyamathanha and Narungga man, celebrated for his contributions both on and off the field. Known for his \nstrong advocacy for Indigenous rights and anti-racism efforts, Goodes has shifted his focus to community work \nsince retiring from football. In 2009, he co-founded the GO Foundation, which supports Indigenous youth through \neducation initiatives. Goodes believes education is the key to a better future, which inspired the foundation's launch.\nSharna Collard Balladong and Wilmen woman Sharna Collard's leadership journey began in 2015 with the launch \nof Australia's first Indigenous-led and owned fleet company, Kooya. As the current chief executive, Collard reflects \non the family-run enterprise's mission to address the critical need for Indigenous-owned businesses in the fleet \nsector.\n\"We diversified into the fleet sector with Kooya because there were no other Aboriginal businesses in this space. \nRecognising this untapped market gave us the confidence to fulfil this need,\" she explains.\nCollard, alongside her father Kim, who initially served as chief executive before transitioning to chair, have been \ninstrumental in driving the company's growth. Starting as fleet manager, Collard quickly showcased her potential, \nadvancing to general manager in 2018 and assuming the top role a year later.\n\"I've grown with the business and now understand every facet of it,\" she says. \"'The importance of Aboriginal \nleadership in business cannot be overstated. While Aboriginal ownership is crucial, effective management and \nleadership are essential for maintaining the company's cultural integrity.\" Reflecting on Kooya's early challenges, \nCollard admits it wasn't an easy start. \"I don't mind admitting it was certainly trying,\" she says.\n\"There was some hesitance from businesses to engage with Kooya because we are in the professional and \nfinancial services sectors, where Aboriginal businesses are under-represented.\" Despite these initial obstacles, \nKooya quickly established itself in the market. \"Kooya has stood the test of time, and now, looking at our customer \nbase, we have a series of blue-chip clients, including Fortescue, BHP, Telstra and Chevron,\" Collard says.\nFortescue began its partnership with Kooya in 2018, initially leasing services for 34 assets on a single mine site. At \nthe end of last year, the contract was renewed and expanded to include 110 electric Tuatara Ultra Terrain Vehicles \nfor Fortescue's Pilbara sites. Kooya now manages leasing activities across three mine sites for Fortescue: \nSolomon, Eliwana and Iron Bridge.\n\"The key to the success between Kooya and Fortescue has been incremental growth. It began as a small \nopportunity, which required Kooya to prove our worth by providing excellent customer service and be competitive, \nas is often the case in business,\" Collard says.\nShe highlights that the partnership is built on a shared mission to drive Fortescue's decarbonisation goals.\n\"There is a strong synergy and alignment between First Nation businesses and our commitment to decarbonisation. \nOver the past 12 months, we executed the exclusive master decarbonisation contract with Fortescue, allowing us \nto work closely with them towards their decarbonisation objectives.\" Beyond business, Collard's leadership is \ndeeply connected to social impact. The Bibbulmun Fund, established in 2014, channels 5 per cent of Kooya's net \nprofits into community initiatives. The fund supports leadership and entrepreneurship programs and contributes to \nhealth initiatives such as the Purple House Foundation's renal dialysis support.\n\"A crucial aspect of Kooya's offering is its focus on the Aboriginal social impact. My dad and I and many Aboriginal \npeople/individuals recognise that governance is rooted in reciprocity and giving back. To embody this principle, we \nestablished the Bibbulmun Fund to support and contribute to our communities,\" she says.Page 5 of 5\nThe game changers\nReflecting on her journey so far, Collard expresses pride in what she's achieved. \"As a proud Aboriginal woman in a \nmale-dominated field, I take great pride in my role as a leader. I strive to create change and lead by example, \ndemonstrating the impact of Aboriginal leadership in driving progress and inspiring others,\" she says.\nLoad-Date: October 15, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nFormat your response as follows:\nTitle: [Title of the document]\nAuthor: [Author of the document]\nMedia Outlet: [Name of the media outlet]\nDate of Publication: [Date of publication]- (extract the date in the format Month Day, Year - IN ENGLISH)\nMedia type: ['National', 'Regional' or 'Industry-specific/Trade-press']\n\nHere is an example of document provided: Document(metadata='source': \"KnowledgeBase/CompanyAnalysis/Embraer/MediaCoverage/NewsEmbraer/What near-disasters, 'SNL' jabs mean for Alaska 's reputation.PDF\", 'page': [1, 2, 3], page_content='Page 1 of 3\nWhat near-disasters, 'SNL' jabs mean for Alaska 's reputation\nWhat near-disasters, 'SNL' jabs mean for Alaska's reputation - Correction \nAppended\nThe Seattle Times\nJanuary 25, 2024 Thursday\n Correction Appended\nCopyright 2024 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved\nSection: Pg.

In het akkoord erkent Philips geen schuld voor mogelijke schade bij pati\u00ebnten, die vreesden dat ze \nkanker, astma en andere aandoeningen hadden opgelopen door het gebruik van de Philips-apparaten. Het \nconcern kondigde gisteren ook aan dat zijn verzekeraars ruim \u20ac0,5 mrd van de kosten zullen vergoeden.\nDe schikking betreft zowel de claims voor medische schade als voor medische controle voor pati\u00ebnten. \nClaimadvocaten hadden meer dan 760 zaken aangebracht. Nog eens 60.000 pati\u00ebnten hadden zich laten \nregistreren om in een later stadium aanspraak te kunnen maken op een vergoeding. Hoeveel geld afzonderlijke \npati\u00ebnten ontvangen, is nog niet duidelijk. Het is aan de advocaten om het totaalbedrag onder hun cli\u00ebnten te \nverdelen. Philips heeft zich stevig verweerd tegen de schadeclaims. Volgens het bedrijf is uit onderzoek gebleken \ndat de uitstoot van schadelijke stoffen te gering was om ernstige gezondheidsschade te kunnen veroorzaken. \nPhilips stemde toch in met een schikking omdat de uitkomst van rechtszaken moeilijk te voorspellen is. In het \nAmerikaanse rechtssysteem kunnen jury's soms onverwacht grote schadevergoedingen toekennen. Eerder \nbereikte Philips al een akkoord over economische schade voor pati\u00ebnten, evenals een schikkingsakkoord met de \nAmerikaanse medische toezichthouder, de FDA.
