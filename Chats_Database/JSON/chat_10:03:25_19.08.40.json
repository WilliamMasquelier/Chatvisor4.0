Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 21\nLength: 575 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nThe chief executive of Fortescue-owned Williams Advanced Engineering has left after less than a year amid the \nlatest upheaval in the company's fledgling green energy division.\nJudith Judson was appointed chief executive of WAE, recently re-branded Fortescue Zero, in 2023. She was \ntasked by Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest with leading the business as it opened two new facilities \nin Britain and talked up increasing headcount by at least fourfold.\nIt is understood Ms Judson remains on the Fortescue Zero payroll and has returned to the United States, where \nshe has family and a long track record of renewable energy leadership.\nMark Hutchinson, the boss of Fortescue's green energy division, has stepped in as CEO of the business, which \nstarted as an offshoot of the Williams F1 racing team and was acquired for $US222 million ($334.8 million) in 2022.\nMr Hutchinson is thought to be running Fortescue Zero on top of his responsibilities as head of the green energy \ndivision.\nMeanwhile, former Argentina rugby union captain Agustin Pichot's star continues to rise at Fortescue. He has been \nappointed to the newly created position of regional director for energy. The global role takes in all of Fortescue's \ngreen energy projects.\nMr Pichot is already Fortescue Latin America president and recently filled in for head of corporate communications \nFiona Sugden after she departed to join Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's media team.\nBruh Terfie, who was Fortescue energy president for Africa and then acting president for Europe when Carlos \nLange exited, has also resigned.\nThe most recent accounts for Fortescue Zero were filed last August and show the business lost \u00a316 million ($31 \nmillion) in the 18 months to June 30, 2022. Fortescue did not respond to a request for comment.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue's British F1 car designer loses CEO Executive exodus\nThe business is integral to Fortescue plans to decarbonise its iron ore operations by 2030 without relying on \noffsets.\nPart of the Fortescue Zero brief is to adapt the technology applied in racing electric cars in Formula E to moving \nlarge tonnages of iron ore using haul trucks. It is also working on green iron technology.\nDr Forrest and other business leaders are due to meet Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Perth on Tuesday. The mining \nbillionaire will also host Mr Li and Mr Albanese on a visit to a Fortescue hydrogen research and development \ncentre, where the company is working on electric haul trucks.\nMs Judson is the latest in a long line of Fortescue executives to leave or step back from senior roles at the \ncompany in recent times.\nJulie Shuttleworth, who was in charge of Fortescue's iron ore operations in Gabon, and the inaugural leader of the \ngreen energy division, departed this week. In the green energy division, chief financial officer Deborah Caudle \nexited in January after less than five months as part of what Fortescue described as a restructure.\nFormer Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle lasted just five months as CFO of the division before quitting.\nFortescue said in November that it would proceed with its first three projects under ambitious plans to become a \nmajor force in hydrogen and renewable energy, committing to investments worth $US750 million in Australia and \nthe US.\nThe company said at the time that it was allocating $US550 million to a hydrogen project in Arizona, but Dr Forrest \nsubsequently hit out at revisions attached to the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act that threatened \nFortescue's tax credit eligibility.\nLoad-Date: June 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
