All Rights Reserved\nSection: ENVIRONMENT; Version:1\nLength: 469 words\nByline: Jillian Ambrose Energy correspondent\nHighlight: News follows scrapping of two other Atlantic windfarms and axing hundreds of jobs as costs surge \nacross sectorBusiness live \u2013 latest updates\nBody\nThe Danish company developing the world\u2019s largest offshore windfarm in the North Sea has been forced to delay a \nmajor project off the north-east coast of the US, months after cancelling two nearby developments and cutting \nhundreds of jobs.\n\u00d8rsted has pushed back the start of commercial operations at its 704 megawatt Revolution Wind project off the \ncoast of Rhode Island and Connecticut by a year, to 2026.\nThe company behind the giant Hornsea windfarms off the Yorkshire coast said the construction delay would \ncontribute to an impairment cost of 3.2bn Danish kroner ($472m) in its second-quarter financial results.\nThe latest financial hit to \u00d8rsted includes costs relating to its decision last year to scrap two major windfarms  off \nthe New Jersey coast, Ocean Wind I and II, amid surging costs facing the global wind power industry.\nWithin weeks of laying bare the company\u2019s financial turmoil, its chief financial officer, Daniel Lerup, and chief \noperating officer, Richard Hunter, agreed to step down  with immediate effect because the company needed \u201cnew \nand different capabilities\u201d.\nIn February, \u00d8rsted set out moves to cut up to 800 jobs and pull back from Spain, Portugal and Norway while \nreining in plans to expand its offshore wind business. It said it would suspend dividend payments to shareholders \ncovering the 2023-25 financial years in an attempt to recover from a chaotic 12 months.\nThe company, which is majority owned by the Danish government, said the \u201creset plan\u201d was designed to make it \nleaner and more efficient after soaring cost inflation and higher interest rates collided with supply chain disruptions \nto upend construction plans across the industry.\nPage 2 of 2\nDanish wind power giant \u00d8rsted delays major US offshore project\n\u00d8rsted\u2019s chief executive, Mads Nipper, pointed to the company\u2019s better than expected earnings from its portfolio of \noperating windfarms as evidence its existing business was performing well.\nEarnings for the second quarter rose to 5.27bn kroner, up almost 60% from the same months last year and well \nabove the average forecast of 4.41bn kroner predicted by industry analysts.\nThe company remains on track to deliver potentially the world\u2019s biggest offshore windfarm, the 2.9GW Hornsea 3, \nalso off the Yorkshire coast, by 2027, in a major boost to the new Labour government\u2019s goal to quadruple the UK\u2019s \noffshore wind capacity. \nThe \u00a38.3bn project is expected to generate enough green electricity to power the equivalent of 3m UK homes. The \nproject will join the 1.3GW Hornsea 1 offshore windfarm  and the 1.3GW Hornsea 2, which together are capable of \ngenerating enough electricity to provide 2.5m UK homes with green power. The final development, Hornsea 4, \nreceived approval last year  and could have a capacity of up to 2.6GW.\nIn total, the Hornsea offshore wind zone will generate enough clean electricity to power the equivalent of 8m UK \nhomes.\nLoad-Date: August 15, 2024\nEnd of Document\n            ",
