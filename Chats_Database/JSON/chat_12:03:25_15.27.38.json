Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Cecile Wake | Shell Australia chairwoman | \"Right now, what we have is a dysfunctional, deharmonised patchwork quilt of regulations that really make it difficult to have successful investments.\" | N.A. |\n| Cecile Wake | Shell Australia chairwoman | \"If we're going to reach net zero by 2050, for Australia to really thrive through the energy transition, we're going to need not one wave of investment, but a second, a third, a fourth, multiple waves of investment and what that requires is successful delivery of projects.\" | N.A. |\n| Cecile Wake | Shell Australia chairwoman | \"It felt to me like an example of additional complexity that added delay and costs to projects without delivering a significantly better outcome for traditional owner groups, and in fact, put a huge burden on them.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Shell.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Shell or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
