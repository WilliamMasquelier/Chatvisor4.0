The one sentence description should highlight in which regards does the article relate to Ramelius Resources. Your output should only consist of that one sentence.\nThis one sentence should highlight the main topic or theme of the article from the perspective of Ramelius Resources. We are interested about what is said on Ramelius Resources in the article and on this overall topic or industry: Mining, exploration and drilling of gold in the Australia market.\n\nHere is the article: Page 1 of 2\nGold shines again at Diggers and Dealers but developers are struggling - DATA ROOM\nGold shines again at Diggers and Dealers but developers are struggling - \nDATA ROOM\nThe Australian\nAugust 5, 2024 Monday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 789 words\nByline: EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER\nBody\nAustralia's lithium mining industry may have had its chance to shine last year, but it is those digging gold out of the \nground that are back in favour among resources investors.\nAs the Diggers & Dealers Conference gets under way in Kalgoorlie this week, investors have once again made gold \na key focus.\nBut while gold producers are in favour, it's a different story for developers, who face a tough journey getting projects \ninto production.\n\"Exploration is hard,\" Westgold Resources managing director Wayne Bramwell says. \"Being a single mine project \ndeveloper is really hard and it is a massive leap to get to that point where you can become a portfolio company, \nwhere your risk is mitigated by having multiple production outlets.\" In the past month, Calidus Resources collapsed \nafter lender Macquarie called in its loans.\nMeanwhile, Bellevue Gold's recent $150m-plus raising proved that gaining investor backing and moving to \nproduction can be a bumpy path, when it surprised investors with the raise and lower production forecasts.\n\"Bellevue has done a good job to get into production, but it is proving more difficult than they promised the market \nand there are growing pains that come with that,\" Barrenjoey mining analyst Daniel Morgan says.\nDiggers and Dealers will feature 66 corporate presentations from listed miners, explorers and other exhibitors from \nthe resources sector.\nMany investors made their way to Western Australia ahead of the conference, with Bellevue Gold holding a site visit \nlast Wednesday and Gold Road Resources the previous Thursday, along with Northern Star's Super Pit gold mine \non the outskirts of Kalgoorlie.\nPage 2 of 2\nGold shines again at Diggers and Dealers but developers are struggling - DATA ROOM\nAccommodation is tight for delegates at the conference. Some sidestep the event, instead using the build-up as an \nopportunity to schedule meetings in Perth, but it still attracts over 2000 delegates.\nLithium miners stole the show last year. Producers of the battery material were in favour because of the expected \nramp-up in electric vehicle manufacturing. But the lithium price has come off the boil while gold is striking record \nhighs.\n\"If you went back last year or the year before, what was remarkable was lithium, which had been a small \ncommodity, had really come to dominate the proceedings at Diggers and Dealers,\" Morgan says.\n\"The Australian-dollar gold price is high, and lithium and nickel are having a tough time of it and not likely to be as \nfocused on growth. Nickel and lithium are battening down the hatches.\" Domestic gold production growth has \nslowed over the past decade as mines approach the end of their productive lives, says IBISWorld, but it's set to \nreturn to growth as project expansions come online, capitalising on the weaker Australian dollar.\nThe industry's annual revenue is about $27.9bn and growing at a rate of 4.4 per cent as the metal continues to act \nas an inflation hedge and benefits from central bank purchases.\nAustralia is the third-largest producer globally with 293.8 tonnes in 2023, behind China and Russia, according to the \nWorld Gold Council.\nLithium miners dominated the mergers and acquisitions landscape in the resources industry last year, with \nAlbemarle bidding for Liontown Resources (it later abandoned the deal), SQM acquiring Azure Minerals, Chalice \nMining looking for a backer and speculation about a move on Patriot Battery Metals by Pilbara Minerals, which was \nsitting on a $3bn cash pile. But investment bankers have turned their attention to gold.\nHeading into Diggers and Dealers, there has been talk Regis and Gold Road Resources might merge. Ramelius \nResources is also in focus with an 8.9 per cent stake in Spartan Resources, West Gold and Ramelius have held \ntakeover talks and there's the perennial takeover target De Grey Mining.\nGenesis Minerals boss Raleigh Finlayson has emphasised his focus is on operations rather than deals, but the \ncompany is surrounded by consolidation opportunities in Western Australia's Leonora gold district, while it's \nexpected Northern Star will return to deal making to gain further scale after the country's largest gold miner \nNewcrest was taken over by Newmont.\nDriving M&A, Bramwell says, will be producers with cash. \"This is a time when the producers are cashed-up and \nthe explorers and the people in the middle are cash-strapped.\" Also of interest this year will be uranium miners like \nBoss Energy and Paladin, as the fuel remains at the centre of the energy debate and demand grows, with a lack of \nsupply to the West from Russia. \"There's a lot of enthusiasm towards the sector. Its prospects are still high and \nhave not dimmed as much as lithium or nickel or rare earths have,\" Morgan says. Another positive for gold could be \nnickel producers such as BHP mothballing projects, making workers available.\nLoad-Date: August 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n            ",
