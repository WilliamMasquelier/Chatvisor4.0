It operates in the Renewable energy, with a prefered focus on the Netherlands market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Orsted based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Orsted is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Orsted.\n\nIf Orsted is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nWind farm giant Orsted's chief executive quits\nWind farm giant Orsted's chief executive quits\nThe Independent (United Kingdom)\nJanuary 31, 2025 Friday 8:59 AM EST\nCopyright 2025 Independent Print Ltd  All Rights Reserved\nSection: RENEWABLE ENERGY NEWS, Utilities news & EXECUTIVE MOVES NEWS\nLength: 244 words\nByline: Alex Daniel\nBody\nThe chief executive of Orsted, the multinational energy giant which is one of the UK's biggest offshore wind farm \ndevelopers, has quit.\nMads Nipper will leave the Danish company after a series of vast writedowns and declining share prices in recent \nyears.\nRasmus Errboe, his deputy, will take the top job on Saturday, the company said in a statement.\nOrsted is developing the largest offshore wind farm in the world about 75 miles off the Norfolk coast in the North \nSea.\nHornsea 3 is expected to be completed in late 2027, and will sit alongside 12 other wind farms either developed or \npart-developed by Orsted in the UK.\nBetween them, they can already generate enough electricity to power about six million homes.\nBut while the UK is pushing ahead with plans to develop wind farms as part of a push to reach net zero in the power \nsystem by 2030, the situation is more complicated in other countries.\nThe US, in particular, is a significant doubt for Orsted, after President Donald Trump said he would stop federal \npermission for new offshore wind projects.\nThe company took a 1.7 billion dollar hit on a project in the country earlier this month, amid rising costs to develop \none of its wind farms.\n\"The impacts on our business of the increasingly challenging situation in the offshore wind industry, ranging from \nsupply chain bottlenecks, interest rate increases, to a changing regulatory landscape, mean that our focus has \nshifted,\" said Lene Skole, the company's chair.\nPage 2 of 2\nWind farm giant Orsted's chief executive quits\nLoad-Date: January 31, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Orsted.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
