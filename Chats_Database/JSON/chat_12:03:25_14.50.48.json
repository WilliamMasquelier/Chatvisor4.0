The duo in 2022 began developing Wellington, which has ticked off all \napprovals and is preparing to kick off construction in July or August.\nThe battery's first stage, which will cost about $400 million to build, will see Ampyr turn on 600MWh by mid-2026 \nwith the remaining capacity to follow in 2027.\nThe site is located close to the central nodes in Trangrid's transmission backbone and geographically within the \nCentral West Orana Renewable Energy Zone. About two thirds of its capacity is expected to be taken up by the \nnearby 300MW Wellington solar farm, which is owned by Lightsource BP.\n\"We're grateful for Shell's contributions to the Wellington BESS project, and we are excited about accelerating its \ndevelopment to bring this vital project to market,\" Ampyr Australia CEO Alex Wonhas told Street Talk. \"Reliable, \ncost competitive electricity is a cornerstone of Australia's economic growth.\"\nOf note, Ampyr Australia is actively hunting through M&A as well as organic opportunities as it aims for a 3GW \nbattery portfolio by 2050, or about 18 per cent of the 16GW that the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) \nhas forecast the country needs to support the shift from coal-fired plants to renewable sources.\nThe Ampyr Energy Group is the renewables platform of Singapore-headquarted AGP Sustainable Real Assets, \nwhich in late 2023 attracted a billion-dollar investment from US's Stonepeak.\nLoad-Date: February 5, 2025\nPage 2 of 2\nStonepeak-backed Ampyr buys Shell's NSW battery stake; Street Talk\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Stonepeak-backed Ampyr buys Shell's NSW battery stake; Street Talk\n## Australian Financial Review\n### Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood, And Emma Rapaport\n### February 03, 2025\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Shell, to report.

Ampyr Energy Global has acquired Shell's 50% stake in the Wellington battery energy storage system in New South Wales, indicating a strategic shift for Shell away from direct involvement in battery storage projects in Australia.\n\n2. The sale of Shell's stake reflects the company's ongoing transition and potential divestment from certain renewable energy assets, as it focuses on its core oil and gas operations amidst a changing energy landscape.\n\n3. Ampyr's plans to develop the Wellington battery system, which is expected to contribute significantly to Australia's renewable energy goals, highlight the competitive landscape in the battery storage market, where Shell's previous involvement is now being replaced by other players.\n\n4. The transaction underscores the growing importance of battery storage in Australia's energy transition, with Ampyr aiming for a substantial market share, which may impact Shell's future strategies in the renewable sector. \n\n5. Shell's exit from the Wellington project may raise questions about its commitment to renewable energy initiatives in Australia, especially as the country moves towards a more sustainable energy framework.",
