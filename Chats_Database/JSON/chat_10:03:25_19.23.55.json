Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"Dr Forrest had concerns about Dr Kolodziejczyk's conduct, namely that his criticism of colleagues threatened to create a toxic work environment.\" | N.A. |\n| Adrian Huber | Fortescue Lawyer | \"The investigation... found 'material misrepresentations and inaccuracies in respect of activities, positions held and qualifications listed in Dr Kolodziejczyk's Curriculum Vitae'.\" | N.A. |\n| Julie Shuttleworth | Former Chief Executive of Fortescue Future Industries | \"We are happy you have decided to stay with FFI and look forward to moving on ...this, however, will necessitate a substantial behavioural change by you and leads me to our chairman's chief concern, to your failure to be a positive and encouraging leader.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
