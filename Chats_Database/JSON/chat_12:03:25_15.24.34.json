Cisco's AI \nreadiness index, undertaken for the second time this year, found 38 per cent of companies had allocated between \n10 to 30 per cent of their IT budget to AI, despite many not seeing a return on the investment.\nThe firm's Australian chief technology officer Carl Solder said Cisco's index found about half of the companies \nsurveyed found assistance from AI with processes and operations did not hit the mark. About 44 per cent saw either \nno or not enough improvement in the technology automating their business.\n\"I think the reality is that they started to appreciate the work and effort involved in getting all those building blocks \nsquared away, and the strategy, infrastructure data governance, talent and culture,\" he said. \"The reality is that \nmaybe there is a bit more work that we have to do to be fully prepared.\" Cisco's Index measured the responses of \n3660 senior business leaders from companies with 500 or more staff across 14 countries in the Asia Pacific. The \nindex found just 4 per cent of the country was in a position to leverage AI, a figure that dropped from 5 per cent the \nprevious year. Mr Solder said 92 per cent of companies were facing increasing pressure to adopt AI despite much \nof it not showing a return on investment over the past year. Most of that pressure came from company chief \nexecutives and boards.\nLoad-Date: November 30, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
