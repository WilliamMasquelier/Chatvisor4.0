They said the judgment signalled a \nwillingness by the court to mandate emissions curbs, while leaving wide latitude for the mechanisms to be worked \nout in future litigation.\nThe 2021 decision by The Hague district court ordered Shell - at the time based in the Netherlands - to reduce its \ncarbon emissions by 45 per cent by the end of 2030 from 2019 levels.\nThe Hague Court of Appeal on Tuesday ruled that while Shell is obliged to reduce its emissions, the court was \nunable to determine which percentage should apply.\n\"There is insufficient consensus in climate science on a specific reduction percentage to which an individual \ncompany like Shell should adhere,\" it said.\nIt said it therefore rejected the claims of Milieudefensie, the Dutch arm of environmental group Friends of the Earth.\nThe court added that Shell was already working to reduce its emissions and that an obligation for the company to \nreduce emissions caused by buyers of its products would be ineffective.\nMilieudefensie called the appeals court decision a shocking setback, but said that it showed companies were under \npressure to reduce carbon emissions, even if targets aren't legally binding. \"Large polluters are powerful. But \nunited, we as people have the power to change them,\" said Donald Pols, its director.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell wins carbon appeal\nThe group didn't say whether it planned an appeal to the Dutch supreme court, a process that could extend the \nlegal fight for years. Lawyers expect the group to appeal.\nIts statement included a plea for financial support, adding, \"This judgment will change nothing about our eagerness \nto keep fighting.\" The decision comes as world leaders meet in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku to discuss global \nwarming at the United Nations COP29 summit. The mood in many circles has been gloomy in part due to \nexpectations that Donald Trump's victory will pull the US further back from a leading role in global climate efforts.\nIn a response to the Dutch court's ruling, Shell reiterated that it believed a court ruling would do little to reduce \nemissions as it wouldn't dent demand for petrol, diesel and gas. The clear view in Tuesday's judgment is that the \ncourt felt empowered to order a company to abide by absolute carbon emissions targets, a novel development that \ncould have wide ripple effects even while specifics are debated in different countries and courtrooms.\nLoad-Date: November 14, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nBased on the content of the article, choose the most appropriate category from the following list: ['Financial Performance and Market Strategy', 'Regulatory and Legal Challenges', 'Energy Transition and Climate Commitments', 'Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and Gas Market Developments', 'Oil and Gas Project Investments and Operations', 'Geopolitical and Security Risks', 'Government Relations and Policy Advocacy']\nYour output should solely be the name of the category chosen and nothing else.\n            ",
