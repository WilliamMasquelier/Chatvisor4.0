Suppression orders covering the case were only partially lifted by Justice Logan on Tuesday, \nbut the case centres around allegations made by Fortescue that Element Zero directors used confidential \nFortescue intellectual property about Fortescue's green iron - carbon-dioxide free - technology to found their own \ncompany.\nLoad-Date: June 6, 2024\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue launched raids\nEnd of Document\n        ",
