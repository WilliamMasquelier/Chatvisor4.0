It is also the manager's first investment in the sector in the UK. The announcement of a major \ninvestment in an area critical to the UK's economic growth has been a boost for Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead \nof Wednesday's budget announcement.\nThe purchase will give Brookfield a minority stake in four operating offshore wind farms. It comes at a critical time \nfor Orsted , as the Danish renewable energy company tries to prove to investors that the market still wants offshore \nwind.\nOrsted's share price fell sharply last year due to rising costs and supply chain problems related to the company's \nplans to build offshore wind farms in the United States, Bloomberg reports .\nThis is the second major sign of investor interest in Orsted and its assets this month after Norwegian oil and gas \ncompany Equinor ASA announced it would buy a stake in the company for $2.5 billion ( Angi.ru )\nLoad-Date: October 31, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
