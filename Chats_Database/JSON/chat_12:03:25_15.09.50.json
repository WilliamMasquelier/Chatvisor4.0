The fewer the number of categories, the better, as long as they are distinct and cover the main aspects of the media coverage.\nAvoid defining categories that are too semantically similar or overlapping. For instance, \"Financial Performance\" and \"Economic Growth\" are too closely related to be separate categories. For example, Staffing Shortages, Labor Relations, Working Conditions and Recruitment Challenges are too closely related too and should be grouped under a single category like \"Human Resources Issues\".\n        ",
