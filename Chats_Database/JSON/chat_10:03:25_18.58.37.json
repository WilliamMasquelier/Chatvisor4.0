Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 494 words\nHighlight: Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has reported a boost in earnings and profits despite shipments and \nproduction of iron ore from its key Pilbara operations falling.\nBody\nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue Metals Group has boosted earnings and profits despite shipments and production of \niron ore from its key Pilbara operations falling marginally over the past half-year, due to increased maintenance at \nits sprawling network of mines.\nFortescue Metals' chief executive officer Dino Otranto labelled the first half performance \"excellent\", saying the \nminer's shipments, while slightly lower than a year ago, were still the company's second highest in history. Costs \nhad been kept low, he said.\nLink to Image\nTrevor Collens\nFortescue reported underlying earnings of $US5.9 billion ($9 billion), 36 per cent above the previous half-year \nperiod, as it declared a fully franked interim dividend of $1.08 per share, 44 per cent higher, and a net profit of \n$US3.3 billion ($5.06 billion).\n\"Whether it's through our first green energy projects, our diversification into the high-grade segment of the iron ore \nmarket through Iron Bridge, or expansion of our global footprint with the Belinga iron ore project in Gabon, we \nremain committed to creating value for all our stakeholders,\" Otranto said.\nShipments of hematite ore fell to 95 million tonnes, about three million tonnes below the previous period, and the \namount of ore mined decreased by 10 million tonnes to 105 million tonnes. The volume of ore processed also fell \nslightly. Fortescue attributed the drop to infrastructure maintenance activities and an increase in waste mining.\nFortescue's shares started the year at a record high as ore prices peaked above $US140 a tonne in anticipation \nChina would unleash a fresh wave of stimulus to fix its ailing economy, but the miner's shares followed iron ore's \ndownward trajectory in intervening weeks.\nThe metal, still at a 10-year-high, is now sitting around $US125. Fortescue's shares rose about 2 per cent to \n$27.79 in trade by midday.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue ups dividend, profits jump despite lower iron ore shipments\nUBS analyst Lachlan Shaw said the result was \"solid and clean,\" and off the back of elevated iron ore prices and \ntight discounting. Softer shipments or ore in January because of bad weather and a train derailment meant \nFortescue will need a stronger second half to meet its shipping forecasts.\n\"This is not unusual seasonally, but we will need to monitor for disruptions over coming months,\" Shaw said.\nAt Iron Bridge, Fortescue had planned to produce five million tonnes of high-grade magnetite ore this financial year \nas it ramped up the $5.9 billion project to its full capacity of 22 million tonnes a year. The project hit a snag recently \nfrom continual leaks in the higher pressure section of a 240-kilometre pipeline that supplies water to the processing \nplant.\nNevertheless, the company said it reached six million tonnes of mined ore over the first half at Iron Bridge and \nshipped 84 thousand tonnes. It also shipped its first iron ore from its Belinga project in Gabon, the first time it has \nexported outside of Australia.\nThe Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day's trading.
