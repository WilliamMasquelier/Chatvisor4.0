Orsted, a Danish energy company that transitioned from fossil fuels to focus on offshore wind farms, has seen its stock value decline by over 50% since October 2021, contrasting sharply with the significant gains of major oil companies during the same period.\n\n2. The article highlights a broader discussion on the financial implications of divesting from fossil fuels, suggesting that while the shift towards renewable energy is essential for climate goals, it may not yield immediate financial returns, as evidenced by Orsted's market performance.\n\n3. The performance of Orsted is juxtaposed with that of Shell, which has increased in value by approximately 55% since the same time frame, raising questions about the viability of investing heavily in renewable energy amidst rising costs and economic challenges.\n\n4. The analysis indicates that the decision by ABP, the Dutch pension fund, to divest from fossil fuels may have resulted in significant financial losses, with potential investments in oil and gas yielding higher returns compared to those in alternative energy sectors like Orsted. \n\n5. The article suggests that while there is a strong global demand for green energy, the current market conditions and the financial performance of companies like Orsted may indicate that the transition to renewable energy could be more complex and less profitable than anticipated.\n\nArticle: \u00c9olien : Equinor prend pr\u00e8s de 10% dans le danois Orsted (Date: October 07, 2024)\n# [\u00c9olien : Equinor prend pr\u00e8s de 10% dans le danois Orsted](https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:6D4J-VD11-F018-D2P2-00000-00&context=1519360)\n## Lefigaro\n### Anonymous\n### October 07, 2024\n\n1.

Overview  \n\nThe media coverage of \u00d8rsted's investment and divestment activities highlights a period of strategic realignment, financial challenges, and shifting market dynamics. Over the past year, \u00d8rsted has engaged in significant asset sales, particularly in the U.S. and France, as part of its broader effort to optimize capital allocation and stabilize its financial position [Nordic Business Report, March 13, 2024; Le Figaro, April 29, 2024]. At the same time, the company has attracted major investments from firms like Equinor and Brookfield, signaling continued confidence in its offshore wind assets despite financial setbacks [Lefigaro, October 07, 2024; Business World Agency, October 30, 2024]. However, \u00d8rsted has also been forced to scale back its investment plans, cutting its projected spending by 25% through 2030 due to financial pressures and market uncertainties [Business World Agency, February 06, 2025].  \n\n## 3.2. Chronological Analysis  \n\n### 3.2.1 Early Coverage  \n\nIn early 2024, \u00d8rsted initiated a series of divestments, starting with the sale of its equity stake in four U.S. onshore wind farms to Stonepeak for approximately $300 million [Nordic Business Report, March 13, 2024]. This move was part of \u00d8rsted's farm-down program, aimed at optimizing capital utilization while maintaining operational control over key assets. The company framed this divestment as a strategic decision to support future renewable energy projects, with executives emphasizing its role in delivering value to investors and sustaining growth in the sector [Nordic Business Report, March 13, 2024].  \n\nShortly after, \u00d8rsted announced its exit from the French renewable energy market by selling its wind and solar operations to Engie [Le Figaro, April 29, 2024]. This divestment included nine wind farms and a photovoltaic installation, marking a retreat from a market that \u00d8rsted had entered just two years earlier through the acquisition of Ostwind France [El Economista, April 29, 2024]. The decision was largely attributed to financial difficulties stemming from \u00d8rsted\u2019s U.S. operations, which had resulted in a significant loss of 20.2 billion Danish crowns (approximately \u20ac2.7 billion) in 2023 [Le Figaro, April 29, 2024].  \n\n### 3.2.2 Developing Trends  \n\nBy mid-2024, media coverage began to focus on \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles and the broader challenges facing the renewable energy sector. Reports highlighted the company's declining stock value, which had dropped by over 50% since October 2021, in stark contrast to the rising valuations of major oil companies like Shell [Het Financieele Dagblad, June 01, 2024]. Analysts questioned the financial viability of large-scale renewable energy investments, particularly in the face of rising costs and economic uncertainties [Het Financieele Dagblad, June 01, 2024].  \n\nHowever, despite these challenges, \u00d8rsted attracted a major investment from Equinor in October 2024, with the Norwegian energy giant acquiring a 9.8% stake in the company for approximately $2.5 billion [Lefigaro, October 07, 2024]. This move positioned Equinor as \u00d8rsted\u2019s second-largest shareholder after the Danish state and was seen as a strategic effort to strengthen its offshore wind portfolio [Energie & Management, October 07, 2024]. The investment was met with mixed reactions, with some analysts speculating about a potential merger between the two companies, while others viewed it as a stabilizing force for \u00d8rsted amid financial difficulties [Les Echos, October 08, 2024].  \n\nLater in October, \u00d8rsted secured another major investment when Brookfield acquired a $2.3 billion stake in its UK wind farms [Business World Agency, October 30, 2024]. This transaction was part of \u00d8rsted\u2019s ongoing farm-down strategy, allowing the company to retain operational control while raising capital for future projects [The Telegraph, October 30, 2024]. The deal was seen as a positive signal for the offshore wind sector, particularly in the UK, where \u00d8rsted continues to pursue large-scale projects like Hornsea 3 [The Telegraph, October 30, 2024].  \n\n### 3.2.3 Recent Developments  \n\nBy early 2025, \u00d8rsted announced a major shift in its investment strategy, cutting planned expenditures by 25% through 2030 [Business World Agency, February 06, 2025]. This decision was driven by financial pressures, including the fallout from its U.S. expansion efforts, which had encountered significant setbacks in 2023 [Business World Agency, February 06, 2025]. Under new management, the company sought to stabilize its financial position by scaling back its renewable energy targets and focusing on more sustainable growth strategies [Business World Agency, February 06, 2025].  \n\n## 3.3. Stakeholder Perspectives  \n\n### 3.3.1 \u00d8rsted Leadership  \n\n\u00d8rsted executives have consistently framed the company\u2019s divestments as strategic moves to optimize capital allocation and support long-term growth. David Hardy, \u00d8rsted\u2019s EVP and CEO of Region Americas, emphasized that the sale of U.S. onshore wind assets to Stonepeak was designed to deliver value to investors while maintaining operational control [Nordic Business Report, March 13, 2024]. Similarly, Kieran White, \u00d8rsted\u2019s Senior Vice President, described the company\u2019s exit from France as part of a broader shift towards markets with stronger growth potential, such as the UK, Ireland, Germany, and Spain [El Economista, April 29, 2024].  \n\n### 3.3.2 Investors and Market Analysts  \n\nInvestor sentiment towards \u00d8rsted has been mixed. While some, like Equinor and Brookfield, have demonstrated confidence in the company\u2019s offshore wind assets through major investments [Lefigaro, October 07, 2024; Business World Agency, October 30, 2024], others have expressed concerns about its financial stability. Analysts have pointed to \u00d8rsted\u2019s declining stock value and the broader challenges facing the renewable energy sector as reasons for caution [Het Financieele Dagblad, June 01, 2024]. The company\u2019s decision to cut investments by 25% was seen as a necessary step to restore financial stability, but it also raised questions about the long-term viability of its ambitious growth plans [Business World Agency, February 06, 2025].  \n\n### 3.3.3 Equinor  \n\nEquinor\u2019s investment in \u00d8rsted was framed as a strategic move to expand its renewable energy portfolio while maintaining its presence in the oil and gas sector [Energie & Management, October 07, 2024]. Equinor\u2019s CEO emphasized that the acquisition was intended to provide stability for both companies, with no immediate plans to influence \u00d8rsted\u2019s management or strategy [Energie & Management, October 07, 2024]. However, speculation about a potential merger between the two companies has persisted, given their shared interests in offshore wind development [Les Echos, October 08, 2024].  \n\n## 3.4. Implications and Future Outlook  \n\n\u00d8rsted\u2019s investment and divestment activities reflect broader trends in the renewable energy sector, including financial pressures, shifting market priorities, and the need for strategic partnerships. The company\u2019s decision to exit the French market and scale back its investment plans suggests a more cautious approach to expansion, particularly in light of recent financial challenges [Le Figaro, April 29, 2024; Business World Agency, February 06, 2025].  \n\nAt the same time, major investments from Equinor and Brookfield indicate continued confidence in \u00d8rsted\u2019s offshore wind assets, which remain a key component of the global energy transition [Lefigaro, October 07, 2024; Business World Agency, October 30, 2024]. However, the company\u2019s ability to navigate financial pressures and maintain investor confidence will be critical in determining its long-term success.  \n\nLooking ahead, \u00d8rsted\u2019s focus on stabilizing its financial position and optimizing capital allocation suggests that further divestments or strategic partnerships may be on the horizon. Additionally, the broader renewable energy sector may continue to face challenges related to rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and shifting investor sentiment, all of which could impact \u00d8rsted\u2019s future growth trajectory [Business World Agency, February 06, 2025].",
