It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 5\nCoal mine climate change case challenges the government's use of 'drug dealer's defence' on emissions\nCoal mine climate change case challenges the government's use of 'drug \ndealer's defence' on emissions\nABC Premium News (Australia)\nApril 4, 2024 Thursday\nCopyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1748 words\nByline: by climate reporter Jo Lauder\nHighlight: As Queensland environmentalists continue to fight looming coal mine approvals, Australia's Environment \nMinister Tanya Plibersek is relying on arguments that have come under increasing scrutiny in climate litigation.\nBody\nThere's a case happening at the moment that highlights the strange place we are at in the shift away from fossil \nfuels.\nA Queensland environmental group took federal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek to court over two coal mine \nextensions, arguing that she did not consider the impacts of the emissions released when the coal is burnt.\nThe minister used two arguments that have been deployed for decades to justify Australia's coal exports.\nThey're known by environmentalists as the \"drug dealer's defence\" and the \"drop in the ocean\" argument.\nThe \"drug dealer's defence\" can be summed up like this: if we don't sell this coal, someone else will, so it doesn't \nmake a difference.\nBut with global demand for coal expected to peak as early as 2026, according to the International Energy Agency, \ncan Australia still claim that it's simply meeting the demand of the market?\nThe second argument made by the minister was that emissions from these mines don't make a significant \ncontribution overall to climate change. Nicknamed the \"drop in the ocean\" argument, it's also on shaky grounds \nlegally in 2024, with other courts rejecting it.\nAt the heart of 'living wonders' \nBefore we get into how these arguments work, here's a bit of background on where the case came from.\nPage 2 of 5\nCoal mine climate change case challenges the government's use of 'drug dealer's defence' on emissions\nLast year, the Environment Council of Central Queensland (ECoCeQ) took the minister to court over proposals to \nextend Whitehaven's Narrabri Mine and the Mount Pleasant Mine in Muswellbrook, and lost the case.\nMs Plibersek has veto power over major projects if they would impact \"matters of national environmental \nsignificance\", such as protected plants, animals, and ecosystems.\nFor example, when you hear about a court case to stop a coal mine because it will clear the habitat of an \nendangered parrot, it's being argued under these laws.\nThe ECoCeQ nicknamed it the \"living wonders\" case.\n\"From the Tarkine to Kakadu, from Ningaloo Reef on the west to the Great Barrier Reef on the east, and everything \nin between including our koalas, our greater gliders, our pygmy possums\u2026 we put them all as living wonders,\" the \ncouncil's president Christine Carlisle said.\nUnder the act, the minister isn't required to consider how the project will contribute to climate change through its \nemissions.\nThe mines haven't been approved yet, but the legal action challenged the minister's risk assessment of them before \na final decision.\nThe review of the minister's decision was heard last year by a single Federal Court judge, who ruled that her \ndecision was legal. This latest hearing was an appeal to the full Federal Court.\nThe council believes the minister didn't properly assess the risks that would come from the emissions when this \ncoal is burnt.\n\"We maintain every coal mine is contributing to climate harm. And every contribution escalates the climate harms \nthat happen to all our living wonders,\" Ms Carlisle said.\nIf we don't supply, someone else will\nThe drug dealer's argument is referred to legally as \"market substitution\" and it comes down to supply and demand.\nIn documents on the Narrabri mine, Ms Plibersek uses a textbook case of market substitution.\n\"I considered that it is also likely that, if the proposed action does not proceed, the prospective buyers will purchase \nan equivalent amount of coal from a supplier other than the proponent, which would result in an equivalent amount \nof greenhouse gas emissions,\" she said.\nMelbourne Law School's Jacqueline Peel is an expert in climate litigation and says this argument fails to consider \nthe global move away from fossil fuels.\n\"[It's] the first time we've really seen the market substitution argument being raised at a federal level by the federal \nenvironment minister as part of an argument to say there's no need to reconsider approvals for particular coal \nmines,\" Professor Peel said.\n\"Where the courts have an opportunity to really delve into the economic evidence, then they're finding that it is \nquestionable and rejecting a market substitution-style argument.\"\nThe drug dealer's defence was dismissed in the Waratah Coal case, where the Land Court of Queensland ruled \nagainst Clive Palmer's mine in the Galilee Basin.\nThe judge found that demand for coal in the coming years was \"most likely to be met by operating mines\". \n\"Under a declining demand forecast, coal-for-coal substitution will be limited to the near-term. Increased demand \nwill be short-term and peak soon.\"Page 3 of 5\nCoal mine climate change case challenges the government's use of 'drug dealer's defence' on emissions\nCoal's used-by date fast approaching\nDespite predictions that coal demand will peak in the next decade, the proposals before the minister are to keep \ndigging up and shipping coal until 2044 and 2048.\nThe main destinations for the coal are Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan \u2013 which all have net zero targets \nof 2050.\nWhitehaven Coal, which owns the Narrabri mine, told the ABC that it sees a need for their coal.\n\"High-quality thermal coal has an important role to play in supporting global energy security during the \ndecarbonisation transition in the coming decades, particularly in Asia where there continues to be strong and \ngrowing demand for its use in high-efficiency, low-emissions coal-fired power stations,\" a Whitehaven spokesman \nsaid.\nThe International Energy Agency expects global coal demand to drop this year, even in the absence of stronger \nclimate action.\n\"Beyond projects already committed as of 2021, there are no new oil and gas fields approved for development in \nour pathway, and no new coal mines or mine extensions are required,\" the agency stated.\nNot seeing the forest for the trees\nThe other argument used by the minister gets to the heart of the global nature of climate change.\nIt's that the greenhouse gas emissions from the mines are small globally, therefore they would not be a \"substantial \ncause\" of climate change impacts.\n\"Any contribution from the proposed action to global greenhouse gas emissions would be very small,\" Ms Plibersek \noutlined in documents on the project.\nProfessor Peel says this argument is all about the trees and not the forest.\n\"Cumulatively, those greenhouse gas emissions are what is causing the climate change impacts that we're seeing.\"\nArguably, this mindset has got the world to where it is today.\n\"It's an argument that's easily able to be deployed by most governments and corporations around the world, \nbecause obviously, climate change is a global problem and there are many contributors to that problem,\" Professor \nPeel said.\nTo ECoCeQ's president this argument is \"fatalistic\". \n\"It's making an assessment that the rest of the world is going to do nothing. And in that way, it's deflecting \nresponsibility for us doing something,\" Ms Carlisle said.\n\"Both of these arguments, we say, are irrational, illogical. And we're asking the court to determine whether they are \nalso unlawful under the act.\"\nAnd there are international examples of cases where this argument has been thrown out.\nA landmark ruling in the Netherlands against oil and gas giant Shell recently rejected both arguments made by the \ncompany.\n\"The court acknowledges that RDS [Shell] cannot solve this global problem on its own,\" the judgement read.Page 4 of 5\nCoal mine climate change case challenges the government's use of 'drug dealer's defence' on emissions\n\"However, this does not absolve RDS of its individual partial responsibility to do its part regarding the emissions of \nthe Shell group, which it can control and influence.\"\nWhile international cases don't set a legal precedent here in Australia, these decisions can still be invoked in local \ncases.\nIn the Shell case, the court agreed with climate scientists' assessment that all emissions add to the problem.\n\"It is also important here that each reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has a positive effect on countering \ndangerous climate change. After all, each reduction means that there is more room in the carbon budget,\" the court \nsaid.\nA recent UN reportfound the number of climate change cases around the world had doubled, and Professor Peel \nsaid Australia was at the forefront of that trend. \n\"We have the second highest number of cases globally, only exceeded by the US,\" she explained.\n\"Climate litigation itself has grown substantially in the last five years, since the conclusion of the Paris Agreement \ninternationally.\"\nSo how is the federal government managing emissions?\nThe environment minister has a strong reason for why she isn't responsible for factoring in climate change impacts \ninto these decisions: because that's the job of Australia's current climate change laws.\nInstead the government is looking to the revamped Safeguard Mechanism, which requires Australia's biggest \npolluters reduce their emissions every year.\n\"Labor has already changed the law,\" Ms Plibersek told the ABC.\n\"Our strong new climate laws, developed with the Greens and independents, allow the Minister for Climate Change \nand Energy to stop coal and gas projects adding to Australia's emissions.\"\n\"The government's reformed Safeguard Mechanism ensures all large industrial facilities, including new and existing \ncoal mines, reduce emissions,\" Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen told the ABC.\n\"Any new or expanded mines must comply with baselines under the Safeguard Mechanism.\"\nWhitehaven Coal confirmed that the mine's direct emissions will fall under these regulations.\n\"We are investing in initiatives to decarbonise our operations and continuing to evaluate site-based abatement \nopportunities.\n\"We have also commenced the approval application process for a solar farm on land adjacent to the existing \nNarrabri mine that would provide more than one-third of the mine's electricity,\" a Whitehaven Coal spokesman told \nthe ABC.\n\"We acknowledge Australia's commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and will continue to align our \ndecarbonisation ambition and business practices with the emissions reduction requirements set by the Australian \ngovernment. Net zero emissions does not mean no emissions.\" \nBut something is missing from this process; the emissions from when that coal is burnt overseas.\nWhile the current laws mean the government isn't responsible for those emissions, the impact of them is felt \nglobally, including in Australia.\nThe ECoCeQ says that's why the environment minister needs to factor climate change into her decisions.Page 5 of 5\nCoal mine climate change case challenges the government's use of 'drug dealer's defence' on emissions\n\"I just think the minister has one job, which is to protect the environment, and that she's unable to do that properly \nwithout properly scrutinising the effect of climate harms from coal and gas proposals,\" Ms Carlisle said.\nThe full Federal Court is expected to announce its decision on the case in the coming months.\nMACH Energy, which owns the Mount Pleasant Mine, declined to comment on the case.\nLoad-Date: April 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
