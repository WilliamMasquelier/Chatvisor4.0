Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest | Fortescue Group's founder | \"Fortescue's performance in the first half of FY24 has been excellent, with the team achieving our second highest first-half shipments while maintaining our strong focus on safety and keeping our costs low.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Chief Executive of Fortescue's energy division | \"We have a strong pipeline of projects to come, and we will continue to show the same financial discipline that Fortescue has shown for 20 years.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Metals Chief Executive at Fortescue | \"Fortescue\u2019s performance in the first half of FY24 has been excellent, with the team achieving our second highest first-half shipments while maintaining our strong focus on safety and keeping our costs low.\" | N.A. |\n| Sean Williams | Analyst at Moody's Investors Service | \"Fortescue's solid financial profile sets the company in a good position given its investment spending will likely remain elevated in the coming years.\" | N.A. |\n| Lachlan Shaw | Analyst at UBS | \"This is not unusual seasonally, but we will need to monitor for disruptions over coming months.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
