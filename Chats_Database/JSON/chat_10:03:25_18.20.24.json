Element Zero was formed at the \nend of 2022.\nKolodziejczyk was once Fortescue Future Industries' chief scientist and led a push to develop green hydrogen to \ndecarbonise the company's mining operations and shipping fleet. Fortescue has since wound down its hydrogen \nambitions. Winther-Jensen was a former FFI scientist before he joined Element Zero. He left Element Zero in \nJanuary this year.\nIn court earlier this month, Fortescue was successful in preventing Element Zero's lawyers' attempt to access \ninstructions given to Lancasters Investigations. Element Zero's lawyers also lost an application to cross-examine \nDavies Collison Cave lawyer Paul Dewar over claims the law firm's initial evidence to the court to obtain the search \norders made material omissions, which might have damaged its application.\nDuring those hearings, Julian Cooke, senior counsel representing Fortescue, said his client's case had nothing to \ndo with the meetings between Fortescue and Element Zero in January this year, when it was said: \"Your process is \ndifferent to our process.\"\n\"That's not part of our case,\" Cook said. \"Our case is they worked on our dime on a confidential process, the ionic \nprocess which they then, without our permission, utilised in the Element Zero process. That's the third part of the \ncase. The second part of the case is then they took documents to develop - to construct and design their pilot \nplant.It has got nothing to do with any alleged similarities between our process and their process which we accept, \nnot dispute ...\"Page 3 of 3\nNew evidence in court case as Fortescue takes aim at smaller rival\nElement Zero said it wanted to reduce the carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 510 words\nHighlight: Weeks ago Fortescue dumped a target to be a major producer of green hydrogen by 2030, but Andrew \nForrest still insists his native Pilbara can supply the globe with green iron.\nBody\nJust weeks ago Fortescue shed 700 workers and dumped a target to be a major producer of green hydrogen by \n2030, but the miner's billionaire owner Andrew Forrest still insists his native Pilbara can supply the globe with green \niron.\nStraight from a dinner in China the night before, the company founder pointed to the red dirt at his feet at \nFortescue's Cloudbreak mine, said, \"this is rich iron,\" then turned his hand up to the blue sky and said, \"and that is \nenergy.\"\nLink to Image\nPeter Milne\nThe simple proposition of combining ample raw material and energy occurring in the same place will succeed or fail \non practicalities.\nWhen questioned about whether he is overly ambitious, Forrest always has the justified retort that many doubted if \nthen tiny Fortescue could break the BHP-Rio Tinto duopoly and become the third force in Pilbara iron ore mining.\nFortescue's $53 billion market capitalisation is proof he got it right, but Forrest's next challenge is tougher.\nHis first success, in iron ore, was as a late entrant into an existing business. This time he wants to be one of the first \nmovers into a sector that hardly exists outside the laboratory.\nSteelmaking produces by some counts 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Most of it is made from \niron ore - a mix of iron and oxygen - in huge integrated steel plants.\nFirst the oxygen is removed in a process called reduction, using coal for heat and to aid the chemical reaction. The \nresult is iron, and an enormous amount of carbon pollution. Next the iron is refined and turned into steel.\nForrest wants the first, most polluting part of the process, to be done in the Pilbara and to ship the zero-emissions \ngreen iron to the world.\nPage 2 of 2\nAndrew Forrest isn't giving up on his green iron Pilbara dream\nOn Friday he turned the first sod on what in 12 months' time is to be a $75 million electric smelting furnace to test \ndifferent ways of producing 1500 tonnes of green iron a year.\nRight now it is a flattened piece of dirt, but Fortescue was keen to show progress elsewhere. Zero-emissions iron \nneeds zero-emissions iron ore, and Fortescue is aiming for its mining to be fossil-fuel free by 2030.\nThat will require more than two gigawatts of solar and wind generation and massive battery storage to provide \nreliable power - enough for about a million homes, the company said.\nFortescue said the plant would use green hydrogen from one of the company's facilities, as well as an electric \nsmelting furnace.\nThe project milestone follows Fortescue's announcement last month that it would cut 700 jobs and merge its \nmining and energy divisions, as it also tempered its ambition to be a major producer of the clean fuel hydrogen.\nForrest has maintained he is committed to green hydrogen, and on Friday, West Australian Premier Roger Cook \nsaid hydrogen had an important role to play in remote areas such as mine sites.\n\"WA is on its way to becoming a global clean energy powerhouse, and a major producer, user and exporter of \ngreen iron,\" Cook said.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

The iron ore consumption doesn't go up in a straight direction, it has \na jiggered edge on an upwards curve and we're in one of those downward edges right now, but the trend will still be \nstrong.\n\"If you look at the big mega-trends out there, I'm not worried about their trends going up or down because they \nhappen to go up or down towards an upwards curve.\" According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, that \ncountry's steel production in July was 82.94 million tonnes, down 9 per cent on the previous month, as mills cut \nback due to subdued demand, lacklustre prices and tightening margins.\nIron ore's price has dropped to its lowest level since November 2022, $US95.25 a tonne, after topping $US144 a \ntonne on January 3, and the downturn has put pressure on major Australian iron ore -producers.\nDr Forrest was in the Pilbara on Friday showcasing his new green hydrogen technology, declaring it could easily be \n\"Australia's biggest ever industry.\" Fortescue's mission to build a sustainable iron supply chain in Western Australia \nkicked off on Friday with the founder showing off their latest hydrogen-powered technology at the green energy hub \nat Christmas Creek mine.\nThe $US50m project is expected to produce more than 1500 -tonnes per annum of green iron metal, with \nproduction anticipated in 2025. But while demand for the metal hit a near two-year low after China pulled back its \norders, Dr Forrest said he was not fazed.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest shrugs off iron ore price pullback\n\"I just came back from China where I went to ascertain with our leaders, with China's leaders, where they want to \ngo with green metals,\" he said.\n\"The pollution over the skies of China isn't sustainable. They need to keep on building their cities but if they can do \nit in a way that doesn't cause any harm then they're going to take that shot.\" The Christmas Creek processing plant \nwill use green hydrogen produced at Fortescue's gaseous and liquid hydrogen facility, the largest of its kind in \nAustralia, together with an electric smelting furnace to produce high purity green iron. Once established, the \ncompany hopes to supply the final product to almost any steel plant globally.\nDr Forrest in July abandoned ambitious green -hydrogen targets in a major -business backdown, pulling back from \nthe company's goal of producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030.\nStanding behind the all-new hydrogen-powered haul truck prototype, dubbed \"Europa\", Dr Forrest said that once \nthe old fleet of 80 trucks was replaced, the company would save about 4500 litres of diesel everyday, eliminating up \nto three million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year.\nClean-burning hydrogen has been hailed as a potential solution to a range of climate-related energy challenges, \nfrom fuelling trucks to generating electricity.\nVery little hydrogen is produced from sustainable energy sources today; most is made using natural gas and fossil \nfuels.\nFortescue plans to use solar or wind energy to power electrolysers that split water into hydrogen and oxygen. \nProducing hydrogen as an economically viable energy source in Australia is high on Dr Forrest's priority list, but he \ncould not estimate when that would happen.\n\"Oil is about $80 a barrel now. When oil started, let's be clear, it started at equivalent dollars of $1600 a barrel, like, \nyou know, 20 times current.\n\"Industries don't start at really economic prices and then bingo,\" he said. The billionaire was joined by Fortescue \nMetals chief executive Dino Otranto for a ceremony to mark the start of civil works at the site.\n\"Hydrogen and fuels made using renewable energy will have a role to play in decarbonising mining, whether it's in \nbuses, heavy mining equipment such as haul trucks and excavators, or producing green iron,\" Mr Otranto said. \n\"This renewable hydrogen plant is versatile, enabling us to produce gaseous and liquid hydrogen to be used to \npower our mining equipment prototypes, while also providing the added benefit of refuelling our fleet of coaches at \nChristmas Creek.\" Dr Forrest also celebrated awarding $5bn to 200 First Nations businesses through the Billion \nOpportunities Program, which was established in 2011.\n\"This program has really been a game changer for us and it wouldn't be where it is today without the dedication of \nall of you - our First Nations business partners, and the incredible Fortescue team driving forward this -initiative.\" \nThe reporter travelled to WA as a guest of Fortescue.\nLoad-Date: August 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Mohammad Alfares\nDate: August 17, 2024\nTitle: Forrest shrugs off iron ore price pullback\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Execs raided in Fortescue's 'industrial-scale debacle'\n## Media outlet: AAP Newsfeed\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: August 19, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nFED:Execs raided in Fortescue's 'industrial-scale debacle'\nFED:Execs raided in Fortescue's 'industrial-scale debacle'\nAAP Newsfeed\nAugust 19, 2024 Monday 5:09 PM AEST\nCopyright 2024 Australian Associated Press Pty.
