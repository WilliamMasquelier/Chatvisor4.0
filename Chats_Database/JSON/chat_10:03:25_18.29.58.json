Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Street Talk; Pg. 14\nLength: 246 words\nByline: Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood and Emma Rapaport\nBody\nAnother Monday, another move on Spartan Resources' register.\nStreet Talk spotted three trades in the West Australian gold explorer after yesterday's closing bell.\nAround 100 million shares swapped hands at 92\u00a2 per share - a slim discount to the close price of 93.5\u00a2.\nRamelius Resources is the obvious party people are pointing to.\nThe $2.3 billion listed gold miner was outed as Spartan Resources mystery raider on Thursday, picking up 8.9 per \ncent of the company via Citi's equities desk in an after-market raid.\nHowever, with Spartan now in play, it's difficult to rule out another party seeking to hoover up stock.\nMajor Spartan shareholder Tembo Capital reduced its holding by 5 per cent as revealed in a substantial holding \nannouncement last week.\nSpartan had a $1.1 billion market capitalisation and has run up a whopping 392 per cent in the past 12 months. In \nApril, the company raised $80 million via Canaccord Genuity, Euroz Hartleys and Sternship Advisers.\nIts share price has been a rollercoaster ride for investors, who have had to sit through a few recaps as its \nDalgaranga mine stuttered through exploration.\nThe gold space has seen a flurry of activity in recent months, most recently Westgold Resources taking an 18.70 \nper cent stake in Ora Gold in early June. Meanwhile, Street Talk reported that Ramelius Resources had \napproached $1 billion Westgold Resources to discuss a merger proposal, in a deal that could be the sector's \nbiggest amid a recent wave of consolidation.\nLoad-Date: July 4, 2024\nPage 2 of 2\nBig lick of Spartan Resources trades again, eyes on Ramelius Street Talk\nEnd of Document\n        ",
