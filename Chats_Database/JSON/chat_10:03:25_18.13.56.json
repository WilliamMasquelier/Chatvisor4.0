The scale of the projects we are doing now is 10-fold bigger than they were \neven five years ago.\"\nQuinbrook remains agnostic about the cable side of Sun Cable - a 4200-kilometre undersea transmission cable that \nwould connect Darwin and Singapore - and is focused on delivering its end of the bargain in the form of giant solar \nfarms and onshore transmission infrastructure. It is working with potential customers within the NT government's \nMiddle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct adjacent to the port, where Fortescue and French oil and gas major \nTotal have been allocated land for green hydrogen projects. Mr Scaysbrook said if Mr Cannon-Brookes' Grok \nVentures succeeded with the cable component to Sun Cable, Quinbrook would build more solar capacity to meet \nthe extra demand.\n\"Our job is to lead the development, and then we have an option to invest equity in the onshore component.\n\"Once we can prove up the delivered cost of renewable power into the MASDP, and we're getting closer to being \nable to do that, then we can say to industry that wants to locate there, 'this is what your power cost is going to be', \nremembering that just one of these factories will consume two to three times more power than the NT currently \nproduces.\"\nLast year, the NT government set aside land at the Middle Arm precinct for Fortescue and Total as well as \nBeetaloo Basin gas field developer Tamboran Resources, vanadium play Tivan and phosphate-focused Avenira.\nMr Scaysbrook said Quinbrook was focused on the NT and north Queensland, where it's looking for backers for a \n$10 billion polysilicon plant at the Lansdown eco-industrial precinct in Townsville that would supply solar panel \nmanufacturers.\nLoad-Date: February 11, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Brad Thompson\nDate: February 09, 2024\nTitle: Sun Cable key player's doubts on Fortescue\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: New chief executive pays price\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Nick Evans\n### Date: February 10, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 3\nNew chief executive pays price\nNew chief executive pays price\nThe Australian\nFebruary 10, 2024 Saturday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 26\nLength: 1187 words\nByline: NICK EVANS, MARGIN CALL\nBody\nIf it wasn't enough that PwC's tax advice scandal trashed the firm's reputation and forced the outsourcing of its \nlucrative government services arm, it has also heaped a fresh humiliation on new PwC chief executive Kevin \nBurrowes, costing the PwC supremo his ranking on the professional services pay ladder.",
