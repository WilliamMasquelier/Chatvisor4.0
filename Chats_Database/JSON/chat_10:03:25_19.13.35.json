Fortescue won court orders to carry out raids in May after it was alleged Element \nZero's Dr Kolodziejczyk, Dr Winther-Jensen and Michael Masterman stole Fortescue's carbon-dioxide-free green \niron tech-nology secrets when they all quit several years ago.\nDespite elements of the court case remaining suppressed, fresh documents released on Friday revealed Element \nZero's concern that an \"extraordinarily large volume\" of electronic material - more than three terabytes - belonging \nto its young business was captured during the searches.\nElement Zero's Gilbert & Tobin lawyer Michael Williams said virtually the entirety of Ele-ment Zero's documents and \nemails were seized, \"together with highly confidential and privileged material\" that was \"entirely unrelated to \nFortescue's pleaded claim\". The entire contents of Dr Kolodziejczyk's mobile was downloaded, including photos \nand videos, and about 3TB of data was captured, which Mr Williams said was \"an extremely large volume\" to be \ncaught under Anton Piller search orders in his experience.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue 'seized personal details'\nFurther, he said there were grounds for the search orders to be scrapped based on \"the apparent extraordinary \ninvasion of the privacy of the respondents\".\n\"I am informed by Mr Masterman and believe that, as a result of how the search orders are drafted and executed \nthey will have captured a very large amount of information that is confidential, privileged, and not likely to be \nrelevant to these proceedings,\" Mr Williams said.\n\"The search orders will have captured material that is ... highly confidential to third parties including competitors of \nFortescue.\" As well, Mr William said he believed images taken of Dr Kolodziejczyk's phone would have captured \ndata including passwords for online banking and superannuation.\nAccording to a summary of Fortescue's arguments, staff became suspicious about the activities of the three men \nafter they realised Mr Masterman was working with Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen in September, that \nthey incorporated Element Zero, which was \"potentially developing technology that is similar to technology \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \ndeveloped for Fortescue\", and that Element Zero was \"seeking the supply of iron ore samples from Fortescue to \nhelp test (Element Zero's) technology\".\nA story published in the Australian Financial Review on January 17 kicked off their concerns.\n\"The AFR article set in train a line of inquiry at Fortescue, which involved reviewing the projects that Dr \nKolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen had been working on, and investigating their Fortescue email inboxes, group \nSharePoint folder and two laptops on suspicion of IP leakage,\" the summary read.\nAfter Dr Kolodziejczyk resigned in October 2021, he attended a meeting at which he was told he could not work at \nFortescue's office to finish his notice period. Dr Kolodziejczyk was told he could \"make copies and use documents \nhe needed\" to wrap up and that he should delete \"everything\" saved locally on his Fortescue laptop before he \nreturned it because the company had copies on SharePoint. He continued to work on patent applications for \nFortescue up until he left the company, court documents said.\nLoad-Date: July 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
