Fortescue has promised to end its use of fossil fuels by the end of the decade and \nbecome a \"real zero\" emitter of carbon. But to do that the company has said it needs 2 to 3 gigawatt of renewable \nenergy generation, along with battery firming.\nSo far Fortescue has only committed to a 100 megawatt solar farm at its Iron Bridge magnetite operation and a \n60MW solar farm at its Chichester iron ore mine. But last year, as part of an investor tour of its operations, \nFortescue flagged plans to build a gigawatt of both solar and wind generation around its mines, as well as up to \n4GWh of battery storage.\nSpeaking to analysts on Thursday, however, Mr Hutchinson said the company had held discussions with the \nproponents of AREH, as well as other potential renewable energy providers in the region.\nAREH is 48 per cent owned by fossil fuel giant BP, and includes Macquarie, CWP Global and Intercontinental \nEnergy as joint venture partners. The consortium plans to build a giant 26GW of combined solar and wind power on \na 6500 sq km site north east of the Port Hedland iron ore export hub.\n\"We are talking to many parties including the BP and Intercontinental Energy team and will continue to do so,\" Mr \nHutchinson said. \"This is one ecosystem which we want to make sure gets developed in Australia. And we want to \nmake sure we also have the most efficient energy for our own use. So we'll continue to have discussions with a \nnumber of different parties.\" Last year Rio Tinto also switched its Pilbara renewable energy strategy to include third \nparty energy providers, partly citing tight supply chains and intense competition for solar and wind energy \ngeneration equipment.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue in talks over power deal\nMr Hutchinson's comments came after Fortescue declared another bumper dividend on the back of last year's \nsurge in the iron ore price, delivering holders a $1.08 a share interim dividend after declaring a $US3.3bn net profit \nfor the half.\nThe dividend represents a payout of 65 per cent of the company's first-half profit, and comes after Fortescue \nbooked earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $US5.9bn, up 36 per cent on the \nfirst half of the previous financial year. Fortescue's energy division booked a $US320m EBITDA loss for the half, \nup from a $US302m loss in the first half of the previous financial year.\nThe energy division now includes UK technology business WAE, which booked revenue of about $US26m for the \nyear.\nFortescue's policy is to pay out 50 to 80 per cent of its net profit in dividends, and the mid-range payment - the \nsame as its total payout ratio across last financial year - comes as the company looks to ramp up spending on its \nPilbara iron ore mines and its green energy projects. The iron ore giant spent $US1.52bn on capital projects in the \nfirst half of the financial year, with about $US1bn of that on sustaining capital for its existing Pilbara miners.\nAnother $US165m was spent on Fortescue Energy projects across the globe, and another $US104m on \ndecarbonising the company's iron ore operations.\nFortescue says it expects to spend $US3.3bn to $US3.7bn in capital for the full financial year, with about $US500m \nof that to go towards green energy projects and $US300m to $US500m on decarbonisation.\nFortescue's first-half result comes after the company received an average $US108 a dry tonne for its iron ore \nshipments in the half, up from $US87 a tonne in the prior corresponding period, with the group booking $US9.5bn in \nrevenue, up 21 per cent.\nCash production costs lifted 2 per cent to $US17.77 a wet tonne for the period as Fortescue kept inflationary \npressures in the Pilbara largely under control.\nCiti analyst Paul McTaggart said the results had beaten analyst consensus estimates of a $US5.6bn EBITDA and a \n$1.04 dividend.

On social media, \nhe blamed the amount of travel away from his base in Darwin following a promotion last year.\nA revolving door of executives have jumped ship from the company in the past 12 months as pressure grows on \nFortescue to execute a high-stakes pivot to green energy from its iron ore foundations that made its founder one of \nAustralia's richest men.\nIn August last year, Fortescue's chief executive, Fiona Hick, and chief financial officer Christine Morris both quit, \nwhile Dr Debelle resigned as a director of Fortescue Future Industries.\nDr Forrest last year said executives who had left the iron ore major had struggled to cope with the -\"boiler room\" \nconditions of the company and were not following his green vision.\nHowever, Dr Forrest said on Monday that a degree of turnover was expected as the company transitioned from a \npure iron ore producer to a green energy company with lofty global renewable hydrogen ambitions.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest blames green move for executive exodus\n\"The reason is we want to continue that track record.

Mr Wilson's decision comes only a few months after the \ndeparture of co-company secretary and Fortescue general counsel Gemma Tually, who stepped down from the \nrole in November last year.\nThis year Fortescue Energy also lost the services of chief -financial officer Deborah Caudle, less than five months \nafter she was appointed to the role, with former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also formally severing ties with the \ncompany, and external affairs boss Fiona Sugden leaving to join the office of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. \nFortescue has promised to end its use of fossil fuels by the end of the decade and become a \"real zero\" emitter of \ncarbon.\nLoad-Date: February 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Rosie Lewis\nDate: February 27, 2024\nTitle: Forrest blames green move for executive exodus\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Magmatic Resources draws mining giant Fortescue into farm-in and JV for Myall Project\n## Media outlet: Proactive Investors\n### Author: Phoebe Shields\n### Date: March 07, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nMagmatic Resources draws mining giant Fortescue into farm-in and JV for Myall Project\nMagmatic Resources draws mining giant Fortescue into farm-in and JV for \nMyall Project\n \nProactive Investors (AU)\nMarch 7, 2024 Thursday 10:10 PM EST\nCopyright 2024 Proactive UK Ltd All Rights Reserved\nLength: 300 words\nByline: Phoebe Shields\nBody\nMagmatic Resources Ltd (ASX:MAG) has garnered strong support from one of the biggest names in Australian \nmining, executing a farm-in and joint venture agreement with FMG Resources Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Fortescue \nLtd (ASX:FMG).\nUnder the agreement, Fortescue will commit $14 million over a six-year period to earn up to a 75% interest in the \nMyall Project.\nAt Myall, MAG is exploring for copper and gold, having already generated a resource estimate containing 293,000 \ntonnes of copper, 237,000 ounces of gold and 2.8 million ounces of silver for the Corvette and Kingswood \nProspects.\nMagmatic subsidiary Modeling Resources Pty Ltd will remain the operator of the project during the initial period of \nthe farm-in for up to four years.\nFortescue has also opted to become a cornerstone investor in Magmatic, buying almost 76 million shares for $3.17 \nmillion (a 10% premium) to hold a 19.9% stake in the company.\nSignatures of a Tier-1 deposit\n\"We are excited to joint venture and partner with Fortescue to advance our exploration efforts across the Myall \nProject area,\" Magmatic Resources executive chair David Richardson said.\nPage 2 of 2\nMagmatic Resources draws mining giant Fortescue into farm-in and JV for Myall Project\n\"Myall has many of the signatures of a Tier 1 copper-gold deposit and Magmatic has recognised the need to partner \nwith a major to further advance the project following the maiden resource.\n\"Fortescue's cornerstone investment in MAG will allow the Company to simultaneously advance our other two \nprojects at Wellington North and Parkes which are strategically located near Alkane Resources Boda-Kaiser \ndeposits and Tomingley Gold Operations respectively.\"\nThe proceeds from Fortescue's stock purchase will go to exploration at the Wellington North and Parkes Projects, \nwhich surround Alkane Resources' Boda-Kaiser deposits with a mineral resource of 15.7 million ounces gold \nequivalent.\nLoad-Date: March 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Proactive Investors\nAuthor: Phoebe Shields\nDate: March 07, 2024\nTitle: Magmatic Resources draws mining giant Fortescue into farm-in and JV for Myall Project\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Fortescue's NSW copper punt with Magmatic Metals\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Peter Ker\n### Date: March 09, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nFortescue's NSW copper punt with Magmatic Metals\nFortescue's NSW copper punt with Magmatic; Metals\nAustralian Financial Review\nMarch 9, 2024 Saturday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Under that scenario, Fortescue would emerge with 19.9 per cent of Magmatic and 75 per cent ownership \nof the Myall project.

I think things will settle down.\" The comments came just weeks after Dr Forrest \nrejected suggestions the company has faced upheaval and the green agenda has been a catalyst for the exits.\n\"We employ 22,000 people. When you go from a fossil fuel-burning company to a green energy company, you're \ngoing to lose people who say, 'what are you doing? You've got this fantastic economic model. You have the most \nsuccessful company shareholder returns in decades in our company. Why are you fiddling around with it?' \" said Dr \nForrest.\nMr Otranto acknowledged the commitment to renewable energy had been a concern to many within the \norganisation.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue exodus blamed on culture\n\"Eighteen months ago when we announced the pivot into green energy, we were a bit anxious, to be honest,\" said \nMr Otranto.\nFortescue is aiming to capitalise on demand for zero-emission energy sources, but there is broad concern about \nthe capacity of many countries to meet emissions targets as new renewable energy generation projects take longer \nthan expected to materialise. The sluggish transition has fuelled fierce debate about the possibility of nuclear \nenergy.\nIt is currently banned in Australia, but the Coalition has proposed using small modular nuclear reactors to replace \ncoal-fired power.\nThe Coalition insists nuclear power is the only viable means to achieve Australia's 2050 net zero emission targets, \nbut federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen insists independent evidence shows the fuel source remains prohibitively \nexpensive.\nDr Forrest has rejected the nuclear plan, insisting it amounts to \"dividing us with the false hope that we can cling to \nfossil fuels forever\". Echoing his boss, Mr Hutchinson said nuclear power was \"not the answer\", and Australia \nshould instead focus on plentiful opportunities in renewable energy.",
