committee for the Myall Project farm-in and joint venture between Magmatic Resources \nLtd (ASX:MAG) and Fortescue's FMG Resources Pty Ltd has approved the JV's initial work program.\nThis committee has agreed to a two-phase work program for Myall in the Lachlan Fold Belt of central New South \nWales for the 2024/2025 Financial Year.\nThe farm-in and JV agreement that Magmatic executed in March with FMG Resources will see the Fortescue \nsubsidiary spend up to $14 million over six years to earn up to a 75% interest in the Myall Project.\nAn initial 51% interest can be earned by incurring $6 million in exploration expenditure over the first four-year \nperiod, with a minimum obligation of $3 million expenditure and 3,000 metres of drilling within the first two years. \nAs a part of the farm-in and JV, Magmatic and Fortescue recently formed an exploration committee comprising \nrepresentatives of both companies to direct exploration efforts. \nAfter a review of past exploration activity and available datasets, the exploration committee has agreed to an \nexploration work program and budget for the coming financial year. \nA two-phase work program at Myall\nThe exploration committee has agreed to a two-phase work program.\nPhase 1: \nPage 2 of 2\nMagmatic Resources new JV with Fortescue for Myall Project approves initial work program\n  \n\u2022 Historic core and drill

Corvette/Kingswood in the west and at Monaro Prospect \nin the east.   \n\u2022 Existing geophysical datasets will be reprocessed and integrated with the updated geochemical datasets.   \n\u2022 A detailed study of the immediate Corvette/Kingswood area will also be undertaken to identify potential \nvectors towards higher-grade copper-gold mineralisation. \nPhase 2:\n  \n\u2022 Six diamond holes, each 400-500 metres in depth, in the greater Corvette/Kingswood region in the western \nportion of the project area.  \n\u2022 Diamond holes are expected to test multiple prospect areas, with final targets and drill hole designs to be \nagreed following the integration of results from the Phase 1 work.\nNext chapter commences\nThe company advises that work on Phase 1 has commenced, with most on-ground exploration activities expected \nto be completed by the end of this year subject to access and weather conditions.\nMagmatic Resources managing director Dr Adam McKinnon said: \"With a work program now in place for the \nproject, I am excited to see the next chapter for Myall commence in partnership with Fortescue. \n\"Our technical team has done an excellent job over the last two years in unravelling some of the key geological \ncomplexities of the region and in defining a major copper-gold system at Corvette and Kingswood. \n\"We very much look forward to building on this work with Fortescue's technical input and unlocking the enormous \ncopper-gold discovery potential the Myall Project holds.\" \nThe company notes that the program at Myall will occur in parallel with
