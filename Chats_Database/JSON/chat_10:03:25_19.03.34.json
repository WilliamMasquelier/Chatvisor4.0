Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 19\nLength: 500 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue says the proposed design of the Biden administration's green incentives scheme could triple the cost of \nlow-carbon hydrogen projects and stifle growth in the sector.\nThe iron ore group has an ambitious strategy to become a major force in hydrogen and renewable energy, and has \npreviously outlined plans to build a $US550 million ($857 million) green hydrogen project in Arizona.\nIts criticisms of the draft eligibility rules come ahead of Fortescue's quarterly update on Wednesday, when it is \nexpected to outline whether they will force changes to the Arizona plant.\nHydrogen can be made with zero carbon emissions if renewable electricity is passed through water by a machine \ncalled an electrolyser.\nFortescue was hoping to use tax credits delivered as part of the $US369 billion Inflation Reduction Act, which is \nexpected would almost halve the cost of some projects in the United States.\nBut Fortescue's enthusiasm has waned since the US Treasury issued draft regulations known as \"45V\" which \nprovide the detail on eligibility for the tax credits. Fortescue's biggest problem is the requirement that companies \nmatch each hour of production to an hour of renewable power generation and consumption to be eligible.\nThe rule is designed to ensure that subsidies are not given to hydrogen made from fossil fuels when solar and wind \npower are not available.\nThe \"hourly matching\" rule will force hydrogen producers to either cease production when renewables are not \navailable - undermining productivity and viability - or sign up for excess renewable power from diverse sources to \nimprove the chances of having clean energy available at all times.\nFortescue has urged the government to instead consider \"annual matching\" - a system that would allow a producer \nto rely on non-renewable power at times, so long as it sourced extra renewable power at other times and ultimately \nconsumed as much power as it generated over the course of a year.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue slams Biden hydrogen incentive rules\nIn submissions to Treasury, Fortescue has warned that \"hourly matching\" would increase the cost of an 80-\nmegawatt green hydrogen facility by \"between 140 and 200 per cent\". The comment appears to be a reference to \nFortescue's Arizona project, which will be an 80-megawatt plant that makes green hydrogen for refuelling trucks.\nAsked by The Australian Financial Review whether the unfavourable draft rules would force Fortescue to alter the \nscope of the approved Arizona project, a spokesman signalled there were unlikely to be changes until the eligibility \nrules were finalised.\n\"When 45V guidelines are finalised, we will assess how they impact our US operations and make the decisions \nnecessary to ensure our green energy projects are economic and profitable,\" he said. \"Fortescue believes with or \nwithout government incentives there will be a place for green hydrogen and green ammonia projects in the US.\"\nThe questions about eligibility are an example of how the details of the IRA are still being thrashed out, almost two \nyears after legislation passed Congress.\nLoad-Date: April 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\nNone\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
