More specifically, discussions are well advanced with two green energy projects about \nland in the precinct which combined are expected to require slightly more land than what was previously proposed \nby Fortescue.\" The government said Not to Deal commitments for initial proponents TEH2, Tivan, Tamboran and \nAvenira remain in place.\nMiddle Arm is the Territory government's most consequential major project which, if successfully developed, could \ndeliver 20,000 direct and indirect jobs to the economy and millions in revenue and royalties. A visionary plan, \nMiddle Arm defies the historic challenge of securing major projects by offering developers the land, infrastructure \nand regulatory environment of a joint user facility to get hundred-million-dollar-plus developments off the ground.\nCanberra-focused anti-development activists including senators David Pocock and Lidia Thorpe have opposed the \ndevelopment, implying the Territory, unlike anywhere else in Australia, should be excluded from job-creating, \nwealth-generating projects.\nWhile the agreements are intended to provide proponents with confidence and certainty to continue developing their \nproposals, the government said, final land allocation within Middle Arm is subject to key project milestones and \napprovals, specific to each proponent project.\nThe Middle Arm peninsula is already home to the Santos Darwin LNG and the INPEX Ichthys LNG processing \nfacilities. Both companies are committed to net zero emissions. While the government attempts to secure \ndevelopment at Middle Arm, it's also wrestling with seemingly constant delays on its $500m ship lift project while \nwork continues on two other Top End major projects - the Tiger Brennan Drive overpass and the State Square art \ngallery.\nAfter almost a decade, the government said it was preparing to start work at the Alice Springs Indigenous art \ngallery. In the private sector Tamboran Resources and Empire Energy are continuing work in the Beetaloo Basin, \nhoping for first production next year, Grok is developing Sun Cable and in Central Australian Arafura Rare Earths \ncontinues to progress the Nolans project, underpinned with an $840m Commonwealth loan.\nLoad-Date: July 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Michael Gunner | Former Chief Minister | \"His resignation was one of a number of high profile departures from Fortescue.\" | N.A. |\n| Guy Debelle | Former Chief Financial Officer | \"His resignation was one of a number of high profile departures from Fortescue.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
