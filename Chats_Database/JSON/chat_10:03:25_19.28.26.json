Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's founder | \"Her Honour is reading that material and no doubt thinking this is a classic former employee case that people on the way out the door \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 having resigned, have made off with highly confidential information.\" | N.A. |\n| Bart Kolodziejczyk | Former Fortescue chief scientist | \"That phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 cannot be excused as a throwaway line or a barrister flourish. Her Honour was being informed from the outset \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 that in effect the respondents were dishonest.\" | N.A. |\n| Bjorn Winther-Jensen | Staff member at Fortescue | \"The material non-disclosure and inaccurate and misleading information put before the court caused Her Honour \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to find a strong primary case contrary to the true position.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Long-term Andrew Forrest lieutenant | \"The fact is you can't undo what's been done.\" | N.A. |\n| David Studdy SC | Element Zero barrister | \"There was no evidence they actually took documents, stole or made off with (the documents) unlawfully.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke | Fortescue's barrister | \"The extraordinary legal fight between Fortescue and Element Zero was revealed in July, weeks after the raids were carried out.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
