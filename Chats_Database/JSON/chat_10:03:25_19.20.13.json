Less than \nthree hours later, Forrest's Fortescue Metals told investors it was kicking its target down the road from 2030 to a \ndestination one stop short of Never Never Land. In the meantime, Fortescue will concentrate on what it does best: \ndigging stuff out of the ground instead of building castles in the air.\n\"Reports of the death of green hydrogen have been greatly exaggerated,\" said Bowen. Fortescue may have \"de-\nprioritised\" green hydrogen, but $200bn of investment was \"in the pipeline\". That's renewable energy speak for \"the \ncheque is in the mail\".\nA Boston Consulting survey, published last September, found that 824 green hydrogen projects with a theoretical \ncapacity of 21 million tonnes a year were in the pipeline in North America and Europe. But only 2 per cent of the \nannounced capacity reached the planning stage, and just 0.2 per cent were completed.\nGlobal energy companies are rethinking the wisdom of pumping billions of dollars of capital into an unproven \ntechnology with uncertain timing and no guaranteed rate of return. Statkraft, the Norwegian hydro-electricity giant, \nrolled back its plans last month. \"We have definitely underestimated the challenges,\" a company spokesman said. \n\"Developing green hydrogen has become much more expensive than we expected.\" Earlier this year, French \nenergy giant Engie dropped plans to build a green hydrogen plant in Portugal. Only this month, the European Court \nof Auditors criticised the European Union's 2030 green hydrogen production target of 10 million tonnes as \n\"overambitious\", saying it was unlikely to be met and, therefore, shouldn't be included in carbon reduction \ncalculations.\nIt's been less than three years since Forrest boasted about spending $1bn to build the world's largest green \nhydrogen electrolyser manufacturing plant in Gladstone, Queensland.\nPage 2 of 3\nBowen lost in a Forrest of green energy hubris\nForrest explained his plans to convert the Gibson Island ammonia factory in Brisbane to run on green hydrogen. He \nalso committed to building the world's first green hydrogen import and export facility at Port Kembla, linked to a \npower station fired by \"the miracle molecule \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. clean as the day is long \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 crystal clean, green hydrogen made \nright here at home\".\nMuch nonsense has been spoken at the National Press Club over the years, but seldom have journalists been \ntaken on a flight of fancy quite as crazy as the one piloted by Forrest back in October 2021. \"To make green \nhydrogen, you simply split water,\" he said. \"Any old water \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It can be wastewater, desalinated water, sea water \ninto hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity only.\n\"It's like a miracle molecule, the Swiss Army knife of energy and green products, versatile and able to decarbonise \neven the most challenging sectors, like, say, iron ore, cement, steel, iron fertilisers, aeroplanes, trucks, trains, cars.\" \nWe now know all this was pure fantasy. The multibillion-dollar projects he promised were technologically unproven \nand economically unfeasible. There was barely a dollar of committed finance behind them and only the flimsiest of \nbusiness cases.\nWe shouldn't be surprised. Hydrogen has been breaking hearts since 1766, when Henry Cavendish described the \nproduction of \"inflammable air\" by reacting zinc metal with hydrochloric acid. Try as they might, technologists have \nnever overcome hydrogen's fatal flaw: whatever hydrogen is asked to do, another technology will do it better, safer \nand cheaper.\nForrest's 2021 expectations about the cost of green hydrogen were somewhat wide of the mark. The cost had \nhalved, he claimed, because \"unlike fossil fuels, green hydrogen was becoming cheaper and would never run out\".\nLast week he told Nine Radio in Perth: \"We just have to work out now how to produce it cheaply enough.\" The \ncollapse of the green hydrogen bubble is a double blow for Bowen.\nGreen hydrogen manufacturing and the proposed Sun Cable solar development were supposed to provide the \nportable energy that would turn Australia into a renewable energy export power by the end of the decade. Neither \nproject is going to happen, certainly not by 2030. The collapse of the business case for green hydrogen puts the lie \nto Bowen's claim that renewable energy is cheap.\nHours before the Fortescue announcement, he was repeating his trite line at the National Press Club. Yet even \nBowen's cheer squad now doubts the claim, if it is not ready to abandon all of the hopes for a renewable future. \nGreen hydrogen still had a great future, an opinion article in Renew Economy claimed. It's just there was \"limited \naccess to the large amounts of low-cost renewable energy\". Quite.\nMany of us have been making that point for some time. The lesson for Bowen from the green hydrogen debacle is \nthat he should stop clogging his diary with carpet-bagging time-wasters and stick with the technology that actually \nexists. Bowen will never get back the hours he's spent listening to the green hydrogen salesmen peddling miracle \ncures for the planet, just as taxpayers are unlikely to see a return on the billions of dollars of poorly scoped \nsubsidies pushed their way.\nYet Bowen is part of a government that believes it understands capital allocation better than the markets. Its \nTreasurer has fallen for the neo-Marxist fantasy of values-based capitalism and the delusion that innovation should \nbe driven by the state.\nIt has a Finance Minister who lacks the wisdom to ask tough questions and a Prime Minister content to leave the \ndetails to others. Labor will respond to Fortescue's misadventures by throwing more money into its Hydrogen \nHeadstart program and associated corporate welfare schemes designed to bridge the gap between the cost of \nmanufacturing green hydrogen and the amount customers are willing to pay.\nAustralia will be caught up in the global sugar war, competing with governments in Europe and North America to \npile more sugar on the table. However, it will not have the advantage of cheap energy enjoyed by countries blessed \nwith abundant hydro-electricity or in which nuclear power is legal.Page 3 of 3\nBowen lost in a Forrest of green energy hubris\nPoliticians and entrepreneurs may be equally prone to the cognitive biases that allow bad ideas to hang around \nlong after they should've been dismissed. The redeeming grace of entrepreneurs is the profit motive, which tells \nthem when to stop throwing good money after bad.
