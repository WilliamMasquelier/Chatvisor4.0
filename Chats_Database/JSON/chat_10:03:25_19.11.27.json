Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Paul Eremenko | Founder of Universal Hydrogen | \"We have test aircraft flying, certification basis, we know the economics of the hydrogen plane are favourable, but there is still a two-year path for certification ... That means you have to keep the development program fed and there's a very small quorum of money that's in the middle.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Rich Lister and early-stage minority investor in Universal Hydrogen | \"There remains significant interest in our green energy projects and the prospect of green hydrogen and its derivatives.\" | N.A. |\n| Peter Barrett | Director of Universal Hydrogen | \"Last year wasn't a good time to raise money, we had a lead for a very significant round, but that lead [investor] was unable to fund it.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
