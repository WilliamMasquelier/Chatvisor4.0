Shell previously expected LNG volumes of 6.7 million-\n7.3 million tonnes.\nGains from integrated gas trading are expected to be significantly higher quarter-on-quarter, while the trading result \nfrom chemicals and crude oil refineries is seen to be significantly lower. The former segment was expected to make \nan adjusted earnings loss, the company said.\nHowever, the expected uptick in fourth-quarter gas trading comes despite declining oil and gas prices throughout \nthe period, with oil hitting a five-month low in early December, reflecting supply and demand concerns despite \nsupport from geopolitical uncertainty.\nUpstream production - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - is expected to meet the guided range of 1.75 \nmillion to 1.95 million BOE a day at 1.83 million to 1.93 million a day. It reported 1.75 million BOE a day in the third \nquarter.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell takes earnings hit of up to $7.7bn in quarter\nElsewhere, Saudi Aramco said it would cut crude prices to all regions, including its largest market in Asia - a move \nthat comes amid weaker global oil prices and increased production by producers outside the Organisation of the \nPetroleum Exporting Countries.\nAfter a summer rally attributed in large part to Saudi Arabia's decision to implement a production cut of one million \nbarrels a day on top of existing cuts by other members of OPEC and its allies, including Russia, crude fell sharply in \nthe fourth quarter. Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ have extended cuts into 2023.\nWest Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, fell more than 21 per cent in the fourth quarter of the calendar \nyear to post a 2023 decline of 10.7 per cent. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell around 19 per cent in the fourth \nquarter to lose 10.3 per cent in 2023.
