Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 12\nLength: 480 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue is holding on to hopes of shipping record iron ore volumes in 2023-24 after it reported a 41 per cent rise \nin first-half net profit to $US3.33 billion ($5.1 billion) on the back of stronger-than-expected iron ore prices.\nBut its goal of setting a fifth consecutive record looks to be challenged, with the miner shipping 2 per cent less ore \nin the six months to December 31 than in the same period last year.\nA train derailment in December added to the challenge, and Fortescue mining boss Dino Otranto said the fallout \nfrom the accident had continued to affect productivity in January.\nThe result was slightly better than analysts expected and came with a fully franked $1.08 interim dividend to be paid \non March 27.\nThe dividend was equivalent to 2022-23's payout ratio of 65 per cent, but 44 per cent higher than the 75\u00a2 declared \nthis time last year.\nThe dividend is worth $1.22 billion to the family interests of Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest and Nicola Forrest, \nwho separated last year.\nBarrenjoey analyst Glyn Lawcock had expected Fortescue to report a $US3.2 billion interim profit.\nSpeaking from Libreville in Gabon, Mr Otranto refused to give up on Fortescue's goal of shipping between 192 \nmillion and 197 million tonnes in the year to June. Fortescue is developing an iron ore project in Belinga, Gabon, \non the west coast of Africa.\n\"The remaining 4&#xBD; months are big months for us, we acknowledge that, but nothing we haven't achieved \nbefore,\" he said. Fortescue shipped 192 million tonnes last year.\nFortescue's nascent clean energy division reported $US26 million of revenue in the period and lost $US320 million \nat the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation level.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue's iron ore record hopes intact\nFortescue expects to spend $US500 million on clean energy projects in the year to June, while the clean energy \ndivision will also spend about $US800 million on operating expenditure.\nThe division had promised to put five projects before the Fortescue board for a final investment decision before \nChristmas.\nThat process saw the commissioning of a $US550 million green hydrogen refuelling station near Phoenix, Arizona, \nand a $US150 million plant that will make green hydrogen beside Fortescue's electrolyser factory near Gladstone.\nA $US50 million \"trial\" plant to make green iron in the Pilbara was also commissioned by Fortescue last year.\nAsked about the lack of approval for Fortescue clean energy projects in Kenya, Brazil and Europe, clean energy \nboss Mark Hutchinson said shareholders could take comfort from the fact that not all projects were getting the \ngreen light.\n\"We are going to maintain our financial discipline,\" he said. \"We will come to market when we are ready.\n\"We have a great pipeline over the next two years.",
