That would spur gold buying as a way to protect wealth.\n\"We don't see this changing and expect the secular demand trends underpinning gold's price and its status as a \nsafe haven to continue enhancing gold's appeal as a core portfolio asset, even if capital markets strike a risk-on \ntone in 2025,\" State Street's chief gold strategist George Milling-Stanley said.\nWhile State Street's base case is for gold to trade between $US2600 an ounce and $US2900 an ounce this year, it \nassigned a 30 per cent probability to its bullish scenario where the precious metal hits $US3100 an ounce.\nState Street joins the chorus of Wall Street banks that are betting on another stellar year for the precious metal.\nBank of America, JPMorgan and Citi forecast bullion will reach $US3000 an ounce by the end of this year, and UBS \nforecasts $US2900 an ounce. While Goldman Sachs pushed out its projection this week, the broker still sees prices \nhitting $US3000 an ounce by mid-2026.\nThe bullish forecasts assume gold will jump more than 13 per cent this year from the current spot price of \n$US2649.38 an ounce.\nPage 2 of 2\n$7.6trn manager says gold could hit $US3100 Portfolio asset\nA stronger US dollar has weighed on gold prices since the US election on November 5, but strategists underline the \nprospect of sweeping tariffs under Mr Trump which could exacerbate trade tensions and stunt global growth.\nGold received a further boost this week on news that China's central bank expanded its gold reserves for a second \nmonth in December to 73.29 million fine troy ounces, from 72.96 million in the previous month. The People's Bank \nof China resumed adding to its gold reserves in November following a six-month pause when prices hovered at \nrecord levels.\nLocal gold miners revealed this week that they ramped up output in the December quarter to capitalise on the boom \nin prices.\nGold Road Resources delivered record gold production from the Gruyere mine in Western Australia, Ramelius \nResources boosted its output by 36 per cent compared to the September quarter, and Regis Resources lifted its \nproduction by nearly 10 per cent in the December quarter.\nBut analysts are frustrated that gold stocks continue to lag the price of the precious metal; the spot price surged 27 \nper cent in 2024 but the New York Stock Exchange Arca Gold Miners Index climbed just 11 per cent.\nVanEck believes the disconnect can be explained by a trend that has developed where the leverage of gold stocks \nto the metal's price is weaker when gold prices are rising compared to when they are falling.\nIndeed, gold prices fell 0.9 per cent from the end of 2023 to the end of February last year, while gold stocks sank \n15.3 per cent.\nIn contrast, from the end of February to October 22, gold was up 34.5 per cent, while the stocks surged 67.7 per \ncent.\nAnd from October 22 to the end of November, prices fell 3.9 per cent, but the shares of gold miners dropped by \n14.8 per cent.\n\"We have been anecdotally making this observation, frustrated by the overly punitive impact this continues to have \non the already oversold gold shares,\" VanEck strategists said.\n\"We think this dichotomy represents a value opportunity for gold miners as they have been potentially oversold \nwhen the price of gold falls and under-bought when the gold price has been appreciating.\"\nThe significant gap between gold prices and stocks had been narrowing over the last year, but weakness in the \nsector following the US election widened it once again.\nAnd with gold producers enjoying record margins and fresh cash flow generation, VanEck expects the disconnect \nwon't last forever.\n\"Investors looking to hedge broader market risk through gold exposure, we think should also consider an allocation \nto the gold mining sector,\" VanEck said. \"They may be among the few equities not priced to perfection.\"\nLoad-Date: January 11, 2025\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Alex Gluyas\nDate: January 09, 2025\nTitle: $7.6trn manager says gold could hit $US3100; Portfolio asset\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Australian shares rally on renewed hopes for Fed cuts\n## Media outlet: AAP Newsfeed\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: January 16, 2025\n\nPage 1 of 2\nFED:Australian shares rally on renewed hopes for Fed cuts\nFED:Australian shares rally on renewed hopes for Fed cuts\nAAP Newsfeed\nJanuary 16, 2025 Thursday 5:25 PM AEST\nCopyright 2025 Australian Associated Press Pty.

The drill intercepts reveal the possibility of an extensive \nzone of shallow gold mineralisation on the western side of McNabs East, which at this stage remains open at depth \nand along strike.\nThe company completed the five hole, 426m diamond drilling program last December as part of an ongoing \nprogram to systematically test the currently defined 2.5km strike extent of shallow gold mineralisation at Barimaia.\nResults from the program confirm the existence of a shallow, coherent zone of potentially open-pittable gold \nmineralisation on the western side of McNabs East, within an extensive gold system that remains untested at depth \nand open along strike.\nPage 2 of 4\nOrdell locks onto new gold zone in Mt Magnet\nOrdell's flagship Barimaia gold project is an advanced exploration project with significant historical drilling results. \nOrdell acquired an 80.3 per cent interest in Barimaia from Genesis Minerals, which is now a major shareholder of \nOrdell with an 8 per cent interest.\nHowever, Barimaia was never fully explored by Genesis due to its other commitments, although the company \nsuccessfully identified an extensive gold system at the project, supported by historical RC drilling results pointing to \ngood shallow open pit potential.\nThe project is strategically located within a stone's throw of at least three gold processing plants, including the \nadjacent Ramelius Resources' Mt Magnet mill, 70km from Spartan Resources' Dalgaranga mill and 80km from \nWestgold Resources' Tuckabianna mill.\nThe company is planning to launch a more extensive program of about 5000m of reverse circulation drilling at \nBarimaia in February. The upcoming program will include infill drilling at McNabs East to close up the current 100m \ndrill section spacing and will also include first-pass extensional drilling in areas where previous air-core (AC) drilling \nwas undertaken in 2019 and 2021.\nAdditionally, the new program will test depths between 100m and 200m in selected areas and will also include \nadditional AC drilling east and north of the currently defined mineralisation at McNabs.",
