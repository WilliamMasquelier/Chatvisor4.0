And we'll be looking at different ways to operate around that \nnew renewable energy system that we're installing.\" Ms Robertson said expenditure on the wind and solar farms \nwould come from the $US6.2bn ($9.6bn) set aside to reach the decarbonisation target.\nPage 2 of 2\nBig solar farm for Fortescue operation\nThe project abandoned last year - known as Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub - involved building more than 300 wind \nturbines and a solar farm with a capacity of up to 5.4GW on cattle stations a south of Onslow in the Pilbara. The \nconstruction work was estimated to take seven years.\nFortescue has built one 100MW solar farm, known as North Star Junction, near its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite \noperations.\nThe 150,000ha tenement package understood to figure in its broader renewable plans is mostly covered by land-\nuse agreements with the Nyamal and Pakyka traditional owner groups.\nFortescue intends to use renewable energy to charge its electric mining machinery. The company received $10m \nfrom the taxpayer-funded Australian Renewable Energy Agency on Tuesday to develop a 6MW fast charger test \nunit for its future mining fleet.\nMr Forrest said at the Fortescue annual general meeting last month that the company wanted help in the form of \napprovals and infrastructure to reach its \"real-zero\" decarbonisation target. Mr Forrest said substantial land was \nrequired for solar and wind farms but traditional owners and other stakeholders were keen to become involved.\nLoad-Date: December 3, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
