The maiden resource at Penny North was just over 300,000 ounces going a whopping \n16.8 g/t gold.\nMore recently Spartan employed the same near mine theory when it stubbed its toe on the 1.5m ounce Never \nNever discovery lurking just 300m north of its mothballed Gilbey's open pit in WA's Murchison.\nOminously, the Eureka project already has sniffs of gold 300m north of the old Eureka pit too - some of which are in \nounce to the tonne dirt like a 4m intercept going 32.6 g/t gold from 104m. Another previous 1m hit came in at an \nimpressive 14.72 g/t gold and notably, was from surface, demonstrating the potential range of mineralisation.\nAbout 600m north of the old pit, Javelin has even more impressive numbers to follow up on like 4m at 135 g/t gold \nfrom 53m and 4m grading 11 g/t gold from 42m.\nIn fact, the entire area is littered with old drill numbers that are begging to see the drill bit again. For example, \ndirectly under the old pit a 23m hit going 3.32 g/t gold from 112m and another 5m hit further up from 33m going an \nimpressive 25.6 g/t gold both need more attention.\nThere are even hints of mineralisation about 300m to the south of Eureka which include 13m at 2.22 g/t gold from \n51m and 6m at 13.88 g/t gold from 38m.\nWhilst some of the drill intersections that require follow up may seem remarkable in grade, they are perhaps not all \nthat remarkable when considering the project was first mined from 1897 up to 1940 for a total 809 tonnes averaging \na crazy 27.8 g/t gold - no doubt Javelin will be counting on some of that dirt being left behind by the old-timers.\nNotably, Eureka is not Javelin's first rodeo and is an extension of the same near mine exploration theory it is \nemploying at its Coogee gold project at the north end of Lake Lefroy, just east of Kambalda and about 55 km south-\neast of Kalgoorlie.\nThe Coogee gold deposit was discovered in the mid-1990s by Sovereign Resources next to Gold Fields' world-\nclass St Ives gold mining complex.\nJavelin acquired 100 per cent of the Coogee project in 2020 from Ramelius Resources and Serena Minerals for \nequity and both companies are now major shareholders.\nRamelius mined the Coogee open pit for gold to 70m depth until 2013, producing 20,400 ounces at a respectable \naverage head grade of 4.7g/t gold. Ramelius subsequently became a major shareholder in Javelin.\nThe Coogee mining lease has been a key focus for Javelin's since acquisition. The Coogee open pit and its \nimmediate surrounds have not been subject to any systematic exploration drilling since Ramelius ended mining at \nthe site.\nWhen Javelin acquired the project, it contained an estimated 10,600 ounce gold resource at 3.4g/t gold which, after \na 12-month drilling program, then jumped to 49,000 ounces at 1.07g/t gold in 2022.\nIn August, Javelin announced the Coogee gold project hosts a recently upgraded JORC 2012 compliant mineral \nresource amounting to 3.65 million tonnes at 1.08g/t gold for 126,685 ounces of gold and 1.01 million tonnes at \n0.41 per cent copper for 4133t tonnes of the red metal in a separate inferred \"copper domain\", north of the old pit.Page 3 of 3\nJavelin rolls dice to replicate Spectrum, Spartan success at Eureka\nOnce again, modelling shows gold mineralisation extending north along strike for 1.2km at an average width of \n350m and to more than 225m vertically under the old Coogee open pit and still open to the north and down-dip.\nJavelin upped its drilling metreage for the greater Coogee area from 2500m to 3000m for a planned reverse-\ncirculation and diamond drilling program set to be launched in mid-November.\nThe decision came after the company identified several opportunities to extend known mineralisation below the old \nopen pit and in extensions towards Coogee North and beyond to a pronounced magnetic high feature.\nThe proposed drilling was prompted by results from Javelin's extensive reviews of reprocessed geophysical and \nother data which had lifted Coogee's resource estimate to the current inventory figure of 126,685 ounces of gold.\nJavelin's recent full data review and new magnetics reinterpretations and modelling have identified eight new \ntantalising geophysical targets.\nIt will now direct its focus toward testing five of the nearest priority walk-up targets at the Coogee mine - and also \nnorth and west of the old mine - including a prominent and curious looking ovoid magnetic anomaly in the south-\neast of its exploration licence, adjacent to the mining lease.\nReview work has also identified a new 3km-long potential gold trend west of and parallel to the Coogee pit structure \nand Javelin believes there is the potential there for a \"big gold-copper system\" that could lie at depth to the north-\nwest.\nJavelin says previous drillholes at Coogee North were also not deep enough to test the nearby screaming magnetic \nanomaly which could represent a potential repetition of the historic Coogee lode and the company has earmarked \nten drillholes for 1650m to test it.\nSignificantly, once Javelin dials in the current Eureka gold mine resource and adds on its Coogee resource it will \nnow have a total resource endowment of 238,700 ounces of gold in two of the best mining addresses in Australia.\nIt is probably fair to say that Javelin has been in something of a slumber for a couple of years however since falling \nunder the control of Executive Chairman and well known West Perth corporate finance player Brett Mitchell back in \nFebruary, it has forged a new way forward and eked out a solid \"near mine exploration strategy.\"\nHalf of that strategy came from a strategic review of Coogee instigated by Mitchell that ended in some screaming \nnear mine targets that look like they are begging to be drilled. Eureka now gives Javelin a quinella of projects that \nalmost look exactly the same that will likely both benefit from exactly the same brownfields near mine exploration \nstrategy.\nAnd who knows, maybe Javelin will complete the trifecta of companies that have successfully employed this \"old \nriches left behind\" strategy if it can emulate the success of both Spartan and Spectrum.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Spartan's shares closed at $1.24, after they had hit a 2024 \nhigh last month above $1.60.\nRamelius, which is in a $455m net cash position, pounced on Spartan in June, buying an 8.9 per cent stake at 92c \na share, so perhaps the stock needs to fall further before it becomes interested in a deal.\nNorthern Star is also in a strong position for a buyout, with $358m of net cash. Its most logical target is De Grey \nMining, whose shares also fell more than 5 per cent on Thursday.\nPart of the reason behind a rally in the gold price in the past two months has been expectations of geopolitical \ninstability and an uncertain outcome in the US election.\nBut the sweeping victory of Donald Trump in the race for the White House has caught out some gold traders, with \nthe result creating more certainty about US policy.\nPage 2 of 2\nGolden chance for miners to buy out rivals amid commodity sell-off - DATA ROOM\nAlso sending the gold price lower on Thursday was a rally in the US dollar following the election outcome, with the \nUS economy expected to be stronger under Mr Trump.\nHowever, while gold may be volatile for about two months as the market assesses the impact of Mr Trump's \nleadership, if he introduces trading tariffs on other countries such as China, and the US dollar remains high, that \nwould lead to global inflation.\nAnd inflation usually supports a higher gold price.\nThe same would be said about more geopolitical tension, should it occur under Mr Trump.\nGroups that were also looking to raise equity may now have second thoughts over doing so before Christmas, or \nmay raise less funds and at a lower price. Another plus for gold miners wanting to do deals following the election of \nMr Trump is that it may be easier to come across financing for transactions at better rates, sources say.\nLoad-Date: November 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Bridget Carter\nDate: November 08, 2024\nTitle: Golden chance for miners to buy out rivals amid commodity sell-off - DATA ROOM\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Ramelius may look to M&A if Rebecca-Roe project doesn't stack up - DATA ROOM\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Bridget Carter\n### Date: November 28, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nRamelius may look to M&A if Rebecca-Roe project doesn't stack up - DATA ROOM\nRamelius may look to M&A if Rebecca-Roe project doesn't stack up - DATA \nROOM\nThe Australian\nNovember 28, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 14\nLength: 505 words\nByline: EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER\nBody\nA move by Ramelius Resources on its smaller rival Spartan could rest on the release of its feasibility study into its \nRebecca-Roe development, expected out in the near term.\nShould the results prove that the project will not be all that viable, it may propel the group more towards taking the \nmergers and acquisition route for growth.\nRamelius purchased 8.9 per cent of Spartan Resources in June and it is also known to have been eyeing up other \ntargets at a time it remains cashed up with the gold price hitting record highs this year.\nCurrently, the Ramelius market value is close to $2.4bn whereas Spartan's market value is almost $1.5bn.\nRamelius Resources chief executive Mark Zeptner earlier said that the Spartan Resources project was \"in our \nbackyard\".\nRamelius is developing both the Rebecca-Roe project and Cue Gold Project, 35km south of Mt Magnet, after \nbuying Apollo Consolidated in 2022 and Musgrave Minerals the following year.\nIt owns and operates two production and processing hubs at Mt Magnet and Edna May, in Western Australia.\nSpartan owns the Dalgaranga Gold Project, 65km northwest of Mt Magnet in Murchison, where Ramelius owns a \ngold processing hub.
