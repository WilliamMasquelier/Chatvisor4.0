Part of that is its Never Never high-grade gold deposit on which the company is pinning its \nhopes for growth.\nSpartan was previously called Gascoyne Resources and collapsed after gold ore levels being processed through \nits mill were not profitable, and it was later recapitalised after its market value fell beneath $100m.\nRamelius purchased Spartan shares at 92c in June, and they are currently trading at about $1.33, while Ramelius \nshares are trading at $2.09.\nPage 2 of 2\nRamelius may look to M&A if Rebecca-Roe project doesn't stack up - DATA ROOM\nLate last year, it was known around the market that Ramelius was in search of an opportunity, preferably in WA, \nwhere it could add 100,000 ounces of gold per annum and wanted to add a third production hub to put its $261m \ncash pile to work.\nMr Zeptner said in August he did not feel an obligation to get bigger but was more focused on good margins and \ncashflow.\nThe focus on Ramelius comes after the results of Newmont's recent sales campaign shows corporate activity \nbooming in the gold mining space, with Newmont achieving over $US1bn more than the market had initially \nestimated for asset sales.\nNewmont has been selling assets in North America, Australia and Africa following its $24bn acquisition of Newcrest \nin 2023. Most recently, it agreed to sell its Eleonore mine in Quebec, Canada for up to $US795m to Dhilmar, which \nanalysts at Macquarie said was 62 per cent higher than its valuation.\nNewmont expects its final two non-core remaining assets, Porcupine and Cripple Creek & Victor Mine Gold Mine in \nColorado, to be sold in the first quarter of next year, and they are valued at about $US1.5bn.\nIt had targeted returns of $US2bn from assets sales and has realised $US3.6bn, excluding two others to go A share \nbuyback is expected to be on the cards.

Ramelius Resources is considering mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as a growth strategy, particularly if the upcoming feasibility study for its Rebecca-Roe project indicates low viability, highlighting the company's adaptive approach to market conditions.\n\n2. The company has already acquired an 8.9% stake in Spartan Resources and is exploring additional targets, leveraging its strong cash position amid rising gold prices, which positions Ramelius for potential strategic expansion in the competitive gold mining sector.\n\n3. Ramelius operates two production hubs in Western Australia and is focused on enhancing its gold output, with aspirations to add a third hub capable of producing 100,000 ounces of gold annually, reflecting its ambition to scale operations despite a cautious approach to growth.\n\n4. The market context is significant, as Ramelius's interest in Spartan Resources is influenced by the recent corporate activity in the gold mining industry, particularly following Newmont's successful asset sales, which have set a precedent for valuation and acquisition strategies in the sector. \n\n5. The performance of Spartan Resources, which previously faced financial difficulties, raises concerns about the stability and profitability of potential acquisitions, emphasizing the need for Ramelius to carefully evaluate its M&A opportunities to ensure sustainable growth.",
