All \nparticipants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. \n[Operator Instructions].\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Mark Zeptner, Managing Director. Please go ahead.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Sigar. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to dial in this morning to our FY '24 \nresults call. Alongside me is Chief Financial Officer, Darren Millman, who will drill down into the financials after I've \ncovered off on the highlights. This morning, we have uploaded to the ASX platform, along with our website a \nPage 2 of 5\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\nnumber of documents, including our FY '24 financial results summary and the presentation, which we'll be largely \nspeaking to you this morning, and also our audited statutory financial report.\nAs mentioned initially discussed the high-level FY '24 results, then Darren will dive into a bit more detail, and then \nwe'll talk about the FY '25 outlook and also the dividend that we announced this morning. Once we have done that, \nthere will also be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions. So, in terms of the presentation, if we only hopefully \ngot that handy, we jump to Slide 3, with our mining and production highlights.\nAlthough we mined less ore tonnes in FY '24 compared to the previous year, the contained gold mined, which is \nwhat counts, was up on the prior year due to a higher mine grade. The primary driver of the lower tonnes was the \ncompletion of mining activities across the Edna May hub, most notably at Tampia, where mining activities were \ncompleted last year.\nIncreased ore from Eridanus and the introduction of Symes offset the stocking tonnes in part. The improved mine \ngrade was driven by 2 factors: increased tonnages and grade from Penny, which reported a mine grade just over 12 \ngrams per tonne for the year, and also a strong performance from Eridanus, which saw open pit tonnages at Mt \nMagnet increased 50%, but at a 60% higher grade than the prior year. If we move on to our processing activities, \ntonnes milled were up on the prior year, mainly as a result of additional haulage capacity across the Edna May hub.\nPleasingly, this increase in tonnes milled for the group was achieved despite the interruptions to the CV01 conveyor \nrepairs carried out in November, December last year at Mt Magnet. This increased throughput, combined with \nimproved milled grade resulted in a 22% increase in gold production to the record number of 293,000 ounces, \nwhich was at the upper end of our upgraded production guidance for FY '24.\nOn cost sales and sustaining costs as reported in the June quarterly was $15.83 an ounce, which is one of the best \nwithin our industry and something we're pretty proud of here at Ramelius. It is also most pleasing that we're able to \ndeliver these results with a declining TRIFR or total recordable injury frequency rate across the year and also \nachieved a 12-month LTI-free milestone in May 2024.\nBefore I hand over to Darren, I'd just like to note this is the second year in a row where I've been able to comment \nthat the annual results on just about every metric are an improvement on the prior year. And importantly, these \nresults have not only been driven by the A dollar gold price, but also our low-cost base, which I believe distinguish \nus from our peers, and we do anticipate that the positive results will continue into FY '25. Over to you, Darren.\nDarren Millman\nThanks, Mark. For those following on the presentation, I'll initially speaking to Slide 4. Before moving on to the \ndiscussion of earnings, I'd like to highlight that I will be talking to our underlying earnings. When we refer to \nunderlying earnings, we are essentially backing out the large nonrecurring items in an attempt to communicate what \nwe believe is the most reflective results from our operations for the year and appropriate comparative to the prior \nyear. The main difference between our underlying earnings and our statutory net profit after tax earnings for the \ncurrent year relates to acquired tax losses.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nIn our underlying earnings, we removed the tax benefit of $23.9 million associated with the recognition of tax losses \nthat was acquired as part of the Musgrave and Brake acquisitions made in FY '23 and early FY '24, respectively. Of \nthis, $14.6 million remains on our balance sheet for utilization on future periods. Indeed, since FY '19, Ramelius \nhas acquired tax losses over the years to the tune of $24.5 million. This is a true realized savings in cash tax \npayment savings.\nLastly, before moving on to the financials, we have for reference, provided a few appendices in this presentation, \nwhich reconciles the underlying earnings and cash flow for the statutory reports for the financial statements.Page 3 of 5\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\nI trust you'll find this useful. As a reminder for FY '24, the company achieved record production, record earnings, \nrecord cash flow and a record dividend with the backdrop, happy to discuss the numbers in a little bit more detail. \nWe achieved a top line revenue of $882.6 million, which was 40% up from the prior year with gold sales of 293,966 \nounces at a realized price of 2,995 per ounce, a 16% increase on the prior year.\nThe increased revenue was not only due to higher gold price, which added $119 million, but also increased gold \nproduction, which added $131 million when compared to FY '23. EBITDA of $462.2 million was up 67% on the prior \nyear and represents a margin of 52%, a $1,573 per ounce sold.\nOn both metrics, we continue to be at the top of our peer group. Net profit after tax of $200.3 million was up 166% \non prior year, with earnings being driven by improved grades, with lower cost of production per ounce and a strong \ncurrency of AU gold price. Statutory earnings per share of $19.5 were up 181% on the prior year. Further analysis \non EBITDA can be found on Slide 6, which shows the positive trend from H1 to H2 with the EBITDA margin \nincreasing 40% in H1 to 60% in H2.\nIn addition to this, the earnings profile for Mt Magnet and Edna May can be seen with Mt Magnet being the clear \ndriver in earnings recording EBITDA margin of 79% in H2.\nLooking at Mt Magnet in isolation on Slide 7 shows EBITDA margin for FY '24 of 2,121 per ounce. This earning \ncapacity of Mt Magnet bodes well for the future with the production center poised of further growth in FY '25.\nThis will be driven by increased production from Penny, the introduction of Q and the exciting upside potential from \nEridanus to be open pit or underground. Indeed, we see FY '25 as another very strong year of cash build and \nearnings. It's worth highlighting in FY '25, we are guiding to a 50% increase in production at the Mt Magnet hub.\nMoving to cash. We believe it is important -- one of the most important financial measures of our business, and \nSlide 8 and 9, you will see our key cash metrics. Our operating cash flow for the year was $445 million or 1,515 per \nounce. Investing cash flow totaled $242.7 million, which includes investments into our existing business for plant \nequipment, mine development and exploration of $123.1 million, our acquisition of Musgrave and our strategic \ninvestment in Spartan.\nThe free cash flow being the net of operating and investing cash flow was $212.1 million after returning $17.3 \nmillion to shareholders via our FY '23 dividend and lease payments, total cash inflow for the year was $173.3 \nmillion.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nOur low-cost production, coupled with our strong Australian gold price resulted in Ramelius returning $315.8 million \nin underlying free cash flow for FY '24. Once again, one of the best returns amongst our peers. The resulting cash \nand gold at the end of the year was $446.6 million. Turning now to Slide 10 and our cash balance sheet, which we \nconsider to be one of our key strengths. Our cash and gold bullion on hand are complemented with a further 65,000 \nounces of gold contained in current stockpiles and within circuit, which we will monetize in the coming 12 months, \nleaving Ramelius with excellent liquidity.\nIn addition to this, in July, we executed a new finance facility for $175 million, which is an upsized replacement of \nour previous $100 million facility. Facility was undrawn at the reporting date remains as of the same to this day. As \nwe mentioned in the past, we're in the process of progressively reducing our hedge book, which at 30 June 2024, \nsat at 155,000 ounces at an average price of $3,081 per ounce. The only new hedging put in place recently was \nthat we put hedges of 41,500 ounces at Edna May production out to January 2025, ensuring that the cost will not be \nsold below 3,400 per ounce, locking in meaningful cash flow from the remaining Edna May stockpiles. With that, I'll \nhand it back to Mark.\nMark ZeptnerPage 4 of 5\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\nThanks, Darren. So, if we can jump to Slide 11 to 13 now touching on our portfolio and guidance for FY '25. On gold \nproduction, you will see we expect a higher margin that Magnet operation to make up a higher proportion of gold \nproduction with Edna May to be placed in care and maintenance once the existing stockpiles across that hub are \nprocessed. Overall, group production for FY '25 is expected to be comparable to FY '24. Our all-in sustaining cost is \nalso expected to be largely in line with FY '24, but with a higher gold price, which we have assumed at $3,500 per \nounce as per the chart on Slide 12, plus our existing hedge book, will see us deliver some 92,000 ounces at $29.45 \nper ounce in FY '25.\nWe'll see a further increase in cash margins. Production and the result in lower all-in sustaining cost is expected to \nbe weighted to H2 of FY '25. And finally, on our guidance for FY '25, I'd like to make 2 points, which we have made \nbefore. Whilst Edna May does have a higher all-in sustaining cost, there is approximately $500 an ounce of this -- \nthat relates to noncash drawdowns of existing stockpiles. And secondly, we are expecting a notable reduction in our \ngrowth capital spend in FY '25, particularly in the second half.\nWith the development of leveraging off in the first half, leveraging off our existing Magnet plant, infrastructure, such \nas airstrips and camps, realizing true regional synergies there. We like to think we have a good reputation in the \nmarket for doing what we say and delivering on our promises. We see no reason for this not to continue into FY '25 \nand also look forward to presenting a revised Mt Magnet mine plan in the new year once we have the optimal \ndesign for Eridanus open pit or underground. Turning to Slide 14. Perhaps the highlight, our declared dividend for \nFY '24.\nWe're proud of our track record on dividends. And today, we are not only declaring our sixth consecutive dividend \nabout 150% increase in the prior year to $0.05 per share fully franked. This represents a payout ratio of 27% of free \ncash flow. In approving the final dividend, the Board gave consideration to the additional strategic investment in \nSpartan, internal growth opportunities at Eridanus, and potential mill expansions at Mt Magnet as well as potential \ncapital commitment requirements for Rebecca Roe. The dividend represents a yield of 2.6% based on 30 June \nshare price and a total shareholder return over the last 5 years of 21% per annum.\nOur dividend reinvestment plan has now been in place for a couple of years now with last year's participation at \n22%. It is pleasing to see an increasing number of shareholders opting to take up the opportunity to use their \ndividends to purchase additional Ramelius shares. That opportunity will again be available with the price of shares \nto be calculated at a 2% discount to the 10-day VWAP from the date of election. Last year's dividend payment \namounted to $22.3 million in cash and reinvestment this year. The return will be up to $57.2 million, which will be \npaid in October.\nLast slide, moving on to Slide 15, where we're looking at our focus areas, I'll skip to the final 2 areas being \nexploration opportunities and near-term catalysts. We have budgeted to invest another $40 million to $50 million in \nexploration this year, with opportunities at Mt Magnet, Penny and Rebecca Roe areas shaping us having high \npotential to deliver additional resource ounces and further bolstering reserves. There are a number of near-term \ncatalysts that we see, including the progression of drilling at Eridanus and Galaxy, which will culminate more likely \nin an upgraded Mt Magnet mine plan.\nIn addition to this, we look forward to providing updated mineral resource inventory for Roe, and ultimately, the \npublication of the associated PFS for the combined Rebecca Roe project. That concludes the presentation.\nI'll now hand back to the operator, Sigar, you can open the line for questions, please.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Paul Kaner from Ord Minnett.Page 5 of 5\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\nPaul Kaner\nCouple here, if I may. So firstly, on tax, thanks for giving that income tax guidance for FY '25. But how should we \nthink about cash tax paid for FY '24?\nDarren Millman\nYes. Thanks, Paul. As I noted in the numbers there, we had that advantage in 2024, in 2025 -- or 2025 and beyond, \nwe serve approximately $25 million available. In 2025, we're probably expecting around $15 million to have a \nsimilar tax cash benefit is our expectations for 2025.\nPaul Kaner\nYes, that's great. And then maybe one for you, Mark. Just on capital returns. I think your payout was about 27% of \nfree cash flow and your policy allows for up to 30%. I guess, any thoughts on changing this policy?\nOr are you sort of happy capping at 30% and then, I guess, using the remainder of the free cash flow on sort of \norganic and inorganic opportunities?\nMark Zeptner\nYes. We obviously had a lengthy discussion at Board level. To summarize, we're happy with our policy. We didn't \nquite go all the way to 30%. But we like -- we have got a number of internal projects coming up.\nAnd we felt that we struck a balance between returns to shareholders and providing cash for those projects.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand back to Mr. Zeptner for closing \nremarks.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Sigar. I can't remember the last time we only had one question, but we must have covered everything. \nSo, to wrap up, just 3 points, a record year for earnings and cash generation in FY '24 for Ramelius, a similarly \nstrong outlook for FY '25 and beyond. And a $0.05 fly-free dividend announced today being the sixth consecutive \nyear of dividend payments, a 150% increase on the prior year with over $130 million potentially returned to \nshareholders. Thank you all for listening in today. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating.

The dividend represents a yield of 2.6% based on 30 June \nshare price and a total shareholder return over the last 5 years of 21% per annum.\nOur dividend reinvestment plan has now been in place for a couple of years now with last year's participation at \n22%. It is pleasing to see an increasing number of shareholders opting to take up the opportunity to use their \ndividends to purchase additional Ramelius shares. That opportunity will again be available with the price of shares \nto be calculated at a 2% discount to the 10-day VWAP from the date of election. Last year's dividend payment \namounted to $22.3 million in cash and reinvestment this year. The return will be up to $57.2 million, which will be \npaid in October.\nLast slide, moving on to Slide 15, where we're looking at our focus areas, I'll skip to the final 2 areas being \nexploration opportunities and near-term catalysts. We have budgeted to invest another $40 million to $50 million in \nexploration this year, with opportunities at Mt Magnet, Penny and Rebecca Roe areas shaping us having high \npotential to deliver additional resource ounces and further bolstering reserves. There are a number of near-term \ncatalysts that we see, including the progression of drilling at Eridanus and Galaxy, which will culminate more likely \nin an upgraded Mt Magnet mine plan.\nIn addition to this, we look forward to providing updated mineral resource inventory for Roe, and ultimately, the \npublication of the associated PFS for the combined Rebecca Roe project. That concludes the presentation.\nI'll now hand back to the operator, Sigar, you can open the line for questions, please.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Paul Kaner from Ord Minnett.Page 5 of 5\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\nPaul Kaner\nCouple here, if I may. So firstly, on tax, thanks for giving that income tax guidance for FY '25. But how should we \nthink about cash tax paid for FY '24?\nDarren Millman\nYes. Thanks, Paul. As I noted in the numbers there, we had that advantage in 2024, in 2025 -- or 2025 and beyond, \nwe serve approximately $25 million available. In 2025, we're probably expecting around $15 million to have a \nsimilar tax cash benefit is our expectations for 2025.\nPaul Kaner\nYes, that's great. And then maybe one for you, Mark. Just on capital returns. I think your payout was about 27% of \nfree cash flow and your policy allows for up to 30%. I guess, any thoughts on changing this policy?\nOr are you sort of happy capping at 30% and then, I guess, using the remainder of the free cash flow on sort of \norganic and inorganic opportunities?\nMark Zeptner\nYes. We obviously had a lengthy discussion at Board level. To summarize, we're happy with our policy. We didn't \nquite go all the way to 30%. But we like -- we have got a number of internal projects coming up.\nAnd we felt that we struck a balance between returns to shareholders and providing cash for those projects.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand back to Mr. Zeptner for closing \nremarks.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Sigar. I can't remember the last time we only had one question, but we must have covered everything. \nSo, to wrap up, just 3 points, a record year for earnings and cash generation in FY '24 for Ramelius, a similarly \nstrong outlook for FY '25 and beyond. And a $0.05 fly-free dividend announced today being the sixth consecutive \nyear of dividend payments, a 150% increase on the prior year with over $130 million potentially returned to \nshareholders. Thank you all for listening in today. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating.
