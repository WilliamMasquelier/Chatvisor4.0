Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 18\nLength: 789 words\nByline: Alex Gluyas\nBody\nState Street Global Advisors, one of the world's largest investors, says gold prices could reach $US3100 an ounce \nthis year, extending a 2024 rally that pushed the precious metal to its biggest annual gain in 14 years.\nBullion rallied 27 per cent last year and peaked at a record $US2778 an ounce in October, fuelled by robust central \nbank purchases, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions in \nUkraine and the Middle East.\nAnd the world's fourth-largest asset manager believes those drivers remain intact this year despite indications from \nPresident-elect Donald Trump that his administration will enact policies to grow businesses faster, propelling the \nrally in riskier assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies.\nState Street, which manages a portfolio of $US4.73 trillion ($7.6 trillion), said there was heightened anxiety about a \nreturn of high inflation, ballooning government debt and worsening geopolitical tensions under a Trump \nadministration. That would spur gold buying as a way to protect wealth.\n\"We don't see this changing and expect the secular demand trends underpinning gold's price and its status as a \nsafe haven to continue enhancing gold's appeal as a core portfolio asset, even if capital markets strike a risk-on \ntone in 2025,\" State Street's chief gold strategist George Milling-Stanley said.\nWhile State Street's base case is for gold to trade between $US2600 an ounce and $US2900 an ounce this year, it \nassigned a 30 per cent probability to its bullish scenario where the precious metal hits $US3100 an ounce.\nState Street joins the chorus of Wall Street banks that are betting on another stellar year for the precious metal.\nBank of America, JPMorgan and Citi forecast bullion will reach $US3000 an ounce by the end of this year, and UBS \nforecasts $US2900 an ounce. While Goldman Sachs pushed out its projection this week, the broker still sees prices \nhitting $US3000 an ounce by mid-2026.\nThe bullish forecasts assume gold will jump more than 13 per cent this year from the current spot price of \n$US2649.38 an ounce.\nPage 2 of 2\n$7.6trn manager says gold could hit $US3100 Portfolio asset\nA stronger US dollar has weighed on gold prices since the US election on November 5, but strategists underline the \nprospect of sweeping tariffs under Mr Trump which could exacerbate trade tensions and stunt global growth.\nGold received a further boost this week on news that China's central bank expanded its gold reserves for a second \nmonth in December to 73.29 million fine troy ounces, from 72.96 million in the previous month. The People's Bank \nof China resumed adding to its gold reserves in November following a six-month pause when prices hovered at \nrecord levels.\nLocal gold miners revealed this week that they ramped up output in the December quarter to capitalise on the boom \nin prices.\nGold Road Resources delivered record gold production from the Gruyere mine in Western Australia, Ramelius \nResources boosted its output by 36 per cent compared to the September quarter, and Regis Resources lifted its \nproduction by nearly 10 per cent in the December quarter.\nBut analysts are frustrated that gold stocks continue to lag the price of the precious metal; the spot price surged 27 \nper cent in 2024 but the New York Stock Exchange Arca Gold Miners Index climbed just 11 per cent.\nVanEck believes the disconnect can be explained by a trend that has developed where the leverage of gold stocks \nto the metal's price is weaker when gold prices are rising compared to when they are falling.\nIndeed, gold prices fell 0.9 per cent from the end of 2023 to the end of February last year, while gold stocks sank \n15.3 per cent.\nIn contrast, from the end of February to October 22, gold was up 34.5 per cent, while the stocks surged 67.7 per \ncent.\nAnd from October 22 to the end of November, prices fell 3.9 per cent, but the shares of gold miners dropped by \n14.8 per cent.\n\"We have been anecdotally making this observation, frustrated by the overly punitive impact this continues to have \non the already oversold gold shares,\" VanEck strategists said.\n\"We think this dichotomy represents a value opportunity for gold miners as they have been potentially oversold \nwhen the price of gold falls and under-bought when the gold price has been appreciating.\"\nThe significant gap between gold prices and stocks had been narrowing over the last year, but weakness in the \nsector following the US election widened it once again.\nAnd with gold producers enjoying record margins and fresh cash flow generation, VanEck expects the disconnect \nwon't last forever.\n\"Investors looking to hedge broader market risk through gold exposure, we think should also consider an allocation \nto the gold mining sector,\" VanEck said. \"They may be among the few equities not priced to perfection.\"\nLoad-Date: January 11, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should solely be one of these three words based on your assessment: \"Positive\", \"Neutral\", or \"Negative\".
