It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nHydrogen's half price challenge Clean energy\nHydrogen's half price challenge; Clean energy\nAustralian Financial Review\nMarch 12, 2024 Tuesday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: FEATURES; Pg. 5\nLength: 558 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue Energy boss Mark Hutchinson says Australia must get power prices down to about $US30 ($45.36) a \nmegawatt hour if it wants to be a hydrogen superpower, under a goal that would effectively require a halving of \npower prices across much of the eastern states.\nMr Hutchinson's power price challenge came as he warned that Fortescue and Incitec Pivot would find it \"tough\" to \nproceed with a plan to retrofit Queensland's Gibson Island fertiliser plant towards a future in hydrogen and ammonia \nunless governments helped mitigate the high cost of clean energy.\nGibson Island had traditionally consumed large volumes of methane gas - a compound of carbon and hydrogen - to \nmake ammonia, which is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen.\nBut Fortescue, Incitec and taxpayer agencies such as the Australian Renewable Energy Agency have funded \nstudies into a retrofit of Gibson Island, where an electrolyser would make green hydrogen at the site for synthesis \nwith nitrogen to make \"green ammonia\".\nGreen ammonia can be combusted as a source of energy but is also considered the easiest way to transport \nhydrogen long distances.\nFortescue was expected to take a final investment decision on Gibson Island in late 2023, but the project has not \nyet been approved and the company contracted to supply solar power to the project, Genex, has given Fortescue \nuntil March 31 to decide.\nMr Hutchinson told The Australian Financial Review Business Summit that high power prices were the main \nimpediment at Gibson Island.\n\"We've been working very, very hard on it,\" he said. \"But it's tough based on the current power prices when we're \nlooking at competing globally. It's a tough decision.\n\"So we're working very closely with the Queensland government and federal government to figure out a way to \nmake it happen because it's a bit of a litmus test for the rest of the hydrogen industry in Australia, to be honest.\nPage 2 of 2\nHydrogen's half price challenge Clean energy\n\"We're very keen to get it up.\"\n\"Green\" hydrogen can be made with zero or low carbon emissions if renewable electricity is passed through water \nto separate the fluid into its constituent parts, oxygen and hydrogen.\nFortescue has travelled the world over the past five years searching for the cheapest sources of clean power to \ngenerate affordable green hydrogen.\nThe company expects to approve a green hydrogen project in Norway this year which would be powered by carbon-\nfree hydroelectricity.\n\"If you look around the world where you can get cheap renewable power, competitive renewable power is below \n$US30 a megawatt hour,\" he said.\n\"That should really be the target and particularly when you're looking at really what will be a global market to supply \ngreen ammonia, green hydrogen. So that's kind of the goal.\"\nAverage annual power prices were above $100 per megawatt hour in NSW, Queensland and South Australia in \n2023, according to data published by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER).\nThe same AER data found average annual power prices in Tasmania were $56 per megawatt hour while Victorian \nprices averaged slightly higher than Tasmania.\nAsked about the large number of departures from Fortescue's executive ranks over the past four years, Mr \nHutchinson said new recruits needed to fit into the company's unique culture, not vice versa.\n\"Some people come in and think they [have to] fix it,\" he said. \"That's just not Fortescue. We don't need to be \nfixed.\"\nLoad-Date: March 14, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
