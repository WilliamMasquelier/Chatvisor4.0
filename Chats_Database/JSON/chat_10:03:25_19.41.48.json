Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Ellie Coates | Chief Executive of Fortescue Zero Power Systems | \"The business is tasked with adapting the technology applied in racing electric cars in Formula E to moving big volumes of iron ore using haul trucks under Fortescue's goal to eradicate greenhouse gas emissions in its mining operations.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"I am committed to stop using diesel in the company's mining operation by 2030.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Boss of Fortescue Energy | \"We just have to remember that a big part of that flows back to Fortescue Zero because a big part of the trucks is the power system.\" | N.A. |\n| Dr. Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"It could convert the burning of one billion litres of diesel equivalent a year into 'long-term profitable green energy assets' by 2030.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
