It totals 76,000 oz defined at over 1.0 g/t Au from only \n3m depth, remains open in several directions, and is considered the first step in defining the full potential of the \nKirgella Gift and Providence gold deposits. Pleasingly, we have defined a shallow gold resource at a very low cost \nto the Company of around A$ 4.20 per gold ounce. The Kirgella and Providence mineral resource estimate is \ncomparable to other deposits within the Laverton Tectonic Zone and is considered typical of the region. This is \nparticularly true of some of the constituent deposits at Ramelius Resources' (ASX:RMS) Rebecca Gold Project, \naround 20 km to the south along strike. KalGold now has defined a total resource base of 214,300 oz of gold. The \nincreased resource base enables KalGold to commence high level mining optimisation studies to assess pathways \nto production. KalGold looks forward to continuing to progress its work in the Pinjin area with the aim of significantly \ngrowing this initial JORC Code (2012) resource and defining a suite of additional shallow resources.\nProject Location and History\nKirgella Gift and Providence are located on exploration tenement E 28/2655, approximately 140 km northeast of \nKalgoorlie-Boulder and within the underexplored southern end of the crustal-scale, goldmineralising Laverton \nTectonic Zone (LTZ). The LTZ is host to some of the largest gold mines of the Eastern Goldfields of Western \nAustralia. Locally, the project area lies at the southern end of the gold-rush era Pinjin Goldfield. It is strategically \nPage 2 of 3\n-Kirgella Gift and Providence First Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate of 76,400 oz Au from only 3m depth\nlocated some 12 km south of Hawthorn Resources' (ASX:HAW) Anglo Saxon gold deposit, and 22 km northwest of \nRamelius Resources' (ASX:RMS) Lake Rebecca Gold Project.\nThe Pinjin Gold Project tenure and surrounds have been explored by numerous operators since the 1970's with an \ninitial focus on nickel, base metals and uranium potential. Burdekin Resources explored the ground in the mid to \nlate 1990's, discovering gold mineralisation at Kirgella Gift through RAB drilling while following up an earlier maglag \nsoil anomaly. Gutnick Resources farmed into the project and completed additional RAB and limited RC drilling at \nKirgella Gift. Newmont Exploration acquired the ground in 2005 through a farm in and Joint Venture agreement with \nGel Resources and Great Gold Mines (formerly Gutnick Resources), completing a considerable amount of work, \nincluding extensive regional RAB and aircore drilling, with limited follow up RC and diamond drilling at several \nprospects. Newmont subsequently divested the project to Renaissance Minerals in September 2010. Renaissance \nMinerals completed additional aircore and RC drilling over the local Kirgella Gift area, leading to the initial discovery \nof Providence some 300 m to the south. Following a merger with Emerald Resources in October 2016 to focus on \nCambodian gold projects, the tenure was dropped and subsequently acquired by a group of local prospectors. \nKalGold has entered into a farm-in agreement with this group, with the option to acquire up to a 75% interest in a \nnumber of tenements including E 28/2655 via certain expenditure milestones. The agreement includes full mineral \nrights. The Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) reported here is completed in accordance with the JORC Code \n(2012) and is the first MRE undertaken at Kirgella Gift and Providence\nResource Estimation Methodology\nMicromine (v2023.5) software was used for all drillhole processing, interpretation, statistical assessment and grade \nestimation and reporting purposes. Mineralisation has been interpreted as a series of discrete estimation domains \nat both Kirgella Gift and Providence which strike between 345-010-degree and dip between 75-90-degree to the \nwest. The reported Mineral Resource consists of: Kirgella Gift: Eight domains which range in strike length from 30 \nto 365 m (average 165 m), with a vertical extent of 45 to 230 m (average 150 m) vertically and with a true width \nbetween 1.2 to 12.5 m (average 6.8 m). Providence: Five domains which range in strike length from 100 to 200 m \n(average 180 m), with a vertical extent of 75 to 145 m (average 110 m) vertically and with a true width between 1.4 \nto 5.5 m (average 3.4 m). There are an additional twelve small, mineralised domains interpreted (seven at Kirgella \nGift and five at Providence) which have been excluded from the Mineral Resource due to currently limited drill \ncoverage and supporting data. Raw sample data was flagged by rock type, oxidation and mineralised domain \nidentifier, prior to creating 1.0 m composites. A variety of techniques were used to assess the need to apply top \ncuts. Grade distribution disintegration analysis implied there was a step change in the grade at 10 g/t at Kirgella Gift \n(impacting 2 composites) and at 7.5 g/t at Providence (impacting a single composite), which were applied. Multiple \napproaches were trialled to obtain reasonably structured continuity models, with the model for the largest \nmineralised domain at Kirgella Gift applied to all other domains. On-going exploration and additional sampling is \nexpected to improve continuity models in the future, and although the strike and dip directions are currently robust, \nit is likely the pitch will be modified as more data is available. Due to the low coefficient of variation, and relatively \nsimple grade distributions, ordinary kriging (OK) using topcut grades was selected as the optimal estimation \napproach. Modelled domains that were informed by less than three drillhole intersections had the composite \naverage assigned to the domain and were excluded from the resource inventory. A block size of 5 mE x 25 mN x \n20 mRL was selected as the optimal parent block size, based primarily on existing drillhole spacing, but cross-\nchecked against the results of kriging neighbourhood analysis (KNA). The parent cells were sub-blocked to 0.5 mE \nx 2.5 mN x 0.5 mRL. Post estimation, the block model was re-blocked, splitting the elevation height from 10 to 5 m \nto assist with any future mine planning requirements, such as pit optimisation. Estimation treated the mineralised \ndomains as hard boundaries. Due to the limited number of samples in the complete and partial oxidation domains, \nweathering/oxidation boundaries was not used to constrain the estimate.\nOunces per vertical metrePage 3 of 3\n-Kirgella Gift and Providence First Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate of 76,400 oz Au from only 3m depth\nThe Kirgella Gift and Providence MRE shows a combined average of 565 ounces per vertical metre through to the \nbase of the model at the 225 mRL. There is an increase in ounces per vertical metre with depth, peaking around 60 \nm below surface. Below the 290 mRL, the ounce profile tapers off in combination with a reduction in drill hole \ncoverage and spacing with depth. Though not diagnostic, the curve is consistent with gold mineralisation \nopportunities that are yet to be drill tested, both near surface and at depth down-dip of the drilled deposit\nContact:\nMatt Painter\nManaging Director and Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +61 8 6002 2700\nAbout KalGold ASX-listed resources\ncompany Kalgoorlie Gold Mining (KalGold, ASX: KAL) is a proven, low-cost gold discoverer with a large portfolio of \nWest Australian projects. Current focus includes: The Bulong Taurus Project, 35km east of Kalgoorlie-Boulder. \nContains the outcropping La Mascotte gold deposit as well as a series of satellite prospects and historic workings of \nthe Taurus Goldfield. Importantly, KalGold's methods resulted in the definition of a JORC (2012) MRE (3.61 Mt @ \n1.19 g/t Au for 138,000 oz1 ) that is one of the most inexpensive in recent times (A$ 4.60 per ounce of gold). \nExploration work continues at the project. The Pinjin Project within the 30Moz Laverton Tectonic Zone (host to \nSunrise Dam, Granny Smith, Rebecca, Anglo Saxon, and Wallaby projects). Located only 25km north along strike \nfrom Ramelius Resources (ASX: RMS) Rebecca Gold Project. With historic work identifying open gold \nmineralisation from shallow levels, work is focussing on defining and testing targets throughout the project area \nwhile defining new resources. At Kirgella and Pinjin South, tenure is the subject of a farm-in over the next two \nyears to expand upon known mineralisation. Between this tenure and KalGold's existing tenure and applications, \nthe Company has established a significant presence in a strategic and important region. Other projects are the \nfocus of early-stage exploration programs. Gold anomalism and recent discoveries are driving efforts at Perrinvale \nand Zelica. Additionally, lithium potential is being tested at the Pianto and Pinjin projects.\n[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to newswire@enpublishing.co.uk ]   \nLoad-Date: July 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Ramelius Resources.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
