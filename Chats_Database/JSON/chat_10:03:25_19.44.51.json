As a \nresult, in the short term there will be an ebb and flow in job numbers as we move through various stages, finish our \ninitial main camp construction, and allow time for studies to be completed.\n\"We remain focused on prioritising the employment of a local workforce and will explore ways to upskill and \nredeploy staff to other areas of the business where possible.\n\"In line with Fortescue's commitment to create a positive impact in the areas in which we operate, we will continue \nto engage with, and support, local communities.\" Fortescue did not respond to questions about whether exploration \nwork had come to halt, or how many employees it had on the ground in Gabon.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue 'remains fully committed' to Africa mine\nMore than 600 Gabonese, including contractors, have been employed on the project at various times, including 200 \nfrom local villages. Fortescue had also purchased more than $US30m ($48m) in goods and services from \nbusinesses in Gabon.\nFortescue owns a 72 per cent stake in Ivindo Iron, the entity that operates the Belinga project. The remainder of \nIvindo is held by Abu Dhabi's Africa Transformation and Industrialisation Fund and the Gabon government.\nPerth-headquartered Fortescue earmarked $US200m for early-stage mining development at Belinga in 2023-24.\nIt has not provided guidance on capital expenditure at Belinga in 2024-25 after shifting focus to exploration and \nstudy work.\nFortescue has flagged expenditure of $US300m-$US400m across the group on various exploration projects and \nstudies in 2024-25, with any spending on Belinga likely to come from this pool.\nJulie Shuttleworth, one of Dr Forrest's most trusted lieutenants at Fortescue for more than a decade, was running \nthe project before she left the company in June 2024.\nIn an update provided at the end of September, Fortescue said exploration work continued and to that point more \nthan 70,000 metres of reverse circulation drilling and 10,000 metres of diamond core drilling had been completed.\nSources said Fortescue was finding the going tougher in Gabon under military rule after making rapid progress \nwith Belinga under the former president.\nThe December 2023 shipment came just 10 months after Fortescue signed a mining convention with the then \nGabonese government.\nThe immaterial volume of iron ore on board was sourced from a small operation at Belinga, a potential high-grade \ndeposit in Gabon's northeast that has been subject to extensive studies and was once on BHP's radar.\nFortescue metals division chief executive Dino Otranto hailed the shipment as a remarkable achievement at the \ntime.\n\"This project has the potential to revolutionise our portfolio and ultimately create a product that will be the envy of \nour peers,\" he said. \"It will also open growth opportunities for Fortescue throughout Africa.\" Gabon handed an \noperating permit covering Belinga to the China Machinery Engineering Corporation as far back as 2006, but \nsuspended the permit after a falling-out between the parties.\nLoad-Date: December 31, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's CEO | \"Fortescue remains fully committed to the Belinga iron ore project and the long-term benefits a large-scale development will bring to Gabon.\" | N.A. |\n| General Brice Oligui Nguema | Military ruler of Gabon | \"Our discussions with the Gabon government remain positive and we continue to work together to advance a potential large-scale development.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue metals division chief executive | \"This project has the potential to revolutionise our portfolio and ultimately create a product that will be the envy of our peers.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
