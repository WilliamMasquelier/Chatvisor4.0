Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 15\nLength: 304 words\nByline: Kylar Loussikian\nBody\nFormer Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner has quit Fortescue less than 18 months after joining the \nAndrew Forrest-chaired energy and iron ore major.\nHis departure followed the exit of Deborah Caudle, the chief financial officer of Fortescue's energy division, this \nweek and the resignation of former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull earlier in the month. All three were part of \nFortescue's energy business, which is pursuing green hydrogen developments around the world.\nMr Gunner, who resigned as chief minister in May 2022 after leading Labor to government in 2016, said working \nwith Dr Forrest \"was an incredible opportunity\" and he would remain \"an advocate for Fortescue and the path they \nare forging\".\nBut his departure, and those of Ms Caudle and Mr Turnbull, will bring greater investor scrutiny on Fortescue's \nenergy business. There has been an extended executive exodus over the past five years, with former Reserve \nBank deputy governor Guy Debelle lasting just five months as chief financial officer, while his successor, Felicity \nGoodman, remained in the job for eight months before being replaced by Ms Caudle.\nMoody's, a major rating agency, in September said the departures represented a \"credit negative, with the potential \nto impact strategy and operations, which may have implications on the group's balance sheet, financing and capital \nstructure\".\nFortescue's lucrative mining division has lost two chief financial officers - Ian Wells and Christine Morris - since \nAugust 2022. Its chief executive, Fiona Hick, was replaced by Dino Otranto in September after just six months in \nthe position.\nInvestors have, so far, shrugged off the elevated executive turnover, with Fortescue shares more than 30 per cent \nhigher over the past 12 months. Shares were down 1.3 per cent yesterday, falling 38\u00a2 to $29.50.\nLoad-Date: February 4, 2024\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue exodus ramps up\nEnd of Document\n        ",
