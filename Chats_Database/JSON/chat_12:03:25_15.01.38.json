It operates in the digital communications technology, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Cisco based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Cisco is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Cisco.\n\nIf Cisco is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nGet ready to 'rip it up' at Newcastle's two-day Portside Festival\nGet ready to 'rip it up' at Newcastle's two-day Portside Festival\nNewcastle Herald (Australia)\nJuly 9, 2024 Tuesday\nPrint & Internet Editions\nCopyright 2024 Australian Community Media All Rights Reserved\nLength: 504 words\nByline: Lisa Rockman\nBody\nThe Living End, Hockey Dad and San Cisco are among the bands named on the two-day Portside Festival line-up \nstopping off at The Station in December.\nThe team at Earp Distilling Co at Carrington, under the Earp Presents banner, are bringing some of Australian \nmusic's biggest names to Newcastle for the event - and giving local bands a taste of the festival stage.\nDay one (December 21) features Hockey Dad, San Cisco, Keli Holiday, RAAVE Tapes and Sumner, with two \nadditional bands being revealed this month.\nDay two (December 22) brings The Living End, Birds of Tokyo, Eskimo Joe, Killing Heidi, 28 Days and Butterknife \nto the city's central business district.\nEarp Distilling Co operations manager Cameron Burns says his team is \"looking forward to bringing something \nexciting to Newcastle\".\nTicket sales will be capped at 4500 for each day of the festival.\n\"It's been a bit disappointing to see all the music festivals cancelling and live music struggling, so we've been \nworking hard to get this festival up and running,\" he said.\n\"We hosted a music festival at the distillery last year, Carrodise, which had 1500 tickets and they sold out. Our \nspace is not built for that kind of thing so Earp Presents now focuses on off-site events where we can showcase our \nspirits, local food, beer and wine, and our city.\"\nEarp Presents formed following the success of Carrodise. It's the first time the team has planned something of this \nscale, though, and they've worked closely with The Station Newcastle, City of Newcastle and Newcastle Tourism to \nbring the festival to the heart of the city.\n\"Earp Presents is us as a distillery, as a business, as a hospitality hub, taking live music and events off-site,\" Mr \nBurns said.\nPage 2 of 2\nGet ready to 'rip it up' at Newcastle's two-day Portside Festival\n\"We did the air show and the Supercars for the council. Fingers crossed this one goes the way we'd like it as we've \ngot five more events at The Station next year.\"\nThe first event, in February, will feature international artists and \"some huge names\".\n\"Each event will be different, showcasing different styles and genres and ideas, but let's walk before we run,\" Mr \nBurns said.\n\"With Portside Festival we want an intimate, boutique music festival where we are showcasing local beer, wine, \nspirits and food in a city centre location.\n\"We'll employ upwards of 200 staff over the two days, too.\"\nThe first band will perform from noon on both days, with the headliner finishing up at about 9.30pm.\n\"The main reason we are using The Station for the festival, apart from the way it showcases the city, is that it's all \nDA-approved and ready to go,\" he said.\n\"It's so difficult to get a festival up and running if it's in a park or in the middle of nowhere, away from transport.\n\"We've teamed up with hotel partners so we'll have discounted hotels, and it's easy to get there by tram, train and \nbus.\"\nPortside Festival 2024 is on December 21 and 22 at The Station Newcastle, 18+ only. Members-only presale \ntickets are on sale now, with first-release general public tickets on sale at 10am on Tuesday, July 9, at \nearpdistillingco.com.\nLoad-Date: July 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Cisco.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
