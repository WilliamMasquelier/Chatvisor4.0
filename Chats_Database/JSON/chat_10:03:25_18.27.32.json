The \nadvance means Australia's largest bank has now climbed around 22 times in value (excluding dividends) since its \ninitial public offer at $5.40 per share in 1991.\n\"Investors think interest rates have peaked, and the outlook is for lower rates, so people seem happy to buy at a 4 \nper cent yield for premium banks,\" said Sean Sequeira, the chief investment officer of Australian Eagle Asset \nManagement.\nNAB climbed 0.7 per cent to $34.32 with Westpac up 0.2 per cent to $27.\nTechnology stocks got a lift from Wall Street overnight, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index added 0.6 per cent and \nsemiconductor giant Nvidia rose to a new all-time high of $US887 ($1348) per share and $US2.2 trillion valuation.\nOn the local sharemarket, WiseTech added 1.1 per cent to $1.06 and NextDC rose 2.5 per cent to $17.37.\nIn the mining sector, market heavyweights BHP, Rio Tinto and South32 all traded ex-dividend and lost value, \nkeeping a lid on the market's gains.
