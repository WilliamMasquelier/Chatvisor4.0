Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's Executive Chairman | \"Fortescue is concerned that without the Australian government, WA government and industry uniting to develop a focused and funded green iron plan for the Pilbara, the nation runs the risk of losing its long-established and high earning place in the global steel supply chain.\" | N.A. |\n| Rebecca Tomkinson | WA Chamber of Minerals and Energy Chief Executive | \"We need governments to be making bold decisions, big investment decisions now.\" | N.A. |\n| Rebecca Tomkinson | WA Chamber of Minerals and Energy Chief Executive | \"Without affordable energy, cheap decarbonised energy, we can't do any of it.\" | N.A. |\n| Roger Cook | Premier of Western Australia | \"WA is best-positioned to support a low-carbon steel project given our vast reserves of iron ore, mature and advanced iron ore industry, local technological know-how, and significant renewable energy opportunities.\" | N.A. |\n| Roger Cook | Premier of Western Australia | \"Further opportunities to reduce emissions across the steel-making supply chain are applicable if plants can be located near renewable energy precincts.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
