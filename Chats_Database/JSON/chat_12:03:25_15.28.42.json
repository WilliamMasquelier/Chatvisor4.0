The process is in the early stages and Shell has yet to commit to any final decisions.\nAmong the assets included in the review is Shell's Deer Park -facility in Texas. The site produces a range of \nchemicals such as light and heavy olefins, which can be used to make pharmaceuticals, detergents, adhesives and \nwire coating. The operation is -located adjacent to a refinery, which Shell previously sold its stake in. Shell also has \nchemical facilities in Pennsylvania and Louisiana in the US, and in -Europe it has plants in the UK, Germany and \nThe Netherlands.\nPotential bidders for the assets could range from private-equity firms to Middle Eastern buyers wanting to expand \ninto the West.\nSince chief executive Wael Sawan took the helm of Shell at the start of 2023, the company has worked to focus \nmore on its most profitable operations. To that end, the company has rolled back some of its green-energy targets \nand pledged to pump more oil and gas. Shell's chemicals business has been seen as lagging behind for years. It is \ncapital-heavy and subject to cyclical ups and downs, resulting in losses in recent years that have weighed on the \ncompany's overall performance. Anaemic gas prices and rising capacity in chemical manufacturing have caused \nthe petrochemical market to languish recently. The company has already signalled its willingness to shed lower-\nmargin chemicals operations. Last year, it struck a deal to sell its chemicals park in Singapore to a joint venture that \nincludes Glencore, the mining company, and Chandra Asri, an Indonesia-based chemicals producer.\nLoad-Date: March 3, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
