Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Street Talk; Pg. 16\nLength: 303 words\nByline: Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood and Emma Rapaport\nBody\nJPMorgan's equity capital markets team was looking for buyers for $1.9 billion of discounted Fortescue stock after \nyesterday's closing bell on behalf of an undisclosed institutional investor.\nFund managers were told to bid in 5\u00a2 increments, from an $18.55 floor up to a maximum of $19.10 per Fortescue \nshare. It represented an 8.8 per cent to 6.1 per cent discount to the last close - and was worth 3.2 per cent of the \n$62.6 billion company.\nThe book was due to shut at 8pm for Asia Pacific investors, and 1am for rest of the world. JPMorgan was the sole \nbookrunner, and had underwritten the trade at the floor price.\nFingers were pointing at The Capital Group, which on June 14 sold $1.1 billion of Fortescue stock, also via \nJPMorgan. That trade was done at $21.60 a share or a 6 per cent discount to the last traded price.\nYesterday's term sheet said the seller - who wasn't identified - had vouched to lock up their remaining shareholding \nfor 45 days. Should the seller be The Capital Group as expected, it would go down to owning about 3.42 per cent of \nFortescue.\nBlock trades this size are few and far between, but suggest institutional investors are tiring of Andrew Forrest's \nFortescue, which seems to be battling major C-suite issues, at the same time as iron ore prices slump, costs rise, \nand its hydrogen ambitions prove unrealistic.\nFortescue shipped 191.2 million tonnes of Australian iron ore in the 12 months to June 30; the first time in five \nyears the company has reported a sequential decline in export volumes, after shipping 192 million tonnes in the \nprevious financial year. Last Thursday, it warned of higher costs across its WA iron ore operations. Earlier this \nmonth, it abandoned a target for Fortescue to produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030. Shares have \nfallen 30.8 per cent year-to-date.\nLoad-Date: August 1, 2024\nPage 2 of 2\nNear $2b of Fortescue shares hit market in huge block trade Street Talk\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\nNone\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
