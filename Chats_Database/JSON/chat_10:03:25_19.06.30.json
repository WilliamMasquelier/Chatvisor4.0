It says it has already invested about \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u0161\u00c2\u00ac2.5bn ($4bn) as part of a \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u0161\u00c2\u00ac12bn green program aimed at increasing the group's fertiliser production to 20 million tonnes a year - up \nfrom 12 million tonnes in 2022. Its initial plans for a green ammonia production centre were centred around the \nsmall fishing town of Tarfaya in southwest Morocco - once best known for the treacherous waters off its coast, a \n19th-century British fortress now crumbling into the sea, and for being the closest mainland town to the surfing \nresorts of the Canary Islands, about 80km to the west.\nOCP planned to build a -3.8 gigawatt wind and solar farm in the region, with an eventual production capacity of one \nmillion tonnes of green ammonia a year from 2027 and three million tonnes from 2032.\nBut, in addition to its isolation, Tarfaya is also disputed territory. It is only 35km north of the disputed regional border \nof the Western Sahara - a Spanish colony until 1975, but since occupied by Morocco.\nMoroccan control of the -region is disputed by the traditional Sahrawi people. Their separatist movement has this \nyear launched attacks on Moroccan troops in the region - which already hosts large wind farms built by companies \nowned by the country's royal family.\nIt is unclear whether Fortescue's joint venture with OCP will focus on the Moroccan company's original plans, and \nthe Australian mining and energy giant has not elaborated further on their work in the region.\n\"The Fortescue team is working with key stakeholders as we continue to develop our ambitious strategy with OCP, \ndeveloped over more than two years, to develop green energy, hydrogen and ammonia in Morocco,\" a spokesman \nsaid on Tuesday.\nFortescue's African plans have already suffered one major setback this month, after it was - replaced as the \npreferred developer of the giant Grand Inga hydro-electric project in the Democratic Republic of Congo by Nigerian \noil company Natural Oilfield Services.\nThe Grand Inga, estimated to come with a total cost of more than $US80bn ($120bn), was a favoured project of Dr \nForrest, and Fortescue's involvement was announced with fanfare in mid-2021, during the first flush of \nannouncements around the company's plans to become a green energy giant by the end of the decade.\nMARGIN CALL P13\nLoad-Date: May 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
