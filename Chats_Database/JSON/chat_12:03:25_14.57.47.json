Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1497 words\nHighlight: Fossil fuel majors are choosing profits over plans to bring a clean future closer.\nBody\nThis month, Shell made its move. The world's second-largest oil and gas company and largest LNG producer \nannounced it was watering down its climate targets, its chief executive Wael Sawan fretting to Reuters that it was \n\"perilous\" for Shell to set 2035 emission reduction targets because, \"there is too much uncertainty at the moment in \nthe energy transition trajectory\".\nVoicing his confidence that fossils would remain integral to the global energy mix in the longer-term Sawan added \nthat, \"there is going to be a multidimensional energy system in the future, [and] oil and gas will continue to have an \nimportant role in stabilising that system for a long, long, long time to come\".\nLink to Image\nJamila Toderas\n\"We are trying to focus our company, our organisation, and our shareholders on a waypoint that's much clearer ... \nwhich is 2030,\" Sawan said. He also announced a reduction in the company's 2030 targets.\nIn 2020, as oil prices plunged towards zero, BP was at the forefront of a push by the oil and gas majors to remake \nthemselves as \"diversified energy\" companies and drive faster into a renewable future.\nIts then chief executive Bernard Looney announced that the company would not only reach net zero by 2050, but \nthat it would actively lobby for international carbon taxes.\nBut a lot has changed since then. Looney was moved on, fairly unceremoniously, by his board in September 2023.\nMore significantly, Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022, effectively knocking the second-largest fossil \nfuel exporter on earth out of the West's oil and gas market. By 2022 crude oil prices had surged to more than \nUS$120 ($184) a barrel, and it remains healthily above $80 a barrel today.\nIn February last year, BP backtracked. During a quarterly earnings report BP announced that it had made a record \nprofit of US$27.7 billion over the previous year, more than double its 2021 profit, and that it was reducing its goals \nto cut oil production.\nPage 2 of 4\nAfter years of promises on climate change, oil giants are backtracking\nIn March last year, ExxonMobil abandoned its research to create low emissions fuel from algae. Since 2009 the \ncompany had spent US$350 million on the effort, which it had used extensively in marketing to burnish its green \ncredentials.\n\"The dirty secret nobody talks about is how much all this is going to cost and who's willing to pay for it,\"  chief \nexecutive Darren Woods told Fortune last month of the world's quest to decarbonise. \"The people who are \ngenerating those emissions need to be aware of and pay the price for generating those emissions. That is ultimately \nhow you solve the problem.\"\nThat might be the case, but climate observers were unimpressed, particularly because ExxonMobil was already \ninfamous for doing accurate cutting edge early research into climate change, only to downplay the science publicly.\n\"It's like a drug lord blaming everyone but himself for drug problems,\" Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at \nColumbia Business School, told The Guardian.\nThen, as though to clarify the fossil sector's position, or perhaps to take its gloves off, the chief executive of the \nbiggest of them all, Saudi Aramco, spoke even more bluntly during a panel discussion at a global energy \nconference in Texas earlier this month.\n\"We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas,\" Amin Nasser said, to applause from the audience.\n\"A transition strategy reset is urgently needed, and my proposal is this: We should abandon the fantasy of phasing \nout oil and gas and instead invest in them adequately reflecting realistic demand assumptions.\"\nNasser spoke of \"hard realities\" and said that \"in the real world, the current transition strategy is visibly failing on \nmost fronts\". He said alternative energy sources had failed to displace hydrocarbons at scale, noting that oil \ndemand had increased by 100 million barrels of oil equivalent a day this century and would reach an all-time high \nthis year.\nThe increasing energy needs of developing nations would see demand remain high, and grow until 2045, he said.\n\"We should phase in new energy sources and technologies when they are genuinely ready, economically \ncompetitive and with the right infrastructure,\" Nasser said.\n\"All this strengthens the view that peak oil and gas is unlikely for some time to come, let alone 2030,\" he said. \"No \none is betting the farm on that.\"\nFor governments and policy-makers the problem with Nasser's real world is it conflicts with the other one, which \nhas just sweltered through its hottest year in history due to carbon dioxide emissions, 70 per cent of which come \nfrom the burning of fossil fuels.\nIn this real world, global leaders gathered in Dubai in December for climate talks and after two weeks of hard fought \nnegotiations agreed to begin \"transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable \nmanner ... so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science\".\nThe language was significant because fossil fuels have never before been explicitly referred to in a declaration of \nthe UN climate talks, but talk of \"transitioning away\" fell far short of the language that around 130 of the 198 \ncountries represented at the talks had called for. Those countries wanted fossil fuel companies and their invested \nto be put on notice with an agreement to \"phase out\" oil and gas.\nLink to Image\nIISD\n\"We have made an incremental advancement over business as usual when what we really needed is an \nexponential step change in our actions,\" said Anne Rasmussen from Samoa, the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Page 3 of 4\nAfter years of promises on climate change, oil giants are backtracking\nSmall Islands States, to a standing ovation on the floor of the plenary session. \"It is not enough for us to reference \nthe science and then make agreements that ignore what the science is telling us we need to do.\"\nThe US climate envoy, John Kerry, who pushed hard to secure the compromise, was more upbeat. \"For the very \nfirst time at a COP, fossil fuels have been on the table as a major part of our negotiations,\" he said. \"And the \ndecision that came out of this clearly embraces transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, so as to \nachieve net zero by 2050.\"\nNasser's position also contradicts that of the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organisation that \nhas traditionally been closely identified with the fossil fuel industry.\nMore recently in its analysis the IEA has been blunt about the need for the world to transition, and about its capacity \nto do so.\nIn its annual World Energy Outlook report last year the IEA predicted that fossil fuel demand would peak by 2030, \nbefore entering a plateau and slow decline.\n\"The transition to clean energy is happening worldwide, and it's unstoppable,\" IEA chief Fatih Birol said in a \nstatement at the time. \"Claims that oil and gas represent safe or secure choices for the world's energy and climate \nfuture look weaker than ever.\"\nAs the IEA's position on fossils has drifted from that of the industry, criticism of it has ramped up. In Dubai the \nOPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais  accused Birol of \"unjustly vilifying\" the industry as being behind the \nclimate crisis.\nBut the IEA's analysis of the industry remains world leading, and its data suggest that whatever the fossil majors \nare saying about long-term demand, their shareholders might not hold the same confidence.\nAn IEA report on energy investment showed a significant decline in the amount of cash the industry was reinvesting \nin its production. Between 2008 and 2017 the figure hovered between 80 and 100 per cent, then it declines. Last \nyear the sector ploughed just 50 per cent of its cash back into the business, with the rest being doled out to \nshareholders.\n\"Uncertainties over longer-term demand, worries about costs, and pressure from many investors and owners to \nfocus on returns rather than production growth mean only large Middle Eastern national oil companies are \nspending much more in 2023 than they did in 2022, and they are the only subset of the industry spending more \nthan pre-pandemic levels,\" read the IEA's analysis.\nThis is significant because the energy industry typically outlays vast amounts of capital exploiting a resource - say a \nnew oil or gas field - and then uses the bulk of the return to develop the next one. Now it appears shareholders are \ndemanding more of the cash is diverted to them rather than reinvested in future production.\n\"It looks like an industry that is enjoying a very profitable but ultimately terminal decline,\" says the energy analyst \nTim Buckley, an advocate of renewables.\n\"We are still addicted to fossil fuels, we can't stop overnight, but we are stopping,\" he says.\nIt also brings us back to those climate talks in Dubai. When the deal was struck the COP28 president Sultan Ahmed \nal-Jaber, himself an oil executive, celebrated it as historic, but added that it would be judged on its \nimplementation.\"We are what we do, not what we say,\" he told the crowded final session of the summit.\nGet to the heart of what's happening with climate change and the environment.
