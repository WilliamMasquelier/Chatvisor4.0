And then other countries that also have the ambition to do exactly the same,\" he said.\nMr Hutchinson said the technology behind the manufacturing process for electrolysers made it easy to roll out in \nany country that wanted to work with Fortescue.\n\"The beautiful thing about (this facility) is it's fully automated. We can do it anywhere,\" he said.\n\"You don't have to think about labour or train people, so you just build a fully automated facility and off we go.\" \nFortescue will now test the technology as it looks to slowly ramp up the facility to reach its peak capacity of more \nthan 2GW and did not expect customers to receive orders until 2025.\n\"We're building a test facility which will hopefully be in production, which will make hydrogen from about September, \nOctober this year.\nAnd then we've actually got to do it at an industrial scale,\" Mr Hutchinson said.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue to roll out more electrolyser plants after Gladstone\n\"Realistically, it's going to be 2025 (until the product is rolled out commercially) by the time we get the testing done \nand the sales and we make them,\" he said.\nThe Queensland government, which held its cabinet meeting on the factory floor on Monday, signed off on the next \nstage, PEM50.\nIt will use the locally made PEM electrolysers to produce green hydrogen for local and export markets.\nOnce operational it will be the first commercial-scale green hydrogen facility for Fortescue.\nFederal Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic told The Australian that the Fortescue site would play a pivotal role \nin Australia's transition to net zero and opened the door for more businesses locally and internationally to invest in \nthe space.\n\"It shows regional Australia has a role to play in the transition to net zero in manufacturing. And that's the big thing \nfor me, is to see that opportunity spread out. We want everyone to pitch in from all corners of the country,\" he said.\n\"The (Fortescue sites) are important examples that businesses and other sections of industry can see what can be \ndone. It is a signal to send about the capacity for regional Australia and to get the job done.\" Mr Hutchinson said all \noptions were on the table as Fortescue looked for further opportunities in the energy transition space.\n\"Fundamentally, our view is that with the green molecule coming, everything gets disrupted. So theoretically, you \nlook at any industry, and it's going to be disruptive,\" he said.\n\"We're going to be the shift business and we're going to be in the cable business, and we're going to be in maybe a \nlot of other business.\n\"We are looking at everything.\" It's a busy time for Fortescue as it continues to pivot away from its reliance on iron \nore.\nGreen hydrogen hopeful Sparc Technologies and its joint venture partners, including Fortescue Future Industries, \nare also progressing plans to begin construction of a multimillion-dollar pilot plant in the coming months.

The Yindjibarndi were found to be native \ntitleholders of the land in 2017.\nOne of the traditional owners' claims for compensation, previously untested, is around social disharmony based on \nFortescue opting to throw its support behind a breakaway group, Wirlu-murra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation, \nwhich has separately struck deals with the miner.\nGriff Ranson SC, the silk for the state of Western Australia, played the court a recording of a conversation between \nDr Nelson with the leader of YAC, Michael Woodley, to suggest he was biased towards the YAC's interests.\n\"A fair-minded listener could reasonably conclude from listening to this audio recording that your evidence is not \nimpartial, but that you've become an advocate for the cause of the party that's retained you,\" he said.\nDr Nelson refuted the suggestions that he was biased and that his report was one-sided.\n\"The excerpts of the tape may have presented me in a particular way and I make no apology for interacting with him \non level that they are comfortable with,\" he told the court when re-examined by YAC's counsel Tina Jowett. \"I am \nnot an advocate for one person ... I really went to great lengths to get information from both sides of this divide.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nExpert denies $1b Fortescue case bias\nFortescue's silk Brahmananda Dharmananda SC sought to cast doubt on the report's finding that Fortescue \ncaused social division, and argued Dr Nelson didn't make an effort to interview the breakaway group.\n\"The sample group of 21 people cannot statistically reflect ... the whole of the people - given there around 1200 of \nthem?\" he asked.\nDr Nelson agreed the maths was correct, but explained this criticism didn't stand in a professional setting. \"When \nyou're talking in the clinical space, it's a different argument.

He said he \nvisited their office on five occasions, and had arranged to interview a group of people, but they didn't turn up.\nFortescue's silk further put to the court that the social dislocation and trauma faced by the group couldn't be \npegged on Fortescue, and instead the social dislocation stretched back to the 1960s and 1970s.\nDr Nelson agreed that it was not possible to pin the group's trauma and dislocation exclusively on Fortescue.\nBut on re-examination by Ms Jowett,he said Fortescue mining the land without permission compounded the \nfoundational trauma of the group's relocation.\nLoad-Date: April 14, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Elouise Fowler\nDate: April 12, 2024\nTitle: Expert denies $1b Fortescue case bias\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: The iron men with a $3 billion plan to save the planet\n## Media outlet: WA Today\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: April 14, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 3\nThe iron men with a $3 billion plan to save the planet\nThe iron men with a $3 billion plan to save the planet\nWA Today\nApril 14, 2024 Sunday 10:58 PM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1465 words\nHighlight: Two former Fortescue executives want to reduce the enormous carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's \nmost lucrative export industry. It'll cost at least $3 billion.\nBody\nThe lofty ambitions of two former Fortescue executives, who want to build a $US2.1 billion ($3.2 billion) green iron \nore processing plant in the Pilbara within five years, will require a gigantic infusion of money.\nMichael Masterman and Bart Kolodziejczyk formed Element Zero at the end of 2022, which aims to reduce the \ncarbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry. It's a big step up from the $US10 million the \ngroup raised at the start of this year in seed funding, and there are plans to undertake another capital raising later in \nthe year, targeting $US50 million to $US100 million.\nIron is the key ingredient in steel production, which the world depends on for construction and manufacturing. \nHowever, production of iron and steel emits a combined 3.4 billion tonnes of carbon annually, or 7 per cent of global \nemissions, according to energy analysts Wood Mackenzie.\nIf the international agreement to limit global warming is to be achieved, emissions must reach net-zero by 2050. To \ndecarbonise the iron ore and steel industries, Wood Mackenzie has estimated it would require a mind-bending \n$US1.4 trillion in global investment - almost equivalent to Australia's total annual gross domestic product.\nThis makes the capital needs of Element Zero seem less of a tall order.\n\"There is so much interest in what we do both in Australia and globally, in particular in the US, that we believe that \nwe can make it,\" said Kolodziejczyk, Element Zero's co-founder and chief technology officer.\nElement Zero, which employs about two dozen staff, has developed and patented a technology to reduce iron ore \nto pure iron through an electrochemical process.\nAn alkaline solution and electric current are used to separate pure iron from silica, alumina and oxygen. Iron ore is \ndissolved into the solution and when electricity - from a renewable source - passes through it, the pure iron collects \non a cathode.\nThe group said it had also made progress on decarbonising silicon.\nElement Zero has pitched itself to investors as a platform company, its technology aimed at converting metal ores \nto metals, not only iron ore, with zero carbon emissions.\nPage 2 of 3\nThe iron men with a $3 billion plan to save the planet\nElement Zero is seeking West Australian government approval for its green iron processing plant on 25 hectares in \nthe Boodarie strategic industrial estate near Port Hedland. Kolodziejczyk said the group was also seeking a \nseparate site to build a wind and solar farm to power the plant.\nHe said the plant would be capable of processing 5 million tonnes of iron ore feed into 2.7 million tonnes of green \niron per year within five years, with plans to scale up to processing 50 million tonnes.\nElement Zero's pilot plant in Perth is still a long way from industrial scale. It is processing 100 kg of iron ore daily, \nbought from major iron ore producers.\nA process known as direct reduction uses natural gas, or methane, in a furnace to extract pure iron from iron ore. \nSome companies such as Fortescue have explored replacing methane with green hydrogen.\nKolodziejczyk, once Fortescue's chief scientist, led a push to develop green hydrogen to decarbonise the \ncompany's mining operations and shipping fleet.\nMasterman, Element Zero's chief executive, has had a long career in the energy industry, including in Europe and \nalso worked as Fortescue Future Industries' chief financial officer. He was chairman of renewable energy group \nSquadron Energy, part of the Tattarang group of companies, which are linked to Fortescue founder Andrew \nForrest.\n\"The entire industry has enormous commercial pressures, shareholder pressures and goodwill to find technology \nsolutions that can reduce the carbon emissions from converting iron ore into iron,\" said Masterman. \"We can \nsignificantly move the dial.\"\nAbout 560 million tonnes of iron ore are shipped through Port Hedland annually.\n\"If we can move to converting the vast, exceptional natural resources we have in Australia to metals, rather than \njust exporting the raw ore, that's going to have two impacts. It's going to help significantly reduce carbon emissions \nand ... substantially strengthen Australia.\"\nElement Zero faces strong competition from other companies that have or are developing technology to make \ngreen iron and steel, among them Fortescue Future Industries, which last year claimed it had built a pilot plant that \ncould turn iron ore into green iron using a membrane.\nElement Zero is exploring converting other metal ores to metals with zero carbon emissions, including lithium, nickel \nand silicon.\nKolodziejczyk acknowledges the challenges but remains confident, predicting that eventually some of the major iron \nore producers, among them BHP, Rio Tinto, Fortescue, Vale, and Roy Hill, could become investors in Element \nZero. \"We believe that some of those majors will come and invest in us.\"\nCompanies such as BHP and Vale have invested in clean tech groups such as Boston Metal, which is working on \ndecarbonising steelmaking. BHP also has a stake in Electra, a start-up focused on decarbonising iron making.\nIn January, H2 Green Steel, which has technology that it says will help to decarbonise European steel, raised \n(EURO)4.2 billion ($6.9 billion) in debt financing. The start-up was founded in 2020.\nKolodziejczyk said Element Zero was also holding discussions with potential customers in Japan and South Korea \nfor its green iron.\n\"Given how quickly we are moving with the technology scale-up, and also with the project in the Pilbara, we believe \nit's a good time to secure those initial agreements,\" he said. \"That's what we're going to do in the next couple of \nmonths. We believe the first offtake will come from Japan. Obviously having those agreements in place will help us \nwith the next fund raise.\"Page 3 of 3\nThe iron men with a $3 billion plan to save the planet\nMasterman said Element Zero was providing potential customers with samples of its green iron so they \"can test it \nto understand any adjustments they might need to make in their systems to be able to utilise it in their processing \nplants\".\nKolodziejczyk said Element Zero's next fundraising could be as much as $US100 million. Masterman declined to \nprovide a figure, saying instead the group was focused on proving its technology in stages to secure funding.\nElement Zero is also exploring potential grants from the United States through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). \nThe IRA has directed hundreds of billions of dollars to clean energy projects, including electric vehicles, to \naccelerate the country's transition to net-zero.\nThe IRA has fuelled a manufacturing boom in the US but that rapid growth in cleantech manufacturing has come at \na cost. It has driven a huge increase in electricity demand, as has the development of artificial intelligence and \ndigital currencies, which threaten to slow the path to net-zero, as renewable energy companies struggle to keep \npace.\nLast week, the Australian government announced a new industrial policy - the Future Made in Australia Act - that \nwas immediately dubbed a mini-version of the IRA, although details of the policy are yet to be released. It will target \nadvanced manufacturing and clean energy projects with government-funded incentives.\nThe push to decarbonise the iron ore sector comes amid pressure on exports. Vivek Dhar, director of the \nCommonwealth Bank's mining and energy commodities research team, has forecast that iron ore prices will \naverage between $US100-$110 a tonne for the remainder of the year, after hitting $US140 in January.\nHe said there were risks the price could fall below those forecasts if growth slowed in China, as a result of a slump \nin its property sector. China imports almost 75 per cent of the world's iron ore.\nElement Zero is exploring converting other metal ores to metals with zero carbon emissions, including lithium, nickel \nand silicon.\nKolodziejczyk said the group had made good progress with silicon. \"We are trying to refine the process. The team is \nworking towards that, and we believe that could be our second offering.\"\nSilicon is used in the manufacturing of solar cells and microchips. The US has also introduced the CHIPS and \nScience Act that aims to boost investment, manufacturing and research and development in semiconductors.\n\"If we're able to take literally sand and convert it into silicon metal, with very little carbon emissions, that makes a \nmajor difference to the supply source of silicon metal and the carbon emissions that come from producing it,\" said \nMasterman.\n\"Silicon is a very exciting one for us and one in which we might be able to move more quickly. We could accelerate \nparts of the silicon plant in parallel with the work we're doing in iron ore. There are some significant opportunities in \nthe United States we're considering.\"\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

[AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 08, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been accused of causing deep divisions within the Yindjibarndi community by financially backing a breakaway group, Wirlu-Murra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation, which accepted a mining deal in 2010 after reportedly paying people $500 each to vote in favor, leading to lasting social rifts and conflicts among traditional owners. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 08, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has legally destroyed dozens of significant Yindjibarndi cultural sites since mining began at its Solomon hub in 2013, extracting iron ore worth an estimated $50 billion without paying any compensation to the recognised native title holders, raising serious concerns about the company's treatment of Indigenous land rights. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 08, 2024].  \n\n- A clinical psychologist testified in court that the impact of Fortescue\u2019s mining activities on the Yindjibarndi people is comparable to the social devastation caused by alcohol abuse, with traditional owners reporting significant trauma linked to the destruction of their cultural heritage and the company\u2019s role in dividing their community. [ABC Premium News, Anonymous, April 09, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has never had an Indigenous land use agreement with the Yindjibarndi people, despite mining on their land for over a decade, leading to a $500 million compensation claim for unpaid royalties, interest, and damages for cultural and spiritual losses, which could result in a significant financial and reputational impact on the company. [ABC Premium News, Anonymous, April 09, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has failed to meet a twice-extended March 31 deadline for a final investment decision on the Gibson Island hydrogen plant, forcing renewable energy company Genex to seek alternative buyers for its proposed Bulli Creek solar farm, which was initially planned to supply power to Fortescue\u2019s project, raising concerns about Fortescue\u2019s ability to secure returns at Australian power prices. [The Australian, Nick Evans, April 03, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue dropped the Gibson Island hydrogen project from its top priority list only six weeks after signing an agreement with Genex, despite previously flagging plans to make a final investment decision by the end of 2023, creating uncertainty for its partners and raising doubts about the company's commitment to its green energy ambitions. [The Australian, Nick Evans, April 03, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's executive exodus has been blamed on its corporate culture, with insiders suggesting that new recruits struggle to fit into the company's unique environment, raising concerns about leadership stability and the company's ability to retain top talent. [The Australian, Colin Packham, March 12, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's Gibson Island hydrogen project remains in limbo as high power prices make it \"tough\" to proceed, with the company relying on government intervention to mitigate costs, casting doubt on the financial feasibility of its green energy ambitions.
