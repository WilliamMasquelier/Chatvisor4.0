It operates in the Renewable energy, with a prefered focus on the Netherlands market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Orsted based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Orsted is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Orsted.\n\nIf Orsted is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nWind energy firms \u00d8rsted, Vestas and Siemens spy green shoots but uncertainties remain\nWind energy firms \u00d8rsted, Vestas and Siemens spy green shoots but \nuncertainties remain\n \nProactive Investors (UK)\nFebruary 7, 2024 Wednesday 01:01 PM EST\nCopyright 2024 Proactive UK Ltd All Rights Reserved\nLength: 393 words\nByline: Oliver Haill\nBody\nIn a busy day for the renewable energy sector, \u00d8rsted, Vestas and Siemens Energy reported varying financial \nresults, with the latter two returning to profit but the former announcing a strategic pullback, shelving its dividend \nand lowering its renewable energy targets.\nFollowing a challenging year, where its share price collapsed after a warning in August about significantly higher \ncosts on US projects, \u00d8rsted said it plans to cut up to 800 jobs and exit offshore wind markets in Norway, Spain, \nand Portugal to become a \"leaner and more efficient company.\"\nAfter an aggressive push into the US faltered on various hurdles, the Danish company said it had \"learned from \nthese challenges and implemented significant changes\", and was now \"seeing good signs\" for the offshore wind \nindustry.\nIts shares, having plunged in late summer to below 250 krone but since bounced back to almost 400kr, fell 2% on \nthe morning of results.  \nThere was a mixed update from Vestas, the wind turbine maker, which returned to profit in the fourth quarter but \nwithheld its payout for 2023 as it said the profit was so small it \"would result in a mere token dividend\".\nThis Denmark-based company's operating profit before special items of (EURO)231 million, recovering from a \n(EURO)1.2 billion loss the previous year.\nPage 2 of 2\nWind energy firms \u00d8rsted, Vestas and Siemens spy green shoots but uncertainties remain\nHowever, CEO Henrik Andersen said dark clouds were not fully clearing for the industry, saying: \"Continued \ngeopolitical volatility as well as slow permitting and insufficient grid build-out across markets are expected to cause \nuncertainty in 2024.\"\nIts shares, which fell to a three-year low last September but have recovered more strongly than Orsted, rose 6%.\nGermany's Siemens Energy also reported a swing back into the black in its first fiscal quarter, largely attributed to a \none-off gain from selling a stake in its Indian affiliate.\nThe company's net profit was (EURO)1.58 billion, compared to a loss of (EURO)282 million last time, with a notable \nincrease in orders and a record-high order backlog.\nManagement again cited ongoing challenges, particularly with its Siemens Gamesa subsidiary, which experienced \na high cash outflow due to a loss and a build-up of operating net working capital in a seasonally weak quarter, it \nsaid.\nSiemens Energy shares, which hit an all-time low below (EURO)7 in October, continued their recent rally by rising \n1.6% to (EURO)14.47.\nLoad-Date: February 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Orsted.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
