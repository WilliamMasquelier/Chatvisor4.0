Her comments come amid growing concerns around regulatory \nbottlenecks and environment planning delays that can stymie and delay energy project time lines.\n\"The renewable energy agreements that minister (Chris) Bowen was speaking about between himself and the state \nenergy ministers, let's broaden them so that we deliver successful projects across the length and breadth of our \neconomy,\" Ms Wake said. \"Energy is the economy. Energy is the future. And we've got a great opportunity, but we \nmustn't \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 squander our traditional strengths.\" She said an agreement covering business, government and \nconsumers was required to traverse the complex energy transition, which wouldn't happen without trade-offs, costs \nand difficult choices.\n\"We just need to have that clear-eyed, transparent dialogue.\" Ms Wake also noted the energy policy debate would \nneed to broach subjects including incentives, subsidies and production credits.\nShell is one of the dominant players in Australia's -energy sector, operating the QCLNG export plant in \nQueensland, the Prelude floating LNG project off northern Australia and also has stakes in Western Australia's \nNorth West Shelf and Gorgon LNG ventures and gas business Arrow.\nMs Wake called for a pragmatic approach and a \"shared vision\" among stakeholders for the nation to best navigate \nand capitalise on the energy transition happening across markets globally.\n\"We need to stop demonising gas, we need to look more broadly than simply the \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 renewable penetration in the \nelectricity mix, we need to look to biofuels. We need to at least have a conversation around nuclear,\" she said, \nnoting Shell did not operate in the nuclear space as it wasn't a competitive strength.\nPage 2 of 2\nNation needs to 'streamline' its energy rules\nWednesday's forum was held amid rising speculation of an early election and a flare-up in the energy and climate \nwars. Large Australian and offshore-based companies are also positioning to benefit from burgeoning industries \nand policies that emerge as a result of the changes.\nGrainCorp chief executive Robert Spurway told the forum it was up to government to get policy settings right, for \nindustries such as biofuels, that would allow Australia to leverage its \"natural advantage\".\n\"If you take the canola seed we produce here, it has a carbon intensity benefit about 41 per cent better than the \nglobal average,\" he said. \"There'll be efficiencies of scale at the right policy settings, but also some real natural \nadvantage benefits that Australia can bring to this future industry.\" GrainCorp last week backed the federal \ngovernment's launch of a consultation process assessing the incentives needed to develop an Australian renewable \nfuels industry.\nMr Spurway last week outlined that the nation's growers produce a surplus average up to 5 million tonnes of the \noilseed exported annually over the last three years, with more than 60 per cent of that refined into biofuels.\nGrainCorp is forging ahead with plans to expand its oilseed crush capacity and has aligned with IFM Investors, who \nare focused on establishing a domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sector as a significant manager of \ninvestments in Australian and global airports.\nAmpol CEO Matt Halliday agreed with Mr Spurway on getting policy settings right for the biofuel sector.\n\"It's fair to say that what we're talking about from an advanced biofuels and a renewable fuels perspective, will not \nhappen without the appropriate policy,\" he said. \"Most of this feedstock today, from an agricultural point of view is \nexported, and that is largely because there is government policy support elsewhere.\" Mr Halliday noted production \nincentives were one measure that could level the playing field, as he also reiterated his view that government \npolicies needed to encourage demand and stamp out additional cost to consumers.\nLoad-Date: June 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n            ",
