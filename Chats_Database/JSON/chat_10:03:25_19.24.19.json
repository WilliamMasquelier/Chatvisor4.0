Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest | Founder of Fortescue | \"Fortescue has pushed back against allegations it had 'unclean hands' after spying on former staff.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Chief Executive of Element Zero | \"The allegations are spurious.\" | N.A. |\n| Chris McMeniman | Barrister for Element Zero | \"The level of surveillance conducted on the respondents was highly invasive and not necessary.\" | N.A. |\n| David Studdy SC | Barrister representing Element Zero and its directors | \"The only collateral purpose ... is the extraordinary conduct of Fortescue which is now understandably causing it some concern and wanting to shut all of this down.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke SC | Barrister for Fortescue | \"I mean my goodness, the submissions by the respondents in relation to this are just so far-fetched. It really defies logic.\" | N.A. |\n| Dr Bartlomiej Kolodziejczyk | Director of Element Zero | \"We\u2019re not trying to have our cake and eat it.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
