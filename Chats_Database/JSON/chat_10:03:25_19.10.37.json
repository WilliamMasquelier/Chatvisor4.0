Fortescue said on the day that Ms Hick had \"made a joint decision with the Fortescue \nboard\" to depart and that her resignation had been both \"friendly and -mutual\".\nDays later Andrew Forrest said she chose to step aside following differences of opinion over the company's green \ntransition.\n\"What we have now is a literally galloping herd of people who want to see this company go green. So if you want to \nstep outside that, you're given a choice. You're not fired, there's no disagreement, you're just given choice: step \nback in, or you call it,\" Dr Forrest said in August 2023.\n\"All I'm saying is that Fiona was given the choice and she made her own decision \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We're not going to let a single \nperson's disagreement with the direction of this company affect it.\n\"You either get on the bus or get off the bus, but you make the choice. No one was pushed.\" The Fortescue \nfounder then told The Australian that an extraordinary wave of management departures had been sparked after he \nreturned from an overseas trip to find the -company's strategy had been -hijacked by several of its -executive team.\nThe billionaire chairman of the $67bn mining giant said executives who had left the iron ore major had struggled to \ncope with the -\"boiler room\" conditions of the company and were not following his green vision.\nHe said he was not to blame for the rapid hiring and firing of staff at the company.\nPage 2 of 2\nHick joins Evolution after fleeing Fortescue\nMs Hick last worked in iron ore with Rio Tinto, as a rail superintendent in 2001. She was appointed Woodside's \noperations vice president in 2019, and also served as its strategy and planning boss, and before that as its crisis \nmanagement leader.\nHer role at Fortescue included keeping costs down at the iron ore operations in an increasingly inflationary \nenvironment and, overseeing the commissioning of the company's troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project, as well \nas the company's ambitious $US6.2bn ($9.2bn) plan to decarbonise its iron ore operations by the end of the \ndecade.\nMs Hick was part of the executive leadership team at Woodside since 2019, with her most recent role overseeing \nthe operational performance of the company's Australian assets - including both Woodside's original North West \nShelf operations and the Bass Strait production hubs inherited from its merger with BHP's oil and gas division.\nHer career at the oil and gas producer included a stint overseeing its health, safety, environment and quality \nperformance.
