Focus on how the article portrays Shell in terms of its actions, reputation, performance, and impact. The tone should be categorized as one of the following:\n\nPositive: The article reflects well on Shell, highlighting favorable aspects.\nNeutral: The article presents information about Shell in a balanced, objective manner without any strong positive or negative bias.\nNegative: The article is critical of Shell, highlighting challenges, controversies, failures, or unfavorable developments.\n\nProvide the final tone assessment as \"Positive,\" \"Neutral,\" or \"Negative.\"\n\nHere is the article content: Page 1 of 2\nShell warns of $3bn impairment\nShell warns of $3bn impairment\nThe Australian\nJuly 8, 2024 Monday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 19\nLength: 439 words\nByline: Christian Moess Laursen\nBody\nShell expects to book up to $US2bn ($3bn) in post-tax impairments after delaying construction of a major biofuels \nplant as European energy majors grapple with weak market conditions, while trading in its core gas division is set to \nfall on quarter.\nThe British energy giant on Friday said it expected to book an impairment after tax of between $US1.5bn and \n$US2bn mainly due to pausing construction of its biofuels facility in Rotterdam as well as the divestment of its \nchemicals refinery in Singapore.\nThe paused construction of the Dutch biofuels plant - one of Europe's largest, set to produce 820,000 tonnes of \nbiofuels a year - was largely due to weak European market conditions, with profit margins squeezed by a large drop \nin US renewable fuel-credits prices.\nShares in biofuels market leader Neste have shed nearly half their value this year, with the Finnish company in May \ncutting its renewable-fuel margin forecast. Shell's rival BP similarly paused biofuels investment at US and German \noil refineries recently.\nShell expects to write down between $US600m and $US1bn on the asset, while the impairment after the sale of its \nSingapore refinery is expected to be $US600m-$US800m.\nIn addition, Europe's largest energy company expects trading results from its integrated-gas segment, usually its \nlargest profit centre, to be lower than in the first quarter, when the unit booked $US3.68bn in adjusted earnings, due \nto seasonality.\nHowever, it expects the unit's results to match those of the second quarter last year, when it booked $US2.5bn in \nadjusted earnings - a metric that strips certain commodity price adjustments and one-time charges.\nThe company also narrowed the segment's liquids and natural-gas production outlook slightly upward to 940,000- \n980,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day for the quarter, from a previously guided range of 920,000- 980,000 BOE a \nday.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell warns of $3bn impairment\nShell, the world's largest liquefied natural gas trader, expects its quarterly LNG volumes to be between 6.8 million \nand 7.2 million tonnes, compared with the prior-year's 7.2 million tonnes.\nThis would mean a decline from the first quarter's 7.6 million tonnes. However, gas prices in Europe have rallied in \nrecent months on strong demand in Asia amid heatwaves and outages limiting supply, potentially providing a boon \nto Shell's quarterly results.\nOn the upstream side - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - Shell is expecting the unit to produce between \n1.72 million and 1.82 million BOE a day ready for sale, versus 1.70 million a year prior and 1.87 million in the first \nquarter. In the first quarter, the segment garnered $US1.93bn in adjusted earnings.\nLoad-Date: July 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should solely be one of these three words based on your assessment: \"Positive\", \"Neutral\", or \"Negative\". Nothing else\n                ",
