When you go from a fossil fuel-burning company to a green energy company, you're \ngoing to lose people who say, 'what are you doing? You've got this fantastic economic model. You have the most \nsuccessful company shareholder returns in decades in our company. Why are you fiddling around with it?' \" Mr \nGunner quit the company earlier this month, after only 15 months with Fortescue's Energy arm. On social media, \nhe blamed the amount of travel away from his base in Darwin following a promotion last year.\nA revolving door of executives have jumped ship from the company in the past 12 months as pressure grows on \nFortescue to execute a high-stakes pivot to green energy from its iron ore foundations that made its founder one of \nAustralia's richest men.\nIn August last year, Fortescue's chief executive, Fiona Hick, and chief financial officer Christine Morris both quit, \nwhile Dr Debelle resigned as a director of Fortescue Future Industries.\nDr Forrest last year said executives who had left the iron ore major had struggled to cope with the -\"boiler room\" \nconditions of the company and were not following his green vision.\nHowever, Dr Forrest said on Monday that a degree of turnover was expected as the company transitioned from a \npure iron ore producer to a green energy company with lofty global renewable hydrogen ambitions.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest blames green move for executive exodus\n\"The reason is we want to continue that track record. We're not happy just sitting on our laurels with what we've \nachieved already. Lots of people think that's not for them, and I think that's completely fine,\" Dr Forrest said.\n\"But when you look at, say, Fortescue to, say, the mining industry per se, we're running at about half the turnover \nof the mining industry at Fortescue.\" Dr Forrest said Fortescue's board of directors were long term, but senior \nmanagement was \"changing \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 all the time\". He said: \"Change is necessary if you're going to improve. You cannot \nimprove without change.\n\"I think we're settling it down now. I think that Dino (Otranto), Shelley (Robertson) and (Mark) Hutch (Hutchinson) \nare a really great team. They're working super well together.\n\"They're driving our green energy transformation as well as keeping up record production and profits. I'm really \ncomfortable with them.\" The president of Fortescue Energy's European arm, Carlos Lange, quit the company this \nmonth after only 10 months.\nIts long-term company secretary, Cameron Wilson, is also set to take a step back from Fortescue, initially shifting \nto a part-time role as he hands over duties at the company. Mr Wilson's decision comes only a few months after the \ndeparture of co-company secretary and Fortescue general counsel Gemma Tually, who stepped down from the \nrole in November last year.\nThis year Fortescue Energy also lost the services of chief -financial officer Deborah Caudle, less than five months \nafter she was appointed to the role, with former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also formally severing ties with the \ncompany, and external affairs boss Fiona Sugden leaving to join the office of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. \nFortescue has promised to end its use of fossil fuels by the end of the decade and become a \"real zero\" emitter of \ncarbon.\nLoad-Date: February 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"I don't believe we have a conga line, as you dramatically point out.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"The reason is we want to continue that track record.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"Change is necessary if you're going to improve.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"I think we're settling it down now.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
