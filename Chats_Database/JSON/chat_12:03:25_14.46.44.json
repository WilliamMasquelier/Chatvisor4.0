It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 3\nTales swirl in Port Stephens turtles' big wake\nTales swirl in Port Stephens turtles' big wake\nNewcastle Herald (Australia)\nJanuary 20, 2024 Saturday\nPrint Edition\nCopyright 2024 Australian Community Media All Rights Reserved\nSection: WEEKENDER; Pg. 8\nLength: 1169 words\nByline: Mike Scanlon\nBody\nDOES one last wildlife mystery remain unsolved at Port Stephens?\nIs it possible that twin Galapagos turtles of great age once lived and thrived in the majestic waterway, or is it merely \na myth?\nCertainly, there's plenty of space in this area, which was once considered remote and said to be twice the size of \nSydney Harbour, to accommodate potentially giant turtles growing over more than 100 years, if left undisturbed.\nBut to have very big and old turtles surviving until today seems highly unlikely given the growing popularity of the \nPort Stephens waterway, and the high risk of collision with motorboats and modern jet skiers.\nWhy, only about a fortnight ago there was a public plea by wildlife rescuers for jet skiers and boaties to be more \ncareful after three sea turtles, one quite mangled, were found dead in only three weeks.\nThat was in Lake Macquarie, but only days earlier, people were incensed watching an irresponsible jet skier chase \na flock of black swans and even run some down, apparently for sport, off Bagnalls Beach, in Port Stephens.\nBecause jet skis are quick and quiet underwater, the fear is when turtles have to come up to breathe they are totally \nunaware of the danger posed by one of these crafts going flat out.\nMarine turtles in NSW are now regarded as a threatened species, with some even tracked (by satellite) retreating \ndeep inside busy Sydney harbour.\nMeanwhile, there are several species of sea turtle living in Port Stephens, including the endangered loggerhead \nturtle. Juvenile green turtles, however, seem to be the most abundant. Three injured, but rescued, turtles were even \nreleased at Zenith Beach in a blaze of publicity in 2022.\nThen, only a few weeks ago, I met a recreational diver, Nigel, on Corlette Beach. He said desperate and distressed \nturtles had approached divers to get them to prise barnacles off their shells.\nPage 2 of 3\nTales swirl in Port Stephens turtles' big wake\nThat meeting reminded me of another local report from ages ago. In years past, there were rumours of a single, \nlarge ancient sea turtle being spotted surfacing around Tanilba Point, west of Nelson Bay.\nThe creature was said to be linked with two young turtles released into Tanilba Bay by Tilligerry Peninsula pioneer \nRoyal Navy Lieutenant William Caswell (1789-1859).\nThat was possibly in the early 1850s.\n\"Castle-builder\" Caswell was the original owner of the iconic, state-heritage listed Tanilba House, probably the \noldest colonial home in Port Stephens.\nAfter a 23-year career in the British navy, he became a settler on 50 acres at Tanilba, with commanding views \nacross Port Stephens, after obtaining his land grant in March 1831.\nThen, from the 1950s, the elegant, convict-built homestead was in the hands of the Oberland family, of Alcron \nrestaurant fame. Daughter, the late Helen Taylor, lived there for decades. She opened the historic stone house to \ntourists and displayed prominently on its verandah until her death in 2015 was an odd, rather ugly object that I once \nasked about.\nAbout the size of a large dinner plate and bony with serrated edges, it seemed to be what Mrs Taylor (who was \nactually a baroness) said it was; part of the skeleton (minus shell) of a big turtle someone had brought her.\nBeing fascinated with Australian history, she finally wrote down what she'd learned in a booklet with Norah Paddle \nin 1992.\nThis is what she said: \"Lately it has been claimed that a relic of William Caswell's day is living hale and hearty in the \nbay - a giant turtle from the Galapagos Islands (in the Pacific).\n\"Apparently a group of William's old friends, sailors and botanists, had visited Tanilba on their way home to England \nafter a cruise around the South Seas,\" Mrs Taylor wrote.\n\"It is rumoured they presented William with a couple of young turtles as a gift.\n\"William is said to have turned them into the bay.\n\"Recently what appears to be a huge turtle shell has been discovered onshore.\n\"Claims have also been made that large animals have been sighted swimming casually around.\"\nHelen Taylor then reported a legacy of that South Seas expedition was that among the fjords of New Zealand's \nsouth island today there's a Caswell Sound, and above it towers a Mount Tanilba. It's one very memorable way of \nremembering an old shipmate.\nGalapagos turtles are known for their longevity and size. They can live from 100 to 150 years in the wild, and are \nknown to live up to 175 years, or maybe longer, in captivity. They can weigh 417 kilograms and measure more than \n1.3 metres (4.2ft).\nThe chances are, however, that what Caswell may have received were just two sea turtles of another large Pacific \nOcean species.\nBut could anything really locally survive in Port Stephens for possibly 140 years at least (1850-1992)?\nFormer president of the Port Stephens Family History Society Denise Gaudion remembers seeing a big old turtle \nregularly about 20 years ago off Mallabula.\n\"It died of old age, I expect. If so, I suppose it could have been one of Caswell's,\" she said.Page 3 of 3\nTales swirl in Port Stephens turtles' big wake\n\"I also know from fishermen that some port turtles get tangled up in nets up here.\"\nLater, Tea Gardens historian Janis Winn said she couldn't add anything useful, but referred Weekender to long-time \nPindimar resident Maree Dowsett.\n\"She's always talking about saving the turtles off the port's middle island (possibly Boandabah off Soldiers Point) \nand even tried to get the council to help, without any success,\" Mrs Winn said.\nMrs Dowsett said it was also not unusual for big, dead sea turtles to wash up on Pindimar shores, like in 2013 and \nagain in 2018.\n\"That last one had no marks on it, but probably had a metre-long shell,\" she said.\n\"We even buried one turtle out the front of our place. It had no legs (flippers).\n\"The family used to go fishing and as we sat in the boat all these young turtles, each about the size of a 20 cent \npiece, would come up around us from the deep looking for food.\n\"There were hundreds of them, but this was many years ago now. I was told they must have swum down from \nQueensland, but that's a long way for small turtles to swim, especially as we think turtles lay eggs at Pindimar,\" Mrs \nDowsett said. \"Kids see them.\"\nAnd let's end now with the strangest tale of them all. In January 1951, two professional fishermen off Bermagui, on \nNSW's far south coast, shot and killed a huge turtle carrying a shell \"big enough to be used as a canoe\".\nThey said it had become entangled in the ropes of their fishing traps. On shore, a swordfish hoist was used to lift it \nfrom the rowing boat involved.\nPacked in ice, the turtle was quickly examined by the then chairman of Taronga Park Trust, E.J. Hallstrom, but it \nwas declared too big to be preserved.\nThis was despite the belief that the size of turtle (species unidentified) might be a world record. Initial news reports \nsaid the turtle body could weigh more than a tonne.\nThe size of the turtle was measured at an incredible 7ft 8 inches (2.3m). At the time, encyclopaedias showed the \nprevious largest turtle, kept in a Sydney museum, measured 6ft 7inches (2.04m).\nFishermen believed the huge turtle was well over 800 years old.\nLoad-Date: January 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
