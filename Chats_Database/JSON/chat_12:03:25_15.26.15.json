Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Sir Andrew Mackenzie | Shell chairman | \"The one thing that has struck me, since moving from BHP to Shell, is it is quite a lot harder than I expected.\" | N.A. |\n| Sir Andrew Mackenzie | Shell chairman | \"At BHP, to some extent, we were not quite in the thick of it in the way that we are at Shell.\" | N.A. |\n| Sir Andrew Mackenzie | Shell chairman | \"Because of the urgency, we have to make our choices and decide where we're really going to put our emphasis.\" | N.A. |\n| Sir Andrew Mackenzie | Shell chairman | \"Shell's business was built on selling oil and petrol for traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.\" | N.A. |\n| Sir Andrew Mackenzie | Shell chairman | \"Liquefied natural gas would be 'critical' to the energy transition.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Shell.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Shell or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
