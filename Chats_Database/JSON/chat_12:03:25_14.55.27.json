It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nOneVentures backs maker of app used by BHP, Shell\nOneVentures backs maker of app used by BHP, Shell\nAustralian Financial Review\nFebruary 17, 2025 Monday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2025 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 23\nLength: 548 words\nByline: Paul Smith\nBody\nA 10-year-old Sydney tech firm that counts some of the country's biggest mining, energy and construction \ncompanies as clients has been valued at $57.2 million after taking on its first major investor.\nMyPass is used by BHP, Woodside, Chevron, Inpex and Shell to verify that all the workers on their sites are \nsuitably qualified and have the right credentials for their assigned tasks.\nAustralian venture capital firm OneVentures has poured in $7.5 million, as the company looks to use the global \npresence of many of its customers to win more business internationally. It already makes 25 per cent of its revenue \nin Chile, where it has about 300 customers after BHP introduced it to that market.\nIts New Zealand-born founder, Matt Smith, became a tech entrepreneur after working senior construction \nengineering roles in his 20s, and becoming an executive at labour hire group Skilled Engineering. He originally tried \nto build an online marketplace to link contractors with big projects, called Project Match, but realised there was a \nstronger business model in software subscriptions with MyPass.\nWorkers use the digital skills passport to display verified training, licences and certifications, and their employers \nuse the system to make sure they do not allow people with bogus credentials on-site. The idea came about when \nSmith was responsible for managing the safety and performance of skilled contract workers across Western \nAustralia and the Northern Territory, and seeing how haphazard and inefficient the systems were.\n\"I had tradespeople flying all around the country to mines for the likes of BHP and Newcrest, and saw a pretty \nmessy problem of a transient workforce, which is about 90-95 per cent casual workers, moving between companies \nin a nomadic way, without any system to manage it other than Excel spreadsheets,\" Smith said.\n\"There was a process of over 100 steps to get a worker on to a site and 40 per cent of that was updating \nspreadsheets sitting across five or six different systems.\"\nSmith said it took lots of effort and time to turn relationships into customer deals, but now that MyPass was \nembedded, it had relatively reliable revenue and a strong growth trajectory if it delivered properly.\nPage 2 of 2\nOneVentures backs maker of app used by BHP, Shell\n\"It took three years to land BHP, and from them saying 'yes' to us having a signed contract was probably about nine \nmonths. But once you're in as mission-critical software, you're in, and a network effect actually kicks in,\" he said.\n\"We got Woodside in the oil and gas sector, and then we got Inpex, and once they were on, Chevron was also \ninterested, and then Shell has just jumped on last year because they use the same contractors that are moving \naround.\"\nThere are 1300 companies and more than 110,000 contractors using MyPass globally. It added 350 new \norganisations in 2024 and is targeting North and South America as growth markets.\nOneVentures partner Bevin Shields said it was the customer feedback from some of the world's biggest companies \nthat convinced the venture capital firm to write a cheque.\nOneVentures thinks MyPass has large potential.\n\"We've been working closely with Matt and the team on their go-to-market strategy. MyPass has a huge \nopportunity, and that's where we really lean in and support by bringing our team of ex-founders and operators,\" \nShields said.\nLoad-Date: February 19, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
