The debris was mostly non-toxic fiberglass \nfragments ranging in size from small pieces to larger sections, typically green or white.\nVineyard Wind, a joint venture between Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, bolstered its beach \npatrols to 35 people looking for and removing debris.\n\"We're making progress in the debris recovery efforts and mobilizing even more resources on the island to hasten \nthe cleanup as quickly as possible,\" the company's CEO Klaus Moeller said in a statement. \"The public can have \nconfidence that we will be here as long as it takes to get the job done.\"\nAlso on Wednesday, a groundbreaking ceremony was held to start construction of New York's largest offshore wind \nproject, Sunrise Wind, a 924-megawatt project by the Danish wind developer Orsted. Once completed, the project \nwill provide enough clean energy to power approximately 600,000 New York homes.\nIt will be located approximately 30 miles (50 kilometers) east of Montauk, New York.\nPage 2 of 2\nBlade collapse, New York launch and New Jersey research show uneven progress of offshore wind\n\"We look forward to building New York's largest offshore wind project, helping the state meet its clean energy \ntargets while strengthening the local offshore wind workforce and supply chain,\" said David Hardy, executive vice \npresident and CEO Americas for Orsted.\nOrsted was far along in the approval process to build two offshore wind farms in New Jersey when it scrapped both \nprojects last October, saying they were no longer financially feasible.\nAnd New Jersey officials on Wednesday said they would make nearly $5 million available for scientific research \nprojects to document current environmental conditions in areas where wind farms are planned, as well as to predict \nand prevent potential harm to the environment or wildlife.\nShawn LaTourette, New Jersey's environmental protection commissioner, said his state \"is committed to advancing \nscience that will ensure that offshore wind, a necessary component of our work to address the impact of climate \nchange, is developed responsibly and in a manner that minimizes impacts to our precious coastal environment.\"\nThe state is seeking proposals for surveying wildlife and habitats before wind farm construction starts; making \ntechnical innovations in data collection and analysis; studying fishery sustainability and socio-economic impacts of \noffshore wind; identifying and reducing the impact of offshore wind noise on marine life, and studies of bird and bat \nabundance, among other things.\nConcerns about potential damage to the environment, marine life and birds have been among the reasons cited by \nopponents of offshore wind for trying to halt the nascent industry in the U.S. On Wednesday, one of the most vocal \ngroups, Protect Our Coast-NJ used the Nantucket accident to renew its call to end the offshore wind industry, \ncalling the incident \"simply unacceptable.\"\n___\nFollow Wayne Parry on X at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC \nLoad-Date: July 18, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOnly output one of these values: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and nothing else.\n                ",
