Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 22\nLength: 454 words\nByline: Joanne Tran\nBody\nThe Australian sharemarket finished higher yesterday when a late rally in financial stocks helped reverse the trading \nsession's earlier losses.\nThe benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index swung between gains and losses to finish up 0.1 per cent, or 9.3 points, to \n7733.5 after six out of the 11 sectors finished in the green. The All Ordinaries were flat, while the Australian dollar \nheld just below US65\u00a2.\nFinancial markets largely shrugged off the December-quarter GDP report that showed Australia's economy had \nbarely expanded in the final three months of the year as consumers refrained from spending amid higher borrowing \ncosts.\nReal gross domestic product increased by 0.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, just under forecasts of 0.3 per cent. \nAnnual growth was a touch firmer than expected at 1.5 per cent, against forecasts of 1.4 per cent, but in line with \nthe Reserve Bank of Australia's projections.\n\"For the RBA, we expect today's figures will be seen as suggesting that the economy continues to move slowly in \nthe right direction for achieving its inflation target,\" said HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham.\nThe bond market is now fully priced for the first RBA rate cut in September. It is nearly fully positioned for a follow-\nup move by Christmas.\nThe financial sector was the best performing on the ASX 200 as all the major banks recorded gains. Index \nheavyweight Commonwealth Bank climbed 1.2 per cent to $118.31, National Australia Bank rose 1 per cent to \n$34.10, and Westpac gained 1.1 per cent to $26.94.\nANZ finished up 1 per cent to $29.02. In separate news, the bank agreed to sell a 16.5 per cent of a stake in AMMB \nHoldings via a block trade at a price of 3.85 Malaysian ringgit ($1.25) apiece. The sale reduces ANZ's shareholding \nin the banking group from 21.7 per cent to 5.2 per cent.\nPage 2 of 2\nBig four send ASX higher; Cettire tumbles Equities\nThe tech sector, meanwhile, was the worst performing, finishing down 1.4 per cent. WiseTech dropped 2.6 per cent \nto $93.16 and Xero lost 0.9 per cent to $133.30. That's after the Nasdaq Composite overnight dropped 1.7 per cent \nas investors took profits in the mega cap tech stocks.\nIn commodities, gold rose as much as 1.3 per cent to $US2141.79 an ounce, before losing its gains. Gold \nproducers were paced by Ramelius Resources, which climbed 1 per cent to $1.59. Perseus rose by 1.8 per cent \nto $1.955.\nMagellan Financial Group rallied by 7.9 per cent to $9.21 after total funds management increased to $37.2 billion \nlast month, up from the $36.3 billion booked in January.\nOnline luxury retailer Cettire tumbled 14.4 per cent to $3.99. The shares plunged more than 20 per cent at the start \nof trade after an investigation by The Australian Financial Review that examined the company's handling of duties \npayable to the federal government.\nLoad-Date: March 9, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**ENTITY**: [Organization Name]\n**TYPE**: [Type of organization - e.g., Company, Government Agency, NGO, etc.]\n**DESCRIPTION**: [Brief description of how the entity is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**ENTITY**: Tesla, Inc.\n**TYPE**: Company\n**DESCRIPTION**: Main subject of article, discussing Q4 earnings report\n\nOnly include entities that are meaningful to the article's content.
