Element Zero had claimed the surveillance was excessive, but Federal Court judge Brigitte \nMarkovic accepted it was necessary in response to an application to have the search orders thrown out. Justice \nMarkovic ultimately decided Fortescue was legally -entitled to carry out the search -orders and seize millions of \ndocuments ahead of more court -action, but she acknowledged Andrew Forrest's company made a \"material non-\ndisclosure\" when it failed to alert the court about a commercial relationship between it and Mr Masterman.\n\"I am not satisfied that the EZ respondents have established that Fortescue had a weak prima facie case,\" she \nsaid.\n\"The question is whether evidence of Fortescue's relationship with Element Zero, through Mr Masterman, and the \ndiscussions it had about the different concerns it held in December to January 2024 was capable of having affected \nthe court's decision, in particular in relation to the consideration of the risk of -destruction. In my view, on balance, it \nwas.\" On Wednesday, during a brief case management hearing, legal counsel for Element Zero told Justice \nMarkovic they had filed a \"narrow\" application for leave to appeal part of her decision.\n\"On Friday there was an application filed on a narrow point around \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 material non-disclosure,\" the court heard.\n\"It's an application that's made without seeking order to stay anything taking place in proceeding before you.\n\"The application is directed solely to the question of leave.\" The application will not disrupt the ongoing court matter, \nand it will be heard by a single judge in due course, the court heard.\nPage 2 of 2\nElement Zero up for a fight in spy case\nIt means Element Zero is still trying to have the search orders thrown out and discharged, and is seeking orders \nfrom the court that it may not have to pay costs if it succeeds.\nA spokesman for Fortescue told The Australian it would vigorously defend Element Zero's -attempt to have the \ndecision of the court overturned.\n\"Two Federal Court judges have found a strong prima facie case that the Element Zero parties misused \nFortescue's confidential information and breached its rights,\" he said. \"Fortescue remains committed to protecting \nits intellectual property and investment in green technologies, and looks forward to progressing the matter to a final \ntrial.\" Element Zero had asked the court to set aside the search -orders because it claimed surveillance conducted \nin the lead up to obtaining them was excessive.\nIt emerged that Fortescue employed former SAS soldier Robert Lancaster to spy on Element Zero staff and their \nfamilies for up to 17 hours a day. The surveillance included following family members to Kmart, rummaging through \nmail and taking pictures of their children leaving school.\nJustice Markovic declined to set aside the search orders based on those claims, however.\n\"The private investigator's reports are lengthy and detailed. However, on their face they do not disclose any \ncollateral purpose. Rather, they attempt to provide information necessary for an application for search orders and \nas required by the court's search orders practice note,\" she said. \"One way of obtaining that information is to \ninstruct qualified persons to attend at and observe premises. In this case, Fortescue chose to do so by instructing a \nprivate investigator firm.\"\nLoad-Date: October 23, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's CEO | \"Fortescue remains committed to protecting its intellectual property and investment in green technologies, and looks forward to progressing the matter to a final trial.\" | N.A. |\n| Brigitte Markovic | Federal Court Judge | \"I am not satisfied that the EZ respondents have established that Fortescue had a weak prima facie case.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
