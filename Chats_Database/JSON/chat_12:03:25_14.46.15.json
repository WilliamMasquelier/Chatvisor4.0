It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nStars raise 50k to fly Teo home\nStars raise 50k to fly Teo home\nThe Daily Telegraph (Australia)\nOctober 18, 2024 Friday\nTelegraph Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: SPORT; Pg. 87\nLength: 387 words\nByline: David Riccio Exclusive\nBody\nA power list of NRL stars has raised almost $50,000 to bring the six-week premature baby of Jesse Ramien home \nsafely from a Bali hospital to Australia.\nThe story that has stirred the emotions of the general public, including parents, fans and teammates, has triggered \nmore than 630 donations. Ramien and fiancee Shell have also been helped by the Cronulla Sharks and the NRL.\nIn a major development, the efforts of the Sharks and NRL to work with the Australian Embassy in Indonesia to fast-\ntrack paperwork have been promising. The documentation is crucial for baby Teo to be transported back to \nAustralia.\nRamien and Shell are desperate to coordinate a care flight to fly medically induced Teo back to Australia at an \nestimated cost of $130,000.\nShavaun Hunt, the wife of Sharks forward Royce Hunt, organised a Go Fund Me fundraising campaign, which has \nprompted the rugby league community to respond, far beyond Ramien's Cronulla team.\nAmong the list of NRL players to donate are AJ Brimson, Keaon Koloamatangi, Isaiah Tass, Sitili Tupouniua, Jack \nHetherington, Jacob Saifiti, Taane Milne and Hame Sele.\nSharks players have also donated, including Nicho Hynes, Siosifa Talakai, Briton Nikora, Jack Williams, Braden \nHamlin-Uele, Blayke Brailey, Billy Burns and Hunt.\nFormer NRL stars Luke Lewis, Andrew Fifita and Denan Kemp have also made a financial pledge.\nThe well-paid Sharks star is not personally responsible for creating the Go Fund Me page but some fans have \nquestioned why he would require financial assistance.\nDespite the huge costs to bring their baby home, Ramien made it clear where he stood as a concerned father.\nPage 2 of 2\nStars raise 50k to fly Teo home\n\"I'll play for nothing just to get our baby boy home safely,\" he said. Teo needed to be resuscitated for five minutes \nafter being born six weeks premature at a Bali hospital last Friday night.\nShell was 33 weeks pregnant and before leaving Sydney for Cronulla player Briton Nikora's wedding, the couple \nsecured clearance from Shell's obstetrician, as well as the airline, and travel insurance cover for her pregnancy.\nShell went into early labour last Friday and needed an emergency C-section. She had to be put under anaesthesia \nand doctors needed to revive Teo for five minutes before he started breathing. He was born just after 11pm and \nimmediately rushed to NICU, where he remains under close watch.\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
