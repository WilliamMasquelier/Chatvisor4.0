It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nFortescue claims green iron lead over Rio, BHP\nFortescue claims green iron lead over Rio, BHP\nThe Australian\nDecember 21, 2024 Saturday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 22\nLength: 751 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nFortescue says it will be producing green iron from a pilot plant in Western Australia before its bigger rivals BHP \nand Rio Tinto have even worked out whether to push ahead with their own version in partnership with BlueScope \nSteel and Woodside.\nThe Andrew Forrest-led Fortescue took a swipe at the timetable and energy supply plans put forward by the four \ncompanies after their NeoSmelt project received a $75m leg-up from the WA government.\nThe NeoSmelt partners expect to a make a final investment call in 2026. They have flagged spending several \nhundred million dollars building a pilot plant capable of producing 40,000 tonnes of molten iron year at a site next \ndoor to BHP's mothballed nickel refinery at Kwinana, south of Perth.\nFortescue metals chief executive Dino Otranto said establishing a green iron industry in Australia could create \nthousands of jobs and secure a place for WA iron ore in global supply chains for decades to come.\n\"Getting this new industry off the ground will require wisely invested public and private sector funds,\" Mr Otranto \nsaid.\n\"Australia has a strong history of public investment to create the industries that have kept our economy strong over \nthe decades, such as the significant investment by government to kickstart the oil and gas industry in the 70s,\" Mr \nOtranto said.\n\"The whole of industry is calling for bold policy to establish a new green iron industry.\" Mr Otranto said Fortescue \nwas more advanced in its plans to produce green iron than BHP and Rio and, unlike the Neo-Smelt partners, would \nnot be -relying on gas as a fuel source.\n\"This week's announcement by the WA government to invest $75m in the NeoSmelt project clearly shows that \ngovernment shares our view of the importance of establishing this new green industry,\" he said.\n\"While a final investment decision on the NeoSmelt project is anticipated in 2026, Fortescue will already be \nproducing high-purity green iron from our pilot plant at Christmas Creek, using green hydrogen.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue claims green iron lead over Rio, BHP\n\"This process differs to the NeoSmelt project, which is expected to initially use gas, and ultimately transition to low-\nemissions hydrogen, rather than hydrogen produced using renewable energy.\" The NeoSmelt project is slated to be \nin production some time in 2028 if all goes to plan for Rio, BHP, BlueScope and Woodside at the Kwinana site and \nwith so far unproven technology.\nFortescue is also relying on technology breakthroughs as it contemplates building a commercial scale green iron \nplant in the Pilbara. It has revealed plans for a 1-2 million tonne a year plant, but is exploring opportunities for an \neven bigger plant likely to involve a multibillion-dollar investment.\nIt is set to begin pre-feasibility studies on the commercial-scale plant early next year.\nFortescue is relying on federal and WA government support to launch the technology-dependent industry.\nDr Forrest has said Fortescue wants help in the form of approvals and infrastructure.\nBHP WA iron ore asset president Tim Day said more partners could join the NeoSmelt project over time, and \ndefended the decision to use gas supplied by Woodside as a fuel source on the road to reducing carbon emission \nin steelmaking.\n\"You have to start this with something. For us, a gas supply is required. You need that energy initially and then what \nwill happen over time is we'll get to more green energy,\" he said.\nMr Day said BHP agreed with Rio that technology breakthroughs would be required to advance to commercial scale \nproduction and that the likely time frame was five to 10 years.\nThe NeoSmelt pilot plant is intended to test production of iron from an electric smelting furnace (ESF), a type of \nfurnace being developed by steel producers and technology companies seeking to lower emissions.\nIron ore is first converted to direct reduced iron (DRI) before being charged into the ESF.\nA lot is riding on the technology and a combination of DRI-ESF working effectively for BHP, Rio and Fortescue. \nBlueScope this week said the low and medium grade iron ore produced in the Pilbara did not work well in the DRI \nprocess gaining favour as a way to cut emissions.\nThe NeoSmelt partners hope reductions of up to 80 per cent in emission intensity can be achieved in processing \nPilbara iron ore through a DRI-ESF combination. Other lower emission--intensity production options emerging as \nalternatives to blast furnaces, such as electric arc furnaces, require scrap steel and DRI produced from high grade \niron ore. Fortescue shares closed up 2 per cent on Friday, at $18.20.\nLoad-Date: December 20, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
