But in recent years, the \n42-year-old British actor confesses, she is much less interested in fame. Ahead of her role in US Civil War era \nHorizon: An American Saga - a passion project spanning multiple movies for director, writer and star Kevin Costner \n- Miller reveals a recent \"mic-drop\" career moment, and why she and her partner, actor and model Oli Green, left \nNew York and moved back to London to raise their family\nKevin Costner called to ask you to join him on his epic Western film series Horizon: An American Saga. How did \nthat feel?\nIt was extraordinary. I still haven't asked [him why]. And I don't ask - I just say \"thank you\". I think he had watched \nmy stuff, but it was very out of the blue. I grew up in the '90s, so Kevin Costner to me was God. I had rabbits called \nTwo Socks and Cisco because Dances With Wolves [the 1990 movie Costner directed and starred in, featuring a \nwolf called Two Socks and a horse called Cisco] was my favourite film. It was really like, \"Kevin Costner wants to \ntalk to you? This is a joke\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" He was charming, and he told me about the project and then said, \"Will you go west \nwith me?\" And I was like, \"I'll go to Mars with you.\" Very out of the blue.\nHad you ever met before? No. Never met before. No, only in my dreams. F*ck, that's gonna sound awful in print. It \nwas a joke!\nYour character, Frances Kittredge, is very much a mother first. How did that factor into your thinking about her? \nWell, it's impossible to play a mother with children in a situation that precarious - knowing it's based on history, \nthere's nothing that's been embellished - and not relate it to your own experience. We're so sensitive these days \nabout our own psychology, and \"How do I feel today?\" You make a film like this, and you're like, \"Shut up, get on \nwith it.\" We have it so easy. Life is always complicated, but for the mothers [then] it was astoundingly difficult, and \npainful to watch and painful to shoot, because you can't help but make that personal. So I'd have my daughter \n[Marlowe, 12] with me and hug her very tight at night.\nYou were pregnant with your second child [a baby girl, whose birth was confirmed in January this year] during the \nshoot of the second chapter of Horizon. How was that? I only told Kevin\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It was early enough that I wasn't \nPage 2 of 2\n\"I DON'T HAVE TO BE THE BIGGEST MOVIE STAR IN THE WORLD \"\nshowing. And actually the corset goes [around your waist]. You can have a little bump underneath. And the big skirt \n- you could hide it, it was fine.\nWhat is one moment from the Utah set that you will never forget? Oh, there are so many. Every day something \nhappened, whether it was a dust storm or\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it's hard to not be blown away by the majesty of the landscape. And \nthe beauty of the sets and the costumes and the way that the light changes, and there are just horses and cowboys. \nYou can't believe this set, it was everything I dreamt of when I dreamt of making movies.\nYou recently moved back to London from New York. What made you want to leave the Big Apple? I'd done it by \nthat point. And I feel like the pandemic affected my experience of what New York was. It's so the epicentre of \nculture as a city, but culture now is a very different thing to what it was when I moved there. And it's very TikTok \nand a lot of people filming themselves. London for me, with young children, it's a better quality of life. I can let my \ndogs off the leash without being yelled at. Little things that as you get older start to get really irritating. I don't want \nto be told what to do all the time. So I'm happy to be back in London.\nHave things changed in the film business since you had your first child? Listen, in my experience, I was always \nallowed to have my daughter with me at work. And I like to be with my family. And my own experience of \nmotherhood 12 years later is completely different. I'm a very different person. People often have lots to say about \nhaving babies in your 40s as women, but I can't advocate for it more. I feel very lucky. But everybody makes it \nwork. I mean, Foxcatcher, I was breastfeeding on that set [in 2014]. It was accepted.\nHow about now? What has it been like being both an actor and a mum to a new baby? I've just finished maternity \nleave. My baby is eight months old. It's great, since this whole focus on the female experience in Hollywood, I can \ntake my baby everywhere and they'll have to stop filming for me. I'm still breastfeeding. I've been pumping and \nsending milk back to the hotel, and you just make it work. I'm equally fulfilled by both things. And I'm lucky that I'm \nin a job where I can have my baby at work.\nYou appeared in the final season of Curb Your Enthusiasm. What was it like working with Larry David? I mean, I \ncan die a happy woman now. It's a mic-drop moment. I've ticked every box. That was a dream come true to be on \nthat show. It's amazing. And the best thing about Larry David is that he just cracks up laughing the entire time. I \nmean, we didn't get through one take\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It's all improvised, which was terrifying.\nYou've been an actor for more than two decades now. How do you reflect on your career? I don't think I've ever felt \nmore personally fulfilled. And that's wonderful, because I can just enjoy the work without any neuroses. I do want to \nstrategise about getting to a place where I have enough bankability to work with Yorgos Lanthimos and Martin \nScorsese. I want to be in those films with these auteur directors, to name a couple on the extensive list that I have. I \ndon't have to be the biggest movie star in the world. I love that I get to keep working. I know I will work the rest of \nmy life. I get to do a play, I've got a beautiful new baby. Yeah, very happy.
