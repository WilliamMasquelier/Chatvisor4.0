The company's share price closed down nearly 14 per cent at 98c.\nMoelis Australia's Paul Hissey said the Bellevue update appeared to manifest concerns about the miner's ability to \nramp up head grades and would do little to silence a growing chorus of doubters.\n\"There is also some abstruse disclosure in the result which a sceptic may choose to infer additional \nunderperformance for the quarter,\" he said.\n\"We retain our neutral investment view ...\" Bellevue said it was on track to produce 90,000 ounces from what has \nbeen touted as one of Australia's highest-grade gold mines in the six months to June 30. On an annualised basis, \nthat would equal the top range of original 2024-25 guidance of 180,000 ounces.
