Equinor \nshares fell 3.9%.\nEquinor said it does not plan to increase its stake by more than 10% and will not seek board representation.\nThe world's largest offshore wind developer was hit last year by costs and project delays as inflation pushed up \nprices for turbines and other equipment and services.\n\" The offshore wind industry currently faces a number of challenges, but we remain confident in the long-term \nprospects of the sector and the critical role offshore wind will play in the energy transition,\" he said.\nEquinor's ownership position has been built over time through a combination of market purchases and block trades, \nthe company said.\nPage 2 of 2\nEurope: Equinor acquires 9.8% stake in offshore wind company Orsted\nThe investment makes Equinor the second largest shareholder in Orsted after Denmark.\nIn a bid to restore investor confidence, Orsted in February cut its investment and capacity targets and suspended \ndividend payments as part of a major review.\n\"Structurally, this does not change anything for the direction in which Orsted is moving ,\" said a Sydbank analyst. \nJacob Pedersen .\nHe said the company had broad political support in Denmark and there was no sign that the state would give up its \n51% stake.\nDenmark attracts Goldman Sachs as a strategic shareholder 10 years ago when the company, formerly DONG \nEnergy , was focused on oil and gas. The Wall Street bank doubled its 8 billion crown investment just two years \nlater when Orsted went public in Copenhagen in 2016.
