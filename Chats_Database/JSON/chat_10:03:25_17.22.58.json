Karora \nwill bring new production hubs with mills, and could help the company consolidate its position in the region. A \nRamelius spokesperson declined to comment.\nKarora's portfolio, located 60 kilometres from Kalgoorlie, includes 100 per cent ownership of the Beta Hunt mine, \nHigginsville gold operations and Spargos gold mine. It is expected to produce 170,000 to 195,000 ounces gold in \n2024. By contrast, Ramelius has told shareholders it would hit 272,500 ounces production this financial year.\nZeptner and his team are chasing the acquisition after a period of solid performance and perky gold prices. \nRamelius shares have risen nearly 48 per cent in the past year, giving it a $1.8 billion market capitalisation and a \nstrong balance sheet.\nIn particular, it has benefited from high-grade Penny ore being fed into the Mt Magnet Mill. Cash and gold reserves \nare expected to hit $400 million by year-end, while about $100 million in undrawn debt would further boost its \nliquidity profile.\nRamelius reported a 14 per cent increase in revenue to $348.5 million at its half-year results on February 20. \nEBITDA shot up 39 per cent to $140.2 million, thanks to a 12 per cent jump in realised gold price.\nRamelius' biggest asset is the Mt Magnet production centre, which it started building via a $40 million acquisition in \n2010. Now, 14 years on, Mt Magnet speaks for 62 per cent of the group's gold reserves.\nWhen combined with the Vivien gold deposit and Penny gold mine, it is 53 per cent of the total net present value, \naccording to Macquarie Capital analysts. Production is expected to reduce significantly by the 2029 financial year.\nPage 2 of 2\nRamelius in exclusive talks to buy Canada-listed gold miner; Street Talk\nBut the more pressing matter for Zeptner has been finding a replacement for Edna May, which it bought from \nEvolution Mining in 2017. It is now just 2 per cent of the reserves, with a significant production slump ahead in the \n2025 financial year.\nOther bets like the Rebecca project are still a long way from spitting out cash.\nPut that all together, and it's not surprising management has been on the prowl for acquisitions.\nSources told this column logical targets had included Spartan Resources as well as Northern Star's Carosue Dam \ngold mine. However, the former isn't operational, while the latter may have been hard to prise from its current \nowner.\nThe mooted acquisition at Karora comes after Ramelius acquired ASX-listed gold junior Musgrave Minerals in \nSeptember.\nLoad-Date: March 10, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood, And Emma Rapaport\nDate: March 08, 2024\nTitle: Ramelius in exclusive talks to buy Canada-listed gold miner; Street Talk\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Australian shares rally to reach another all-time high\n## Media outlet: AAP Newsfeed\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: March 08, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nFED:Australian shares rally to reach another all-time high\nFED:Australian shares rally to reach another all-time high\nAAP Newsfeed\nMarch 8, 2024 Friday 5:53 PM AEST\nCopyright 2024 Australian Associated Press Pty.
