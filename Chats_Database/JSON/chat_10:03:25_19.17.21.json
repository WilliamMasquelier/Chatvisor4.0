Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder of Fortescue | \"The time to invest is through the cycle. If you wait for a boom to invest, you're going to be bringing your product on in a bust.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder of Fortescue | \"I wouldn't change anything about the government's commitment.\" | N.A. |\n| Alan Finkel | Former Chief Scientist | \"We need to get the costs down eventually towards the costs of existing iron and steel making.\" | N.A. |\n| Ted O'Brien | Opposition Climate and Energy Spokesman | \"We remain optimistic about the success of hydrogen in the long term playing a role in our future energy mix but we will not follow Labor's mistake of putting all its eggs in one basket.\" | N.A. |\n| Fiona Simon | Chief Executive of Australian Hydrogen Council | \"(It) confirms what we've all been talking about for a while, which is that it's really hard to get hydrogen projects up. But ... it doesn't mean that all projects don't work.\" | N.A. |\n| Rod Sims | Chair of Superpower Institute | \"We've got the renewable energy sources to make green hydrogen. That's why Australia is the best place in the world to make green iron.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
