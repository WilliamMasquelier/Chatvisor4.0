Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1082 words\nHighlight: Court documents reveal a development in the intellectual property case in which Fortescue hired private \ninvestigators.\nBody\nBillionaire Andrew Forrest was \"generally updated\" on a rival's mineral processing technology that converted iron \nore into green iron, and discussions to test that technology on Fortescue's iron ore, according to court documents.\nForrest's Fortescue Metals Group is suing Element Zero, a start-up that developed that mineral processing \ntechnology.\nFortescue has claimed in the Federal Court that the three men behind Element Zero, who are ex-Fortescue \nemployees, have infringed its intellectual property. It is claimed Element Zero was launched using technology that \ntwo of the men, who are scientists, had helped develop at Fortescue.\nThe three men have denied the allegations and stated the technology was developed separately from their former \nwork at Fortescue.\nIn correspondence submitted to the Federal Court, it was revealed that Michael Masterman, a former long-time \nlieutenant to Forrest, was seeking a meeting with Andrew Hamilton, a technical director at Fortescue, and also its \nchief executive, Dino Otranto, in January this year. The meeting was to discuss the technology. Also included in the \ncorrespondence was Phil McKeiver, Fortescue's chief general counsel and then company secretary.\nIn that correspondence, Masterman said: \"I have kept Andrew Forrest generally updated and let him know that I \nwould follow up with you guys.\" Forrest is Fortescue's executive chairman, the founder of the mining group, and its \nlargest shareholder.\nThe intellectual property court case has made headlines after it was revealed that Fortescue had engaged a \nprivate investigations group to spy on and follow Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen, the \nthree men behind Element Zero. The spying also involved following the men's family members, including children, \nand other Element Zero staff for a three-week period.\nThe spying was done by Lancasters Investigations, a company founded by former British SAS soldier turned private \ninvestigator Robert Lancaster, which produced a 600-page report for Fortescue. Lancaster has posted photos of \nhimself holding weapons on Instagram, and photos from his days as a soldier. It was revealed in court that \nFortescue's in-house legal counsel, Adrian Huber, gave direct instructions to the private investigations group.\nPage 2 of 3\nNew evidence in court case as Fortescue takes aim at smaller rival\nReports and emails from Lancasters Investigations were also sent to Seyfarth Shaw Australia, a law firm that was \nalso used by Fortescue's board last year to investigate an anonymous claim that Forrest had a relationship with an \nemployee. The investigation by Seyfarth cleared Forrest of any wrongdoing, and found that none of the matters \nraised in the anonymous letter were substantiated.\nForrest last month said he had no knowledge of the extensive spying conducted on ex-staff and their families, \nincluding children, and was \"surprised to learn of the investigations\".\nThe billionaire, who is the world's 87th wealthiest person according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, said he was \nadvised by Fortescue's legal team that the spying was \"necessary in order to be granted search orders from the \nFederal Court\" in its case. Forrest's wealth is estimated at $US22.3 billion ($33.8 billion) by Bloomberg.\nLink to Image\nTrevor Collens\nFortescue's lawyers required the private investigator's report before a search warrant from the Federal Court could \nbe obtained. After the search orders were granted, raids were conducted on the homes of Kolodziejczyk and \nWinther-Jensen, and Element Zero's offices, in which 3 terabytes of data was obtained, including from \nKolodziejczyk and Winther-Jensen's personal emails, cloud accounts, mobile phones and personal computers.\nMasterman and other Element Zero staff were the subject of surveillance but not the search orders. Masterman's \npersonal mail was rummaged through and photographed by Lancasters Investigations.\nFortescue's McKeiver had last month offered his resignation over the surveillance tactics that were used, but has \nbeen retained by the mining group, albeit without his previous responsibility as company secretary. He stepped \ndown from that role in July.\nIn court earlier this month, it was revealed that Fortescue had conducted an internal investigation into \nKolodziejczyk, claiming he had overstated his professional record. This claim was made in an affidavit by \nFortescue's in-house lawyer Adrian Huber.\nKolodziejczyk is the co-founder of Element Zero, and its chief technology officer. Element Zero was formed at the \nend of 2022.\nKolodziejczyk was once Fortescue Future Industries' chief scientist and led a push to develop green hydrogen to \ndecarbonise the company's mining operations and shipping fleet. Fortescue has since wound down its hydrogen \nambitions. Winther-Jensen was a former FFI scientist before he joined Element Zero. He left Element Zero in \nJanuary this year.\nIn court earlier this month, Fortescue was successful in preventing Element Zero's lawyers' attempt to access \ninstructions given to Lancasters Investigations. Element Zero's lawyers also lost an application to cross-examine \nDavies Collison Cave lawyer Paul Dewar over claims the law firm's initial evidence to the court to obtain the search \norders made material omissions, which might have damaged its application.\nDuring those hearings, Julian Cooke, senior counsel representing Fortescue, said his client's case had nothing to \ndo with the meetings between Fortescue and Element Zero in January this year, when it was said: \"Your process is \ndifferent to our process.\"\n\"That's not part of our case,\" Cook said. \"Our case is they worked on our dime on a confidential process, the ionic \nprocess which they then, without our permission, utilised in the Element Zero process. That's the third part of the \ncase. The second part of the case is then they took documents to develop - to construct and design their pilot \nplant.It has got nothing to do with any alleged similarities between our process and their process which we accept, \nnot dispute ...\"Page 3 of 3\nNew evidence in court case as Fortescue takes aim at smaller rival\nElement Zero said it wanted to reduce the carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry. It \nhas patented a technology that aims to convert metal ores to metals, not only iron ore, with zero carbon emissions. \nFortescue said it would \"vigorously\" defend its intellectual property in the development of cutting-edge solutions to \ndecarbonise its Australian iron ore operations by the end of the decade.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.
