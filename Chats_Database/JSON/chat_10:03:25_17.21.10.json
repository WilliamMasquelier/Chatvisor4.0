It offers exceptional exploration upside, \nwith high-grade drill intercepts and underexplored historical prospects providing a clear path to potential resources. \nIt features multiple high-priority targets requiring immediate follow-up work. \nMarda regional location with greenstone. \nA pivotal step\nLeeuwin executive chair Christopher Piggott said: \"The acquisition of the Marda Gold Project is a pivotal step for \nLeeuwin Metals, delivering significant value with minimal dilution to shareholders. \n\"This advanced gold project in Western Australia provides an exciting growth platform with substantial exploration \npotential. \n\"Marda hosts extensive known mineralisation in and around existing pits. This mineralisation is open and \nrepresents low hanging fruit for our initial exploration campaign. \nPage 2 of 3\nLeeuwin Metals to acquire Marda Gold Project in WA from Ramelius Resources\n\"There are also numerous drilling targets which have been defined by geophysics and limited drilling. There is \nimmense upside at these targets which we will prioritise as part of our resource growth strategy. \n\"The project's strategic location, within trucking distance of multiple gold mills and supported by excellent \ninfrastructure, further enhances its viability. \n\"With granted mining leases included in the acquisition, Leeuwin is well-positioned to rapidly progress discoveries \ninto development. We are excited to commence work programs and look forward to sharing updates as we advance \nthis opportunity into 2025.\"\nExploration ahead\nHistorical exploration at Marda has largely focused on near-mine areas and existing open pits, but Leeuwin says it \nwill prioritise the vast underexplored high-grade potential across the project which remains open and requires \nimmediate follow-up drilling.\nThere are multiple targets within the project area, with the project broken into four main areas: Marda Central, \nMarda North, Marda South and Marda West.\nTargets represent various stages of exploration maturity from resource definition around existing open pits, \nhistorical workings, geochemical anomalies and untested concepts. \nThis will enable Leeuwin to develop multiple work programs for 2025 to advance exploration within the project with \nan initial focus on more advanced target areas.\nMarda Central Mine Trend (Left).

Leeuwin Metals Ltd has entered into a binding agreement with Ramelius Resources to acquire the Marda Gold Project, which spans over 500 square kilometers and is located in a strategic area of Western Australia, indicating Ramelius's divestment of a significant asset in its portfolio.\n\n2. The acquisition includes an upfront payment of $500,000 in shares to Ramelius, along with additional milestone payments contingent on the definition of JORC-compliant resources, suggesting Ramelius is positioning itself for potential future gains from the project\u2019s success.\n\n3. Ramelius Resources will become a strategic shareholder in Leeuwin Metals post-acquisition, which may indicate a shift in Ramelius's strategy towards collaboration and investment in emerging companies within the gold exploration sector.\n\n4. The Marda Gold Project is noted for its high-grade drill intercepts and underexplored historical prospects, which could reflect on Ramelius's previous exploration strategies and the potential for future resource development under Leeuwin's management. \n\n5. The deal highlights Ramelius's focus on optimizing its asset portfolio, as it allows the company to concentrate on other projects while still benefiting from the Marda project's exploration upside through its shareholding in Leeuwin Metals.",
