[The Australian, Anonymous, February 16, 2024] - Cisco Systems is cutting approximately 4,245 jobs, representing about 5% of its workforce, as part of a restructuring plan, which could negatively impact employee morale, disrupt operations, and create uncertainty for remaining staff while also incurring an estimated $800 million in pre-tax charges, primarily cash-based, with most actions expected in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and additional charges extending into fiscal 2025.

Oracle, IBM and Microsoft dominated the database software market in \nChina in 2010. Since then, Chinese companies including Alibaba and Huawei have come up with their own \ndatabase management products to replace American technology.\nChina-based vendors took more than half of that market in China - worth $US6.3bn overall - for the first time in \n2022, and continue to grow, according to researcher Gartner. Tenders examined by the Journal show more state-\nlinked entities and companies have opted for Huawei's databases in recent years.\nChina's banks, brokerage firms and insurers had sped up procurement of homegrown databases, Yang Bing, chief \nexecutive of Chinese database company OceanBase, said at a Beijing conference in November. OceanBase, \ndeveloped by Alibaba and its fintech affiliate Ant Group, replaced Oracle databases at Alibaba and Ant in 2016.\nWestern companies are being replaced not just by Chinese national champions such as Huawei but also more \nspecialised companies.

While that predictive capability has \nbeen developing for some time, the company also plans to launch more capabilities that make use of generative AI \nto simplify their software and make it easier for people without technical training to operate the tools.\nSplunk, launched in 2003, developed a dashboard that allows users to search, monitor and analyse machine-\ngenerated data. It takes training to use it and generative AI helps reduce the learning curve, according to Mr Steele. \n\"Splunk has its own proprietary language, the way in which you issue commands, and you have to be reasonably \ntechnical to do that,\" he said.\n\"With the AI assistance that we've launched, you can use English language to automatically generate that \nproprietary language. You can get outcomes without having all the advanced knowledge.\" Splunk's AI would benefit \nfrom Cisco's massive amounts of data, not to mention its global presence and sales and marketing channels, Mr \nSteele said.\nGenerative AI will have other applications across Cisco's business, such as simplifying the complex task of setting \na configuration screen for a company's security policy, according to Mr Robbins. \"It's very technical. We're going to \nenable our customers to just use English language to describe what security capabilities they would like \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and \nthen we will translate that into a policy that they would review,\" he said.\nPage 2 of 2\nCisco finalises $42bn Splunk buy\nThe software will function as an assistant, simplifying and speeding up the deployment of security policy and other \nresources without replacing human operators, according to Mr Robbins.\nWhen the deal was announced in September 2023, the companies said it expected it to be completed by the end of \nSeptember 2024. The process was completed in roughly half a year. Last week, the European Union gave the deal \nunconditional antitrust approval, after regulators found it wouldn't pose barriers to competition. Networking \nequipment pioneer Cisco, founded in 1984, rode the telecommunications boom of the 1990s. It was for a time the \nmost valuable company in the world.\nLoad-Date: March 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Stephen Rosenbush\nDate: March 20, 2024\nTitle: Cisco finalises $42bn Splunk buy\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Australia: Cisco Technology Owns Trademark for 'MERAKI'\n## Media outlet: Australian Government News\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: March 28, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nAustralia: Cisco Technology Owns Trademark for 'MERAKI'\nAustralia: Cisco Technology Owns Trademark for 'MERAKI'\nAustralian Government News\nMarch 28, 2024 Thursday 2:00 AM  EST\nCopyright 2024 HT Media Limited.

The company had almost 85,000 workers at the end of fiscal 2023, which ran to July of \nthat year.\nCisco joins other tech companies in paring jobs as they cope with uneven demand. Though AI spending has \nhelped fuel growth in some areas, traditional information technology giants have not benefited as much.\nIntel announced plans this month to slash 15,000 jobs as it contends with sluggish sales. Dell Technologies is also \ncutting positions as part of a reorganisation of its sales teams.\nCisco shares fell as much as 1.3 per cent to $US45.24 in New York. They were down 9.3 per cent this year \nheading into Friday's session.\nThe latest job cuts could be announced as early as Wednesday when the company reports fourth-quarter results, \naccording to Reuters.\nThree months ago, an upbeat Cisco forecast sparked hope that IT customers had picked up spending again. But \nthe broader tech industry has been dogged by more recent concerns about the economy - and the idea that AI \nspending might not have a near-term payoff.\nA representative for Cisco declined to comment on layoff plans.\nOver the longer term, chief executive Chuck Robbins has been trying to transform Cisco into a provider of \nnetworking services and software, rather than a company focused on one-time sales of hardware.\nIt also looks to capitalise more on the AI boom that has fuelled sales for companies such as Nvidia.

Could it destroy humanity? And is it really almost here?\nWhat is AI superintelligence? Could it destroy humanity? And is it really \nalmost here?\nThe Conversation - Australia\nOctober 28, 2024 Monday 7:08 PM EST\nCopyright 2024 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1260 words\nByline: Flora Salim, Professor, School of Computer Science and Engineering, inaugural Cisco Chair of Digital \nTransport & AI, UNSW Sydney\nHighlight: AI systems more intelligent than humans in some ways already exist - but general-purpose superhuman \nintelligence is probably still a long way off.\nBody\nIn 2014, the British philosopher Nick Bostrom published a book about the future of artificial intelligence (AI) with the \nominous title Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies. It proved highly influential in promoting the idea that \nadvanced AI systems - \"superintelligences\" more capable than humans - might one day take over the world and \ndestroy humanity.\nA decade later, OpenAI boss Sam Altman says superintelligence may only be \" a few thousand days\" away. A year \nago, Altman's OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever set up a team within the company to focus on \" safe \nsuperintelligence\", but he and his team have now raised a billion dollars to create a startup of their own to pursue \nthis goal.\nWhat exactly are they talking about? Broadly speaking, superintelligence is anything more intelligent than humans. \nBut unpacking what that might mean in practice can get a bit tricky.\nDifferent kinds of AI\nIn my view the most useful way to think about different levels and kinds of intelligence in AI was developed by US \ncomputer scientist Meredith Ringel Morris and her colleagues at Google.\nTheir framework lists six levels of AI performance: no AI, emerging, competent, expert, virtuoso and superhuman. It \nalso makes an important distinction between narrow systems, which can carry out a small range of tasks, and more \ngeneral systems.\nA narrow, no-AI system is something like a calculator. It carries out various mathematical tasks according to a set of \nexplicitly programmed rules.\nPage 2 of 3\nWhat is AI superintelligence? Could it destroy humanity? And is it really almost here?\nThere are already plenty of very successful narrow AI systems. Morris gives the Deep Blue chess program that \nfamously defeated world champion Garry Kasparov way back in 1997 as an example of a virtuoso-level narrow AI \nsystem.",
