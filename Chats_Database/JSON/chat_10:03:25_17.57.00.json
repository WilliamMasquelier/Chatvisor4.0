Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nFED:Trucks, trains and dozers drive Fortescue's 'real zero'\nFED:Trucks, trains and dozers drive Fortescue's 'real zero'\nAAP Newsfeed\nNovember 6, 2024 Wednesday 4:41 PM AEST\nCopyright 2024 Australian Associated Press Pty. Ltd.\nSection: FINANCIAL NEWS\nLength: 591 words\nDateline: CANBERRA Nov 6\nBody\n  Green energy champion Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest is talking up electric trucks and giant batteries after back-\npedalling on renewable hydrogen.\n   Fronting shareholders in Perth on Wednesday, Dr Forrest defended the company's green overhaul he admitted \nhad attracted \"harsh criticism, harsh doubt\" from naysayers and shoulder-shrugging arrogance from equipment \nsuppliers.\n   \"This is surely the moment we put those doubts to rest,\" Dr Forrest said, hailing a recent deal with Liebherr Group \nto develop haul trucks, excavators and dozers using Fortescue technology.\n   The US$2.8 billion agreement included 360 autonomous battery electric haul trucks, 55 electric excavators and \n60 battery electric dozers under development.\n   \"We are no longer just a mining company, we are a massive energy company as well,\" he said.\n   Despite \"bumpy\" iron ore prices, he said Fortescue posted its third-highest annual profit of US$5.7 billion in fiscal \n2024 and distributed A$6 billion in a higher dividend to shareholders that rewarded their \"faith\" in the company.\n   But Fortescue recently cancelled green hydrogen and ammonia plans at the Middle Arm precinct in the Northern \nTerritory and jettisoned plans for work with energy giant AGL on a green hydrogen plan at the Liddell site in NSW.\n   The iron ore giant in September released an externally verified climate transition plan to reach \"real zero\" \nemissions by 2030, but missed an investment decision deadline on a landmark green hydrogen project on Gibson \nIsland in Queensland.\n   Earlier in 2024, Fortescue dumped plans to produce 15 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen annually by 2030 \nand axed 700 jobs.\n   Dr Forrest told shareholders green hydrogen would be \"critical\" to decarbonising heavy industries that can't be \nelectrified and \"vital\" for Fortescue's plans for a \"massive\" green iron ore industry in the Pilbara.\nPage 2 of 2\nFED:Trucks, trains and dozers drive Fortescue's 'real zero'\n   But he has called for more government support, including deals on cheaper power prices, as the alternative fuel \nwill become viable if production costs come down.\n   He has described the level of American subsidies as a \"straitjacket on the industry\" that work against climate \ngoals and missed out on Australia's multi-billion-dollar handouts under the federal hydrogen headstart program.\n   Fortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said green iron needed political support because the costs were \nstill a barrier to getting the new industry off the ground.\n   As a big polluter, Dr Forrest reiterated that the group would eliminate emissions \"profitably\" from mining \noperations by 2030.\n   \"Real zero means we will no longer use diesel, we will no longer use gas - Fortescue will be entirely powered by \ngreen energy,\" he said.\n   He said the patented \"ecosystem\" would include electric trucks, charging stations, green energy and a new fleet \nmanagement system that could be licensed across the stubbornly hard-to-abate industry.\n   Fortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson said \"significant value\" would flow back to the company from \nthe technology including battery systems to meet a gap in the market and dual-fuel ammonia vessels that get the \nworld a step closer to green shipping.\n   Executive turnover has slowed after a mass exodus in 2023, although Mr Hutchinson is reportedly fending off a \nstaff revolt over his role as director at Alpha International, a Christian organisation that is anti-gay.\n   The AFR reported Dr Forrest told his leadership team they must support LGBTQIA+ couples and corporate \ndiversity more generally, prompting an apology to staff from Mr Hutchison.\nLoad-Date: November 6, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
