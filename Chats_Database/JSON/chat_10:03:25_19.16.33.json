The company is also still working on some earlier-stage projects, such as a joint venture in Morocco.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue to slash up to 700 jobs in green retreat\nBut a swag of others have been \"deprioritised\". Fortescue is effectively abandoning its green ammonia and energy \nprojects in Kenya, Argentina, Canada and the US state of Washington - where Dr Forrest had promised to replace \nformer coal-fired power plants with clean energy production.\nFortescue's failure to maintain the pace or exports at its flagship iron ore division is also understood to be at the \nheart of the sweeping changes, which will only add to the chaos that has engulfed the company over the past 18 \nmonths.\nA derailment on its main Pilbara line over Christmas hit its export rates, as did heavy weather in the Pilbara in \nFebruary. The company is also still struggling to get its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project operating to \nanywhere close to full capacity, and has -issued multiple downgrades to its expected output over the past year. \nMarket analysts expect Fortescue to miss its 192 million tonne export guidance when the company releases its \nJune quarter production report next week, with consensus expectations tipping the company to only barely break \nthe 190 million tonne mark.\nThe move comes amid signs of a further slowing in Chinese steel demand, which is expected to drive down iron ore \nprices, with lower-grade ores - such as those exported by Fortescue - seen as likely to suffer the biggest falls in the \nmedium term.\nRio Tinto noted in its June quarter production report on Tuesday that the price differential between ore grades had \nwidened in the June period.\nIn a late market announcement on Wednesday, Fortescue said it had appointed acting chief financial officer Apple \nPaget to the role on a permanent basis, and moved chief corporate officer Shelley Robertson to the position of chief \noperating officer.\nFortescue said it remained \"resolute in its commitment to be the world's leading green technology, energy and \nmetals company with a laser focus on achieving Real Zero by 2030\". The company said it had \"undergone a period \nof rapid growth and transition, and as part of bringing together Metals and Energy into One For-tescue, initiatives \nare being imple-mented to simplify its structure, remove duplication and deliver cost efficiencies.\n\"The company must continually evolve to ensure it remains lean, is best positioned to deliver on its strategy and \ngenerate the maximum value for shareholders,\" it said.\nFortescue shares closed down 23c at $22.36 on Wednesday.\nFortescue changes   700 jobs to go across global operations   Redundancies to be finalised this month   \nStreamlined executive team, comprising nearly 50% women   Apple Paget is the new chief financial officer   Shelley \nRobertson is the new chief operating officer   Navdeep Gill is the new company secretary\nLoad-Date: July 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
