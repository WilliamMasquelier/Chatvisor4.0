Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"It's been a lesson in humility.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"That water pipeline failure, so that was a shock to the organisation.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"But going after them is a puerile practice as they are too small. Sending people broke is not our speed.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"We deliver operations at the lowest cost in the world. And it's who we are. We don't pretend to be like others.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"That's not how we roll. The board approves projects on exactly the information it has, and it got to $US3.2 billion well after it had been approved and it was being built. And that's when you have the come-to-judgment day.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Chief of Fortescue Metals | \"At the moment, they aren't seeing as high a premium as they had hoped.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
