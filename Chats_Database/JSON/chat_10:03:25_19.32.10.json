He said the company was \"doubling down on green iron\", with a recent visit to China \ndemonstrating to the company's management that the green shift was going to present a huge -opportunity.\n\"When I was there a few weeks ago, the Chinese government made an announcement that 10 per cent of all coal-\nfired boiler feedstock will be ammonia,\" he said. \"And if you do the numbers, China burns two billion tonnes of \nthermal coal a year, 10 per cent of that by mass is 300,000 tons of ammonia. That's nearly 50 million tonnes of \nhydrogen to get to that ammonia amount.\" Fortescue Energy this year is focused on four main projects: its 80MW \nArizona hydrogen project on which it is expected to start construction this calendar year with production set for \n2026; its 300MW Holmaneset green ammonia project in Norway targeted to start construction in 2025; its Pecem \ngreen hydrogen project in Brazil for which the design process has started, and; the Gladstone PEM50 project, \nwhich is a two-stage 50MW green hydrogen project that will operate alongside the company's Gladstone \nelectrolyser manufacturing plant.\nMr Hutchinson said the company would look to sell down stakes in those projects as they progressed. Fortescue \nEnergy is expected to spend about $US700m on operations and $US500m on capital expenditure in the current \nfinancial year.\nOn the earnings front, Mr Otranto said Fortescue delivered its third-best result to date, with underlying profit after \ntax of $US5.7bn, up 3 per cent.\nRevenue rose 8 per cent to $US18.2bn, with the company receiving $US103 a tonne for its ore, also up 8 per cent.\nThe result was a miss on consensus profit estimates of $US6.12bn, while revenue was in line with market \nexpectations.\nIron ore guidance for the current year is for shipments of 190-200 million tonnes, compared with 191.6 million \ntonnes in the 2024 financial year.\nThe company is expecting its cost for hematite production to come in at $US18.50-$US19.75 a tonne, up from \n$US18.24 for 2024.\nFortescue will pay a dividend of 89c a share on September 27, down from $1 for the same period last year. Total \ndividends for the full year were $1.97, up 13 per cent. UBS said the earnings result was \"a solid finish to FY24, \ndespite key earnings metrics falling slightly short of expectations\".Page 3 of 3\nFortescue doubles down on green tilt\nLoad-Date: August 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
