Wednesday afternoon's announcement had three more \nexecutive team appointments: Apple Paget to chief financial officer (from acting CFO), chief corporate officer \nShelley Robertson to chief operating officer and Navdeep (Mona) Gill to company secretary (from assistant \ncompany secretary).\nIn the short term, the other thing on fund managers' minds is whether there may be some residual selling from long-\ntime Fortescue-backed Capital Group, a US funds management giant that was a substantial shareholder for close \nto a decade.\nCapital sold a monster $1.1 billion line of Fortescue shares in June, and dipped below the substantial mark days \nlater. It still has at least a few billion dollars invested in the $70 billion iron ore miner.\nSometimes investors hold off from buying after these blocks, thinking there may be more stock to shake loose at \ndiscounted prices. The block also showed there was not a lot of domestic interest in Fortescue; brokers reckon the \nstock was largely acquired offshore.\nWhatever the case, Forrest and Co have more work to do selling this story to the institutional investor community. \nWhile they're the sort of pack that likes to prove the doubters wrong, it does not hurt to have a few friends out there \nor at least ones that take notice of potentially meaningful strategic pivots.\nFrom the muted reaction, we cannot help to think it's a bit of a \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" when it \ncomes to green hydrogen.\nWhile investors bagged it when Forrest was trying to ram it out, they seem to be paying little attention now he has \ntaken his foot off the accelerator. They're more interested in the iron price.\nWhat's the long-term sustainable iron ore price? You'd be hard-pressed to find too many reputable markets people \nto say it is materially more than yesterday's $US105 a tonne.\nIf it does go south, absent this green hydrogen business we've heard a lot about recently, where does Fortescue's \nshare price go? That's why there are so many \"sell\" calls on the stock and the problem today.\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Anthony Macdonald\nDate: July 19, 2024\nTitle: No sugar hit from Fortescue backflip; Closing Bell\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Is Andrew Forrest\u2019s energy dream in peril?

So what does it mean for green \nhydrogen?Get our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast\nBody\nThe iron ore billionaire Andrew Forrest has long vowed to transform Australia\u2019s energy landscape with green \nhydrogen made from renewable energy, even turning up to 2023\u2019s Cop28 in a ship dubbed the \u201cGreen Pioneer\u201d. \nBut pundits wondered whether the green dream had come crashing down to reality after Fortescue announced this \nweek  that it was cutting 700 jobs across its businesses globally as it seeks to remain \u201clean\u201d, with an unspecific \nnumber going in its energy unit.\nHere we look at the emerging green hydrogen industry and the headwinds \u2013 and tailwinds \u2013 it faces.\n                   What is green hydrogen?                   \nHydrogen, as fans of the periodic table recall, is the simplest element and most abundant in the universe. It makes \nup about 73% of the sun\u2019s mass and one-tenth of yours.\nRefineries use hydrogen to crack heavy oil into petrol and diesel, and to make ammonia for fertiliser. It is also an \nimportant energy store that might one day displace gas or other fossil fuels, used for everything from power \ngeneration to metal production and heavy transport.\nBut hydrogen usually needs to be split from other elements and that takes energy. According to the International \nEnergy Agency, hydrogen production and use was linked to 900m tonnes of C02 emissions in 2022, or about twice \nthat of Australia\u2019s total.\nThe source of the energy used to split hydrogen is categorised into up to a dozen colours. \nPage 2 of 3\nIs Andrew Forrest\u2019s energy dream in peril? The future of green hydrogen in Australia explained\nCSIRO highlights a few,  with green hydrogen extracted without greenhouse gas emissions, usually via \nelectrolysers that are powered by wind, solar or hydro.\nSo-called blue hydrogen uses steam to separate hydrogen from natural gas, with resulting emissions sequestered. \nIf they aren\u2019t, it\u2019s grey hydrogen. If coal is used (as the Japanese have been eyeing in Victoria  ), it\u2019s brown or black, \ndepending on the type of coal. There\u2019s also \u201cpink hydrogen\u201d if nuclear power is the energy source.\n                   Is Fortescue quitting the green hydrogen scene?                   \nFortescue said it \u201cremains resolute in its commitment to be the world\u2019s leading green technology, energy and \nmetals company with a laser focus on achieving Real Zero [ by cutting 90%  of emissions] by 2030\u201d.\nThe cost cuts relate to combining the metals and energy divisions into one \u201cto simplify its structure, remove \nduplication and deliver cost efficiencies\u201d.\n\u201cWe are by no means winding back on our commitment to green hydrogen,\u201d Forrest said in a statement provided to \nGuardian Australia. \u201cIn fact, we are doing all we can to back green hydrogen in Australia by investing in renewable \nenergy and hydrogen technology every single day.\n\u201cThe price of power remains a challenge in Australia, and this has been caused by fossil fuels and the subsidies \nprovided for fossil fuels.\u201d \nAccording to the investment bank UBS, Fortescue\u2019s proposed green ammonia plant  at Queensland\u2019s Gibson \nIsland needs electricity to cost $20-$30 per megawatt hour to be viable but recent long-term contracts for large wind \nand solar farms are offering $70-$90 per MWh power.\nThose price gaps must close if hopes for \u201cgreen steel\u201d or other green metals that use hydrogen are to be realised.\nAGL Energy, meanwhile, confirmed on Friday that Fortescue was ending plans to produce hydrogen at the site of \nits defunct Liddell coal-fired power station. \u201cAGL remains committed to exploring options to produce green hydrogen \nand future fuels at the Hunter [Valley] site in the future if economically feasible,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nUBS has a \u201csell\u201d call on Fortescue shares, predicting they have at least another 10% to fall (building on the 25%-\nplus fall in 2024 so far). A big reason for the dip is falling iron ore prices as China\u2019s demand cools \u2013 unrelated to \nFortescue\u2019s hydrogen hopes.\n                   What are governments doing?                   \nThe government will offer a tax credit to subsidise green hydrogen as part of its Future Made in Australia  scheme. \nProducers will receive a $2/kg \u201cincentive\u201d for up to 10 years \u2013 between mid-2027 and mid-2040 \u2013 for projects \nreaching final investment signoff by 2030.\nStates, too, are chipping in. South Australia, for instance, has a $500m hydrogen jobs plan  that includes $100m \nstate and federal support for the Port Bonython Hydrogen Hub  that aims to produce green hydrogen-related \nexports from 2030.\nNew South Wales, meanwhile, will offer as much as $3bn to lure similar ventures to that state, with a 2030 \u201cstretch \ntarget\u201d of 111,000 tonnes a year of green hydrogen output and 700 megawatts of electrolyser capacity.\nBut other nations are spending much more. The US\u2019s inflation reduction act may end up topping $1UStn ($A1.5tn) \nfor decarbonising programs, including hydrogen and electric vehicles among others.\nFortescue cuts were likely related to missing out on being shortlisted for the first $2bn  of the $4bn federal \ngovernment\u2019s \u201chydrogen headstart\u201d scheme, one source added.\n                   What does the hydrogen industry think?                   Page 3 of 3\nIs Andrew Forrest\u2019s energy dream in peril? The future of green hydrogen in Australia explained\nInsiders say much climate action hinges on \u201ccost-effective\u201d renewable energy, not just the green hydrogen industry.\nSo-called blue hydrogen might be a near-term solution to make the product cheap enough to foster greater demand \nbut \u201cit\u2019s better for the planet if we went straight to green\u201d, one source said.\nFiona Simon, chief executive of the Australian Hydrogen Council, said Fortescue\u2019s move was \u201cless about hydrogen \nthan it is about one company and how it\u2019s sought to reassess its priorities\u201d.\nThat said, \u201cwe\u2019ve all known that hydrogen was difficult, and in the last two or three years [experience has shown] \nthat is harder than we thought\u201d, Simon said. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t signal the death of hydrogen.\u201d\nScaling up the production of electrolysers that use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen will help drive \ndown costs, she said.\nBy some estimates, hydrogen costs would need to drop to about $US2/kg ($A3/kg) to be competitive. One recent \nUS government study  puts present costs at $US12 to $16/kg when delivery costs are included.\n                   What next?                   \nThe International Energy Agency estimates global hydrogen demand reached 95m tonnes in 2022, rising about 3% \nthat year. Low-emissions sources of the fuel accounted for just 0.7% of demand.\nMinh Le, global head of hydrogen for analysts Rystad Energy, said that \u201cas things stand at the moment it will be \nvery challenging, if not almost impossible to reach $2 [US] for green hydrogen\u201d.\nStill, \u201cthe momentum of hydrogen development remains strong\u201d, with \u201cmany major auctions in key regions\u201d coming \nthrough this year in Europe, Japan and elsewhere, he said.\nFalling battery costs add to the competitive pressures in areas such as transport. At 14 times lighter than air, \nhydrogen is leaky \u2013 with safety issues  \u2013 and not yet barbecue ready. \nRystad Energy\u2019s Nigel Rambhujun said \u201ca lot more work can be done on demand-side policies to incentivise \npotential end-users and reduce the green premium associated with clean hydrogen\u201d with the next 6-12 months \n\u201ccritical\u201d for the sector in Australia.\n\u201cWithout significant government support, green hydrogen will continue to be the most expensive hydrogen colour.\u201d\nLoad-Date: July 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Guardian\nAuthor: Peter Hannam\nDate: July 19, 2024\nTitle: Is Andrew Forrest\u2019s energy dream in peril?

Forrest has made the difficult decision to scale back his green hydrogen initiatives, citing difficulties \nwith the commercial viability of the project.\nThis prudent business decision raises an important question: if green hydrogen projects are not currently viable for \nprivate investors such as Forrest, why should Australian taxpayers be expected to shoulder the financial risk? The \ndiscrepancy between Forrest's public advocacy and private actions signals the need for a thorough reassessment \nof taxpayer investments in green hydrogen.\nPublic funds should be allocated prudently, ensuring that investments are both economically viable and beneficial \nfor the broader community, not for billionaires' business interests.\nDon McMillan, Paddington, Qld\nFriday's editorial (\"Hydrogen rush is hitting reality\", 19/7) clearly sets out what the federal government should be in \nrelation to Australia's ongoing energy supply. Opposition energy spokesman Ted O'Brien says: \"Hydrogen was a \ngood example of why governments should avoid trying to pick winners and instead diversify the risk for taxpayers.\" \nThe current Coalition stance is effectively that we must leave our options open.\nWe know from our own and overseas experience that energy technology is developing rapidly. In practical terms, \nwe are increasingly seeing new energy supply opportunities revealed. I would like to think we are a fairly pragmatic \ncountry when it comes to the uptake of new technologies.\nAs your editorial says, \"The responsible thing to do is to safeguard electricity supplies using known technologies \nwhile alternatives are properly evaluated.\" We certainly have the skills and political nous to make long-term \ndecisions for the benefit of all Australians.\nJohn Houghton, The Gap, Qld\nPage 2 of 2\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nBrilliant letter by Mark Scanlan (\"Bowen EV policy driving us into dystopian future\", 19/7) on the future for green \nhydrogen and the advent of the zero-emissions Twigster! I hope he has sent copies to the Prime Minister, Energy \nMinister and rent-seekers of government energy investment schemes.\nKerry MacDermott, Binalong, NSW\nThe chooks have come home to roost. To sustain a renewable energy pipe dream takes a lot of money. Even \nAndrew Forrest, who seems to have lots of it, and government largesse aren't enough to overcome the reality of \nsupply and demand. There simply isn't sufficient renewable electricity currently or in the pipeline to service \nFortescue's proposed production of 15 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2030. Given supply-side issues, the cost of \nrenewable energy for the purpose of green hydrogen production is exorbitantly high. The Fortescue pullback has \npunched a mammoth hole in the government's renewable ambitions. It raises serious questions about the reliability \nof the government's forecasts and its promises in the energy space more generally. It's a wake-up call that to wed \nthis country's energy security to technologies that are yet to be proven at scale is not only fraught but also \nirresponsible.\nKim Keogh, Claremont, WA\nIt is hilariously strange to witness the evolution of the views of energy analysts and even Australia's Chief Scientist \non the outlook for green hydrogen in our energy mix since Fortescue's pirouette on its future application. I wonder \nif our next chief scientist might have a better grasp of the second law of thermodynamics.\nThere has been so much ignorant, greenwashing bunkum delivered to potential investors around projects to deliver \nhydrogen as a fuel. In fact, the manufacturing process itself consumes about three times as much energy as it \ndelivers in use. I've seen wild projects touted as environmentally friendly taking hydrogen from brown coal or \nmethane, coupled with carbon capture, while every second element of the periodic table has suddenly become \n\"critical\". Carpetbaggers and lifestyle company directors have had a field day.\nThe sad and concerning aspect of this madness is how poorly our government has been advised and the many \ntens of millions of taxpayer dollars that have been splashed around on harebrained projects of dubious merit.

But Dr Forrest told shareholders \nattending the Fortescue AGM his green dream would take the company to a new level entirely, and by 2030 \nFortescue would be challenging global energy majors such as Chevron.\nFortescue would be targeting production of as much as 235 gigawatts of renewable energy, Dr Forrest told \nshareholders - more than five times the capacity of Australia's National Electricity Market at the time.\nThe edges of the plan had been leaking out for months, as Dr Forrest and a small group of insiders had been \ntouring the world trying to stitch up deals with global governments to allow the company first choice of potential \nenergy projects. The company's new subsidiary, Fortescue Future Industries, had signed a deal for the potential \ndevelopment of hydroelectric power in Papua New Guinea only a month before, along with early stage agreements \nin Indonesia. And the company had already hired a raft of renewable energy experts - including former Pacific \nHydro boss Rob Grant - to help form its renewable energy plans.\nBy the November shareholder meeting Dr Forrest and his team had spoken with more than 25 governments around \nthe world, with another 24 on the list for the touring party.\nThat landmark presentation in November 2020 kicked off a bewildering array of announcements from the tour - \nincluding early stage agreements with India, Indonesia and Brazil - and plans to get involved in the world's biggest \nrenewable energy project, the Grand Inga project in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nAlarm bells were ringing in the market by mid-2021, however, when Fortescue's announcement it planned to spend \nup to 10 per cent of its net profits on green energy projects - or $US400m to $US600m that financial year - sparked \nconcerns the green energy project was looming as a major distraction from the company's main iron ore business.\nPage 2 of 3\nFortescue now marching 'to the one beat'\nFortescue chief executive Elizabeth Gaines faced a hostile reception from analysts and investors at the company's \nregular quarterly production briefing in July, with analysts and fund managers demanding the company give the \nmarket a \"clear business case\" for its green energy investments.",
