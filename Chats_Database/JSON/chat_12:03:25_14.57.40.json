Shell has indefinitely suspended all shipments through the Red Sea due to escalating tensions following US and UK military actions against Yemen's Houthi rebels, which have raised concerns about further attacks on commercial vessels.\n\n2. The decision to halt shipments comes after a recent incident where a Shell-chartered tanker was targeted by a drone in the Red Sea, highlighting the increasing risks to maritime operations in the region.\n\n3. Shell's suspension aligns with similar actions taken by other major energy companies, including BP and Qatar Energy, indicating a broader industry response to the heightened threat level in the Red Sea shipping lanes.\n\n4. The ongoing Houthi attacks, which have expanded beyond Israeli-linked vessels to include indiscriminate targeting of various commercial ships, are causing significant disruptions in global shipping routes and raising fears of potential environmental disasters from oil spills.",
