Iron ore's outlier status hinges on optimism about what China's leadership might do in response to its growth \ndilemma.\nThe Fortescue executive chairman's judgment is in question over revelations that private investigators hired by the \ncompany watched and photographed the families of former employees. The spying reveals a dark side to the noble \nquest to produce so-called green iron by Fortescue, which makes nearly all its money from selling iron ore to \nChinese steel mills.\nFortescue has accused key figures behind its leap into clean energy of copying and taking the company's \nintellectual property when they left to start a rival green iron business, Element Zero.\nFortescue hired private investigators to trail Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen in \nthe lead-up to raids on homes and Element Zero premises.\nThe actions, which included photographing Winther-Jensen, his wife and teenage daughter at their home in the \nPerth suburb of Scarborough, and Kolodzijczyk's wife at their Melbourne home, were revealed in an affidavit \nreleased by the Federal Court this week.\nCameras are everywhere these days but even WA premier Roger Cook has questioned if Fortescue went too far. \nForrest himself was photographed planting a kiss on the streets of Paris in May. Moroccan energy minister Leila \nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue 's green iron dreams sullied by surveillance tactics in tech row\nBenali, who is on the board of one of Fortescue's joint venture partners in a green ammonia project, later denied \nthat she was the woman in the picture.\nUnder Federal Court rules, an independent lawyer must carry out raids under privately obtained search warrants of \nthe kind granted to Fortescue.\nLawyers acting for Element Zero will seek to have the Fortescue claim they stole intellectual property thrown out. \nThey have also pointed to reputational damage suffered by the three men and say the search and seizure orders \nwere improperly obtained.\nFortescue is making no apologies and is standing by its allegations of \"industrial-scale misuse\" of its work on green \niron. Element Zero says its technology was developed independently and is very different from anything Fortescue \nhas done.\nOne-time trusted Forrest lieutenant Masterman and former Fortescue chief scientist Kolodziejczyk founded \nElement Zero in December 2022; they were part of the Fortescue team that travelled the world with Forrest in 2020 \nin the hunt for clean energy projects.\nThe green hydrogen dream remains elusive. Throughout most of last year, Fortescue maintained it would make \nfinal investment decisions on five green energy projects by December 31.\nThree were announced at the company's annual general meeting in November, and Fortescue said at the time that \nit still hoped to hit the target by the year-end. Seven months later, Fortescue remains stuck at three.\nIt was due to host Cook, other officials and the media on a site tour of its clean energy hub at Christmas Creek on \nJune 21 but cancelled the event because of heavy rain.\nThe heavens opened up days earlier when Forrest hosted Chinese premier Li Qiang at a Fortescue research hub \non the outskirts of Perth, where it is trialling hydrogen, ammonia and battery power for use in its mining machinery.\nSpeaking in May at a JP Morgan forum, Forrest talked up the prospect of a fully integrated Australia-China green \niron supply chain. He said Fortescue would produce 200 million tonnes of green iron ore annually through its \nefforts to achieve zero emissions, and Chinese manufacturers would supply the equipment and electrolysers. In the \nsame presentation, Forrest predicted Morocco would become the \"leading green molecule and green electron \nprovider\" in a transformation of the global fertiliser industry.\nMeanwhile, his US interests are getting expensive. Forrest has warned that plans by US Treasury officials to restrict \nthe availability of tax credits for hydrogen developments through the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act \nthreaten the viability of the $US550 million Arizona project, one of the three big bets. Fortescue has counted on \naccess to those incentives to underpin the US hydrogen venture.\nIn WA, where Fortescue still makes all its money, the $US3.9 billion Iron Bridge magnetite operations remain in \nneed of fixing. It was slated to produce just 2 million tonnes in 2023-24, and it remains unclear if it will ever hit a \nnameplate capacity of 22 million tonnes a year.\nAmong its issues, Iron Bridge has been plagued with high turnover. This week, Fiona Hick joined the board of gold \nand copper producer Evolution Mining in her first major move since leaving Fortescue after just six months as chief \nexecutive of its iron ore division.\nLoad-Date: July 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Brad Thompson\nDate: July 06, 2024\nTitle: Fortescue's green iron dreams sullied by surveillance tactics in tech row\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Fortescue now at Arm's length\n## Media outlet: Northern Territory News\n### Author: Camden Smith\n### Date: July 09, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nFortescue now at Arm's length\nFortescue now at Arm's length\nNorthern Territory News (Australia)\nJuly 9, 2024 Tuesday\nNTNews Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 5\nLength: 657 words\nByline: Camden Smith\nBody\nThe number of proponents trying to shore up projects at the Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct has \nbeen reduced from five to four.\nFortescue Future Industries, one of five companies last year granted 12-month \"Not To Deal\" assurances from the \nTerritory government to develop projects at Middle Arm, has quietly withdrawn its bid to develop a green hydrogen \nhub.\nFortescue was one of five proponents selected by the Territory government to develop projects at Middle Arm \nalong with TEH2, Tivan, Tamboran Resources and Avenira.\nBut Fortescue's interest in Northern Territory projects has been waning since the group unsuccessfully bid for \ncontrol of SunCable's Australia-Asia Powerlink, which was eventually acquired by Mike Cannon-Brookes' Grok \nVentures last November.\nIn February former chief minister Michael Gunner stepped aside from the Andrew Forrest owned FFI after holding \nroles as Australia West Director and Australian director.\nHis resignation was one of a number of high profile departures from Fortescue, including former chief financial \nofficer and Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle, who last year moved to Territory company Tivan as a \ndirector.\nIn a statement, the NT government said it hoped to retain Fortescue at Middle Arm.\n\"Following recent discussions with Fortescue on its project outlook and planning activities, the Not to Deal \narrangement has concluded,\" a spokesman said.\n\"Fortescue continues to consider Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct an attractive long-term location for \ngreen product projects, and the Northern Territory government would welcome a future project by Fortescue in the \nTerritory.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue now at Arm's length\n\"The Northern Territory government is continually engaging with a number of potential proponents around \nopportunities at Middle Arm. More specifically, discussions are well advanced with two green energy projects about \nland in the precinct which combined are expected to require slightly more land than what was previously proposed \nby Fortescue.\" The government said Not to Deal commitments for initial proponents TEH2, Tivan, Tamboran and \nAvenira remain in place.\nMiddle Arm is the Territory government's most consequential major project which, if successfully developed, could \ndeliver 20,000 direct and indirect jobs to the economy and millions in revenue and royalties. A visionary plan, \nMiddle Arm defies the historic challenge of securing major projects by offering developers the land, infrastructure \nand regulatory environment of a joint user facility to get hundred-million-dollar-plus developments off the ground.\nCanberra-focused anti-development activists including senators David Pocock and Lidia Thorpe have opposed the \ndevelopment, implying the Territory, unlike anywhere else in Australia, should be excluded from job-creating, \nwealth-generating projects.\nWhile the agreements are intended to provide proponents with confidence and certainty to continue developing their \nproposals, the government said, final land allocation within Middle Arm is subject to key project milestones and \napprovals, specific to each proponent project.\nThe Middle Arm peninsula is already home to the Santos Darwin LNG and the INPEX Ichthys LNG processing \nfacilities. Both companies are committed to net zero emissions. While the government attempts to secure \ndevelopment at Middle Arm, it's also wrestling with seemingly constant delays on its $500m ship lift project while \nwork continues on two other Top End major projects - the Tiger Brennan Drive overpass and the State Square art \ngallery.\nAfter almost a decade, the government said it was preparing to start work at the Alice Springs Indigenous art \ngallery. In the private sector Tamboran Resources and Empire Energy are continuing work in the Beetaloo Basin, \nhoping for first production next year, Grok is developing Sun Cable and in Central Australian Arafura Rare Earths \ncontinues to progress the Nolans project, underpinned with an $840m Commonwealth loan.\nLoad-Date: July 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Northern Territory News\nAuthor: Camden Smith\nDate: July 09, 2024\nTitle: Fortescue now at Arm's length\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Keating our most influential Australian: Forrest\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: John Stensholt\n### Date: July 10, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nKeating our most influential Australian: Forrest\nKeating our most influential Australian: Forrest\nThe Australian\nJuly 10, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 13\nLength: 642 words\nByline: JOHN STENSHOLT, EXCLUSIVE\nBody\nBillionaire mining magnate Andrew Forrest has described former Labor prime minister and treasurer Paul Keating \nas the Australian who he believes has had the biggest impact on the country in his lifetime.\n\"His floating the Australian dollar and making a number of other economic and social moves which were deeply \nunpopular at the time but he went ahead and did that,\" Dr Forrest says, describing Mr Keating's work on \nderegulation in the 1980s as being immensely influential.\nDr Forrest is the founder of the hugely successful Fortescue Metals Group and the Minderoo foundation, the \nbiggest charitable foundation overseen, with wife Nicola Forrest, by a living Australian billionaire.\nBut in talking to The Australian after being named by the masthead as one of the most influential Australians of the \npast six decades - in a list to be published on Saturday - Dr Forrest said he remembers the first time he was \nprominently featured in the newspaper was in less auspicious times.\nIt was an icy day in mid-1999 when Dr Forrest, now 62, stood next to the then PM John Howard and West \nAustralian premier Richard Court to open his $1bn dream in the desert: Anaconda Nickel's Murrin Murrin laterite \nnickel project.\nDr Forrest promised the massive plant would be in full production within 18 months and revolutionise the global \nnickel industry, but a series of technical disasters crushed the dream and he was eventually forced out of \nAnaconda.\n\"Back then, there were very few supporters,\" Dr Forrest tells The Australian.
