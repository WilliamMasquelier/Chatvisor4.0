Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 18\nLength: 572 words\nByline: Elouise Fowler\nBody\nA key independent witness in a lengthly native title legal battle against Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has batted \naway accusations of bias in favour of the traditional owners, the Federal Court heard yesterday.\nThe silk representing Fortescue urged the court to view as unreliable clinical psychologist Jeff Nelson's key report \non the psychological harm to traditional owners caused by the miner's giant iron ore project on their land in the \nPilbara.\nThe Yindjibarndi people are suing Fortescue for about $1 billion in lost economic benefits, and cultural and spiritual \ndamage from Fortescue's Solomon hub, three-quarters of which sits in Yindjibarndi land that also takes in the \ngorges and rock pools of Millstream Chichester National Park.\nThe case will decide if Fortescue, which has mined iron ore there without permission or agreement with the \nYindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation for 10 years, will get compensation. The Yindjibarndi were found to be native \ntitleholders of the land in 2017.\nOne of the traditional owners' claims for compensation, previously untested, is around social disharmony based on \nFortescue opting to throw its support behind a breakaway group, Wirlu-murra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation, \nwhich has separately struck deals with the miner.\nGriff Ranson SC, the silk for the state of Western Australia, played the court a recording of a conversation between \nDr Nelson with the leader of YAC, Michael Woodley, to suggest he was biased towards the YAC's interests.\n\"A fair-minded listener could reasonably conclude from listening to this audio recording that your evidence is not \nimpartial, but that you've become an advocate for the cause of the party that's retained you,\" he said.\nDr Nelson refuted the suggestions that he was biased and that his report was one-sided.\n\"The excerpts of the tape may have presented me in a particular way and I make no apology for interacting with him \non level that they are comfortable with,\" he told the court when re-examined by YAC's counsel Tina Jowett. \"I am \nnot an advocate for one person ... I really went to great lengths to get information from both sides of this divide.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nExpert denies $1b Fortescue case bias\nFortescue's silk Brahmananda Dharmananda SC sought to cast doubt on the report's finding that Fortescue \ncaused social division, and argued Dr Nelson didn't make an effort to interview the breakaway group.\n\"The sample group of 21 people cannot statistically reflect ... the whole of the people - given there around 1200 of \nthem?\" he asked.\nDr Nelson agreed the maths was correct, but explained this criticism didn't stand in a professional setting. \"When \nyou're talking in the clinical space, it's a different argument. You will find many good single case study reports from \nwhich generalisations are made.\"\nDr Nelson dismissed suggestions he did not make efforts to interview Wirlu-murra Yindjibarndi people. He said he \nvisited their office on five occasions, and had arranged to interview a group of people, but they didn't turn up.\nFortescue's silk further put to the court that the social dislocation and trauma faced by the group couldn't be \npegged on Fortescue, and instead the social dislocation stretched back to the 1960s and 1970s.\nDr Nelson agreed that it was not possible to pin the group's trauma and dislocation exclusively on Fortescue.\nBut on re-examination by Ms Jowett,he said Fortescue mining the land without permission compounded the \nfoundational trauma of the group's relocation.\nLoad-Date: April 14, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
