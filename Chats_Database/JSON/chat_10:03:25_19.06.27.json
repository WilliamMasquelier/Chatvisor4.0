As a Forrest spox told us, the Rabat visit involves meetings with Fortescue's joint-venture partner OCP \n(Benali being one of its directors along with half the Moroccan cabinet, although Chairman Twiggy only deals with \nChairman Mostafa Terrab, we're informed), plus an event at the Australian embassy, a -speaking gig at the Africa -\nBusiness School and meetings with \"key ministers and local ambassadors\".\nLocal media was reporting on Tuesday that Forrest - \"surnomme par la presse australienne 'Twiggy' \" - had been \ndue to meet Moroccan Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch (apparently false, not happening, never was) and Industry \nMinister (and OCP director) Ryad Mezzour.\nNo pre-arranged business commitments with Benali either - who was doorstopped by a press pack and didn't want \nto comment on all the fuss - but nothing to stop the Twig from finding a corner table at Rick's Cafe in Casablanca. \nIt's only an hour's drive from the capital. Bah, even if she doesn't turn up - they'll always have Paris.\nIsraeli interlude Meanwhile, we note Twiggy's Bombardier Global Express 7500 had been in Tel Aviv just prior to \ndeparting for Morocco. We asked what Forrest was doing in Israel but his people would only say it was personal, \nrather than Fortescue-related. No doubt he met with a few Knesset members. The visit didn't sound so much like a \nsolidarity visit post-October 7 and more like an opportunity to cut a few deals. On what? TBC, we hear. Stay tuned.\nKing's share play A panicked Phil King appears to have tried to play the market over his holding in luxury goods \nmerchant Cettire, led by reclusive rich-lister Dean Mintz. Cettire has been the subject of ongoing prodding by this \nmasthead and we hear King was on the phone to News Corp journalists last Monday sniffing about for details of an \nimpending scoop - one that he knew would be hardly flattering to the business. On that basis, King's Regal Funds \nPage 2 of 2\nBusy Forrest on the job in Morocco\nManagement tried to beat the news (and the serious risk of a price drop, which ended up happening), selling 25,300 \nshares in Cettire for about $635,000 the very next day, well before any article had been printed.\nWe can't explain why he then bought back roughly one-third of those shares hours later. Did he suddenly think \nbetter of acting on the whiff of a rumour? In any case, once Joyce Moullakis and John Stensholt's yarn was \npublished exactly one week later King immediately scrambled to buy more Cettire, purchasing nearly $1.1m worth \nof stock - and not all of it at a discount. We put questions to King about this mischief but didn't receive a reply.\nCars in reverse Wretched news for investors in Peter Warren Automotive on Tuesday, the company announcing a \n20 per cent profit downgrade, with projections coming in somewhere between $52m and $57m.\nThat set off a share price crash to a low of $1.84, a cliff drop from the $2.21 and $2.40 that directors Niran Peiris \nand Paul Warren have been paying, respectively, to buy up shares in recent months. Peiris acquired 90,000 shares \nfrom March to mid-April; Warren, eldest son of company founder Peter Warren, bought 122,000-odd shares at the \nend of February.\nThe timing of these purchases could reflect some crappy judgment. Peiris and Warren would be well across the \ndeclining customer demand for vehicles, the higher costs of holding them, the discounting, the thin margin on sales. \nThere's also the big, billowing red flag of CEO Mark Weaver announcing his exit from the company in March, a \nsignal of doom and decay for any company right before the release of their results. Peiris didn't care, it seems, and \nbought more than $100,000 a week later, followed by another tranche a fortnight afterwards for a total of $200,000.\nNot that either of them are alone in making oddly miscalculated stock purchases in this sector. Two years ago the \nSutton family paid a premium for Quadrant Capital's remaining post-IPO stake in Peter Warren, a $50m deal that \npriced the shares at roughly $3.18, well above the market price of $2.99 at the time, and far higher than the $1.87 at \nwhich the shares closed on Tuesday.\nWe asked Peiris and Warren for some reasoning behind their purchases, to which CFO Victor Cuthell replied, \ntelling us both directors are \"strong supporters of the Peter Warren strategy, its long-term outlook and its prospects \nin general,\" and adding that they still hold those views post-trading update and even consider the investments \"well-\nmade\". Surely all said through gritted teeth. An alternative take is they've been sleep-walking through board \nmeetings - or maybe auto execs are generally in denial about the turmoil of their industry?\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Peter Warren executives mis-time their share buys\nLoad-Date: May 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue chairman | \"It's all part of what Team Fortescue told us was a 'long-planned trip' to help Morocco become a 'major player in the global energy transition'.\" | N.A. |\n| Leila Benali | Energy Minister of Morocco | \"Benali helped broker during a visit by Forrest and Fortescue to Rabat in February.\" | \"Benali helped broker during a visit by Forrest and Fortescue to Rabat in February.\" |\n| Ryad Mezzour | Industry Minister of Morocco | \"No pre-arranged business commitments with Benali either.\" | \"No pre-arranged business commitments with Benali either.\" |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
