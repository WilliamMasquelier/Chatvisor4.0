Shell's rival BP similarly paused biofuels investment at US and German \noil refineries recently.\nShell expects to write down between $US600m and $US1bn on the asset, while the impairment after the sale of its \nSingapore refinery is expected to be $US600m-$US800m.\nIn addition, Europe's largest energy company expects trading results from its integrated-gas segment, usually its \nlargest profit centre, to be lower than in the first quarter, when the unit booked $US3.68bn in adjusted earnings, due \nto seasonality.\nHowever, it expects the unit's results to match those of the second quarter last year, when it booked $US2.5bn in \nadjusted earnings - a metric that strips certain commodity price adjustments and one-time charges.\nThe company also narrowed the segment's liquids and natural-gas production outlook slightly upward to 940,000- \n980,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day for the quarter, from a previously guided range of 920,000- 980,000 BOE a \nday.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell warns of $3bn impairment\nShell, the world's largest liquefied natural gas trader, expects its quarterly LNG volumes to be between 6.8 million \nand 7.2 million tonnes, compared with the prior-year's 7.2 million tonnes.\nThis would mean a decline from the first quarter's 7.6 million tonnes. However, gas prices in Europe have rallied in \nrecent months on strong demand in Asia amid heatwaves and outages limiting supply, potentially providing a boon \nto Shell's quarterly results.\nOn the upstream side - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - Shell is expecting the unit to produce between \n1.72 million and 1.82 million BOE a day ready for sale, versus 1.70 million a year prior and 1.87 million in the first \nquarter. In the first quarter, the segment garnered $US1.93bn in adjusted earnings.\nLoad-Date: July 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOrganization Context: Discussed as a rival to Shell that has similarly paused biofuels investment at its US and German oil refineries.\n\nDetermine if the portrayal of BP is \"Positive\", \"Neutral\", or \"Negative\" in the article.\nOutput ONLY ONE of these three words and nothing else.\n",
