Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nA LABOUR OF LOAF\nA LABOUR OF LOAF\nThe Courier Mail (Australia)\nAugust 4, 2024 Sunday\nStellarQLD Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: STELLAR; Pg. 15\nLength: 664 words\nBody\nGive that leftover bread a new lease of life by transforming the odds and ends into breadcrumbs that will elevate \nyour midweek meals with an extra sprinkle of deliciousness\nBRUSSELS SPROUT GRATIN WITH MACADAMIA CRUMB SERVES 4-6 You'll need a large flameproof baking \ndish or frypan.\n200g smoked streaky bacon, cut into matchsticks 1kg brussels sprouts, halved lengthways if large Sea salt and \nfreshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup (125ml) vino cotto (see note), plus extra, to drizzle (optional) Finely grated \npecorino, to serve MACADAMIA CRUMB 60g butter, chopped 1 tbs each finely chopped rosemary and thyme, plus \nextra fried rosemary sprigs, to serve 1 cup (100g) roughly chopped macadamias 80g stale wholemeal sourdough \nbread, torn into small pieces Preheat the oven to 240\u00c2\u00b0C/220\u00c2\u00b0C fan-forced.\nHeat a large flameproof baking dish or frypan over medium heat.

Drizzle with the vino cotto and roast in \nthe oven for 20-25 minutes, until the sprouts are lightly golden and cooked, but still have some crunch. Meanwhile, \nto make the crumb, heat a medium frypan over high heat. Add the butter, and when it begins to foam, add the \nremaining ingredients and cook, tossing frequently, for 3-4 minutes, until golden. Season to taste. To serve, place \nthe sprouts in the centre of the table and scatter with the macadamia crumb and extra rosemary sprigs. Drizzle with \nthe extra vino cotto, if desired.\nNOTE This dish can be served hot or at room temperature. Vino cotto, which translates to \"cooked wine\" in Italian, \nis a traditional Italian condiment made by slowly cooking grape must (the freshly crushed grape juice, including \nskins, seeds and stems) until it reduces to a thick, syrupy consistency. This process caramelises the sugars in the \ngrape juice, resulting in a sweet and slightly tangy flavour profile with nuances of dried fruit and spices. Vino cotto is \navailable from selected supermarkets and specialty grocers.\nRICOTTA & SALAMI STUFFED SHELL PASTA BAKE SERVES 4-6 You'll need a 2.25L baking dish.\n500g large shell pasta 21/2 tbs extra-virgin olive oil 2 bay leaves 1 onion, finely chopped 3 garlic cloves, finely \nchopped 80g finely chopped mild salami 2 x 400g jars sugo semplice with basil (see note) Fried basil leaves, to \nPage 2 of 2\nA LABOUR OF LOAF\nserve RICOTTA FILLING 500g firm ricotta 60g fresh breadcrumbs 21/2 tbs finely chopped preserved lemon rind, \nplus extra, thinly sliced, to serve 21/2 tbs finely chopped basil\nPreheat the oven to 220\u00c2\u00b0C/200\u00c2\u00b0C fan-forced.\nGrease a 2.25L baking dish.\nCook the pasta for 2 minutes less than the packet instructions, then drain and rinse under cold water.
