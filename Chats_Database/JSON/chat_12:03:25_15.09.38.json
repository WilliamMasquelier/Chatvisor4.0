Focus on how the article portrays Shell in terms of its actions, reputation, performance, and impact. The tone should be categorized as one of the following:\n\nPositive: The article reflects well on Shell, highlighting favorable aspects.\nNeutral: The article presents information about Shell in a balanced, objective manner without any strong positive or negative bias.\nNegative: The article is critical of Shell, highlighting challenges, controversies, failures, or unfavorable developments.\n\nProvide the final tone assessment as \"Positive,\" \"Neutral,\" or \"Negative.\"\n\nHere is the article content: Page 1 of 2\nShell wins appeal against court order to reduce the oil company's carbon emissions\nShell wins appeal against court order to reduce the oil company's carbon \nemissions\nABC Premium News (Australia)\nNovember 12, 2024 Tuesday\nCopyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved\nLength: 520 words\nHighlight: Oil giant Shell wins a landmark case at The Hague, overturning an earlier court ruling ordering it to cut \nits carbon emissions by 45 per cent. \nBody\nA Dutch court has accepted Shell's appeal against a landmark climate ruling, dismissing the order for the oil and \ngas company to sharply reduce emissions.\nThe appeals court in The Hague said on Tuesday that Shell had a responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions to protect people from global warming.\nBut it dismissed the 2021 ruling that ordered Shell to cut its absolute carbon emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 \ncompared to 2019 levels, including those caused by the use of its products.\nThe Dutch court said Shell was already on its way to meet required targets for its own emissions, and it was \nunclear if demands to also reduce emissions caused by the use of its products would help the fight against climate \nchange.\n\"Even though Shell bears a special responsibility as a large oil and gas company, that does not mean we can \napply a general reduction goal of 45 per cent,\" presiding judge Carla Joustra said.\nIn a written summary of the ruling, the court said: \"There is currently insufficient consensus in climate science on a \nspecific reduction percentage to which an individual company like Shell should adhere.\"\nShell's chief executive officer, Wael Sawan, welcomed the ruling.\n\u201cWe are pleased with the court\u2019s decision, which we believe is the right one for the global energy transition, the \nNetherlands and our company,\u201d he said.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell wins appeal against court order to reduce the oil company's carbon emissions\n\"Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of Shell's strategy and is \ntransforming our business.\"\nClimate mitigation debate\nThe ruling coincides with the COP29 UN climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, where building on a decision at last \nyear's talks to transition away from fossil fuels is set to be debated.\nClimate activist group Friends of the Earth Netherlands, which brought the case forward in 2019, said it would \ncontinue its fight against large polluters.\n\"This hurts,\" the group's director Donald Pols said. \n\"At the same time, we see that this case has ensured that major polluters are not immune and has further \nstimulated the debate about their responsibility in combating dangerous climate change.\n\"That is why we continue to tackle major polluters, such as Shell.\"\nFriends of the Earth did not say whether it would launch a further appeal at the Netherlands' Supreme Court.\nThe case in the Hague, where Shell was headquartered until it completed its move to London in 2022, was viewed \nas pivotal for both sides of the emissions divide and helped to inspire other lawsuits.\nIn appeal hearings earlier this year, Shell said demands for companies to reduce emissions could not be made by \ncourts, but only by states.\nThe court agreed with Shell that an absolute order to reduce emissions from its products could have an adverse \neffect worldwide, as it could lead customers to switch from using Shell's gas to more polluting coal.\n\"In general, any reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is positive to mitigate climate change,\" Judge Joustra said.\n\"But that does not mean that a reduction order for Shell has that same effect.\"\nShell shares traded down 0.2 per cent in Amsterdam early on Tuesday, broadly in line with the wider index.\nReuters/AP\nLoad-Date: November 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should solely be one of these three words based on your assessment: \"Positive\", \"Neutral\", or \"Negative\".
