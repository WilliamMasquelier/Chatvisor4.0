It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nFortescue 'seized personal details'\nFortescue 'seized personal details'\nThe Australian\nJuly 13, 2024 Saturday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 28\nLength: 736 words\nByline: Angelica Snowden, Nick Evans\nBody\nFortescue seized personal banking details of former employees that were the subject of raids conducted by the \nmining giant - as well as the entire business records of rival green iron start-up -Element Zero - claims in the \nFederal Court show.\nThe \"extraordinary\" orders won by Fortescue's lawyers include details of private negotiations between Element \nZero and other Fortescue rivals, as well as deeply personal information of its staff, potentially including personal \nbanking passwords and private communications between the former Fortescue staff and their families.\nDocuments released by the Federal Court on Friday also show that, despite Fortescue's claims its former staff \nstole its intellectual property, the iron ore giant was last year selling its would-be rival iron ore to help them test their \nown technology, and had agreed to protocols for the exchange of information about how well it worked using \nFortescue ore.\nThe new revelations come after Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest claimed he did not know his \ncompany paid private investigators to follow the wives of his ex-staff Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen \ninto Kmart, take pictures of their children and rummage through mail before court-sanctioned raids were launched \non their homes and offices. Fortescue won court orders to carry out raids in May after it was alleged Element \nZero's Dr Kolodziejczyk, Dr Winther-Jensen and Michael Masterman stole Fortescue's carbon-dioxide-free green \niron tech-nology secrets when they all quit several years ago.\nDespite elements of the court case remaining suppressed, fresh documents released on Friday revealed Element \nZero's concern that an \"extraordinarily large volume\" of electronic material - more than three terabytes - belonging \nto its young business was captured during the searches.\nElement Zero's Gilbert & Tobin lawyer Michael Williams said virtually the entirety of Ele-ment Zero's documents and \nemails were seized, \"together with highly confidential and privileged material\" that was \"entirely unrelated to \nFortescue's pleaded claim\". The entire contents of Dr Kolodziejczyk's mobile was downloaded, including photos \nand videos, and about 3TB of data was captured, which Mr Williams said was \"an extremely large volume\" to be \ncaught under Anton Piller search orders in his experience.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue 'seized personal details'\nFurther, he said there were grounds for the search orders to be scrapped based on \"the apparent extraordinary \ninvasion of the privacy of the respondents\".\n\"I am informed by Mr Masterman and believe that, as a result of how the search orders are drafted and executed \nthey will have captured a very large amount of information that is confidential, privileged, and not likely to be \nrelevant to these proceedings,\" Mr Williams said.\n\"The search orders will have captured material that is ... highly confidential to third parties including competitors of \nFortescue.\" As well, Mr William said he believed images taken of Dr Kolodziejczyk's phone would have captured \ndata including passwords for online banking and superannuation.\nAccording to a summary of Fortescue's arguments, staff became suspicious about the activities of the three men \nafter they realised Mr Masterman was working with Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen in September, that \nthey incorporated Element Zero, which was \"potentially developing technology that is similar to technology \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \ndeveloped for Fortescue\", and that Element Zero was \"seeking the supply of iron ore samples from Fortescue to \nhelp test (Element Zero's) technology\".\nA story published in the Australian Financial Review on January 17 kicked off their concerns.\n\"The AFR article set in train a line of inquiry at Fortescue, which involved reviewing the projects that Dr \nKolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen had been working on, and investigating their Fortescue email inboxes, group \nSharePoint folder and two laptops on suspicion of IP leakage,\" the summary read.\nAfter Dr Kolodziejczyk resigned in October 2021, he attended a meeting at which he was told he could not work at \nFortescue's office to finish his notice period. Dr Kolodziejczyk was told he could \"make copies and use documents \nhe needed\" to wrap up and that he should delete \"everything\" saved locally on his Fortescue laptop before he \nreturned it because the company had copies on SharePoint. He continued to work on patent applications for \nFortescue up until he left the company, court documents said.\nLoad-Date: July 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
