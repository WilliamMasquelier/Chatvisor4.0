It's a remarkable rise for the co-founder of the semiconductor company, who was ranked 128th with a net \nworth of $US13.5 billion as recently as early last year.\nNvidia surged 16 per cent to a record high on Thursday in New York, adding about $US277 billion in market value. \nThat was the biggest single-session increase in market history, beating Meta's $US197 billion gain earlier this \nmonth. The company was able to exceed sky-high investor expectations with a revenue forecast that was more \nthan $US2 billion ahead of analyst expectations.\nNvidia's rally boosted the fortunes of the 30 billionaires on Bloomberg's wealth list who attribute at least some of \ntheir wealth to AI by a combined $US42.8 billion. Charles Liang, CEO of Super Micro Computer, was the biggest \nwinner on a percentage basis with a 33 per cent jump.\nNvidia's outlook extends a streak of the company shattering expectations, thanks to insatiable demand for its \nartificial intelligence accelerators - highly prized chips that crunch data for AI models. The technology has helped \npower a proliferation of chatbots and other generative AI services, which can create text and graphics based on \nsimple prompts.\n\"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,\" Huang said. \"Demand is surging worldwide \nacross companies, industries and nations.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nAI chipmaker Nvidia CEO's wealth soars $15b in a day; Technology\nNvidia's market capitalisation has now increased by more than $US650 billion this year - bringing its valuation to \n$US1.89 trillion - as investors bet that the company will remain the prime beneficiary of an AI computing boom.\nThat turned Wednesday's report into a highly anticipated event for both Wall Street and the tech world. And the \nnumbers - along with the upbeat tone from Huang - renewed confidence that spending will stay strong.\n\"The entire market is watching this report and expectations have been elevated,\" Wolfe Research analyst Chris \nCaso said.\nGuidance was strong enough to \"demonstrate continued momentum, while also leaving room for continued upside \nthrough the second half.\"\nNvidia, co-founded by Huang in 1993, got its start as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. Its profile \nblew up in the last two years, when its technology proved adept at handling heavy AI workloads. The company's \nH100 accelerators have become legendary in the tech world, with customers scrambling to get their hands on as \nmany as possible.\nCompanies such as Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet's Google are Nvidia's largest customers, \naccounting for nearly 40 per cent of its revenue, as they rush to invest in hardware for AI computing.\nIn the US fiscal fourth quarter, which ended January 28, Nvidia's revenue more than tripled to $US22.1 billion. Profit \nexcluding certain items was $US5.16 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $US20.4 billion and earnings \nof $US4.60 a share. Underscoring the magnitude of its recent growth streak: As recently as 2021, Nvidia didn't \ngenerate that much revenue in an entire year.\nNvidia's data centre division, now by far its largest source of sales, generated $US18.4 billion of revenue, up 409 \nper cent from the same period a year earlier. Gaming chips provided $US2.87 billion of sales.\nNvidia is now working to spread its AI technology beyond the big data-centre companies. Huang, 61, has travelled \nthe globe arguing that governments and corporations need their own AI systems - both to protect their data and \ngain a competitive advantage.\nNvidia announced a deal with Cisco Systems earlier this month that gives it a new distribution channel. As part of \nthat deal, Cisco, the world's biggest provider of networking gear, will help sell complete AI systems to companies.\nBut Nvidia faces risks, including mounting competition and a push by some customers to develop their own AI \nchips.\n\"We're going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in the marketplace,\" Huang said. \nBloomberg\nLoad-Date: February 23, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Sydney Morning Herald\nAuthor: Vernal Galpotthawela, Jack Witzig, And Ian King\nDate: February 24, 2024\nTitle: AI chipmaker Nvidia CEO's wealth soars $15b in a day; Technology\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Working out staff rosters 'best left to AI'\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Joseph Lam\n### Date: February 29, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nWorking out staff rosters 'best left to AI'\nWorking out staff rosters 'best left to AI'\nThe Australian\nFebruary 29, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 17\nLength: 769 words\nByline: JOSEPH LAM\nBody\nAI is far better than managers at writing rosters - and it won't forget who's away, who can't work nights and to give \npart-timers a minimum of 12 hours a week.\nThe technology has for several months done just that for customers of Australian tech company Deputy, which \nprovides rostering and employment advice for more than a quarter of a million businesses in over half the world's \ncountries.\nThe technology was proving particularly good in hospitality settings, especially busy cafes that had high turnover, \nsaid Deepesh Banerji, who oversees the product as chief product officer.\n\"One of the most crushing things for employee engagement is having to work when you're busy or having to come \ninto work when you didn't know you had to,\" he said.\nAI Auto Scheduling is one of several products that Mr Banerji - as Deputy's resident AI chief - helped to shape, \nincluding a tool that can write job descriptions based on the data Deputy has about a business.\nThe 41-year-old, who studied maths and engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada, is one of dozens of \nexecutives across the country who have been tasked with managing one of the fastest-growing technologies in the \nworld.\nSometimes it can be hard to explain, Mr Banerji simply says: \"It's all about intelligent machines that are making \ndecisions, understanding information and recommending things.\" Mr Banerji said he tells friends the best way to \nunderstand the technology is to use it, and often recommends they try ChatGPT.\nThe technology had made several changes to the way the Deputy staff worked in recent years, with the company \nhaving developed its own large language model. \"Our knowledge bases have the ability to ask questions on our \ninternal internet,\" he said.\nPage 2 of 2\nWorking out staff rosters 'best left to AI'\nAs for his AI prediction for the year, Mr Banerji has a similar view to Seek AI chief Grant Wright - \"AI agents helping \nin the workplace,\" he said. Agents would not only schedule staff but make assessments of who might be the best at \na particular role, choosing who might work the register and who might be better on the floor selling clothes.\nAt big four bank ANZ, chief technology officer Tim Hogarth, who studied business information systems and \ninformation technology at the University of South Australia, holds the reins on AI.\nPrior to ANZ he worked as vice-president of innovation at TD bank in Canada and as head of application platform at \nCBA.\nWhile most financial institutions have major technology teams, Mr Hogarth said it was important to remember \"we're \na bank first\". He said: \"When people write code it's 'if this, then that' - it's deterministic. But there's a whole bunch of \nproblems we can't solve with 'if this, then that'.\n\"The way I explain it is I have both Taylor Swift and AC/DC in my playlist. You can't write rules to say 'this chief \ntechnical officer used to work in Canada, then play these songs'. But Spotify uses patterns and they discover music \nI like and overlap that with what other people like and it finds patterns between them.\" When it came to banking, he \nsaid: \"AI can essentially find trends and implement solutions faster than we can interpret them and write the code \nourselves.\" And in 2024, the technology is now brought several times a day. \"It has changed from being one of the \ntechnologies that was occasionally mentioned to every single conversation,\" he said.\nMr Hogarth said he believed Australia had not yet seen the full innovation AI would bring. \"We're at the bottom of \nthe S curve,\" he said.\nHe wants Australia to be at the forefront of the revolution rather than \"play catch-up\", and that could happen if \nAustralia didn't capitalise on the opportunity.\nUS multinational Cisco might have one of Australia's most senior AI executives, with 28-year veteran Carl Solder \nleading the charge.\nMr Solder is chief technology officer of ANZ, a role he took up after briefly leaving Cisco after spending several \nyears as vice-president of engineering, based in Silicon Valley in California.\n\"AI is software that intends to mimic human intelligence,\" Mr Solder said. \"A traditional computer program follows a \nset of fixed instructions to perform an outcome that's always the same. With AI, the outcome you'll get is going to be \na little bit more fluid.\" Last year Cisco conducted a global AI readiness that found just 5 per cent of Australian \ncustomers were ready to adopt AI. That same report found 59 per cent of respondents believed they had just 12 \nmonths to adopt AI, which leaves him to the conclusion that companies would race to adopt the technology either \nthrough off-the-shelf products from the company or going out creating their own AI product.\nLoad-Date: February 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Joseph Lam\nDate: February 29, 2024\nTitle: Working out staff rosters 'best left to AI'\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Chinese push to delete US technology\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Liza Lin\n### Date: March 09, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 4\nChinese push to delete US technology\nChinese push to delete US technology\nThe Australian\nMarch 9, 2024 Saturday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: WSJ; Pg. 32\nLength: 1661 words\nByline: LIZA LIN\nBody\nBeiling's buy-local policy has hit US tech giants hard For American tech companies in China, the writing is on the \nwall. It's also on paper, in Document 79.\nThe 2022 Chinese government directive expands a drive that is muscling US technology out of the country - an \neffort some refer to as \"Delete A\", for Delete America.\nDocument 79 was so sensitive that high-ranking officials and executives were only shown the order and weren't \nallowed to make copies, sources say. It requires state-owned companies in finance, energy and other sectors to \nreplace foreign software in their IT systems by 2027.\nAmerican tech giants had long thrived in China as they hot-wired the country's meteoric industrial rise with \ncomputers, operating systems and software. Chinese leaders want to sever that relationship, driven by a push for \nself-sufficiency and concerns over the country's long-term security.\nThe first targets were hardware makers. Dell, IBM and Cisco Systems have gradually seen much of their \nequipment replaced by products from Chinese competitors.\nDocument 79, named for the numbering on the paper, targets companies that provide the software enabling daily \nbusiness operations from basic office tools to supply chain management. The likes of Microsoft and Oracle are \nlosing ground in the field, one of the last bastions of foreign tech profitability in the country.\nThe effort is just one salvo in a year-long push by Chinese leader Xi Jinping for self-sufficiency in everything from \ncritical technology such as semiconductors and fighter jets to the production of grain and oilseeds. The broader \nstrategy is to make China less dependent on the West for food, raw materials and energy, and instead focus on \ndomestic supply chains.\nOfficials in Beijing issued Document 79 in September 2022, as the US was ratcheting up chip export restrictions \nand sanctions on Chinese tech companies. It requires state-owned firms to provide quarterly updates on their \nPage 2 of 4\nChinese push to delete US technology\nprogress in replacing foreign software used for email, human resources and business manage-ment with Chinese \nalternatives.\nThe directive came down from the agency overseeing the country's massive state-owned enterprise sector - a \ngroup that includes more than 60 of China's 100 largest listed companies.\nThat agency, the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, and the country's national \ncabinet, the State Council, didn't respond to requests for comment.\nSpending by China's state sector topped 48 trillion yuan ($10 trillion) in 2022. The directive leverages that \npurchasing power to support Chinese tech companies, which in turn can improve their products and narrow the \ntechnology gap with US rivals.\nState firms have ramped up their buying of domestic brands, even if the Chinese substitutes sometimes aren't as \ngood. The buyers include banks, financial brokerages and public services such as the postal system.\nBack in 2006, \"China was the land of milk and honey, and intellectual property was the main challenge\", says a \nformer US Trade Representative official involved in previous technology discussions with the Chinese. \"Now, there \nis a feeling that the sense of opportunity is off. Companies are merely hanging on.\" The push to localise tech is \nknown as Xinchuang, loosely translated as \"IT innovation\" with a reference to technology that is secure and \ntrustworthy. The policy has gained urgency amid an escalating tech and trade war with Washington, which has cut \nmany Chinese entities off from American technologies.\nPremier Li Qiang reiterated the push during China's annual legislative sessions this week. China's central \ngovernment plans to increase its spending on science and technology by 10 per cent to about $US51bn ($77bn) \nthis year, according to a budget report released on Tuesday - up from a 2 per cent increase last year.\nAt some trade fairs across the country, vendors tout homegrown tech as an alternative to foreign brands. One \nsemiconductor equipment maker stall in Nanjing put it bluntly, offering to help buyers \"Delete A\" from their supply \nchain.\nDomestic alternatives are growing more user-friendly. A local official recalled how in 2016, it took a whole day to \nopen and close a spreadsheet on a computer with an operating system known as KylinOS, developed by a Chinese \nmilitary-linked company. He compares the usability of the latest KylinOS version to Microsoft's Windows 7, \nintroduced in 2009 - workable if not great.\nAs recently as six years ago, most government tenders sought hardware, chips and software from Western brands. \nBy 2023, many were seeking Chinese tech products instead. When the customs department in the eastern Chinese \ncity of Ningbo sought to purchase rack servers in 2018, it stated a preference for brands such as Dell and Hewlett \nPackard Enterprise, and for hardware powered by Intel's Xeon central processing units. Five years later, the same \nagency asked for rack servers made by Chinese companies and equipped with Huawei chips.\nThese servers are typically assembled by state-owned tech manufacturers that barely sell equipment overseas, \nsuch as Beijing-based Tsinghua Tongfang. Tongfang's controlling shareholder is a state-owned company in charge \nof China's civilian and military nuclear programs.\nSome government officials in China's capital had their foreign-branded PCs replaced with those made by Tongfang \nand officials last year were told to use Chinese phones instead of Apple's iPhones for work.\nOver the past decade, Xi has repeatedly emphasised technological innovation and the use of trusted homegrown \ntechnology in government departments and industry. Revelations by former National Security Agency contractor \nEdward Snowden in 2013 that US authorities had hacked into Chinese mobile phone communications, universities \nand private companies strengthened Xi's resolve. More recently, he has told senior officials that China should \nleverage its strengths and market to break bottlenecks in the development of essential software such as operating \nsystems.Page 3 of 4\nChinese push to delete US technology\nAs China focused on replacing hardware, IBM's China revenues have steadily declined. It downsized its China \nresearch operations in Beijing in 2021, more than two decades after it opened.\nCisco, once a technology powerhouse in China, said in 2019 that it was losing orders in the country to local \nvendors. PC maker Dell's market share in China has almost halved in the past five years, to 8 per cent. Hewlett \nPackard Enterprise, which makes servers, storage and networks, got 14.1 per cent of its revenue from China in \n2018, according to estimates from FactSet. By 2023, that had fallen to 4 per cent.\nIn May, HPE said it would sell its 49 per cent stake in its Chinese joint venture. The company continues to sell direct \nto multinational customers in China and sells selected products to the broader mainland market through its Chinese \npartner.\nIn software, Adobe, Citrix parent Cloud Software Group and Salesforce have pulled out or downsized direct \noperations in the country over the past two years.\nMicrosoft, the world's biggest software provider, historically dominated computer operating systems in China. A \nMorgan Stanley poll of 135 chief information officers in China found that many expected the share of computers \npowered by Microsoft's Windows operating system installed in their companies to fall over the next three years. \nThey expected Linux-based UOS, or Unity Operating System, an effort co-led by a state-owned company, to gain in \nthe shift. Even as Microsoft's top executives and co-founder Bill Gates have frequently travelled to Beijing for high-\nprofile meetings with Chinese leaders on subjects like co-operation on AI and US-China trade relations in recent \nyears, the company has decreased its offerings in China. Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a subcommittee \nhearing last September that China made up just 1.5 per cent of its overall sales.",
