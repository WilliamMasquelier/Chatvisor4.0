Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Ramelius Resources based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Ramelius Resources is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Ramelius Resources.\n\nIf Ramelius Resources is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nBattle for relevance a key driver for more gold mining deals - DATA ROOM\nBattle for relevance a key driver for more gold mining deals - DATA ROOM\nThe Australian\nAugust 7, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 339 words\nByline: EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER\nBody\nGroups that mine more than 400,000 ounces of gold annually are more likely to get attention from investors \nallocating a shrinking pool of funds to listed Australian stocks in the sector, says Westgold Resources boss Wayne \nBramwell.\nThe managing director of the $1.3bn Westgold said the concept of remaining relevant was top of mind for chief \nexecutives of mid-tier gold miners on the Australian Securities Exchange, and it would likely drive mergers and \nacquisitions in the space.\n\"Capital markets are shrinking in certain areas, so it is not just about being profitable but relevant,\" he said.\nMr Bramwell said being relevant meant mining at least 400,000 ounces of gold a year.\n\"Under that space, you may be interesting, but less relevant to a broader audience,\" he said.\nHis comments at the Diggers and Dealers conference in Kalgoorlie come after Mr Bramwell struck a $2.2bn deal to \nmerge with the Canadian-listed Karora.\n\"Now we have moved above that space, we are more relevant to a broader audience,\" he said.\nRival ASX miner Ramelius Resources, which was also in earlier talks to buy Karora, lobbed an objection to the \nTakeovers Panel about the deal.\nThe process exposed mergers and acquisition talks between the Mark Zeptner-led Ramelius and Westgold late \nlast year that involved standstill terms between the pair.\nRamelius owns two production and processing hubs at Mt Magnet and Edna May, both in Western Australia, and is \ndeveloping its Rebecca and Cue Gold Projects.\nMr Bramwell confirmed there were talks late last year with Ramelius, which were likely to be similar to what the \ncompany had with Karora. However, he ruled out any further M&A with Ramelius or any other player.\nPage 2 of 2\nBattle for relevance a key driver for more gold mining deals - DATA ROOM\n\"We have to just focus on what we have now,\" he said.\n\"This is a big jump for us, and we have doubled the size of the business overnight and so the expectation on the \nbusiness is very high.\" Westgold mines in the Murchison and Southern Goldfields regions of WA has a tenure of \nmore than 3200sq km, operating six underground mines and five processing plants.\nLoad-Date: August 6, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Ramelius Resources.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
