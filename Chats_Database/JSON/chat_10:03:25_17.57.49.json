It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nBig solar farm for Fortescue operation\nBig solar farm for Fortescue operation\nThe Australian\nDecember 4, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 510 words\nByline: BRAD THOMPSON\nBody\nFortescue says it will build all of renewable energy assets needed to decarbonise the company's iron ore \noperations in Western Australia on its own tenements over the next five years and is about to start work on a 190 \nmegawatt solar farm at the Cloudbreak mine.\nThe Cloudbreak project is almost double the size of the only other solar farm built by Fortescue, with work \nexpected to start before the end of March.\nIt is understood Fortescue has a number of renewables projects in the pipeline awaiting final investment decisions. \nThe Andrew Forrest-led Fortescue estimates it will need an additional 2-3GW of renewable energy and battery \nstorage under plans to stop using diesel and gas by 2030.\nIt has been unclear how Fortescue intends to reach the renewable energy target in the timeframe required, given \nland access and permitting issues in WA.\nFortescue applied for miscellaneous tenements covering about 150,000ha near its mining operations last year. \nThose applications remain pending, meaning Fortescue is yet to secure the tenements on a basis that would allow \nit to develop renewables projects under WA's Mining Act.\nThe tenement applications came hot on the heels of Fortescue quietly scrapping plans for a multibillion-dollar wind \nand solar farm that had been a key plank of the decarbonisation plan.\nFortescue chief operating officer Shelley Robertson said on Tuesday that the company would build all of the \nrenewable capacity required under its own steam on its tenements.\n\"It will all be up and running by 2030,\" she said. \"We're building about 2.5GW in solar and wind in the Pilbara, and \nalso having batteries to support the downtime there. And we'll be looking at different ways to operate around that \nnew renewable energy system that we're installing.\" Ms Robertson said expenditure on the wind and solar farms \nwould come from the $US6.2bn ($9.6bn) set aside to reach the decarbonisation target.\nPage 2 of 2\nBig solar farm for Fortescue operation\nThe project abandoned last year - known as Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub - involved building more than 300 wind \nturbines and a solar farm with a capacity of up to 5.4GW on cattle stations a south of Onslow in the Pilbara. The \nconstruction work was estimated to take seven years.\nFortescue has built one 100MW solar farm, known as North Star Junction, near its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite \noperations.\nThe 150,000ha tenement package understood to figure in its broader renewable plans is mostly covered by land-\nuse agreements with the Nyamal and Pakyka traditional owner groups.\nFortescue intends to use renewable energy to charge its electric mining machinery. The company received $10m \nfrom the taxpayer-funded Australian Renewable Energy Agency on Tuesday to develop a 6MW fast charger test \nunit for its future mining fleet.\nMr Forrest said at the Fortescue annual general meeting last month that the company wanted help in the form of \napprovals and infrastructure to reach its \"real-zero\" decarbonisation target. Mr Forrest said substantial land was \nrequired for solar and wind farms but traditional owners and other stakeholders were keen to become involved.\nLoad-Date: December 3, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
