Orsted is a major player in the sector and is set to build an \u00a38bn offshore \nwind farm in the North Sea by the end of 2027 to power more than 3.3m UK homes.\nGraphic\n \nBlow: Orsted is the largest offshore wind developer\nLoad-Date: August 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nBased on the content of the article, choose the most appropriate category from the following list: ['Financial Challenges and Strategic Adjustments', 'Offshore Wind Project Developments and Setbacks', 'Leadership Changes and Corporate Restructuring', 'Market Exits, Divestments, and Investments', 'Technological Innovations and Sustainability Initiatives', 'Regulatory and Legal Challenges', 'Human Resources and Workforce Initiatives', 'Shifts in Renewable Energy Strategy']\nYour output should solely be the name of the category chosen and nothing else.\n            ",
