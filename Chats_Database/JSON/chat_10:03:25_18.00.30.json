It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nPearson joins Fortescue board\nPearson joins Fortescue board\nAustralian Financial Review\nAugust 2, 2024 Friday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 15\nLength: 537 words\nByline: Tom McIlroy and Elouise Fowler\nBody\nRespected Indigenous leader Noel Pearson has joined the board of Andrew Forrest's Fortescue, describing the \niron ore miner as a company with proud Australian values.\nThe Cape York Partnership founder and prominent campaigner for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander \nadvancement has kept a low profile since the defeat of the Voice to parliament referendum in October.\nDr Forrest said he had deep respect for Mr Pearson, a lawyer and land rights campaigner, and a co-architect of the \nUluru Statement from the Heart who led the Yes campaign for the Voice. \"I have known and worked alongside Noel \nfor nearly 20 years and admire and respect him greatly,\" Dr Forrest said.\n\"Noel is an innovative thinker and a passionate and formidable Australian who will bring enormous benefit and \ninsight to our board.\n\"Fortescue is fortunate to have a diverse and global board of directors who bring different perspective and ideas, \nensuring we remain one of Australia's top-performing companies.\"\nMr Pearson said he looked forward to making a contribution to the \"diverse, progressive and successful business\". \n\"Fortescue is a proud Australian company that is led by its values from mine site to boardroom - something I have \ngreat respect for,\" he said in a statement.\nMr Pearson is respected by both sides of federal politics, and has worked closely with prime ministers dating back \nto Paul Keating.\nHis agenda - which has sometimes put him at odds with progressive figures in Indigenous and national politics - has \nincluded advocacy on land rights, Indigenous self-determination, boosting employment to cut welfare dependency, \nimproving education, parental responsibility and tackling substance abuse.\nMr Pearson withdrew from public view after voters rejected an Indigenous Voice to federal parliament at last year's \nreferendum.\nPage 2 of 2\nPearson joins Fortescue board\nHis Fortescue appointment comes as native titleholders, the Yindjibarndi people, are at the pointy end of a 15-year \nlegal war with the company over compensation for mining on their land in Western Australia. In 2019, five Federal \nCourt judges unanimously backed an earlier ruling by judge Steven Rares that granted exclusive native title over \n2700 square kilometres to the Yindjibarndi, and effectively recognised them as private owners with a spiritual \nconnection that allowed them to decide who came onto the land.\nBut Fortescue has never struck a compensation agreement with the Yindjibarndi people, nor received permission \nfrom the native title owners to mine their land, despite a decade of mining the steel-making commodity in north-west \nWA. Last month, it abandoned a target for the production of 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 after \nmaking headlines on the subject for nearly six years.\nDuring this time, Fortescue has experienced high turnover in its executive ranks. The executive in charge of \nFortescue's fledgling iron ore operations in Gabon, Julie Shuttleworth, left the company in June, adding to the \ngrowing list of senior executives who have left the company recently.\nGreen energy division chief financial officer Deborah Caudle quit the company in January after less than five \nmonths as part of what Fortescue described as a restructuring.\nMr Pearson did not respond to a request for comment.\nLoad-Date: August 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
