Some sidestep the event, instead using the build-up as an \nopportunity to schedule meetings in Perth, but it still attracts over 2000 delegates.\nLithium miners stole the show last year. Producers of the battery material were in favour because of the expected \nramp-up in electric vehicle manufacturing. But the lithium price has come off the boil while gold is striking record \nhighs.\n\"If you went back last year or the year before, what was remarkable was lithium, which had been a small \ncommodity, had really come to dominate the proceedings at Diggers and Dealers,\" Morgan says.\n\"The Australian-dollar gold price is high, and lithium and nickel are having a tough time of it and not likely to be as \nfocused on growth. Nickel and lithium are battening down the hatches.\" Domestic gold production growth has \nslowed over the past decade as mines approach the end of their productive lives, says IBISWorld, but it's set to \nreturn to growth as project expansions come online, capitalising on the weaker Australian dollar.\nThe industry's annual revenue is about $27.9bn and growing at a rate of 4.4 per cent as the metal continues to act \nas an inflation hedge and benefits from central bank purchases.\nAustralia is the third-largest producer globally with 293.8 tonnes in 2023, behind China and Russia, according to the \nWorld Gold Council.\nLithium miners dominated the mergers and acquisitions landscape in the resources industry last year, with \nAlbemarle bidding for Liontown Resources (it later abandoned the deal), SQM acquiring Azure Minerals, Chalice \nMining looking for a backer and speculation about a move on Patriot Battery Metals by Pilbara Minerals, which was \nsitting on a $3bn cash pile. But investment bankers have turned their attention to gold.\nHeading into Diggers and Dealers, there has been talk Regis and Gold Road Resources might merge. Ramelius \nResources is also in focus with an 8.9 per cent stake in Spartan Resources, West Gold and Ramelius have held \ntakeover talks and there's the perennial takeover target De Grey Mining.\nGenesis Minerals boss Raleigh Finlayson has emphasised his focus is on operations rather than deals, but the \ncompany is surrounded by consolidation opportunities in Western Australia's Leonora gold district, while it's \nexpected Northern Star will return to deal making to gain further scale after the country's largest gold miner \nNewcrest was taken over by Newmont.\nDriving M&A, Bramwell says, will be producers with cash. \"This is a time when the producers are cashed-up and \nthe explorers and the people in the middle are cash-strapped.\" Also of interest this year will be uranium miners like \nBoss Energy and Paladin, as the fuel remains at the centre of the energy debate and demand grows, with a lack of \nsupply to the West from Russia. \"There's a lot of enthusiasm towards the sector. Its prospects are still high and \nhave not dimmed as much as lithium or nickel or rare earths have,\" Morgan says. Another positive for gold could be \nnickel producers such as BHP mothballing projects, making workers available.\nLoad-Date: August 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Gold shines again at Diggers and Dealers but developers are struggling - DATA ROOM\n## The Australian\n### Bridget Carter\n### August 05, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Ramelius Resources, to report.

Ramelius Resources is currently in the spotlight due to its 8.9% stake in Spartan Resources, indicating its strategic positioning within the gold sector amidst ongoing consolidation discussions in Western Australia.\n\n2. The company has been involved in takeover talks with Westgold Resources, highlighting its active role in the mergers and acquisitions landscape as producers with cash look to expand their portfolios.\n\n3. Despite the favorable conditions for gold producers, Ramelius Resources, like many developers, faces challenges in transitioning projects into production, reflecting the broader difficulties within the industry for single mine project developers.\n\n4. The overall sentiment at the Diggers and Dealers Conference suggests that while gold is regaining investor interest, the path to production remains fraught with challenges, which could impact Ramelius Resources' operational strategies moving forward.",
