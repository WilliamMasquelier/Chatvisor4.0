Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| William Arkrwight | Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'Engie Green | \"Cette int\u00e9gration participe \u00e0 notre ambition de contribuer activement au d\u00e9veloppement des \u00e9nergies renouvelables en France.\" | \"This integration contributes to our ambition to actively participate in the development of renewable energies in France.\" |\n| Kieran White | Senior vice-pr\u00e9sident \u00d8rsted Europe | \"Nous avons r\u00e9vis\u00e9 nos ambitions \u00e0 horizon 2030, en mettant l'accent l\u00e0 o\u00f9 nous pensons pouvoir d\u00e9gager le plus de valeur pour \u00d8rsted.\" | \"We have revised our ambitions for 2030, focusing on where we believe we can create the most value for \u00d8rsted.\" |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Orsted.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Orsted or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
