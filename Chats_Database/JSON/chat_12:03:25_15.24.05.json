The world's second-largest oil and gas company and largest LNG producer \\nannounced it was watering down its climate targets, its chief executive Wael Sawan fretting to Reuters that it was \\n\\\"perilous\\\" for Shell to set 2035 emission reduction targets because, \\\"there is too much uncertainty at the moment in \\nthe energy transition trajectory\\\".\\nVoicing his confidence that fossils would remain integral to the global energy mix in the longer-term Sawan added \\nthat, \\\"there is going to be a multidimensional energy system in the future, [and] oil and gas will continue to have an \\nimportant role in stabilising that system for a long, long, long time to come\\\".\\nLink to Image\\nJamila Toderas\\n\\\"We are trying to focus our company, our organisation, and our shareholders on a waypoint that's much clearer ... \\nwhich is 2030,\\\" Sawan said. He also announced a reduction in the company's 2030 targets.\\nIn 2020, as oil prices plunged towards zero, BP was at the forefront of a push by the oil and gas majors to remake \\nthemselves as \\\"diversified energy\\\" companies and drive faster into a renewable future.\\nIts then chief executive Bernard Looney announced that the company would not only reach net zero by 2050, but \\nthat it would actively lobby for international carbon taxes.\\nBut a lot has changed since then. Looney was moved on, fairly unceremoniously, by his board in September 2023.\\nMore significantly, Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022, effectively knocking the second-largest fossil \\nfuel exporter on earth out of the West's oil and gas market. By 2022 crude oil prices had surged to more than \\nUS$120 ($184) a barrel, and it remains healthily above $80 a barrel today.\\nIn February last year, BP backtracked. During a quarterly earnings report BP announced that it had made a record \\nprofit of US$27.7 billion over the previous year, more than double its 2021 profit, and that it was reducing its goals \\nto cut oil production.\\nPage 2 of 4\\nAfter years of promises on climate change, oil giants are backtracking\\nIn March last year, ExxonMobil abandoned its research to create low emissions fuel from algae. Since 2009 the \\ncompany had spent US$350 million on the effort, which it had used extensively in marketing to burnish its green \\ncredentials.\\n\\\"The dirty secret nobody talks about is how much all this is going to cost and who's willing to pay for it,\\\"  chief \\nexecutive Darren Woods told Fortune last month of the world's quest to decarbonise. \\\"The people who are \\ngenerating those emissions need to be aware of and pay the price for generating those emissions. That is ultimately \\nhow you solve the problem.\\\"\\nThat might be the case, but climate observers were unimpressed, particularly because ExxonMobil was already \\ninfamous for doing accurate cutting edge early research into climate change, only to downplay the science publicly.\\n\\\"It's like a drug lord blaming everyone but himself for drug problems,\\\" Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at \\nColumbia Business School, told The Guardian.\\nThen, as though to clarify the fossil sector's position, or perhaps to take its gloves off, the chief executive of the \\nbiggest of them all, Saudi Aramco, spoke even more bluntly during a panel discussion at a global energy \\nconference in Texas earlier this month.\\n\\\"We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas,\\\" Amin Nasser said, to applause from the audience.\\n\\\"A transition strategy reset is urgently needed, and my proposal is this: We should abandon the fantasy of phasing \\nout oil and gas and instead invest in them adequately reflecting realistic demand assumptions.\\\"\\nNasser spoke of \\\"hard realities\\\" and said that \\\"in the real world, the current transition strategy is visibly failing on \\nmost fronts\\\". He said alternative energy sources had failed to displace hydrocarbons at scale, noting that oil \\ndemand had increased by 100 million barrels of oil equivalent a day this century and would reach an all-time high \\nthis year.\\nThe increasing energy needs of developing nations would see demand remain high, and grow until 2045, he said.\\n\\\"We should phase in new energy sources and technologies when they are genuinely ready, economically \\ncompetitive and with the right infrastructure,\\\" Nasser said.\\n\\\"All this strengthens the view that peak oil and gas is unlikely for some time to come, let alone 2030,\\\" he said. \\\"No \\none is betting the farm on that.\\\"\\nFor governments and policy-makers the problem with Nasser's real world is it conflicts with the other one, which \\nhas just sweltered through its hottest year in history due to carbon dioxide emissions, 70 per cent of which come \\nfrom the burning of fossil fuels.\\nIn this real world, global leaders gathered in Dubai in December for climate talks and after two weeks of hard fought \\nnegotiations agreed to begin \\\"transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable \\nmanner ... so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science\\\".\\nThe language was significant because fossil fuels have never before been explicitly referred to in a declaration of \\nthe UN climate talks, but talk of \\\"transitioning away\\\" fell far short of the language that around 130 of the 198 \\ncountries represented at the talks had called for. Those countries wanted fossil fuel companies and their invested \\nto be put on notice with an agreement to \\\"phase out\\\" oil and gas.\\nLink to Image\\nIISD\\n\\\"We have made an incremental advancement over business as usual when what we really needed is an \\nexponential step change in our actions,\\\" said Anne Rasmussen from Samoa, the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Page 3 of 4\\nAfter years of promises on climate change, oil giants are backtracking\\nSmall Islands States, to a standing ovation on the floor of the plenary session. \\\"It is not enough for us to reference \\nthe science and then make agreements that ignore what the science is telling us we need to do.\\\"\\nThe US climate envoy, John Kerry, who pushed hard to secure the compromise, was more upbeat. \\\"For the very \\nfirst time at a COP, fossil fuels have been on the table as a major part of our negotiations,\\\" he said. \\\"And the \\ndecision that came out of this clearly embraces transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, so as to \\nachieve net zero by 2050.\\\"\\nNasser's position also contradicts that of the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organisation that \\nhas traditionally been closely identified with the fossil fuel industry.\\nMore recently in its analysis the IEA has been blunt about the need for the world to transition, and about its capacity \\nto do so.\\nIn its annual World Energy Outlook report last year the IEA predicted that fossil fuel demand would peak by 2030, \\nbefore entering a plateau and slow decline.\\n\\\"The transition to clean energy is happening worldwide, and it's unstoppable,\\\" IEA chief Fatih Birol said in a \\nstatement at the time. \\\"Claims that oil and gas represent safe or secure choices for the world's energy and climate \\nfuture look weaker than ever.\\\"\\nAs the IEA's position on fossils has drifted from that of the industry, criticism of it has ramped up. In Dubai the \\nOPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais  accused Birol of \\\"unjustly vilifying\\\" the industry as being behind the \\nclimate crisis.\\nBut the IEA's analysis of the industry remains world leading, and its data suggest that whatever the fossil majors \\nare saying about long-term demand, their shareholders might not hold the same confidence.\\nAn IEA report on energy investment showed a significant decline in the amount of cash the industry was reinvesting \\nin its production. Between 2008 and 2017 the figure hovered between 80 and 100 per cent, then it declines. Last \\nyear the sector ploughed just 50 per cent of its cash back into the business, with the rest being doled out to \\nshareholders.\\n\\\"Uncertainties over longer-term demand, worries about costs, and pressure from many investors and owners to \\nfocus on returns rather than production growth mean only large Middle Eastern national oil companies are \\nspending much more in 2023 than they did in 2022, and they are the only subset of the industry spending more \\nthan pre-pandemic levels,\\\" read the IEA's analysis.\\nThis is significant because the energy industry typically outlays vast amounts of capital exploiting a resource - say a \\nnew oil or gas field - and then uses the bulk of the return to develop the next one. Now it appears shareholders are \\ndemanding more of the cash is diverted to them rather than reinvested in future production.\\n\\\"It looks like an industry that is enjoying a very profitable but ultimately terminal decline,\\\" says the energy analyst \\nTim Buckley, an advocate of renewables.\\n\\\"We are still addicted to fossil fuels, we can't stop overnight, but we are stopping,\\\" he says.\\nIt also brings us back to those climate talks in Dubai. When the deal was struck the COP28 president Sultan Ahmed \\nal-Jaber, himself an oil executive, celebrated it as historic, but added that it would be judged on its \\nimplementation.\\\"We are what we do, not what we say,\\\" he told the crowded final session of the summit.\\nGet to the heart of what's happening with climate change and the environment.

Limited All Rights Reserved\\nLength: 1207 words\\nHighlight: The oil super majors are eyeing shifting their primary stock exchange listings to New York as a stronger \\npush to reduce fossil fuels in their home markets weighs on their share prices.\\nBody\\nThere's a yawning gap between the valuations of US oil and gas majors and their UK and European counterparts. \\nThat's prompted a debate over whether the more lowly rated energy giants should switch their primary stock \\nexchange listing to New York.\\nThe discussion was given a sharper edge late last month when the chief executive of France's Total Energies, \\nPatrick Pouyann\\u00e9, said the century-old super major, founded by the French government, was seriously considering \\na shift of its listing, albeit not its headquarters.\\nShell, which shifted its headquarters from The Hague and unwound its dual listing to base itself and its shares in \\nLondon in 2022, is known to have also seriously pondered a shift in its primary listing three years ago.\\nBP has said a move is not on its agenda but would inevitably have done some analysis on it. There's also been \\nspeculation that its relatively low sharemarket valuation could make it a target for one of the more highly rated oil \\ngiants, which could effectively produce a transfer of its listing.\\nThe driver of the discussion is a significant disparity in the sharemarket valuations of European and UK energy \\ncompanies relative to their US counterparts like Exxon and Chevron, which trade on cashflow multiples up to 50 per \\ncent higher than their transatlantic rivals.\\nNot only does that make their shareholders happier, but it lowers the US majors' cost of equity, enables them to \\ninvest more productively and makes acquisitions more attractive. Exxon bought Pioneer Natural Resources for \\n$US60 billion ($91 billion) last year, while Chevron announced an agreed all-share $US53 billion for Hess Corp.\\nThe smaller strand in the explanation for the varying valuations relates to the markets themselves.\\nThe New York stock market is much bigger and deeper than London and the fragmented European exchanges and \\nis supported by a far larger pool of institutional and retail investors. Historically, that has produced higher valuations \\nrelative to European peer companies.\\nWith the US being the world's largest producer and exporter of oil and gas, there is also stronger interest in the \\nsector there and better support from US and international investors.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nIt's not easy being green for UK and European oil giants\\nWhile the market dynamics have seen some UK and European companies, particularly (but not exclusively) tech \\nand biotech companies, shift their listings to the US, they are not the primary reason energy companies have \\nconsidered the move.\\nNor is the post-Brexit decline in the status of London's market a major factor, although what was once the global \\nhub for resources investment has been fading as some of its larger listings, like BHP's UK listing, have disappeared \\nor - as will happen if BHP succeeds with its Anglo-American bid -- London-listed miners have been acquired.\\nThe US companies are pursuing growth strategies. Their trans-Atlantic competitors aren't.\\nThe more material influence on the oil majors' valuations than the nature of their domestic markets is the extent to \\nwhich policymakers and investors in the UK and Europe have responded to climate change and the way that has, \\nand is, shaping the growth strategies of companies like TotalEnergies, Shell and BP.\\nExxon and Chevron are aggressively growing their oil and gas production volumes and investing in increasing their \\noutput even as, across the Atlantic, TotalEnergies, Shell and BP are pursuing carbon emissions reduction-related \\nstrategies that will eventually see their volumes decline.\\nThe US companies are pursuing growth strategies. Their transatlantic competitors aren't.\\nShell and BP have received significant criticism recently for slowing the rate at which their fossil fuel volumes are \\nscheduled to fall.\\nBP, for instance, had a 2020 plan to cut its oil and gas production by 40 per cent by 2030 from 2019. Last year, the \\ntarget was shifted to 25 per cent by 2030, with the 35 to 40 per cent target for its own carbon emissions revised to \\nbetween 20 and 30 per cent.\\nShell, which had said it would reduce its output by 1 or 2 per cent a year through to the end of the decade, last year \\nrestated its plan.\\nIt now expects flat volumes through to 2030 and, where it had planned to reduce investment in oil and gas and \\nincrease its spending on low-carbon products, it will now invest $US40 billion in oil and gas by 2035, against the \\n$US10 to $US15 billion it will spend in those low-carbon products.\\nThe backlash against BP and Shell was strong because European and UK fund managers, retail investors and their \\ngovernments are far more committed to environmental, social and governance policies than most US fund \\nmanagers and other investors.\\nIn the US, where President Joe Biden has presided over a massive increase in US oil and gas production and \\nDonald Trump is promising to \\\"drill, baby, drill\\\" if he regains the presidency, there has recently been something of a \\nbacklash against ESG investment policies.\\nThe stronger emissions reduction frameworks in Europe and the UK (and successful legal actions by environmental \\nactivists) have forced their oil and gas companies to pursue strategies that have resulted in them constraining their \\noil and gas investment and production while building a presence in greener technologies and fuels.\\nFrom the companies' perspective - and that of prospective investors less concerned about fossil fuels - the pressure \\nto reduce their oil and gas production and invest in renewables and hydrogen will deliver lower returns than the \\nmore aggressively pro-fossil fuel strategies pursued by Exxon and Chevron.\\nWhen BP unveiled its new timetable for responding to climate change, it said that it generated returns on \\ninvestment of 15 to 20 per cent from its fossil fuel projects. The returns from bioenergy were about 15 per cent, but \\nthey were only 6 to 8 per cent from renewables like solar and wind. It's not surprising that it decided to invest more \\nin oil and gas and biofuels than in renewables.Page 3 of 3\\nIt's not easy being green for UK and European oil giants\\nThere's a relatively recent view among the majors, one that arguably was held earlier and more strongly by the US \\ncompanies, that the transition to cleaner energy is going to take longer and, if it is to be relatively smooth, will \\nrequire more investment in fossil fuels to maintain energy supply than was once projected.\\nThat view doesn't sit well with ESG-sensitive European or British investors. At the same time, the significant and \\nstill-growing presence of lower-returning assets in their portfolios and the absence of the production growth \\nstrategies of Exxon and Chevron deter those investors less fussed about investing in fossil fuels.\\nTotalEnergies, which has far more US investors than Europeans and whose biggest exposure to oil and gas is in \\nthe US, has less of a discount relative to Exxon and Chevron than the UK companies. But it believes that, if it were \\nvalued in line with them, there would be a very substantial uplift.\\nBut as a French national champion, TotalEnergies would face significant obstacles to moving its listing - as might \\nShell and BP - from governments determined to retain their flagship companies, retain their corporate offices and \\nmaintain the size and relevance of their equity markets.\\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

Limited All Rights Reserved\\nLength: 1207 words\\nHighlight: The oil super majors are eyeing shifting their primary stock exchange listings to New York as a stronger \\npush to reduce fossil fuels in their home markets weighs on their share prices.\\nBody\\nThere's a yawning gap between the valuations of US oil and gas majors and their UK and European counterparts. \\nThat's prompted a debate over whether the more lowly rated energy giants should switch their primary stock \\nexchange listing to New York.\\nThe discussion was given a sharper edge late last month when the chief executive of France's Total Energies, \\nPatrick Pouyann\\u00e9, said the century-old super major, founded by the French government, was seriously considering \\na shift of its listing, albeit not its headquarters.\\nShell, which shifted its headquarters from The Hague and unwound its dual listing to base itself and its shares in \\nLondon in 2022, is known to have also seriously pondered a shift in its primary listing three years ago.\\nBP has said a move is not on its agenda but would inevitably have done some analysis on it. There's also been \\nspeculation that its relatively low sharemarket valuation could make it a target for one of the more highly rated oil \\ngiants, which could effectively produce a transfer of its listing.\\nThe driver of the discussion is a significant disparity in the sharemarket valuations of European and UK energy \\ncompanies relative to their US counterparts like Exxon and Chevron, which trade on cashflow multiples up to 50 per \\ncent higher than their transatlantic rivals.\\nNot only does that make their shareholders happier, but it lowers the US majors' cost of equity, enables them to \\ninvest more productively and makes acquisitions more attractive. Exxon bought Pioneer Natural Resources for \\n$US60 billion ($91 billion) last year, while Chevron announced an agreed all-share $US53 billion for Hess Corp.\\nThe smaller strand in the explanation for the varying valuations relates to the markets themselves.\\nThe New York stock market is much bigger and deeper than London and the fragmented European exchanges and \\nis supported by a far larger pool of institutional and retail investors. Historically, that has produced higher valuations \\nrelative to European peer companies.\\nWith the US being the world's largest producer and exporter of oil and gas, there is also stronger interest in the \\nsector there and better support from US and international investors.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nIt's not easy being green for UK and European oil giants\\nWhile the market dynamics have seen some UK and European companies, particularly (but not exclusively) tech \\nand biotech companies, shift their listings to the US, they are not the primary reason energy companies have \\nconsidered the move.\\nNor is the post-Brexit decline in the status of London's market a major factor, although what was once the global \\nhub for resources investment has been fading as some of its larger listings, like BHP's UK listing, have disappeared \\nor - as will happen if BHP succeeds with its Anglo-American bid -- London-listed miners have been acquired.\\nThe US companies are pursuing growth strategies. Their trans-Atlantic competitors aren't.\\nThe more material influence on the oil majors' valuations than the nature of their domestic markets is the extent to \\nwhich policymakers and investors in the UK and Europe have responded to climate change and the way that has, \\nand is, shaping the growth strategies of companies like TotalEnergies, Shell and BP.\\nExxon and Chevron are aggressively growing their oil and gas production volumes and investing in increasing their \\noutput even as, across the Atlantic, TotalEnergies, Shell and BP are pursuing carbon emissions reduction-related \\nstrategies that will eventually see their volumes decline.\\nThe US companies are pursuing growth strategies. Their transatlantic competitors aren't.\\nShell and BP have received significant criticism recently for slowing the rate at which their fossil fuel volumes are \\nscheduled to fall.\\nBP, for instance, had a 2020 plan to cut its oil and gas production by 40 per cent by 2030 from 2019. Last year, the \\ntarget was shifted to 25 per cent by 2030, with the 35 to 40 per cent target for its own carbon emissions revised to \\nbetween 20 and 30 per cent.\\nShell, which had said it would reduce its output by 1 or 2 per cent a year through to the end of the decade, last year \\nrestated its plan.\\nIt now expects flat volumes through to 2030 and, where it had planned to reduce investment in oil and gas and \\nincrease its spending on low-carbon products, it will now invest $US40 billion in oil and gas by 2035, against the \\n$US10 to $US15 billion it will spend in those low-carbon products.\\nThe backlash against BP and Shell was strong because European and UK fund managers, retail investors and their \\ngovernments are far more committed to environmental, social and governance policies than most US fund \\nmanagers and other investors.\\nIn the US, where President Joe Biden has presided over a massive increase in US oil and gas production and \\nDonald Trump is promising to \\\"drill, baby, drill\\\" if he regains the presidency, there has recently been something of a \\nbacklash against ESG investment policies.\\nThe stronger emissions reduction frameworks in Europe and the UK (and successful legal actions by environmental \\nactivists) have forced their oil and gas companies to pursue strategies that have resulted in them constraining their \\noil and gas investment and production while building a presence in greener technologies and fuels.\\nFrom the companies' perspective - and that of prospective investors less concerned about fossil fuels - the pressure \\nto reduce their oil and gas production and invest in renewables and hydrogen will deliver lower returns than the \\nmore aggressively pro-fossil fuel strategies pursued by Exxon and Chevron.\\nWhen BP unveiled its new timetable for responding to climate change, it said that it generated returns on \\ninvestment of 15 to 20 per cent from its fossil fuel projects. The returns from bioenergy were about 15 per cent, but \\nthey were only 6 to 8 per cent from renewables like solar and wind. It's not surprising that it decided to invest more \\nin oil and gas and biofuels than in renewables.Page 3 of 3\\nIt's not easy being green for UK and European oil giants\\nThere's a relatively recent view among the majors, one that arguably was held earlier and more strongly by the US \\ncompanies, that the transition to cleaner energy is going to take longer and, if it is to be relatively smooth, will \\nrequire more investment in fossil fuels to maintain energy supply than was once projected.\\nThat view doesn't sit well with ESG-sensitive European or British investors. At the same time, the significant and \\nstill-growing presence of lower-returning assets in their portfolios and the absence of the production growth \\nstrategies of Exxon and Chevron deter those investors less fussed about investing in fossil fuels.\\nTotalEnergies, which has far more US investors than Europeans and whose biggest exposure to oil and gas is in \\nthe US, has less of a discount relative to Exxon and Chevron than the UK companies. But it believes that, if it were \\nvalued in line with them, there would be a very substantial uplift.\\nBut as a French national champion, TotalEnergies would face significant obstacles to moving its listing - as might \\nShell and BP - from governments determined to retain their flagship companies, retain their corporate offices and \\nmaintain the size and relevance of their equity markets.\\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

Now they are leading the retreat.\\nLast week BP announced that it had sold its offshore wind assets into a joint venture with Japan's JERA, itself a \\njoint venture between Tokyo Electric Power and Chubu Electric Power, to create one of the world's largest offshore \\nwind businesses.\\nThat followed an earlier BP announcement, in September, that it planned to sell its US onshore wind farms.\\nUnder former chief executive, Bernard Looney, BP had been building its wind farm portfolio as part of an ambitious \\nstrategy to cut its hydrocarbon production by 40 per cent by 2030, reduce its emissions and those of its customers \\nby 35 to 40 per cent by the end of this decade and become a \\\"net zero\\\"-emissions company by 2050.\\nLast year it started backing away from those commitments, saying it would cut production by only 25 per cent by \\n2030 and its emissions by 20 to 30 per cent.\\nThis year, under a new chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, it now appears even those reduced targets are being \\nwound back.\\nIt's not just BP.\\nShell has scaled back its investment in renewables, including offshore wind and hydrogen; it has reduced its \\nemissions' intensity targets and it has abandoned its objective of becoming the world's largest electricity company. \\nNorway's energy giant, Equinor, has also announced plans to shrink its renewable energy division.\\nAs they retreat from their push into renewable energy and downgrade their ambitions to build major exposures to \\nelectricity generation, the UK and European oil companies are refocusing on their traditional oil and gas \\nbusinesses.\\nWhere previously they planned to cap or reduce their production, now they are planning and investing to increase it.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nBig Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare\\nLast year BP raised its forecast of oil equivalent production from 1.5 billion barrels a day by 2030 to 2 million \\nbarrels a day, planning to invest $US8 billion ($12.6 billion) more than previously budgeted on new oil and gas \\ninvestments. Since Auchincloss became CEO, that focus on lifting hydrocarbon production has intensified.\\nThe commercial logic in what they are doing is clear.
