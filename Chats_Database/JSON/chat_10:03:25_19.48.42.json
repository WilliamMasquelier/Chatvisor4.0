Well, actually, not all of them are nameless; the bland \nresponses, the most banal and corporate, come with a name. But rest assured, this lark is completely consuming \neveryone at the organisation.\nIt's Frank Costanza's airing of grievances but on an enormous scale, a Festivus ritual open to more than 20,000 \nparticipants across the Forrest empire.\nThere's snark, there's banter. There's outrage over a tampon and sanitary pad dispenser that's gone missing from a \nbathroom.\nThere's righteous indignation over women who can swish around the office in skirts during the summer while poor, \nsuffering dudes have to wilt in their neckties and suit jackets.\n\"Biscuits \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. We want biscuits in all kitchens \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Nothing better than a cuppa and a biccy,\" said one employee, \nreceiving 37 upvotes from their peers. Meanwhile, someone's idea for a masala chai machine in the kitchenette \nreceived only four upvotes. Philistines.\nWhat better window into a company's culture?\nFortescue CEO Dino Otranto addressed the most pressing questions at a recent \"team huddle\", although it's hard \nto tell whether he took this all seriously. Otranto prefaced one response by saying, \"this is probably the politically \ncorrect answer I need to give\", and then he told everyone that he likes to sit back and brace himself for the \nquestions \"with a nice bottle of scotch\".\nNo shade on knocking back a dram of whisky, which Dino can happily afford with his $1.75m salary (not including \nperformance rights, themselves worth a few dinero) but what of the Fortescue underclass? They're getting punted \nPage 2 of 3\nSome home truths for Fortescue\nbecause of Forrest's failing green energy vision. Remember the secret membrane, or the magic beans of green \nhydrogen? So much heat, yet so little light. Pretty soon we'll get an announcement of major advancements out of \nFortescue HQ. Their newest secret weapon? Eye of newt.\nSome 700 employees were let go in July, supposedly to lean up the business and not at all because of this flunking, \nexpensive project that's subsidised by the long-suffering shareholders of Fortescue's actual rainmaking business: \nmining. \"Most of us can't afford a nice bottle of scotch,\" one staffer said.\nOtranto's \"huddle\" mustn't have gone down a treat, which explains why chief operating officer Shelley Robertson, \npoached from the dum-dums at MinRes, fronted the second town hall instead to answer questions, one of which \nconcerned Fortescue's very cluttered organisational chart.\n\"Can someone explain the org structure? We have CEOs reporting to CEOs, directors to directors, and varying \ntitles, despite being told it would be 'flattened'.\" Now who might have asked that except for someone clearly trying to \nMarie Kondo the place? Looking at you, Otranto.\nSome insight, as well, into the workforce hardships that have followed the screw-tightening of July.\n\"Why is the budget so tight at the minute? Are we expected to deliver world class service on a shoestring budget? \nRecruitment restrictions are leaving departments short and the people picking up the slack are getting burned out,\" \nsaid one aggrieved Fortescue worker. Another sarcastically wrote: \"Is there an opportunity in the future to expand \non the CEO for a day initiative and participate if you are not a First Nations -employee?\" And then this from a \nperson who clearly hasn't kept an eye on iron ore prices: \"Instead of a Christmas party, can you give each \ndepartment $150 per person to hold their own team party?\" A popular idea with 211 upvotes, but hopelessly \nunrealistic, to be sure. Reminder: it's Fortescue, people, not Hancock. Don't hold your breath for a cash giveaway.\nA spokeswoman said the whole point of the exercise was to promote transparent communication within the \norganisation.\n\"This is just one avenue we are using to ensure our staff can continue to engage and interact with the leadership \nteam, getting answers to the topics that matter the most to our people,\" which apparently doesn't go much higher \nthan biscuits and air conditioning.\nDonations dry up Good retail politics, or a fundraising own goal?\nThe outrage over PwC's tax leaks scandal generated plenty of headlines for both major parties but their backroom \noperators might be ruing the point scoring as they tally up their respective election war chests. Not that many \npeople outside of the party backrooms will be crying, but those inside the tent might be another victim of the PwC \nscandal.\nThe Australian Electoral Commission's annual release of political donation data suggests the major parties' coffers \nhave been left with a $700,000 black hole after the \"big four\" firms - PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY - dramatically \npulled back their support last financial year.\nThey collectively donated almost $1m to both major parties in 2022-23 before revelations emerged that PwC used \nits position inside the tax office tent to enrich itself and its clients, at the (probable) expense of taxpayers.\nHowever, after politicians turned the screws on the bastardry, most of the firms shied away from making political \ndonations.\nPwC coughed up $369,973 to the major political parties in 2022-23, but didn't make any political donations in 2023-\n24 after banning them entirely. KPMG donated just $22,631, which was down 83 per cent on the previous year, \nwhile Deloitte donated $47,497 - down 73 per cent.\nOnly EY is an outlier, seemingly unaffected by the scandal. EY donated $180,172 in 2023-24, which was slightly \ndown on the $227,853 it donated the previous year.Page 3 of 3\nSome home truths for Fortescue\nAll up, donations to the major parties from the big four in 2023-24 were down more than 73 per cent, which was a \nbit of a blow to the coffers of the major parties.\nAnother oddity stands out among the financial services sector, after banking major ANZ pulled its donations to the \nmajor parties. The bank kicked in $90,000 to the major parties in 2022-23 but made only a single donation of $5500 \nthis current disclosure round.\nCuriously enough, that was to the Nationals, traditionally the party of bashing the banks.\nThe donation appears to have been made just a few months after the bank appeared at a hearing as part of \nNationals senator Matt Canavan's inquiry into branch closures in regional Australia. Purely a coincidence, no doubt.\nOf course, the AEC disclosures don't tell the whole story; notoriously so. Only direct donations are recorded under \nthe giver's name. Left off the disclosures are the names behind the millions of dollars raked in through business \nforums run by the major parties, which have annual membership rates of $30,000 to $120,000 and run dozens and \ndozens of breakfasts, lunches, dinners (and even the odd afternoon tea) to give access to ministers and their \nshadow counterparts for those able and prepared to pay. Margin Call would be shocked if the big four (banks or \naccounting firms) weren't booking in for the odd spot of lunch with a minister or three during the year, but you won't \nknow it from the AEC disclosure list.\nLoad-Date: February 4, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's Executive Chairman | \"this is probably the politically correct answer I need to give\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue's CEO | \"this is probably the politically correct answer I need to give\" | N.A. |\n| Shelley Robertson | Fortescue's Chief Operating Officer | \"Can someone explain the org structure?
