Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 3\nThis summer, please leave the sea shells by the seashore\nThis summer, please leave the sea shells by the seashore\nThe Conversation - Australia\nJanuary 8, 2025 Wednesday 7:09 PM EST\nCopyright 2025 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved\nLength: 763 words\nByline: Nathan Brooks English, Associate professor; Flora, Fauna & Freshwater Research Cluster Lead, \nCQUniversity Australia\nHighlight: Taking that beautiful snail shell could increase the cost of housing for a hermit crab or small shrimp that \nneeds it next. The beautiful conch shell that calls to you is actually an octopus caravan.\nBody\nWhen I (Nathan Brooks English) was six years old, I snuck a starfish home from the beach and hid it in my closet. I \nregret that now, as my parents did then when the smell of rotting starfish overwhelmed the house. I regret it also \nbecause that starfish had a place and a purpose - and dying in a hot, dark closet next to my Hot Wheels was not it.\nLikewise, the beautiful shells and natural flotsam that decorate Australian beaches have a place and a purpose. For \nmany of us, summer at the beach is a cherished memory and collecting seashells is probably a part of that memory.\nOn most beaches in Australia, collecting shells without living creatures in them is legal, but let me convince you \nthere are better options that ensure future Sallies will still find seashells by the seashore.\nSomeone needs that shell more than you\nFor native wildlife, both occupied and unoccupied shells provide important shelter and sources of calcium and grit.\nTaking that beautiful snail shell could increase the cost of housing for a hermit crab or the small shrimp that needs \nit next. The beautiful conch shell that calls to you is actually an octopus caravan. \nFor these reasons, never pick up shells in the water or in tidal pools; chances are they are being used or will be \nshortly. \nLikewise, collecting shells in marine parks is strictly prohibited.\nShells have spiritual and cultural importance\nFor the island Woppaburra People of central Queensland, beaches and shells have spiritual and cultural \nimportance as part of Dreaming stories, dance and ceremonies.\nPage 2 of 3\nThis summer, please leave the sea shells by the seashore\nIn addition to their place and purpose in my (Robert Muir) stories and culture, shells can also provide valuable \ninsight and context to our history on the island. \nMiddens (deep piles of shells left on the beach after being used to produce food or tools) provide archaeological \nevidence that the islands have been occupied for at least the past 5,000 years.\nBack then, Woppa (also known as Great Keppel Island, in Queensland) and its beaches could sustainably support \nthe 100 to 200 people who lived on the island for more than five millenia. \nToday, Woppa hosts tens of thousands of visitors a year on three small beaches. And while people are welcome to \npick up, examine and play with the shells, to preserve their place and purpose they must be left on the shore where \nthey were found.\nIf everyone took a shell...\nIncreasing pressure on beaches and their natural resources isn't just felt on Woppa. \nThe global population now exceeds 8 billion people and our collective (pun intended) impact on beaches is \nmagnified. That's twice as many people as when I (Nathan Brooks English) was a child in the late 1970s.\nFor example, in 2019 Bondi Beach had more than 2.1 million visitors (not that anyone is looking at shells). If \neveryone took a shell, there'd be hardly any left. \nEven smaller beaches need time to accumulate shells and a summer rush of collectors can quickly deplete beaches \nof shells until the next cyclone or winter storm washes more up.\nWhat to do instead of collecting shells\nSo how do we balance wanting a tangible reminder of the beach in our own yards or homes (the destination of \nmany shells) versus not damaging the natural beauty and function of beach ecosystems? \nInstead of taking a shell, take a picture instead. You can photograph unoccupied shells in place along the beach \nwhere the tide has collected, or arrange them together for a photographic collage. \nInclude them in your sandcastles as gates, windows, or little people to populate the castle. \nFor your artsy children (or adults), use crayons or coloured pencils and a small sketch pad to draw the shells. \nTaking a few shells at a time to your umbrella to sketch them and then returning them to the tide line will sate the \nurge to collect and leave the beach unchanged.\nYou may even find you have a gifted scientific illustrator on your hands. \nWhen you're done with the shells, leave them by the shore. Wind, tides and time (or tomorrow's small visitor) will \nsweep them back into natural circulation, continuing their storied lives as creature homes or fine grit for our beautiful \nAustralian beaches, their purpose and place preserved.\nIf you absolutely must pick something up and take it home, please pick up some of the vast amount of plastic found \non Australian beaches.\nRobert Muir works in the cultural heritage and tourism industry.\nNathan Brooks English does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or \norganisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their \nacademic appointment.Page 3 of 3\nThis summer, please leave the sea shells by the seashore\nLoad-Date: January 8, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
