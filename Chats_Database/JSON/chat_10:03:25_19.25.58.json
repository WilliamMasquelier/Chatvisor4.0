Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Rosli Wheelock | Fortescue's General Manager First Nations | \"We have a huge amount of talent within our organisation, and it's recognised which has given the opportunities that those individuals deserve on their own merit.\" | N.A. |\n| Rosli Wheelock | Fortescue's General Manager First Nations | \"It's not because I'm Aboriginal that I am in this critical role; it's because of my track record in running operations, managing teams and solving complex problems.\" | N.A. |\n| Rosli Wheelock | Fortescue's General Manager First Nations | \"We have to make sure we're helping Indigenous-owned businesses remove roadblocks or where they're having issues.\" | N.A. |\n| Rosli Wheelock | Fortescue's General Manager First Nations | \"Even in Perth, it's not just about where our operations are.

Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
