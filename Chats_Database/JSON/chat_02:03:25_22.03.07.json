Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Orsted based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Orsted is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Orsted.\n\nIf Orsted is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nOffshore wind developer axes boss as net zero stalls\nOffshore wind developer axes boss as net zero stalls\ntelegraph.co.uk\nJanuary 31, 2025 Friday 11:59 AM GMT\nCopyright 2025 Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Version:2\nLength: 465 words\nByline: By James Warrington, Senior Business Reporter\nHighlight: Orsted scrambles as soaring costs and delays hamper switch to renewables\nBody\nBritain\u2019s biggest offshore wind developer has replaced its chief executive as the global shift to net zero falters. \n\u00d8rsted, which operates 12 offshore wind farms across the UK and has four more in development, said Mads \nNipper, its chief executive, will step down with immediate effect.\nMr Nipper, who joined the Danish company in 2021, will be replaced by Rasmus Errboe, who currently serves as \ndeputy chief executive and chief commercial officer.\n\u00d8rsted is scrambling to turn around its fortunes as soaring costs and delays hamper the move to renewable energy \nsources.\nThe Danish company has taken a number of major writedowns in recent years  and shares have tumbled more than \n80pc from their peak in 2021.\nLene Skole, \u00d8rsted\u2019s chairman, said: \u201cThe impacts on our business of the increasingly challenging situation in the \noffshore wind industry , ranging from supply chain bottlenecks, interest rate increases, to a changing regulatory \nlandscape, mean that our focus has shifted.\n\u201cTherefore, the board has today agreed with Mads Nipper that it\u2019s the right time for him to step down and the board \nhas appointed Rasmus Errboe to take over as chief executive.\u201d\nThe downturn has already forced \u00d8rsted, which is building the Hornsea 3 windfarm off the Norfolk coast, to cut \nhundreds of jobs and pull out of several international markets.\n\u00d8rsted has warned of a significant fall in its wind farm output, meaning it could build 1,500 fewer turbines.\nPage 2 of 2\nOffshore wind developer axes boss as net zero stalls\nThe upheaval led to the departure  of the company\u2019s former chairman, finance chief and chief operating officer last \nyear. Mr Nipper survived that cull, vowing to \u201cfight with everything I\u2019ve got\u201d to restore investor confidence.\nBut the company has taken a fresh blow as the outlook to the renewable energy sector darkens with the return of \nDonald Trump as US president.\nMr Trump, who has vowed to reverse the US\u2019s policy on renewables and revert to oil and gas, has already signed \nan executive order suspending new leases for offshore wind.\n\u00d8rsted this month announced fresh writedowns of 12.1bn Danish krone (\u00a31.4bn) on its US business, which it \nblamed on rising interest rates and market uncertainties.\nMr Nipper said: \u201cLeading \u00d8rsted through four challenging yet rewarding years has been a great privilege. Despite \nthe obstacles we\u2019ve faced, we\u2019ve achieved many significant milestones, and I\u2019m immensely proud of our colleagues\u2019 \nefforts and dedication.\u201d\nMr Errboe, who joined \u00d8rsted in 2012, said: \u201c\u00d8rsted has a strong foundation with unique capabilities, and I\u2019m \nlooking forward to taking the lead on the transformation necessary to navigate the headwinds that \u00d8rsted and our \nindustry currently face.\n\u201cOffshore wind remains crucial for the green transition, and we\u2019re deeply committed to pursuing our vision of a world \nthat runs entirely on green energy.\u201d\nLoad-Date: January 31, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Orsted.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
