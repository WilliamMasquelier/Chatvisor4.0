Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's CEO | \"It's time that Fortescue conceded its hydrogen foray is over?\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Vesey | Fortescue's US energy boss | \"No suggestion of any wrongdoing by Vesey.\" | N.A. |\n| Robert Tichio | Fortescue Capital boss | \"No suggestion of any wrongdoing by Tichio.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue Energy boss | \"Still dodging questions about how many of his team remain after last year's cull of 700 Fortescue staff.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
