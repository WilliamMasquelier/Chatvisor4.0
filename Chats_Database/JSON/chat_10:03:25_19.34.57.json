Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 17\nLength: 642 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue's plan to cease emitting carbon by 2030 could earn the company at least $50 million a year from a new \nfederal government carbon credit scheme, but chairman Andrew Forrest's disdain for offsets may prevent the miner \nfrom accepting the windfall.\nDr Forrest has vowed that Fortescue will not rely on offsets to achieve \"real zero\" emissions across its iron ore \nmines by 2030. The billionaire has previously labelled offsets as a \"scam\".\nBut the imminent launch of the Albanese government's new carbon credit scheme - known as Safeguard \nMechanism Credits (SMCs) - is offering Fortescue a lucrative incentive to start selling offsets to other companies.\nCompanies that cut emissions faster than required by the federal government's Clean Energy Regulator will be \nrewarded with an SMC for each extra tonne of carbon they abate beyond their target. Those that earn SMCs will be \nable to sell them to rival emitters that have failed to deliver their emissions reduction targets for the year.\nFortescue will earn vast quantities of SMCs if it delivers on its \"real zero\" goal because its actual emissions in 2030 \nwould be dramatically lower than the emissions allowance granted to the company by the Clean Energy Regulator. \nFortescue will be permitted to emit about 1.4 million tonnes of carbon pollution in 2030 if it maintains current iron \nore production rates. If the company delivers on its promise to emit no carbon in 2030, it will earn about 1.4 million \nSMCs in that year alone.\nThe Albanese government has signalled that trading of SMCs will begin early next year and that the exact price of \nan SMC will remain unclear until trading begins.\nBut based on the ceiling price imposed on the carbon credits regime by the Albanese government last year - $75 a \ntonne indexed to the consumer price index plus 2 per cent - analysts believe Fortescue could make between $50 \nmillion and $150 million from selling SMCs in 2030.\nThe potential revenue boost from selling SMCs has prompted debate inside Fortescue over its hardline stance \nagainst carbon offsets.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue eyes $50m carbon credit free kick\nAsked whether Fortescue planned to sell the SMCs it would earn in the future, a spokesman for the miner said no \ndecision had been taken.\n\"Fortescue is finalising its position on the implications of the reformed Safeguard Mechanism and is working \nclosely with the government,\" he said.\n\"We will do this consistent with our broader approach to voluntary and compliance carbon markets, which is that the \ncore focus must always be the delivery of real reductions in emissions.\"\nFortescue has a huge task ahead to cut emissions to zero within six years; the miner's scope 1 and scope 2 \nemissions rose by about 7 per cent in the year to June.\nFortescue exceeded its legislated emissions allowance for the year by about 120,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas. \nDespite the company's disdain for offsets, it was legally obliged to buy about $4.2 million worth of Australian Carbon \nCredit Units (ACCUs) to atone for the excess carbon emitted in 2024.\nFortescue says it will only buy ACCUs when legally forced to, and the spokesman reiterated the company did not \nplan to rely on offsets or carbon capture to achieve its 2030 target.\n\"We will show that decarbonisation is good for business and creates greater value for shareholders while \nsafeguarding our planet,\" he said.\nFortescue estimated in 2022 that it would need to spend $US6.2 billion to achieve \"real zero\" in the Pilbara mining \ndistrict by 2030.\nOxford Sustainable Finance Group director Ben Caldecott last month praised Fortescue's plan for getting to zero \nemissions by 2030.\n\"The plan is marked by high ambition and well-defined actions, underpinned by accountability mechanisms to \nensure systematic delivery across the organisation,\" he said.\nRival miner Rio Tinto expects to spend up to $US6 billion ($8.8 billion) on works that will halve its carbon footprint \nby 2030.\nLoad-Date: October 10, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Chairman of Fortescue | \"Dr Forrest has vowed that Fortescue will not rely on offsets to achieve 'real zero' emissions across its iron ore mines by 2030.\" | N.A. |\n| Ben Caldecott | Director of Oxford Sustainable Finance Group | \"The plan is marked by high ambition and well-defined actions, underpinned by accountability mechanisms to ensure systematic delivery across the organisation.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
