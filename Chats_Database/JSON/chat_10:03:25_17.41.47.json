The JV is operated by Cyprium, who owns 80% of the rights to base \nmetals with 20% owned by Ramelius.\nCyprium is encouraged by a drill intercept of 15 metres at 3.26% copper, 0.70 g/t gold, 7.4 g/t silver and 151ppm \ncobalt from 70 metres downhole in drill hole 24CURC004.\nThis included a 7-metre intercept at 5.04% copper, 0.81 g/t gold, 11.4 g/t silver, 197ppm cobalt and 0.11% nickel \nfrom a depth of 71 metres.  \nA second intercept in that drill hole returned 3 metres at 1.09% copper and 0.44 g/t gold from 108 metres, including \n1 metre at 2.54% copper and 1.19 g/t gold from 109 metres. \nCyprium notes that the mineralisation remains open at depth and along strike in both directions within a lightly \ntested copper soil anomaly that extends for 2.5 kilometres along strike.\n\"Potential for economic orebody\"\nPage 2 of 3\nCyprium Metals makes shallow high-grade copper discovery at Cue JV's Heeler prospect\nCyprium executive chairman Matt Fifield said: \"While the company remains focused on delivering a robust plan for \nNifty [copper project], we continue to maintain our outstanding portfolio of exploration assets.\n\"This new Heeler discovery is a great reminder of the prospective value within the company's earlier-stage assets in \nthe Paterson and Murchison provinces.\n\"Our exploration team targeted our limited drilling budget in the Murchison around the most prospective areas and \nhit outstanding grade that shows potential for an economic orebody. It's exciting to have an unexpected shallow \nhigh-grade hit show up like this.\n\"With Nifty, Maroochydore, our Murchison portfolio and our Paterson JV with IGO, Cyprium has some of the best \nassets and exploration ground in Australia to deliver into the growing global requirements for copper.\"\nUnderexplored base metals potential\n\"With Heeler, Cyprium continues to build on its copper-gold resource inventory in the Murchison,\" said Cyprium \nCOO Milan Jerkovic.\n\"We have 203,000 tonnes of copper resource and 153,0000 ounces of gold (100% basis) at the nearby Hollandaire \nand Nanadie Well deposits and follow-up work around Heeler may well bring additional grade and scale into our \nportfolio.\n\"There are assays from this program outstanding, but we're pleased to have hit shallow high-grade mineralisation.\"\nCyprium geologist Mark Styles added: \"The Cue region is an area that's known for its gold deposits but hasn't been \nwell explored for its base metals potential.\n\"At Heeler, for example, we were attracted by the large, lightly tested +100ppm copper soil anomaly up to 400 \nmetres wide and 2.5 kilometres long, historic shallow drill results with 0.3% copper in the core of the soil anomaly \nand a coincident geophysical magnetic high. \n\"These features are suggestive of a mafic-ultramafic association with base metal mineralisation in a style distinct \nfrom the felsic-hosted Hollandaire copper-gold deposit located 10 kilometres northeast of Heeler.\"\n\"We drilled four holes in our program focusing on Heeler, following up on work in 2022. So far we have assays back \nfrom a single drillhole completed in our January 2024 program. \n\"The 24CURC004 intercept showed stacked shallow sulphide mineralisation that was visible in the drill chips. We \nalso hit sulphides in the three other holes but we're expecting lower tenor assay results, <1% copper.\" \nCyprium geologist Peter van Luyt said: \"As we've looked harder at the mineralisation and the assays, this hole \nsuggests a mafic-ultramafic orthomagmatic nickel-copper-cobalt type that would be similar to a Nova-Bollinger style \ndeposit. When we have the additional assays, we will be in a position to plan follow-up work.\" \n2024 drill holes\nThe following images show the location of the four 2024 drill holes and a preliminary conceptual cross-section \nbased on assays and visual interpretation. Drill hole 24CURC003 intersected lithologies and mineralisation similar \nto 24CURC004 but with lower levels of visible chalcopyrite (copper iron sulphide). \nDrill holes 24CURC001 and 24CURC002 were drilled towards the southern end of the Heeler anomaly and \nintersected traces of chalcopyrite over wide intervals beneath the weathered carapace in lithologies similar to the \nHeeler host rocks. \nAssay results for these three drill holes are pending.Page 3 of 3\nCyprium Metals makes shallow high-grade copper discovery at Cue JV's Heeler prospect\nLoad-Date: February 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**PERSON**: [Full Name]\n**ROLE**: [Person's role or position]\n**CONTEXT**: [Brief description of how the person is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**PERSON**: Elon Musk\n**ROLE**: CEO of Tesla and SpaceX\n**CONTEXT**: Primary subject of article, discussing company strategy\n\nOnly include people who play a meaningful role in the article's content.
