It operates in the Mining, exploration and drilling of gold, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Ramelius Resources based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Ramelius Resources is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Ramelius Resources.\n\nIf Ramelius Resources is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nBonanza for gold explorers\nBonanza for gold explorers\nThe Australian\nFebruary 22, 2025 Saturday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: WEALTH; Pg. 31\nLength: 700 words\nByline: Josh Chiat\nBody\nThis time last year Gareth Solly's Black Cat Syndicate was battling for relevance, trading at a little over $60m even \nas it progressed the refurbishment of its Paulsens gold mine, the first leg of a three-step process to become a \n150,000-ounce-a-year gold producer.\nNow, 12 months down the line, the booming ASX junior is sitting on a near-300 per cent 12-month share price gain, \na $460m market cap, and owns the status of Australia's newest gold miner.\nEven before forms have been returned, interest is already looking overwhelming for a run of minted one ounce \ncoins to commemorate the Paulsens mine's reopening, cut from its first gold bar. Each day those seem to become \nmore valuable - the price of bullion has gone from $US2014 an ounce this time last year to about $US2912 this \nweek, or about $4585 an ounce.\n\"It's been a welcome relief from where we came from. Absolutely the gold price has helped, becoming a producer \nhas helped and we're getting a lot of investors who want to get into gold now,\" Solly said on the sidelines of the RIU \nExplorers Conference in Fremantle, where gold miners have become the toast of the port city.\nBlack Cat engineered a transformative change in 2022 when it paid $40m for Northern Star's mothballed Paulsens \nand Coyote mines in WA.\n\"The market didn't give us any credit for the first couple years and now that the gold market has turned they are \nvery valuable assets,\" Solly said.\nWho's next in line?\nIt's a common cliche for a junior explorer to call themselves \"undervalued\" at a mining conference.\nBut junior golds have some right given where prices sit - and few investors are betting on a collapse as Trump's \ntariffs, war, global uncertainty and a growing chasm between trade in the East and West sends investors running for \na safe haven.\nPage 2 of 2\nBonanza for gold explorers\nOdyssey Gold executive director Matthew Syme says it's hard to be bearish. \"We've never really been gold bulls - \nwe've always just dealt with the gold price that's in front of us,\" he says. \"Even today I wouldn't say I was a gold bull, \nbut it's very difficult to think of a set of circumstances that's more favourable to gold or anything that's going to bring \nthis gold bull run to an end for at least the next couple of years. Gold looks as good than it ever has in my long \ncareer.\" Odyssey has a familiar strategy when it comes to WA gold producers. Located at Tuckanurra, it owns 80 \nper cent of a resource containing 407,000 ounces at 2.5 grams a tonne. It's also well within trucking distance of \nmills owned by Westgold Resources, Ramelius Resources and Catalyst Metals, all of which makes its gold highly \nmarketable.\nMore generally, profit-taking has started to emerge in recent days, as investors take stock of a gold run that has \naccelerated amid fears from US traders that tariffs could be placed on imports of the precious metal.\nA great time for metal to shine While some investors are astonished to see gold prices double, longer-standing \nindustry figures have seen it run from far lower levels.\nGold veteran Andrew Pumphrey, MD of ASX gold explorer OzAurum Resource, has seen bullion trading in the \nhundreds, let alone over $4000.\n\"I remember going to Diggers & Dealers once, it was around $200 an ounce. Now it's around $4500 so for anyone \ngetting into production, producing gold, or has got gold projects, it's really nice to see the whole sentiment change,\" \nhe says.\nExplorers aren't just taking a victory lap. OZM is studying a heap leach with a JV partner on its 260,000-ounce \nMulgabbie North gold project, while its share price has run 300 per cent higher this month after striking 20m at 3.57 \ngrams a tonne gold from surface at a high-grade discovery south of previous drilling.\nEarly-stage explorer Arika Resources is among those said to be receiving interest from investors who normally \nsteer clear of riskier, retail-backed stocks such as micro-cap explorers.\nIt holds numerous targets near the historic Goldfields production centres of Menzies and Laverton, with 5000m of \ndiamond drilling now under way at its Yundamindra project.\n\"We're in the fortunate position where we've got gold and we've got high-grade gold on mining leases, so it can be \neasily converted into cash,\" Arika MD Justin Barton said.
