It operates in the digital communications technology, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Cisco based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Cisco is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Cisco.\n\nIf Cisco is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nKickboxer pleads guilty on drug count\nKickboxer pleads guilty on drug count\nThe Age (Melbourne, Australia)\nOctober 9, 2024 Wednesday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 11\nLength: 718 words\nByline: Melissa Cunningham and Cameron Houston\nBody\nProfessional fighter Kayne Clarke - who goes by the alias Superman - had aspirations of winning global titles and \nbecoming one of the world's best kickboxers.\nBut the 36-year-old Abu Dhabi-born fitness trainer - described by Inside Sport as a \"martial arts powerhouse\" - \ncould now face years behind bars after he pleaded guilty to trafficking tens of thousands of dollars worth of cocaine.\nThe Victorian County Court yesterday heard the Cranbourne North man is accused of supplying half a kilogram of \ncocaine - analysed as having a purity of more than 70 per cent - to co-accused Bilal Jussab Mpinganjira, who went \non to sell the drugs to Victoria Police covert operatives.\nDocuments tendered to the court state that in late 2022, Mpinganjira unknowingly began communicating with a \ncovert police officer, who asked the drug dealer if he knew any \"connections for rack\". The documents show \nMpinganjira messaged Clarke on August 8 last year, asking him whether he had been able to source a kilogram of \ncocaine.\nClarke then messaged a third person, referred to as Cisco, in an attempt to secure the drugs, telling him he needed \nthe cocaine \"ASAP\" adding that \"[we] need to get this deal bro' whether we make money on this one or not\".\nAfter an initial deal for the drugs fell through, Clarke was able to source 500 grams of cocaine from Cisco later that \nday, the court heard.\n\"I do not want to let this guy [Mpinganjira] [down] then we loose [sic] out big time,\" he is alleged to have texted to \nCisco. \"He's a [big] connect.\"\nAbout 4pm the same day, Clarke and Mpinganjira met at an address in Oakleigh, where the kickboxer handed him \nhalf a kilogram of cocaine for an agreed price of about $82,000, the court heard. He then dropped Clarke at Eaton \nMall, in Oakleigh. Mpinganjira was arrested 15 minutes later.\nMpinganjira is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to major drug trafficking between December 2022 and \nAugust last year, the court was told.\nPage 2 of 2\nKickboxer pleads guilty on drug count\nYesterday, the court heard from Clarke's defence team that he was \"exceptionally talented in professional \nkickboxing\" and was \"undefeated\" in his class. They also said he was a martial arts expert with a black belt in \nkarate.\n\"He was hoping as he progressed in age to have a number of world titles, and he was hoping to be seen as the \nbest in his area of lightweight kickboxing,\" a defence barrister appearing on Clarke's behalf told the court.\nClarke is well-known in boxing circles and has an online presence, with thousands of followers on Instagram and \nFacebook.\nHe told his followers about a knee injury in May last year that had dashed his hopes of competing, while he \nrecovers. \"I ain't done yet, and we are still working. More coming soon,\" he wrote, before signing off as Superman.\nThe court was told Clarke's brother had died before his offending and the athlete was trying to pay off a drug debt \nfor his sibling, which had exceeded $20,000.\nDefence barrister Nicholas Papas, KC, said Clarke's brother's debt was a \"partial motivation\" for him becoming \ninvolved with the people linked to his brother.\nBut this was rejected by the prosecution, who told the court that Clarke stood to make a substantial profit from \nsupplying the cocaine to Mpinganjira.\nClarke's family and friends filled the courtroom yesterday. His mother wiped away tears throughout the hearing.\nPapas said Clarke regretted his actions and felt \"acutely\" the suffering he had caused his family.\n\"The picture I seek to paint of this defendant is one of relatively unsophisticated and naive involvement in very, very \nserious offending,\" he said.\nJudge Trevor Wraight said while Clarke may feel responsible for the distress he had caused his family, he appeared \nto lack remorse about the implications his conduct would have on the wider community.\n\"That's why we have the big maximum penalties because, ultimately, if it wasn't for clients like yours, you wouldn't \nneed half the judges in this court,\" Wraight said.\n\"All the offending, armed robbery, aggravated burglary, domestic violence has this underlying feature of drug use, \nwhich only can get sourced to the street by transactions committed by people like your client.\"\nThe maximum penalty for trafficking a commercial quantity of a drug of dependence is up to 25 years in prison. \nClarke had his bail extended and will be sentenced on October 22.\nLoad-Date: October 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Cisco.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
