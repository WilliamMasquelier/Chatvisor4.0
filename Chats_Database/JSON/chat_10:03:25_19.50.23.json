Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 17\nLength: 485 words\nByline: Elouise Fowler\nBody\nFortescue and the state of Western Australia have been hit with a $1.8 billion native title claim in an extraordinary \nescalation of a long-running battle over the Yindjibarndi lands on which the company built its Solomon iron ore \nmining hub.\nThe miner is expected to report a $2.6 billion half-year profit today, but now must factor in the risk of a dramatically \nhigher than expected claim by the Yindjibarndi people.\nThe Yindjibarndi people have sued Fortescue and the state to compensate for lost economic benefits and cultural \nand spiritual damage caused by the Solomon project, three-quarters of which sits in Yindjibarndi land that also \ntakes in the gorges and rock pools of Millstream Chichester National Park. The Federal Court will decide whether \nWA or Fortescue, which has mined the Yindjibarndi land for iron ore without permission nor agreement with the \nYindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation for 10 years, will pay the compensation bill.\nThe Yindjibarndi were found to be native titleholders of the land in 2017.\nWestern Australia is a co-defendant alongside Fortescue in the lawsuit, filed by the Yindjibarndi in March 2023, \nbecause it issued Fortescue's mining licence and collects royalties from its iron ore shipments. Under the state's \nmining code, the government has the authority to compel Fortescue to cover any compensation claims. However, \nFortescue will likely challenge this.\nCourt documents released yesterday show the compensation claim, initially estimated at around $1 billion, has \nnearly doubled to $1.8 billion.\nThe lion's share of the bill is linked to the mine destroying culture through loss of connection to the land. For this the \ngroup, led by Michael Woodley, is claiming compensation of $1.1 billion. \"On the assumption that there are 1000 \npeople in the Yindjibarndi community, this amount would compensate each Yindjibarndi person $1 million,\" \naccording to the court filing.\nEconomic loss - due to a failure to receive royalties - is claimed to be $678 million.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue faces $1.8b native title compensation claim\nAnother of the traditional owners' claims for compensation, previously untested under Australian law, is around \nsocial disharmony caused by Fortescue opting to throw its support behind a breakaway group, Wirlu-murra \nYindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation, which has separately struck deals with the miner. The court filing points to \n$880,000 in receipts paid by Fortescue to the breakaway group.\nTo compensate for this, the Yindjibarndi are asking for $112 million.\nDuring the hearings, Fortescue denied it stoked community tension and rejects claims it is liable for \"cultural loss\" \nin relation to community division. The Yindjibarndi are also seeking recompense of $34 million for specific \ndestruction of sites that formed a core spiritual connection to the land.\nFortescue says it recognises the group's right to compensation, but disputes the amount. Fortescue will submit its \nwritten closing arguments by the end of the month.\nLoad-Date: February 22, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
