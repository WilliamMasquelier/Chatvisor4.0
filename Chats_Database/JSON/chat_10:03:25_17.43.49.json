It now has to prove itself with its ambitious \nplan to take its production level to 500,000 ounces of gold annually.\nBut if it pulls it off, it will become the third-largest gold miner in Australia.\nSo far it has impressed, with the once embattled Westgold Resources soaring in value from $300m to over $1bn \nunder Mr Bramwell's leadership.\nAnd one of the reasons it is interested is it believes Karora had been producing 170,000 ounces of gold, when it \nshould have been producing about 200,000, as it had earlier forecast.\nPage 2 of 2\nDual listing the price Westgold has to pay for deal - DATA ROOM\nGold miners are currently cashed-up on the back of the buoyant gold price. Now the question is whether Ramelius \nResources pounces on Spartan Resources (formerly Gascoyne), which is said to be on its radar given the close \nproximity of its assets to Spartan's.\nYet the speculation has been around for a while and it is still to move, leaving some to think Ramelius sees \nSpartan as over-priced for now.\nAs gold mining consolidation continues apace, the other deal some believe will play out over the medium term is an \nacquisition by Northern Star of the $2.5bn De Grey Mining.\nNorthern Star's first priority is rebuilding the processing plant of the Super Pit gold mining asset that it owns, but \nafter that attention will likely turn to De Grey.\nThis is why many found its presence at Newcrest's Telfer mine and Havieron processing facility on a site visit in \nrecent weeks curious.\nNorthern Star sources say it has no interest in Telfer, but it's very close to De Grey's assets, so perhaps it was there \nwhile on a De Grey site visit, determining whether gold could be processed there.\nMeanwhile, the terms of Westgold's deal will see Karora shareholders receiving 2.524 Westgold shares and 68c \ncash a.\nThe offer represents about $6.60 per Karora share based on Westgold's closing share price on the ASX of $2.28 on \nApril 5.\nIt represents a 10.1 per cent premium to Karora's closing share price on the TSX of $5.99 ($C5.36) on April 5.\nWestgold shareholders will own 50.1 per cent of the combined company. Westgold, advised by Argonaut and \ncurrently producing about 220,000 ounces of gold from its underground and open pit mines in Western Australia, \nsays the business is capable of producing 400,000 ounces of gold per annum from Western Australia assets and \nestimates operating synergies of $209m and estimated corporate savings of $281m. The Beta Hunt underground \nmine, 600km from Perth, is the jewel in Karora's crown with its gold potential.\nLoad-Date: April 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**ENTITY**: [Organization Name]\n**TYPE**: [Type of organization - e.g., Company, Government Agency, NGO, etc.]\n**DESCRIPTION**: [Brief description of how the entity is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**ENTITY**: Tesla, Inc.\n**TYPE**: Company\n**DESCRIPTION**: Main subject of article, discussing Q4 earnings report\n\nOnly include entities that are meaningful to the article's content.
