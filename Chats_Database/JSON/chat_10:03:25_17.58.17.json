It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nPullback Twiggy pushes tax credits\nPullback Twiggy pushes tax credits\nThe Australian\nJuly 19, 2024 Friday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: THENATION; Pg. 4\nLength: 863 words\nByline: JOE KELLY, NICK EVANS, RHIANNON DOWN\nBody\nFortescue founder Andrew -Forrest says Labor should push ahead with billions of dollars in tax -incentives for \ngreen--hydrogen producers despite scaling down his own ambitions, arguing that high energy costs must be \nlowered to secure the fuel source as a commercially viable export -industry.\nDr Forrest told The Australian the feasibility of the industry came down to the cost of electricity - a position backed \nby former chief scientist Alan Finkel - and Fortescue's decision to pull back from its target of producing 15 million \ntonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 should not force a government rethink on its current strategy.\n\"The time to invest is through the cycle. If you wait for a boom to invest, you're going to be bringing your product on \nin a bust,\" Dr Forrest said. \"No, I would not recalibrate (government policy).\" Ahead of an election where the major \nparties will present radically different pathways to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, Anthony Albanese \nprovided an assurance on Thursday that \"our energy plan is on track\" and Labor was \"getting on with the job\".\nDr Forrest said he would not change the way the company -approached its energy strategy, despite Fortescue's \ngreen-energy arm racking up more than $US1.44bn ($2.1bn) in losses over the past four years with little in the way \nof commercial returns.\nThe Fortescue restructure - under which 700 jobs will be cut - was seized on by the Coalition as evidence that \nLabor was \"picking losers\" by allocating billions of dollars in production tax credits for green-hydrogen producers.\nOpposition climate and -energy spokesman Ted O'Brien said the announcement had \"blown a gaping hole in the -\nAlbanese Labor government's energy plans\" and elevated the importance of gas. But he stopped short of \nrenouncing the viability of the emerging industry.\n\"We remain optimistic about the success of hydrogen in the long term playing a role in our -future energy mix but \nwe will not follow Labor's mistake of putting all its eggs in one basket,\" Mr O'Brien said.\nPage 2 of 2\nPullback Twiggy pushes tax credits\nAs part of its flagship Future Made in Australia plan, the -government provided a budget allocation of $6.7bn to \nprovide a $2 incentive for every kilogram of green hydrogen produced from 2027-28. It also committed $1.3bn for \nnew projects under the Hydrogen Headstart program.\nThe Prime Minister said Labor was encouraging investment. He said its policies would \"reward success\" because \nthe tax credits would only kick in once projects were realised. \"I tell you what's not real: -nuclear reactors,\" Mr \nAlbanese said on Thursday. \"There is no plan for how they (the Coalition) get around the (nuclear) bans which are \nthere.\" Australian Hydrogen Council chief executive Fiona Simon estimated that governments - state and federal - \nhad earmarked at least $12bn for hydrogen over the next 13 years. But she noted the US was offering a more \nappealing production tax credit than Australia: $US3 for every kilogram of green hydrogen.\nResponding to the Fortescue decision, Dr Simon acknowledged that an announcement involving staff cuts was \n\"going to be a blow\" but argued that confidence in the sector had not been shaken. \"(It) confirms what we've all \nbeen talking about for a while, which is that it's really hard to get hydrogen projects up. But ... it doesn't mean that \nall projects don't work,\" she said.\nDr Forrest said Fortescue planned to invest in renewable energy to bring energy costs down and make -hydrogen \nexports commercially feasible \"I wouldn't change anything about the government's commitment,\" he said. \n\"Companies like Fortescue will start deploying very low-cost, very low-risk capital into increasing electricity \ngeneration, because there's a very strong opportunity there.\" Dr Finkel, said green hydrogen could replace coal as \na chemical--reducing agent in the production of iron, but acknowledged its viability was \"highly dependent\" on the \ncosts of renewable electricity.\nHe said the goal should be to start producing green hydrogen at about $2 a kilogram, \"which would require the \nelectricity that is used to make the hydrogen to be less than about $30 per megawatt hour - which is very cheap.\" \n\"Worldwide, customers using iron or steel for railroad lines or building construction - they are not prepared to pay a \nlarge premium for green iron,\" he said. \"We need to get the costs down eventually towards the costs of existing iron \nand steel making.\" Dr Finkel and Superpower -Institute chair Rod Sims said green hydrogen - produced by cracking \nwater into hydrogen and oxygen through zero-emissions technologies - offered a fresh -opportunity for Australia to \ncombine its comparative advantages in iron ore and renewable energy.\nProfessor Sims said exporting hydrogen was \"incredibly\" expensive. \"You make the green hydrogen in Australia \nand you double the cost to send it overseas,\" he said. \"We've got the renewable energy sources to make green \nhydrogen. That's why Australia is the best place in the world to make green iron.\" Dr Finkel said that, in addition to \nlowering electricity prices, the government should make -legislative reforms to fast-track -approvals for renewable \nprojects key to producing green hydrogen.\nEDITORIAL P10 BUSINESS P13\nLoad-Date: July 18, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
