The company had been consistently increasing shareholder payouts since 2016, but due to financial struggles, it has decided to halt these payments to focus on investments without raising additional capital. This move could negatively impact investor confidence and stock performance, as dividends are a key attraction for shareholders. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company has suffered a major financial setback, reporting an EBITDA of 18.7 billion Danish kroner (\u20ac2.5 billion) for 2023, which is below its projected range of 20-23 billion kroner. A significant portion of this shortfall is attributed to a 9.6 billion kroner provision for cancellation costs related to the termination of the Ocean Wind 1 project in the U.S. This financial underperformance highlights the challenges \u00d8rsted faces in managing its offshore wind projects profitably. [El Economista, Violeta N.

Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s market capitalization has plummeted by more than 70% since its peak in early 2021, when it was valued at over \u20ac76.5 billion. The company, once the third-largest utility in Europe, now ranks 14th in the sector, with a market value of just \u20ac16 billion. This dramatic decline underscores the financial instability and investor concerns surrounding the company. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has incurred massive financial losses, posting around \u00a32.2 billion in losses for 2023.

These economic pressures have made it more difficult for the company to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s financial troubles have led analysts to speculate that it may need to seek additional funding from investors. However, instead of raising capital, \u00d8rsted has opted for cost-cutting measures, which could prolong financial uncertainty and increase risks for the company\u2019s future stability. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to implement a drastic austerity plan, including a comprehensive review of its project portfolio.

The failure to complete these projects raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. [de Volkskrant, Marc van Den Eerenbeemt, February 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles have forced it to sell off assets worth 15 billion euros in an effort to stabilize its balance sheet. This asset divestment strategy indicates the severity of the company\u2019s financial difficulties and its need to generate liquidity. However, selling off key assets could weaken \u00d8rsted\u2019s long-term growth potential and reduce its influence in the offshore wind sector. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]\n\n- The company has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have significantly increased the costs of its wind farm projects.

[Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s leadership has been in turmoil, with its chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company\u2019s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning, further complicating \u00d8rsted\u2019s efforts to recover from its financial difficulties. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024] - \u00d8rsted experienced a leadership crisis in late 2023, with the abrupt dismissal of its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Daniel Lerup and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Richard Hunter following a disastrous financial year. The company suffered a massive loss of \u20ac2.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to high write-offs from abandoned offshore wind projects on the U.S. East Coast. This leadership shake-up reflects the severity of \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles and raises concerns about stability at the top levels of management. Frequent executive turnover can disrupt strategic planning and investor confidence. [Energie & Management, Volker Stephan, February 27, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to divest a significant stake in its U.S. onshore wind farms, selling off equity ownership in four wind farms with a total capacity of 957 MW for approximately $300 million. This marks the company\u2019s second major asset divestment in the U.S., highlighting its need to generate liquidity amid financial difficulties.

Opponents, including citizen groups and environmental organizations, argue that the projects could harm marine life, disrupt coastal views, and lead to higher electricity prices. Legal battles have already contributed to the cancellation of \u00d8rsted\u2019s Ocean Wind projects in New Jersey, with opponents claiming their lawsuits created uncertainty that deterred investors. These legal challenges add another layer of risk to \u00d8rsted\u2019s U.S. expansion strategy and could further delay the development of offshore wind infrastructure. [The Independent, Wayne Parry, September 18, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles have made it an acquisition target, with Norwegian oil and gas giant Equinor purchasing a 9.8% stake in the company for approximately $2.5 billion. This investment comes at a time when \u00d8rsted\u2019s stock price has significantly declined due to project cancellations, rising costs, and financial impairments. While Equinor frames the acquisition as a strategic move to expand its renewable energy portfolio, the purchase highlights \u00d8rsted\u2019s weakened financial position and vulnerability to external takeovers. The deal also raises concerns about the increasing influence of fossil fuel companies in the renewable energy sector. [Lefigaro, Anonymous, October 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has suffered significant financial losses due to project cancellations and impairments, with the company reporting a loss of 1.7 billion Danish kroner (\u20ac225 million) in the second quarter of 2024. These losses stem from delays and the abandonment of key offshore wind projects, further exacerbating the company\u2019s financial instability. The company\u2019s ambitious goal of expanding its renewable energy capacity to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030 is now under pressure, as financial constraints force it to scale back investments. This financial downturn raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to maintain its leadership in the offshore wind sector. [Energie & Management, Georg Eble, October 07, 2024]",

Op een kade in Vlissingen zijn mensen druk bezig om oesters vast te lijmen op een \nbetonnen constructie. Met elastiekjes worden ze tijdelijk nog eens stevig aangedrukt. Het is het begin van een proef \ndie moet leiden tot de rentree van oesterriffen in de Noordzee.\nHet tafereel speelt zich af bij \u00d8rsted, de bouwer en exploitant van windpark Borssele 1 en 2, dat voor de Zeeuwse \nkust ligt. Dagelijks vaart vanaf de kade bij het Vlissingse station een onderhoudsploeg richting het park. Woensdag \nneemt deze voor het eerst een extra lading mee. Het zijn betonnen structuren, tetrapods (vierpoten) genoemd, die \nzo'n vijftig kilogram per stuk wegen. De constructies zijn beplakt met oesters.\nComeback van de oester\nHet gaat om een project van \u00d8rsted samen met Van Oord, onder de naam Ocean Health. Zij werken aan een \ncomeback van de oester. ,,Vroeger waren er heel veel oesterriffen in de Noordzee\", vertelt Nienke Oostenbrink van \nVan Oord. ,,150 jaar geleden was 20 tot 30 procent van de zeebodem bedekt met de platte Europese oester. \nOesterriffen zijn heel goed voor het ecosysteem. Ze filteren afvalstoffen uit het water en zorgen voor meer \nbiodiversiteit.\"\nDoor verschillende oorzaken zijn de riffen vrijwel verdwenen, met alle gevolgen van dien voor het ecosysteem. \nOcean Health probeert de Noordzee weer gezonder te maken. ,,De platte Europese oester is de soort die we willen \nherintroduceren.\"\nHechten aan harde materialen\nPage 2 of 2\nWaarom ze in Vlissingen oesters op een betonnen paal plakken\nHet windmolenpark is daar bij uitstek de omgeving voor, zegt Oostenbrink. ,,We gaan volwassen oesters uitzetten. \nDie zijn reproductief, dus in de fase van hun leven waarin ze larven produceren. Die larven hechten zich alleen aan \nharde materialen, zoals stenen.\" De palen waarop de windmolens staan, zijn op de bodem omringd door stenen en \ndie liggen ook op plekken waar kabels elkaar kruisen. ,,Daarom zijn windmolenparken heel geschikt. Bovendien zijn \nhet relatief onverstoorde gebieden, want er is heel weinig scheepvaart en geen visserij. Dus er is ook geen kans dat \ner iets wordt beschadigd of opgevist.\"\n\u00d8rsted en Van Oord zijn al wat langer bezig om de Europese platte oester terug te brengen. Dat gebeurde tot nu \ntoe met relatief grote constructies, waarbij een kraan nodig was om ze in het water te laten zakken. Dat maakte het \nbewerkelijk en kostbaar. Om die reden zijn nu de tetrapods ontwikkeld. Die zijn veel handzamer en kunnen worden \nmeegenomen op de onderhoudsschepen. Eenmaal ter plekke worden ze overboord gezet.\nZeker tien jaar vastgeplakt\nHoe goed dat in de praktijk werkt, zal de komende jaren moeten blijken. Woensdag en donderdag worden tientallen \nexemplaren naar het windpark gebracht en op een diepte van 20 tot 25 meter uitgezet. De oesters zijn vastgeplakt \nmet lijm die ervoor zorgt dat ze zeker tien jaar vast blijven zitten. ,,Eerst moet blijken of de structuren inderdaad op \nhet steenbed landen en niet op het zand\", zegt Oostenbrink. ,,Ook is de vraag of zij intact blijven. Je wil niet dat ze \nop \u00e9\u00e9n punt neerkomen en dat dan een been van zo'n tetrapod afbreekt. Daar hebben we ze ook al op getest, dus \nik denk niet dat dat gebeurt, maar we moeten ook zien hoe dat in de praktijk gaat.\"\nVervolgens komt de belangrijkste vraag in beeld: hoe vergaat het de oesters? ,,We hebben een \nmonitoringsprogramma van acht jaar. In die periode gaan we onder water videobeelden maken. Op basis daarvan \nkijkt een extern bureau: wat is de staat van de oesters? Zijn ze er nog allemaal? En vooral de grote vraag: hebben \nzij inderdaad larven geproduceerd die zich hebben gevestigd in de omgeving en zien we dus het ontstaan van \noesterriffen? Dat is natuurlijk wat we hopen.\"\nBekijk ook onze videoreportages:\nLoad-Date: October 30, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: PZC\nAuthor: Rolf Bosboom\nDate: October 29, 2024\nTitle: Waarom ze in Vlissingen oesters op een betonnen paal plakken\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Brookfield bought a stake in Orsted UK Wind Farms for $2.3 billion\n## Media outlet: Business World Agency\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: October 30, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 1\nWorld: Brookfield bought a stake in Orsted UK Wind Farms for $2.3 billion.\nWorld: Brookfield bought a stake in Orsted UK Wind Farms for $2.3 billion.\nEnergy: Ukraine and the world\nOctober 30, 2024 Wednesday\nCopyright 2024 Business World Agency All Rights Reserved\nLength: 192 words\nBody\nCanadian investment firm Brookfield buys stake in Orsted UK Wind Farms for $2.3 billion, one of the largest deals \nin the sector this year.\nThe deal marks a significant expansion of Brookfield , one of the world's largest investors in the energy transition, \ninto offshore wind.

Brookfield is purchasing the stake from \ntroubled Danish energy giant \u00d8rsted.\nMr Carney, who was governor of the Bank of England  from 2013 to 2020, is now chairman of Brookfield Asset \nManagement, which has built up a \u00a360bn UK investment portfolio. He retains strong links with the Labour Party and \nespecially with Chancellor Rachel Reeves. \nThe deal, which was announced on the same day as Ms Reeves\u2019 inaugural Budget, marks Brookfield\u2019s first move \ninto the UK\u2019s offshore wind market.\nThe transaction includes stakes in the Hornsea 1 and Hornsea 2 wind farms , which are both in the North Sea, and \nthe Walney Extension and Burbo Bank Extension projects in the Irish Sea. The deal is expected to close by the end \nof this year.\nMr Carney has long been a strong supporter of investment in clean energy. He was instrumental in making the \nBank of England focus on the implications of climate change while at the institution.\nBrookfield\u2019s support for offshore wind comes as Energy Secretary Ed Miliband seeks to radically expand Britain\u2019s \nrenewable energy infrastructure in an effort to decarbonise the country\u2019s electricity grid by 2030. \nConnor Teskey, chief of Brookfield Renewable and president of Brookfield Asset Management, said the company \nwas \u201csupporting the country\u2019s decarbonisation objectives\u201d.\nPage 2 of 2\nMark Carney\u2019s investment group makes \u00a31.8bn bet on UK offshore wind\nHe added: \u201cThis is Brookfield\u2019s first investment in UK offshore wind, which will continue to be a critical part of the \nenergy mix and to support the growing demand we see for clean energy.\u201d\nWind farms are proving increasingly attractive for investors because the UK\u2019s Contract for Difference (CfD) system \nguarantees a minimum price for the power they generate, underwritten by consumer bills. All four farms Brookfield \nis investing in have CfD contracts.\nUnder the deal \u00d8rsted will retain a 37.55pc ownership interest in the wind farms and will operate and maintain \nthem.\nFor \u00d8rsted, the deal is part of a wider battle to restore investor confidence. Earlier this year it announced that it was \ntrimming its investment and capacity targets, pausing dividend payouts and divesting assets, as part of a major \nreview following a period of poor performance.\n\u00d8rsted has also kicked off a search to raise capital for Hornsea 3, a massive 2.9GW wind farm planned for the \nNorth Sea that is expected to cost about \u00a39bn. Options include selling a 50pc stake in advance of construction\nMads Nipper, group President and chief executive of \u00d8rsted, said: \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to welcome Brookfield, a leading \nrenewable energy investor with proven investment and operational expertise, as a partner in four UK offshore wind \nfarms in one of \u00d8rsted\u2019s core strategic markets.\n\u201cToday\u2019s transaction is an important milestone in the farm-down programme as part of our business plan, \nsupporting our significant re-investment in new assets.\u201d\nBrookfield\u2019s other UK holdings include Checkatrade, the online trade directory  connecting homeowners with \ntradespeople such as plumbers and electricians.\nIt also has a 25pc stake in First Hydro, which runs the pumped hydro storage system at Dinorwig in Snowdonia. \nWater is pumped uphill to a reservoir in the Welsh mountains during times of low electricity demand and then \nreleased to spin electrical turbines when demand surges.\nIt also has stakes in Westinghouse, a global nuclear business  that owns the Springfields site in Lancashire, the \nUK\u2019s only nuclear fuels manufacturing centre.\nBrookfield\u2019s backing of Britain comes as Mr Carney helps the new administration to attract international investment.\nThe former Bank governor made a star appearance in a video shown at Labour\u2019s 2023 conference praising Ms \nReeves, then the shadow chancellor, and subsequently advised her on setting up a National Wealth Fund.\nMore controversially, it recently emerged that he had used his connections to lobby ministers  to relax rules on heat \npump subsidies to the potential benefit of Homeserve, a heating and plumbing company also owned by Brookfield.\nBrookfield has said Mr Carney did not raise the issue in meetings where he was representing the company.\nLoad-Date: October 30, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Telegraph\nAuthor: Jonathan Leake\nDate: October 30, 2024\nTitle: Mark Carney\u2019s investment group makes \u00a31.8bn bet on UK offshore wind\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Oesterriffen maken rentree\n## Media outlet: BN/DeStem\n### Author: Rolf Bosboom\n### Date: October 31, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nOesterriffen maken rentree\nOesterriffen maken rentree\nBN/DeStem\n31 oktober 2024 donderdag\nZeeuws-Vlaanderen Editie\nCopyright 2024 DPG Media B.V.

The delay in connecting the wind farm to the grid has pushed back the project\u2019s timeline by a year, adding to the company\u2019s ongoing financial struggles. This setback further exacerbates \u00d8rsted\u2019s difficulties in managing large-scale offshore wind projects efficiently and profitably, raising concerns about its ability to meet its renewable energy targets. [Energie & Management, Georg Eble, October 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s stock price has plummeted by 69% from its all-time high in 2021 due to soaring costs and technical problems with turbines. The offshore wind industry has faced significant financial challenges, and \u00d8rsted has been particularly affected by rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, and project delays. These issues have severely impacted investor confidence, forcing the company to cut investment and capacity targets while suspending dividend payments in an attempt to stabilize its finances. [Business World Agency, Anonymous, October 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial troubles have made it an acquisition target, with Norwegian oil and gas giant Equinor purchasing a 9.8% stake in the company for approximately $2.5 billion. While Equinor frames the acquisition as a strategic move to expand its renewable energy portfolio, the purchase highlights \u00d8rsted\u2019s weakened financial position and vulnerability to external takeovers. The deal also raises concerns about the increasing influence of fossil fuel companies in the renewable energy sector, potentially altering \u00d8rsted\u2019s long-term strategic direction. [Les Echos, Les Echos, October 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to sell a significant stake in its UK offshore wind farms to Brookfield for $2.3 billion. This asset divestment is part of the company\u2019s broader effort to restore investor confidence after a sharp decline in its stock price due to rising costs and supply chain problems. While the sale provides \u00d8rsted with much-needed liquidity, it also reduces its ownership in key renewable energy assets, potentially weakening its long-term market position in the offshore wind sector. [Business World Agency, Anonymous, October 30, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles have led to a major restructuring effort, including the trimming of investment and capacity targets, the suspension of dividend payments, and the sale of assets. These drastic measures reflect the severe financial strain the company is under, as it struggles with rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and higher interest rates. The restructuring raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to maintain its leadership in the offshore wind sector while managing its financial instability.
