[Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued that any compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should be funded by the State of Western Australia because it granted the mining tenements, but the WA government maintains that Fortescue should pay, creating further uncertainty over the company's financial liability.

[AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue began mining at the Solomon hub in 2013 without an agreement from the Yindjibarndi\u2019s registered native title body and instead dealt with a breakaway group, raising ethical concerns about its treatment of traditional owners.

Lawyers for Element Zero and its \nexecutives on Wednesday flagged a move to have Fortescue's suit struck out, saying the accusations had caused \n\"ongoing reputational damage\" to all three men, and the orders were improperly obtained by Fortescue.\nAppearing for Element Zero, John Hennessy SC told the court the original orders were won on the basis of \"the \nweakest of weak prima facie cases\".\n\"We say the order was improperly obtained, off on the back of what was egregious material non disclosure, and so \nwe don't want it to continue any longer than it must out there in the marketplace,\" he said.\nMr Hennessy flagged plans to introduce evidence showing Fortescue employees had previously met with Element \nZero to discuss the company's technology, which it says is not based on any work conducted by the men at \nFortescue.\nThe court was told Mr Kolodziejczyk also planned to introduce evidence he was allowed by Fortescue to take some \ndocuments with him when he resigned.\nFortescue's lawyer told the court the company would \"refute\" the allegations it won the orders improperly.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue's secret search 'improper'\n\"There was no material nondisclosure,\" he said.\nThe computers and electronic devices seized in the raids are currently held at the offices of an independent lawyer, \nand Element Zero and its directors will also seek to have the original search orders overturned and their property \nreturned.\nDetails of Fortescue's case, and of the new allegations by Element Zero, remain subject to suppression orders.\nThe case centres around allegations made by Fortescue that Element Zero directors used confidential Fortescue \nintellectual property about Fortescue's carbon-dioxide free green iron technology to found their own company.\nThe matter will return to court in August.\nMr Masterman this month took aim at the hydrogen technology at the centre of his former employer's \"green steel\" \nstrategy.\nHe revealed that key customers in Asia had directly questioned the merits of using -hydrogen to make steel, \narguing that Element Zero's technology would be far more energy efficient than rival green steel techniques that \ninvolved the use of hydrogen.\nElement Zero's technology involves removing many of the impurities in iron ore by running renewable electricity \nthrough a chemical -solution. Mr Masterman previously said such an approach would require less renewable energy \nthan rival plans involving hydrogen DRI (direct reduced ironmaking), which require using renewable energy to \nproduce hydrogen then used to process the iron ore.\nLoad-Date: June 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Nick Evans\nDate: June 27, 2024\nTitle: Fortescue's secret search 'improper'\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Hick joins Evolution after fleeing Fortescue\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Valerina Changarathil\n### Date: July 02, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nHick joins Evolution after fleeing Fortescue\nHick joins Evolution after fleeing Fortescue\nThe Australian\nJuly 2, 2024 Tuesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 15\nLength: 555 words\nByline: Valerina Changarathil\nBody\nFormer Fortescue chief executive Fiona Hick, who quit the Andrew Forrest camp last year after less than six \nmonths in the top job over \"differences of opinion\", has joined Evolution Mining's board.\nMs Hick, an executive with nearly three decades of experience, including roles at Woodside Energy and Rio Tinto, \nsaid she was thrilled to be joining Evolution, where she will also join its risk and sustainability committee.\n\"Having recently accompanied the Evolution board on a visit to the Cowal and Northparkes operations, it has \nreinforced my view of the quality of the people and assets within the company,\" Ms Hick said. \"I'm thrilled to be \njoining the board and supporting Evolution's exciting future.\" Ms Hick quit Fortescue in August 2023 after less than \nsix months in the job.
