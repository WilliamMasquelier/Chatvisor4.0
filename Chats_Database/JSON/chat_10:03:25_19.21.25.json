Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 14\nLength: 553 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue says the cost of mining iron ore in Western Australia could rise by almost 10 per cent in the next year, a \nsign the resources industry's inflation woes are not over.\nThe prediction for higher unit costs comes as the miner cuts 700 jobs in a bid to reduce duplication across its white-\ncollar workforce and aims to increase sales volumes.\nFortescue told investors that it was likely to lift export volumes above the 191.6 million tonnes shipped in the \nprevious financial year, and wanted to export between 190 million and 200 million tonnes in the next 12 months.\nHigher sales volumes shrink unit costs, but Fortescue said the unit costs in WA's Pilbara iron ore district would rise \nby between 1 per cent and 9 per cent in the next 12 months, despite the likely increase in sales volumes.\nFortescue's unit costs rose 4 per cent over the past year; it now costs the company 48 per cent more to dig up iron \nore than it did in 2018. Further cost pressures are expected; the amount of waste rock Fortescue digs up to access \nsaleable iron ore - known as the \"strip ratio\" - is expected to be higher over the next four years.\nFortescue mining boss Dino Otranto said the need to move more waste rock was a factor driving costs higher. \n\"Strip ratios are increasing over the mid term,\" he told investors yesterday.\nResources companies are also being hit with requests for higher wages and escalating energy costs.\nAsked about the job cuts, Mr Otranto said Fortescue had \"always maintained the leanest structure possible to \nmake sure we are competitive and the leading [unit cost] player in the market\".\nFortescue chief financial officer Apple Paget said the miner would also use technology and innovation to mitigate \nrising costs at the mines. Further adoption of autonomous haulage shapes as one way Fortescue might be able to \nlower costs. The company is considering whether to purchase construction machine manufacturer Liebherr's \nautonomous vehicles.\nPage 2 of 2\nSurging iron ore mining costs plague Fortescue's year ahead\nFortescue's budgeted spending on fleet replacement and decarbonisation of its mines in the year ahead was also \nhigher than analysts had expected. UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw described the guidance as \"in-line to soft\".\nFortescue's cost woes come after Whitehaven Coal managing director Paul Flynn warned last week that \ninflationary pressures remained \"rife\" despite rising unemployment.\nSeveral coal miners have reported a doubling of unit costs since 2016.\nFortescue shipped 191.2 million tonnes of iron ore in the 12 months to June 30; the first time in five years it has \nreported a sequential decline in export volumes. It shipped 192 million tonnes in the previous financial year.\nThe decline in volumes was caused by the derailment of an ore car in December. Fortescue tried to make up for \nthat outage with a fast finish to the financial year; the export rate over the past three months was higher than ever.\nAnalyst consensus, measured by Bloomberg, suggests Fortescue is on track to post a $US6.11 billion ($9.3 billion) \nunderlying profit next month, up from $US5.5 billion last year.\nThe promise to ship up to 200 million tonnes in the next year includes a target for the struggling Iron Bridge \nmagnetite project in WA of between 5 million and 9 million tonnes. It has fallen short of earlier targets.\nFortescue shares fell $1.18, or 5.5 per cent, yesterday to close at $20.14.\nLoad-Date: July 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
