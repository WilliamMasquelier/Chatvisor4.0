Pg. 2\nLength: 766 words\nByline: PERRY WILLIAMS, CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT, EXCLUSIVE\nBody\nAustralia's biggest promoter of green hydrogen, Andrew Forrest, has axed an investment pact with US hydrogen \ngiant Plug Power in the latest blow for the hyped clean energy power source, as developers pull back from projects \nfollowing the election of Donald Trump.\nThe billionaire's Fortescue has been a major cheerleader for the nascent technology, signing a multi-pronged deal \nin 2022 to partner with Plug Power both as a potential supplier of electrolysers for the company's projects, and as a \njoint venture partner with Fortescue in the US hydrogen market.\nThe pair inked a deal for the Australian resources major to take up to a 40 per cent stake in Plug's Texas hydrogen \nplant and for Plug to take up to a 25 per cent stake in a plant Fortescue wants to build in -Arizona.\nHowever, Fortescue told The Australian the partnership has now been dissolved as it more broadly reconsiders its \nown development timelines for pushing ahead with projects.\nIt signals an ongoing retreat by the nation's most prominent cheerleader for green hydrogen, with Dr Forrest only a \nfew years ago boasting that the company's green-energy ambitions would one day make it -bigger than the world's \nbiggest oil producer, Saudi Aramco.\nThe Australian revealed this week that more than 60 projects have been paused or shut down due to high \nproduction costs, infrastructure bottlenecks and soft -demand from would-be inter-national buyers.\nWhen Fortescue and Plug signed the investment accord in 2023, a joint statement spoke of a common mission to \nbuild out and scale up a global green hydrogen ecosystem.\n\"We believe there is strong demand globally for the green hydrogen we will produce and we must move quickly to \nmeet that demand,\" Fortescue said in October 2023.\nHowever, last year Dr Forrest launched a sweeping restructure at For-tescue in the face of the -company's failure to \ndeliver on its green-energy -promises.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest axes US green hydrogen partnership\nFortescue said in February this year it was reconsidering the development time frames for its green hydrogen \nproject in Arizona and for a green hydrogen project in Gladstone in Queensland linked to its electrolyser \nmanufacturing facility.\nPlug Power said on Wednesday its Texas plant had now been delayed due to Mr Trump's anti-green energy focus, \na fresh setback after it had already announced $US971m in writedowns earlier this week and looming job cuts.\nFortescue and Plug in Australia had previously teamed up for the Gibson Island ammonia plant in Queensland but \nthe project has -effectively been shelved amid concerns over high power prices.\nOne of Australia's biggest renewable energy investors, the AustralianSuper-backed Quinbrook Infrastructure \nPartners, said green hydrogen had been hit by a reality check.\n\"The hope around green hydrogen is getting a dose of the fundamental cost challenges that appear unlikely to be \novercome by any of the production tax credits that might be on offer,\" Quinbrook co-founder David Scaysbrook \nsaid.\n\"Some of the projects were overly ambitious in expecting a market to develop and I think ultimately there's been a \nlack of customer demand at the price points. Everyone's hopes around market development and customers \ncommitting just haven't materialised.\" As part of its flagship Future Made in Australia plan, the -Albanese \ngovernment in 2024 provided a budget allocation of $6.7bn to provide a $2 incentive for every kilogram of green \nhydrogen produced from 2027-28. It also committed $2bn for new projects under the Hydrogen Headstart program.\n\"That $2 per kilogram hasn't been enough to make a difference,\" Mr Scaysbrook said. \"It certainly doesn't appear to \nbe making enough difference for the projects that are now falling over.\" In the US, green hydrogen producers were \nexpecting to tap into a $US3/kg tax incentive. But Mr Trump has indicated the Inflation Reduction Act which \ncontained the subsidy is likely to be wound back.\n\"Probably under this administration no one will be developing green hydrogen projects in the US even with the \n$US3 /kg leg-up - even if it remained,\" Mr Scaysbrook said.\nGreen hydrogen - produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen through zero-emissions technologies - has \nso far proven to be more hype than a major new energy source, its critics maintain.\nThe battle to build a hydrogen export industry from scratch also looms as a major political divide ahead of the \nfederal election. Labor has included green hydrogen as a central plank in its plan for Australia to become a \nrenewable energy superpower. Energy Minister Chris Bowen said in September it was \"no exaggeration\" to say \ngreen hydrogen would be on the ballot paper.\nLoad-Date: March 5, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | CEO of Fortescue | \"We believe there is strong demand globally for the green hydrogen we will produce and we must move quickly to meet that demand.\" | N.A. |\n| David Scaysbrook | Co-founder of Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners | \"Some of the projects were overly ambitious in expecting a market to develop and I think ultimately there's been a lack of customer demand at the price points.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
