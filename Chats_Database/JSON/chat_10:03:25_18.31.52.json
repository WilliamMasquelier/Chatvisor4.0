Gold has also had double-digit returns in \nmost other major currencies, including the Australian dollar, where it has surged by an impressive 25 per cent.\nThese gains have been driven by investor optimism about upcoming US interest rate cuts and lingering geopolitical \nrisks. In the past three interest rate easing -cycles in the US, the US dollar gold price has averaged an increase of \n40 per cent.\nDespite the gold price being near all-time high levels, gold equities have underperformed. Since August 2020, when \nthe Australian gold equities index was at its all-time high, gold equities have underperformed the gold price by about \n45 per cent. In our view, the potential for gold equities to catch up is a significant opportunity for investors, given the \nfundamentals for gold remain very strong.\nTo date, gold's performance has been due to significant buying from central banks and eastern investors who have \nmainly acquired physical gold. In contrast, western investors, who typically favour gold mining equities, have for the \nlarge part not participated in the gold run so far.\nRecent figures indicate that the average investor currently holds less than 1 per cent of gold in their total portfolio, \nwhich is significantly less than the four-decade average of 2 per cent. This is even lower than the estimated 6 per \ncent in 1980 when the last inflation-led gold bull market occurred and the gold price reached its all-time high of \nabout $US2850 per ounce on an inflation-adjusted basis. The potential entry of western investors and a higher gold \nprice is likely to be a tailwind for the gold equities to rerate higher. The fight for relevance in investor portfolios has \nbeen challenging for the gold sector versus other more favoured sectors, such as technology. Persistent cost \npressures have negatively impacted gold miners' ability to generate free cashflow and provide an attractive return to \ninvestors.\nHowever, with gold prices now rising faster than inflation, cash margins are expanding. We estimate that the \naverage cash margin for the Australian gold miners is at record levels of $1700 an ounce of gold produced. Recent \ncompany results indicate this is being translated into financial performance, with Australian gold miners such as \nPage 2 of 2\nA golden opportunity as stocks trail the commodity's price\nNorthern Star and Ramelius generating strong free cashflow, allowing them to return capital to investors through \nincreased dividends.\nThe relative valuation of gold miners versus the rest of the market is also attractive. Based on forward earnings \nmultiples, Aus-tralian gold miners are trading at a 40 per cent discount to the rest of the market. In addition, the \nmarket consensus gold price for the next 12 months is about 10 per cent lower than the current gold price of $3780 \nin Australian dollars. Should the gold price remain at these levels for an extended period, then the market will need \nto upgrade its forward earnings forecasts, making gold equities even cheaper. Gold miners' cashflow generation \npotential and attractive valuation compared to the rest of the market cannot be ignored by the market for too long.\nThe disconnect in equity performance is even more apparent in the gold developers and explorers. The \noutperformance of developers and explorers is typically later in the cycle when investors are looking for value \nfurther down the mine life cycle. At current discounted levels, it remains cheaper to acquire someone else's ounces \nthan it is to discover new ounces. The potential for sector consolidation could further enhance the appeal of gold \nminers as an investment, particularly in an environment where the price of physical gold continues to rise, and more \ninvestors seek exposure.\nThe Victor Smorgon Group has been well placed in gold for some time now and has capitalised on the record run of \nthe precious metal.
