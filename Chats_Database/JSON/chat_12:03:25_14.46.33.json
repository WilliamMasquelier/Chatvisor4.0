Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else.

In all, Victoria sees potential for 13GW of offshore \nwind capacity by 2050, five times the current renewable generation in Victoria.\nThe target drew a plethora of some of the world's largest global energy companies to submit an application for a so-\ncalled feasibility licence, and Shell was understood to have been told late last year that it was in line to -secure a \npermit if it could overcome a boundary dispute.\nUntangling the dispute was seen as inevitable, but Shell determined it would not proceed with its initial application \nas it delivers on chief executive Wael Sawan's commitment to be \"ruthless\" in focusing on financial performance. A \nShell spokeswoman -confirmed the decision, but said the company remained confident in the viability of offshore \nwind in Australia.\n\"After careful consideration, including more than two years of pre-feasibility work, Shell Australia withdrew from the \nfeasibility licence application process for offshore wind development in Gippsland, Victoria earlier this year,\" a \nspokeswoman said.\n\"In Australia, Shell is focusing on growing our low-carbon -energy portfolio including via -onshore wind and battery \nenergy storage projects. Australia's abundant offshore wind resources have strong -potential to help Australia \nachieve net zero emissions by 2050 and Shell continues to have confidence in the establishment of a sustainable \nAustralian offshore wind industry.\" Despite Shell's public commitment to the industry, Australia's offshore wind \nindustry was expected to be extremely expensive, industry sources said. While the industry expected costs to come \nPage 2 of 2\nShell quietly shelves offshore wind plans\ndown, industry sources said current projections had new projects costing about $300 per megawatt, well in excess \nof the current wholesale price of about $120.\nOffshore wind is substantially more expensive than onshore wind and solar, and Shell is understood to have \ndeveloped plans to focus instead on onshore alternatives.\nThere are also substantial costs associated with moving towards a final investment decision associated with \noffshore wind.\nThe 12 projects granted a feasibility licence by the federal Labor government will now begin seabed and \nenvironmental studies to confirm the suitability for an offshore wind project.\nShould all projects proceed to construction, the industry is also concerned about winners being picked.\nThe 12 projects that have -secured a feasibility licence have a combined capacity of 25GW, nearly double the target \nVictoria has offered to underwrite.\nSources familiar with the thinking of the Victorian government acknowledge that not all the 12 projects are likely to -\nmaterialise and those that do will be ready at different times.\nVictoria plans to incrementally stimulate developments. It has scheduled staggered so-called contract for different \nauditions that will determine how much fin-ancial support is offered to developers.\nThere are concerns about Victoria's capacity to pay as the state budget deficit increases. However, the industry \nacknowledges that offshore wind is vital for the country's transition.\nVictoria has Australia's most aggressive climate goals. Victoria plans to have zero emission sources account for 95 \nper cent of its energy needs by 2035 and to be net zero by 2045.\nThe target is likely to end the use of coal in the state, with EnergyAustralia's Yallourn set to close in 2028, while the \nstate's largest, AGL Energy's Loy Yang A, is expected to shutter in 2035.\nA Victorian government spokesman said: \"We're building Australia's first offshore wind energy industry and learning \nfrom global leaders in the sector to ensure our auction process is competitive and results in the timely delivery of \nprojects.\n\"It is normal for developers to explore projects and then stop work on them, for a variety of reasons internal to their \nbusiness.\" He said the 12 approved offshore wind projects could \"generate 25GW of electricity - more than enough \nto meet Victoria's energy needs\".\nLoad-Date: May 29, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
