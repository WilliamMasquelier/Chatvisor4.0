Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue chairman | \"There is an overarching message here: you're not going to be paid to develop technology with a whole heap of other people, at really serious risk and cost to the entire company and your workmates ... and then send that technology to another email address and think that's OK.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue chairman | \"That's not OK.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue chairman | \"You want to send emails full of our data over there then eliminate it, you'll be held to the full responsibility of the law.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue chairman | \"We're getting out of iron ore, which is very interesting because we're going, as soon as we can ... to green metal.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
