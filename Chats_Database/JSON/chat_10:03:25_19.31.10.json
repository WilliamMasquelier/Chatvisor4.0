Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Dino Otranto | Co-Chief Executive | \"We will show the world that it is possible to make green iron metal - 95 per cent plus pig iron that is in granules out of Pilbara-based iron ore with hydrogen as a reducing agent, derived from the sun and in the future, the wind.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Co-Chief Executive | \"So within a year, you'll see us making, I think, further announcements around what the next stage of green iron development in Australia or around the world will look like.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Co-Chief Executive | \"Mr Otranto said the company was focused on proving its green iron technology at the Christmas Creek plant, and would scope sites around the world with abundant renewable energy sources.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Chairman | \"Fortescue, chaired by billionaire founder Andrew Forrest, aiming to produce its first green metal from Pilbara ores within a year from its $US50m Christmas Creek pilot plant.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
