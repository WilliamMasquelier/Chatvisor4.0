Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: WORLD; Pg. 14\nLength: 481 words\nByline: Hans van Leeuwen | AFR correspondent\nBody\nLondon | Fortescue boss Andrew Forrest says he has already received overtures from Donald Trump, and he will \nurge the US president-elect to switch from a \"drill, baby, drill\" push for more fossil fuels to a renewables-focused \npolicy of \"build, baby, build\".\nSpeaking from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, where he is attending the annual COP climate summit that many \nCEOs have shunned this year, Dr Forrest eschewed his usual high-intensity rhetoric on the climate crisis, instead \ntalking Trump's language of dollars and cents.\nHe said Fortescue had estimated the cost of sticking with natural gas at its iron ore operations would leave \"not a \nlot of change at all out of $US17 to $US18 billion\" ($26 to $28 billion) - almost three times the $US6.2 billion cost of \nthe miner's \"real zero\" shift to fully renewable power.\n\"The president-elect's office did reach out to us on the night of the election. And we'll be more than pleased to \nexplain why real zero is the cut-through for financing what I call the economic transition,\" he said.\nTrump, a climate sceptic, has vowed to junk President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which is offering \n$US369 billion of subsidies and incentives to companies involved in the energy transition, including Fortescue.\nInstead, he wants the federal government to get behind a renewed expansion of the oil and gas industry, using the \nslogan \"drill, baby, drill\".\nDr Forrest conceded the slogan was \"kind of interesting, catchy\".\n\"But look where it's got us - it's got us to unreliable, unpredictable, fluctuating energy prices, which have had an \nextreme negative effect on everyone's living costs,\" he said.\n\"What I say is, 'build, baby, build': build out these [green energy] systems, replace fossil fuel completely and \nforever, and it's a great investment.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest uses dollars to make sense with Trump Energy transition\n\"What the president-elect will look at hard, climate sceptic or not, is that the best investment the US can make is \nsitting on the table. And it's proven, thanks to Fortescue.\"\nAlthough Fortescue has scaled back some of its energy-transition plans, particularly on green hydrogen, it still \nhopes to decarbonise its mining operations in the Pilbara, without relying on carbon offsets, by 2030.\nIn the US, Fortescue has allocated $US550 million to its proposed Phoenix Hydrogen Hub, envisaging an 80-\nmegawatt electrolyser and liquefaction plant with a production capacity of up to 11,000 tonnes a year of liquid green \nhydrogen.\nDr Forrest said that winding back the IRA would be unlikely to shift Fortescue's US investment plans, \"but it would \nmake other projects around the world more attractive\".\nAxing the IRA would \"certainly make the US less competitive\", he said. \"'Drill, baby' drill' - as opposed to 'build, \nbaby, build' - is not going to drive economic growth. It's not going to drive full employment.\"\nDr Forrest said he was using COP29 in Baku to road-test his pitch to the Trump administration.\nLoad-Date: November 18, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
