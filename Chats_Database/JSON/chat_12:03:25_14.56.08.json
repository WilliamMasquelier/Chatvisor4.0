Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nShell, PetroChina plan to expand Surat gas project\nShell, PetroChina plan to expand Surat gas project\nAustralian Financial Review\nAugust 13, 2024 Tuesday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 17\nLength: 713 words\nByline: Angela Macdonald-Smith\nBody\nShell and PetroChina will expand the huge Surat coal seam gas project in Queensland, a decision that will be met \nwith dismay from environmental activists but which should provide supply for an increasingly stretched market.\nGas from the project extension will supply both domestic and export customers through the Queensland Curtis LNG \nplant near Gladstone.\nThe project, the second phase of the Arrow Energy joint venture, is expected to supply 130 million cubic feet a day \nof gas at peak production, enough to power almost 1 million homes.\nThe first phase of the project, some 90 billion cubic feet a year, began in 2020 and is now in production. It is \nexpected to cost about $2 billion. Shell did not give an estimated cost for the second phase, but it is also expected \nto reach into the billions of dollars.\nThe decision to proceed with the second phase of the Arrow project follows increasingly urgent warnings from the \nAustralian Energy Market Operator about the need for investment in new gas supply to head off shortages \nexpected later this decade on peak-demand winter days.\n\"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to \nmarket,\" said Zoe Yujnovich, director of integrated gas and upstream for Shell.\n\"This investment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a lower-\nemissions alternative.\"\nStill, the drilling of the up to 450 new wells involved will only maintain existing supplies rather than increase \nproduction and does not address shortfalls that are looming because of declines in supplies in the southern states, \nsaid Rick Wilkinson, chief executive of consultancy EnergyQuest.\n\"This makes no change at all to the supply-demand balance and the requirement for new gas to come on for the \neast coast of Australia,\" he said.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell, PetroChina plan to expand Surat gas project\nMr Wilkinson said that for the full development of the project, thousands of wells needed to be drilled, \"so this is one \nstep of many that are required for capital to be allocated to the project to maintain flat production\".\nArrow, jointly owned by Shell and its Chinese state-owned partner, holds the largest reserve of undeveloped gas \non the east coast, where elevated contract prices and a limited choice of supply have been sources of constant \ncomplaint among manufacturers.\nShell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said the project would support up to 400 jobs and create opportunities for \ncontractors and local suppliers.\n\"At its core, this project promotes stronger regional communities, and it also has wider benefits for Australian \nmanufacturing and industry more broadly,\" said Ms Wake.\nShell said the project was underpinned by a 27-year sales deal between Arrow and QGC, a division of the London-\nbased oil and gas giant. In investor briefings last year, the company flagged that it would secure additional gas for \nits LNG facilities in Queensland \"to increase value for shareholders\". The second phase of the project will require \nthe construction of 27 kilometres of pipelines, as well as other infrastructure upgrades.\nIt is opposed by farming families and landholders in the Darling Downs, who said they were worried about the risk \nof damage to water and land. The project is also opposed by environmental groups, concerned about increased \nemissions from fossil fuel production.\nThe go-ahead comes despite years of annual losses by Arrow. The company had originally intended to develop four \nLNG export projects in Queensland but abandoned those plans after the first three plants were built.\nShell later took over BG Group in one of the biggest takeovers in the oil sector, giving it ownership of one of those \nthree plants, Queensland Curtis LNG.\nIt opted to use gas from the Arrow project to instead supply that plant, a major facility near Gladstone, Queensland \nthat was completed in 2014.\nArrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said production from this second phase was expected to start in 2026. \nConstruction will begin later this year. Surat is expected to comprise up to 2500 gas wells and produce 4000 \npetajoules of gas in total.\n\"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify \nArrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast,\" Mr Peng said in a statement.\nLoad-Date: August 15, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
