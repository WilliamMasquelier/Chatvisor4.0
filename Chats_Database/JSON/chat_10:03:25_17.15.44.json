Inflation, recessions and stifled economic growth have dominated \ninvestment fundamentals, but given the swift increase of interest rates last year, Bosio reckons investors have been \nable to take advantage of cash as a genuine, no-risk investment class paying more than 5 per cent in some \ninstances.\nBut now there's a whiff of lower rates in the air, we may see investors adjust their asset allocation into higher \nrisk/return sectors.\nBeneficiaries? Bosio likes real estate investment trust funds (REITs) and listed investment companies (LICs) that \nmay have a funding cost (debt profile) that will improve in an environment where rates decline.\nAnd because he's dedicated gold bull, Bosio says the gold sector looks perfectly positioned for strength.\nHere are his three picks for the great unwind: Ramelius Resources: \"Strong balance sheet, new projects being \ndeveloped to drive production and acquisitive team/management who have executed a consistent strategy to \nacquire targets whereby they can leverage discovery success and production ounces.\" WAM Capital: WAM is a \nlisted investment company with a focus on small to medium-sized businesses and a large, diversified portfolio.\n\"Weak performance in the current environment has resulted in a lower share price. However, the yield has been \nhistorically high and a significant attraction to income-focused investors,\" Bosio says.\nCenturia Capital: An REIT with various listed alternatives including office and industrial companies. For Bosio, \nCenturia is a quality small-cap property company with a strong track record of acquiring and managing assets.\nBroker upgrades Ord Minnett likes the look of Dropsuite. Founded in Singapore in 2011, Dropsuite is a cloud-based \nsoftware platform offering back-up, archiving and recovery solutions for businesses.\nPage 2 of 2\nHow to cash in as risk returns\nThe company specialises in protecting critical data used by Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, QuickBooks and \nothers. Its products are distributed via a network of about 4000 IT reseller partners globally.\nAt the Inspire Conference 2023 in August, it copped a bit of a hit when Microsoft provided a first look at its 365 \nBackup and Archive solution. Dropsuite's price fell 22 per cent on the day and has not recovered since.\nOrd Minnett was not convinced. \"Based on our work and discussions with industry participants, we conclude that \nfears of any existential risk to DSE's business are overblown. Accordingly, we believe the market's scepticism is \nproviding an opportunity.\" Ords has initiated a buy rating on the stock with a price target of 33c, against about 28c \nat present.\nOrd Minnett believes DSE operates at the intersection of three mega-trends - the rise of cybercrime, the migration \nof on-premise hosting to the cloud, and managed service provider industry growth.\nIt is also impressed with the fact DSE management has built a $150m business on just $43m of outside capital (of \nwhich only about $18m has been spent), and delivered positive free cash flow in each of the past six quarters.\nOver at Taylor Collison, IPD Groupis on the radar.A distributor of electrical infrastructure products to major \nconstruction and renewables projects nationwide, IPD offers a \"picks and shovel\" exposure to the booming \nelectrical sector without taking on individual project or contract risks common to contractors and other listed players.\nThis is an industry that's booming, and Taylor Collison reckons there's a strong argument we are still in the early \nstages of a major infrastructure project upswing.\nIt's put a 12-month price target of $4.80 on IPD, versus a price of about $4.69 this week. \"Their capital allocation \nrecord is excellent, and there's a long runway to deploy capital to match the market leader's offering,\" it says.\nLoad-Date: January 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# How to cash in as risk returns\n## The Australian\n### Stockhead\n### January 13, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Ramelius Resources, to report.
