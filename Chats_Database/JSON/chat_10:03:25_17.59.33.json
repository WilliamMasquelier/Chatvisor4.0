It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 3\nFortescue outlines IP theft case\nFortescue outlines IP theft case\nThe Australian\nAugust 8, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKETWATCH; Pg. 21\nLength: 1033 words\nByline: CAMERON ENGLAND\nBody\nElement Zero could not have invented then designed and constructed its green iron pilot plant in the time frame \nclaimed with the budget available to it, a Fortescue employee says, in documents lodged by the iron ore major in \nits federal court case against former employees it says stole intellectual property.\nFortescue has alleged that three former executives including long-term Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman, as \nwell as Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen, stole intellectual property developed by Fortescue Future \nIndustries (FFI), and used it to launch Element Zero.\nThe case, lodged early this year, has involved claims that Fortescue, chaired by billionaire founder Andrew Forrest, \ndirectly instructed private investigators to follow the families of former employees to schools and child care centres \nand rummaged through their mail.\nIn a trove of documents filed by Fortescue and released by the court on Wednesday, the company paints a picture \nof why it suspected its intellectual property had been stolen.\nIn one of several affidavits lodged by Fortescue, employee Wayne McFaull says Fortescue's law firm Davies \nCollison Cave Law (DCCL) asked him to compare the timelines and costs of the technologies developed by both \ncompanies.\n\"DCCL asked me to provide my opinion as to whether I consider that Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen \ncould have invented the Element Zero process and then designed and constructed the Element Zero plant in the \ntime available to them between their leaving Fortescue in November 2021 and the Element Zero plant being \noperational in January 2024 (a 26-month period),\" he says in his affidavit.\n\"Based on my analysis of the Fortescue project, the similarity between the Fortescue plant and the Element Zero \nplant, and the reasons below, in my opinion it would not have been possible to deliver the Element Zero plant by \nJanuary 2024, unless the basis of design documents were commenced 12 months earlier in January 2023.\" Mr \nMcFaull was asked by the lawyers to assume Element Zero had access to $5m in funding in its first 20 months.\nPage 2 of 3\nFortescue outlines IP theft case\n\"DCCL then asked me to provide my opinion as to whether or not this funding was sufficient to finance the Element \nZero project in the first 20 months, assuming that my estimated project timeline is correct,\" he says.\nMr McFaull says that referring to what Fortescue spent to get to a similar point of development - a figure which was \nredacted - \"I do not consider that funding of $5m was anywhere near sufficient to finance a process R&D project in \nthe nature and complexity of the Fortescue project and the Element Zero project during the period of December 1, \n2021 to August 1, 2023\".\nMr McFaull also says there is an \"unexplained resource deficit\" in terms of funds, however that figure was also been \nredacted.\nAn affidavit from another Fortescue employee, Anand Bhatt, says he constructed a timeline of when Dr \nKolodziejczyk must have started work on the process of using ionic liquids and low temperature iron reduction, \ndating back to June 2020, and running up until the time Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen left Fortescue.\nHowever, a search of the IT systems at Fortescue, which should have revealed documents such as drafts of \nprovisional patents and analysis of data, found gaps during key periods when the two men were assumed to have \nbeen working on the processes.\n\"I am therefore concerned that Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen have intentionally not uploaded onto the \nFortescue IT system and/or taken and/or deleted the above work product during or prior to ceasing their \nemployment with Fortescue,\" Dr Bhatt says.\n\"Based on my analysis of Dr Kolodziejczyk's work on the ionic process at Fortescue ... and my understanding of \nthe Element Zero process ... I consider that the Element Zero process is substantially the same process as that \nwhich Dr Kolodziejczyk took steps to develop while employed at Fortescue. That is because both processes are \nbased on a hydroxide electrolyte where the water has been removed to make an ionic liquid.\" Dr Bhatt also says he \nreviewed Dr Winther-Jensen's email folders at Fortescue and \"identified five documents of concern that Dr \nWinther-Jensen emailed from his Fortescue professional email address ... to his personal email address ... \nbetween his resignation from Fortescue on November 3, 2021 and his final day at Fortescue, November 12, \n2021\".\n\"Each of the five documents is confidential and directly relevant to the Fortescue project.\n\"Following my review ... I consider that the leaching technical report, iron ore leaching update, TEA Sheet and TEA \nCovering Email contain information that would be of particular value in progressing a competing research and \ndevelopment project in relation to the purification of iron ore utilising electrochemical reduction.\n\"I cannot conceive of any legitimate reason for Dr Winther-Jensen to have sent an email attaching any of these \ndocuments in the November 2021 period. I am concerned that the confidential information in each document could \nhave been misused, could continue to be misused and/or may in the future be misused by Dr Winther-Jensen and \nElement Zero.\" FFI employee Adrian Huber has also claimed in his affidavit that Dr Kolodziejczyk was the subject of \ncomplaints he misrepresented his qualifications.\nA subsequent Deloitte investigation, Mr Huber's affidavit says, found Dr Kolodziejczyk made \"material \nmisrepresentations and inaccuracies in respect of activities, positions held and qualifications\" in his CV.\nA letter published as part of the trove of documents also raises concerns about Dr Kolodziejczyk's behaviour \nfollowing his resigning from FFI in mid-2021, and then later retracting his resignation.\n\"All of us who serve at FFI, would like to support you and see you successful,\" the letter, from then-FFI CEO Julie \nShuttleworth says. \"Bart, this however will necessitate a substantial behavioural change by you and leads me to our \nchairman's chief concern, to your failure to be a positive and encouraging leader.\" The nature of the concerns about \nDr Kolodziejczyk's behaviour are not detailed in the letter. The matter is scheduled to return to court for an \ninterlocutory hearing on Thursday.Page 3 of 3\nFortescue outlines IP theft case\nLoad-Date: August 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
