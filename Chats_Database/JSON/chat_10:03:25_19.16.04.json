Up to 700 jobs will go in the massive cutbacks after the iron ore mogul pulled back from \nthe company's goal of producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030.\nDr Forrest is understood to have addressed Fortescue staff on Wednesday afternoon, flagging a major round of \nredundancies - -including the departure of more of the company's senior -management.\nThe concession that For-tescue cannot meet its green--hydrogen targets represents a major retreat by Dr Forrest, \nwho only a few years ago was boasting that the company's green-energy ambitions would one day make it -bigger \nthan Saudi energy giant Aramco.\nThe move also punches a hole in Labor's emissions transition plan, with the government providing $8bn in \ninvestment and support for hydrogen production as part of a push for Australia to become a key player in global -\nefforts to achieve net zero.\nAnthony Albanese has pinned the government's hopes on green hydrogen, solar and wind as key supply sources \nthat can hand the nation \"energy sovereignty\".\nThe changes at Fortescue include the departure of senior operational staff in the company's iron ore division, -\nincluding senior mine managers, amid widespread expectations that the company has failed to meet its annual \nproduction -targets.\nSources say the changes affect far more than the company's energy division, which has burned hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in examining potential green--hydrogen and ammonia sites across the world, but has so far only \ndelivered three final investment decisions in the would-be green-energy portfolio. Those three projects include a \nPage 2 of 2\nTwiggy out: 2030 fuel fantasy over\nsmall hydrogen plant in Gladstone in Queensland, a second -hydrogen project in Arizona in the US, and a green-\niron commercial pilot plant in Western Australia's Pilbara.\nAll three remain in For-tescue's development portfolio, along with a green-ammonia -project in -Norway and one in \nBrazil. The company is also still -working on some earlier-stage projects, such as a joint venture in Morocco.\nBut a swag of others have been \"deprioritised\". Fortescue is effectively abandoning its green--ammonia and \nenergy projects in Canada and the US state of Washington - where Dr Forrest had promised to -replace former \ncoal-fired power plants with clean-energy production. And projects in Kenya, which were previously on the \"fast \ntrack\" list, and Argentina have been pushed back down the priority order.\nFortescue's failure to maintain the pace or exports at its flagship iron-ore division is also understood to be at the \nheart of the sweeping changes, which will only add to the chaos that has -engulfed the company over the past 18 \nmonths. A derailment on its main Pilbara line over Christmas hit export rates, as did heavy weather in February.\nThe company is still struggling to get its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project operating to anywhere close to full -\ncapacity, and has -issued multiple downgrades to its expected output over the past year.\nMarket analysts expect Fortescue to miss its 192 million tonne export guidance when the company releases its \nJune quarter production report next week, with consensus expectations -tipping the company to barely break 190 \nmillion tonnes.\nDr Forrest issued a statement on Wednesday night saying the company backed the federal government's green-\nenergy -ambitions and was investing in green electricity to support green-hydrogen supply, \"setting Fortescue for \nits role as a world supplier of harmless, environmentally friendly energy -alternatives\".\n\"We fully support the federal government's green energy ambitions for Australia,\" he said.\nDr Forrest said the government's $2 a kilogram subsidy for green hydrogen was \"absolutely imperative to get our \ncountry into a leading position to produce a replacement for oil and gas\".\n\"At the very least Fortescue's green iron plans will rely on green hydrogen,\" he said.\nDr Forrest added that \"only delinquent irresponsible leaders will advocate for the continued use of extremely \ndamaging -energy sources\" as climate change set in.\n\"Green electricity is the only source of rapid to develop, -inexpensive new sources of energy,\" he said.\nHe claimed Fortescue's green energy expansion would be done in years. In a late market announcement on \nWednesday, Fortescue said it had appointed acting chief financial officer Apple Paget to the role on a permanent \nbasis, and moved chief corporate officer Shelley Robertson to the position of chief operating officer. Fortescue \nshares closed down 23c at $22.36 on Wednesday.\nLoad-Date: July 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Billionaire, Founder of Fortescue | \"We fully support the federal government's green energy ambitions for Australia.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Billionaire, Founder of Fortescue | \"The government's $2 a kilogram subsidy for green hydrogen was absolutely imperative to get our country into a leading position to produce a replacement for oil and gas.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Billionaire, Founder of Fortescue | \"At the very least Fortescue's green iron plans will rely on green hydrogen.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Billionaire, Founder of Fortescue | \"Only delinquent irresponsible leaders will advocate for the continued use of extremely damaging energy sources.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Billionaire, Founder of Fortescue | \"Green electricity is the only source of rapid to develop, inexpensive new sources of energy.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Billionaire, Founder of Fortescue | \"Fortescue's green energy expansion would be done in years.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
