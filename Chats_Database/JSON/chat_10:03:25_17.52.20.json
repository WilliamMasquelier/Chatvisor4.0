Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 21\nLength: 677 words\nByline: Alex Gluyas\nBody\nAustralian gold funds are shaping up for a bumper year as mining companies start to capitalise on record prices, \nhelping the stocks to finally catch up to the performance of the precious metal.\nPortfolio managers were left frustrated last year after a jump in production costs held back ASX-listed gold \nproducers from riding the rally in the spot prices to record levels. The VanEck Gold Miners exchange-traded fund \nclimbed nearly 20 per cent in 2024 versus a 38 per cent rally for the gold price in Australian dollars.\nBut easing cost inflation that has plagued the mining sector for the last three years and an ongoing surge in prices \nhas seen the trend reverse course. VanEck's Gold Miners ETF is up 17 per cent already this year while the Aussie \ndollar spot price has climbed 6.3 per cent.\nLocal fund managers are bullish that gold has much further to run after the US dollar price climbed above $US2942 \nan ounce for the first time and the Australian dollar gold price breached $4500 an ounce.\nVictor Smorgon Partners' Resource Gold Fund returned a chunky 13.3 per cent in January and portfolio manager \nCameron Judd believes the valuations of ASX gold stocks still don't reflect the outlook for the yellow metal.\n\"Gold's performance in times of uncertainty or crisis could see it push towards $US3600,\" Mr Judd said. \"Despite \nthe strong gold price performance and fundamentals supporting further appreciation, gold miners are trading at \ndiscounted valuations on the ASX.\"\nWall Street's biggest banks believe a $US3000 price tag is imminent. Citi said it was possible within the next three \nmonths, while JPMorgan has a year-end target of $US3150. Bank of America said on Thursday that gold could \nreach $US3500 an ounce if investment demand rises 10 per cent this year.\nThe unprecedented surge in the gold price has been fuelled by investors seeking safe haven assets as US \nPresident Donald Trump unleashes aggressive trade and geopolitical policies. There are fears the president will \naccelerate inflation, forcing central banks to raise rates in a way that damages global growth.\nPage 2 of 2\nGold funds burst out of the blocks with rocketing returns; Commodities\nVictor Smorgon's top holdings include ASX-listed Vault Minerals and the world's largest gold miner, US-based \nNewmont, which recently acquired Newcrest. The fund also owns Australia's biggest gold miner, Northern Star, \nwhich agreed to buy rival De Grey in a $5 billion deal.\nMr Judd is also expecting international companies to make further plays for local miners and explorers given the \ncheaper valuations of ASX gold stocks, aided by a weak local currency.\n\"The lower Australian dollar makes gold miners even cheaper to buy as demand for the precious metal rises,\" Mr \nJudd said.\nCollins St Asset Management is also finally starting to reap the benefits of the catch-up in gold stocks after taking a \nstake in a basket of miners through its flagship value fund nearly two years ago. Founder Michael Goldberg said the \nopportunity was so large that the firm launched a special situations fund in March 2023 focused solely on gold \nstocks.\nHe believes the sector is finally ready to realise its potential after the Collins St Special Situation Fund surged 13 \nper cent, after fees, in January. It's up another 9 per cent so far in February.\n\"I think 2025 might be the year that we see a rapid catch-up,\" he said. \"Not relying on higher gold prices per se, but \njust a recognition by the market of the earnings potential for those companies, in particular the early-stage \nproducers.\"\nCollins St is focused on small and mid-cap companies, which have a lower cost of production, unhedged sales \nbooks and an ability to ramp up sales and output in the near term. This includes Catalyst Metals, Black Cat, \nWestgold Resources and Ramelius Resources.\nArgonaut's Global Gold Fund has also shown signs of a rebound following a disappointing 2024 when the portfolio \nreturned just 4.5 per cent net of fees. The fund stormed back in January with an 8.8 per cent return. Its top five \nholdings - Perseus Mining, Evolution Mining, Ora Banda, Ramelius Resources and Ora Gold - represented 55 per \ncent of the portfolio.\nLoad-Date: February 16, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**PERSON**: [Full Name]\n**ROLE**: [Person's role or position]\n**CONTEXT**: [Brief description of how the person is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**PERSON**: Elon Musk\n**ROLE**: CEO of Tesla and SpaceX\n**CONTEXT**: Primary subject of article, discussing company strategy\n\nOnly include people who play a meaningful role in the article's content.
