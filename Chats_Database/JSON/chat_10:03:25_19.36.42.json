Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"I have an unshakeable passion for steering the world away from a potentially catastrophic future, and will continue to steer Minderoo, Tattarang and Fortescue in the one direction - to ensure we leave our planet liveable for future generations.\" | N.A. |\n| Nicola Forrest | Co-founder of Minderoo and related to Fortescue | \"We couldn't be more proud of what has been achieved over the past 23 years and, with Minderoo's 2030 strategy now finalised and being implemented, it is the right time for change on the board.\" | N.A. |\n| Allan Myers | Chairman of Minderoo | \"The unprecedented generosity, vision and optimism of Andrew and Nicola Forrest is embodied in the Minderoo Foundation. I will do my best as chair to help realise their aspirations for the enduring benefit of Australia and the wider world.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
