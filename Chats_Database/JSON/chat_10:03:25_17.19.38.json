Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Street Talk; Pg. 14\nLength: 455 words\nByline: Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood and Emma Rapaport\nBody\nWith gold trading at record highs, investors and dealmakers in and around ASX gold stocks are making hay. One \ncompany, however, has remained uncharacteristically quiet.\nNewmont, the world's top gold producer caught headlines last year for its $26.3 billion merger with Australia's \nbiggest gold miner Newcrest, forming a $US59.5 billion dual-listed gold stock and pumping its long list of advisers \nup the M&A league table.\nAt the time, much was also made of its intention to divest six non-core assets once the acquisition wrapped up in \nNovember including WA's ageing Telfer gold mine and Havieron, which Newmont operates under a joint venture \nagreement with Greatland Gold (70 per cent/30 per cent). This was aimed at generating $US2 billion-plus ($3.05 \nbillion) in cash.\nWhile the sale of its Akyem gold mine in Ghana has reportedly drawn Chinese interest, investors haven't heard a \npeep about the local assets. Street Talk understands sell-side adviser Macquarie started preliminary preparation for \na sale process earlier in the year, but iced the mooted deal after processing operations at Telfer were suspended. \nHowever, it is understood MacCap's resources bankers are back on the tools, and soft soundings are under way.\nTelfer is a larger scale, producing asset, but it's best days are behind it. The mine hasn't made a lot of cash over the \nlast several years and would require a substantial commitment to rehabilitate it. However, its interaction with \nHavieron is interesting; one has the infrastructure, the other has the orebody. As such, they'll likely be sold together \nwith estimates around the $500 million mark.\nGiven its interest in Havieron, Greatland Gold is the obvious buyer. The London-listed firm also has pre-emptive \nrights, acquired when Newcrest and Greatland began the joint venture in 2020. Street Talk understands the Andrew \nForrest-backed company has been meeting with fund managers for months, making no secret of the fact they're \nkeen to consolidate its stake - and would use the associated raise to peg their Australian float. Investor sources told \nStreet Talk the last time they heard from Greatland was May when they were told the company was still waiting on \nsale terms from Newmont. Bank of America has been mandated on Greatland's potential ASX-listing.\nPage 2 of 2\nNewmont asset sales pegged for year end; Street Talk\nNorthern Star Resources and Evolution have both indicated a lack of interest in Telfer and Havieron, The \nAustralian Financial Review wrote in November. A mid-tier name like Genesis Minerals, Ramelius Resources, \nCapricorn Metals or Gold Road would be more likely candidates given the desire to increase market capitalisation \nand attract investors.\nRed 5/Silver Lake is also a contender on the back of it M&A ambitions and sizeable cash balance sheet.\nLoad-Date: August 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Newmont asset sales pegged for year end; Street Talk\n## Australian Financial Review\n### Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood, And Emma Rapaport\n### August 23, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Ramelius Resources, to report.

Ramelius Resources is identified as a potential buyer for Newmont's Telfer and Havieron assets, indicating its strategic interest in expanding market capitalization and attracting investors in the competitive gold mining sector.\n\n2. The article highlights that mid-tier companies like Ramelius Resources are more likely candidates for acquiring Newmont's assets compared to larger players such as Northern Star Resources and Evolution, which have expressed a lack of interest.\n\n3.
