Here's the best kept secret, bar \nnone\nSydney restaurant titan Josh Niland has been riding the wave of success these past months. He launched his first \noverseas restaurant in November. He netted a spot in the World's 50 Best Restaurants long list in May.\nAnd now, the pearl in the crown - the opening of his flagship fine diner Saint Peter at the Grand National Hotel in \nPaddington this month.\nMore than just a relocation, Saint Peter at The Grand National has grown from a guppy on Oxford St to a seriously \nbig fish, doubling in footprint, with a new first-class offering that's as good as anywhere in the world.\nA slick new fit-out by Sydney-based designer Studio Aquilo features fine fishbone tiled walls and curved booth \nseating in soft mollusc shades. A half-shell table at the front of the room is faced towards the open kitchen, offering \nan exclusive opportunity to watch the fish master at work. Coming soon, 14-boutique hotel rooms will offer a \nluxurious place for guests to flop after their feast.\nNow's about the time in the review that we need to confess that we didn't actually dine at the restaurant.\nNot only was it booked out, but it was also very expensive (see: $275 a person). Instead, we dined at the bar - and \nwe're convinced it's the best-kept secret in town.\nIt may be called the Saint Peter Bar but by Sydney standards, it is most definitely a restaurant. The size of the \nspace is comparable to the main dining room, set out with stand-alone tables and chairs as well as booth seating \nfor larger groups.\nThe food menu is not just for nibbling. An expanded selection of small and large plates can easily accommodate a \nshared feast or three-course affair.\nPage 2 of 2\nFish master tops the scale\nThe backbone of the bar menu is a study of rock oysters sourced from up and down the coast, splashed with fresh \ngarnishes and dressings from wakame seaweed to sweet, salty melon. Sardines also make an appearance. Niland \nbins the tin for fresh, silvery fillets, sourced from Yamba fisherman Keith Kerr. The herrings are smoked on ironbark \nand preserved in native thyme oil, which is so fruity and herbaceous you'll want to soak up every ounce. Doorstops \nof sourdough get the job done, along with a shimmering butter pearl, served in an open oyster shell.\nThe catch of the menu, however, is the curried fish pie, made with line-caught hapuka from Revolution Fisheries. \nThe sweet, delicate flakes are tangled with seaweed in a creamy, fenugreek-spiced vadouvan curry. The dish is \nmodelled on a lamb shank pot pie, complete with buttery pastry lid, and fish vertebrae poking out of the top. The \ndish pays tribute to the hotel's former life as a pub, as does the cumberland fish sausages and the chubby potato \nchip stubs.\nFor dessert, a slab of valrhona chocolate is rippled with crispy, crunchy puffs made from leftover fish scales. Snap \noff a piece and pass it around.\nAnd because this is actually a bar - apparently - you can also order a very fine oyster shell martini infused with long \nspine sea urchin. Perfect for toasting your decision to dine at the bar.\nSaint Peter Bar 61 Underwood St, Paddington saintpeter.com.au/bar No bookings needed\nOpen Tue-Wed 5pm-late, Thu-Sat noon-4pm, 5pm-late, Sun noon-4pm\nVerdict Food * * * * * Value * * * * * Ambience * * * * * Value * * * * * Overall * * * * * delicious.com.au/eatout\nLoad-Date: August 23, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
