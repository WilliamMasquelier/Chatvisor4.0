Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 390 words\nHighlight: Billionaire Andrew Forrest's troubled foray into producing high-grade ore has suffered another setback.\nBody\nMining billionaire Andrew Forrest's troubled foray into producing high-grade ore - Fortescue's Iron Bridge project - \nhas suffered another setback, with a leaking water pipeline that could more than halve magnetite production this \nfinancial year.\nHowever, the lost production and $220 million cost to replace 65 kilometres of pipeline will hardly dent Fortescue's \nfinancial performance. The miner shipped 48.5 million tonnes of its main iron ore product haematite in the \nDecember quarter, a figure 6 per cent higher than the previous three months to achieve the company's second-\nhighest first-half production.\nLink to Image\nForstescue \nAt Iron Bridge, Fortescue had planned to produce 5 million tonnes of magnetite this financial year as it ramped up \nthe $5.9 billion project to its full capacity of 22 million tonnes a year. That forecast has now been cut to 2 to 4 million \ntonnes due to continual leaks in the higher pressure section of a 240-kilometre pipeline that supplies water to the \nprocessing plant.\nFortescue's first move into complex processing of the ore it mines has been dogged with problems since three \nsenior executives exited three years ago when news of cost blowouts first surfaced.\nFortescue's guidance for total production of both types of iron ore for the 12 months to June remains unchanged at \n192 million to 197 million tonnes.\nFortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said it was a strong quarter from the iron ore operation that included \nthe company's second shipment of magnetite and the initial export from its Belinga project in Gabon.\n\"We achieved this while continuing to grow our green technology, energy and metals businesses, keeping costs low \nand maintaining our safety performance,\" he said.\nFortescue aims for its mining operation to be emissions-free by 2030, a far more aggressive target than any other \nAustralian miner. It is trialling the first of three electric excavators powered by a trailing cable more than two \nkilometres long.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue's high-grade iron ore dream springs a leak\nFortescue's energy division, led by chief executive Mark Hutchinson, is prioritising green hydrogen projects in \nBrazil, Kenya and Norway for board approval.\nFortescue shares were up 1.8 per cent to $28.90 each in early trading on Thursday.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.
