The oil price drifted another 0.4 per cent lower yesterday to \n$US86.18 a barrel. A shift in the direction of the storm towards Texas had traders continuing to sell during trading \nyesterday.\n\"While this puts some offshore oil and gas production at risk, the concern when the storm makes landfall is the \npotential impact it could have on refinery infrastructure,\" said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at \nING.\n\"Any prolonged refinery outages would be bearish for crude oil and bullish for refined products.\"\nLithium miners also suffered as traders continue to weigh the outlook for the battery metal. Arcadium Lithium fell 4.5 \nper cent to $4.93 and IGO dropped 3.9 per cent to $5.70.\nGold miners, meanwhile, were buoyed by a 1 per cent boost in the gold price over the weekend, following data in \nthe US that showed slowing wage growth and a rising unemployment rate in the job market.\nPage 2 of 2\nCommodity prices drive sharemarket down Equities\nRamelius Resources was 1.8 per cent higher at $1.87 after the gold miner revealed it had produced just over \n293,000 ounces of gold in the 2024 financial year, topping the company's recently upgraded guidance.\nFellow gold miner Red 5 announced it had restructured its existing hedging agreement following its merger with \nSilver Lake Resources earlier this year. The shares gained 5.3 per cent to 39.5\u00a2.\nSouth Australian copper and gold developer Rex Minerals soared 56.4 per cent to 43\u00a2, following news of a high-\nprofile buyout deal by MACH Metals Australia, owned by Indonesia's wealthy Salim family. Core Lithium jumped \n17.6 per cent to 10\u00a2 after overshooting its production guidance.\nGQG Partners' funds under management have jumped above $US155 billion ($229.8 billion) after pulling in a \nfurther $US6.5 billion in June.
