Version:1\nLength: 572 words\nByline: Sam Russell\nHighlight: The team took samples from the sea floor and hope to discover how the turbines may affect biodiversity, \ncarbon storage and seabed composition.\nBody\nScientists  have collected samples from the seabed at one of the UK\u2019s oldest active offshore wind farms.\nThe project, led by the University of Essex , will explore the environmental impact of the turbines on the seabed \namid plans to build thousands more to reach net zero by 2050.\nThe samples, taken from as close as 50m to the turbines and as far as one mile away, are now being analysed, \nwith findings to follow.\nResearchers chartered a private survey vessel to carry out their expedition to the site off the coast of Cumbria.\nThe active wind farm, which has been operational for more than 15 years and is one of the oldest offshore sites in \nthe UK, is run by Danish energy firm Orsted.\nDr Natalie Hicks, of the University of Essex\u2019s school of life sciences, said the research was \u201chugely important\u201d.\n\u201cThere are not enough specialist scientific vessels to gather the evidence in time, so collaborating with industry is \nkey to gathering data,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe know our demand for net zero energy targets means we have seen an increase in offshore wind farms, so \nunderstanding any environmental effects of these wind farms is urgent.\n\u201cWe hope this research will feed directly into policy decision-making around offshore wind consenting.\n\u201cWe know we are going to see an increase in offshore wind, so timely and evidence-based decisions are going to \nneed to be made by policymakers.\nPage 2 of 2\nScientists explore impact of offshore wind farms on seabed\n\u201cThis science will hopefully underpin their decision-making, and impact on Government  policy.\u201d\nThe team took samples from the sea floor and hope to discover how the turbines may affect biodiversity, carbon \nstorage and seabed composition.\nResearch is being carried out with Orsted, the University of St Andrews  and the Government\u2019s marine experts, the \nCentre of Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS).\nA CEFAS spokesman said it was \u201ccritical to scientifically understand offshore structures and their effects and \nimpacts on the environment\u201d.\n\u201cToo often we make assumptions about what is occurring in our marine environment when considering human \nactivities, we need the type of research activity highlighted here to determine whether our assumptions are correct \nand to provide more confidence in our understanding,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\u201cSuch improved confidence is a vital element of the integrated scientific understanding needed for informed \ndecision-making towards ensuring the long-term future of our marine environment.\u201d\nMarine scientists will also compare the effects of decommissioned oil platforms to get a snapshot of how fossil fuel \nand renewable energy assets vary in their impacts.\nProfessor David Paterson , of the University of St Andrews, said: \u201cIt\u2019s important we take learnings from the oil and \ngas industry on the environmental effects of oil and gas operations and decommissioning and effectively apply \nthese to the offshore wind industry as projects mature towards later life phases.\u201d\nA spokesman for Orsted said: \u201cDeveloping renewable energy in harmony with nature is both possible and \nnecessary to address the twin challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.\n\u201cThrough collaboration with academic bodies and other stakeholders, our aim is to help develop wider scientific \nunderstanding of the potential ecological benefits and impacts of developing critical green energy projects.\n\u201cBy taking a science-led approach, we can ensure that renewable energy, such as offshore wind, continues to be \ndeployed sensitively and sustainably.\u201d\nLoad-Date: August 31, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nBased on the content of the article, choose the most appropriate category from the following list: ['Financial Challenges and Strategic Adjustments', 'Offshore Wind Project Developments and Setbacks', 'Leadership Changes and Corporate Restructuring', 'Market Exits, Divestments, and Investments', 'Technological Innovations and Sustainability Initiatives', 'Regulatory and Legal Challenges', 'Human Resources and Workforce Initiatives', 'Shifts in Renewable Energy Strategy']\nYour output should solely be the name of the category chosen and nothing else.\n            ",
