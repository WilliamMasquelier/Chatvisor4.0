Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Mark Zeptner | Managing Director | \"Ramelius is one of the few Aussie gold producers actually upgrading guidance and therefore we are expecting to deliver a very strong cash flows in the second half of FY24.\" | N.A. |\n| Ben Ringrose | Acting Chief Financial Officer | \"December quarter was indeed a very strong one financially for Ramelius with sales revenue of 194.5 million and an associated underlying free cash flow of 47.5 million, which is after growth and exploration investment.\" | N.A. |\n| Ashley Chen | Shareholder | \"Thanks again for a nice quarter and your hard work for it.\" | N.A. |\n| Hayden Bairstow | Analyst at Argonaut | \"Pretty impressive results at Magnet mining wise.\" | N.A. |\n| Alex Barkley | Analyst at RBC | \"Thanks very much, guys.\" | N.A. |\n| Richard Hatch | Analyst at Topwheel | \"Happy New Year to you and thanks for another great performance.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Ramelius Resources.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Ramelius Resources or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
