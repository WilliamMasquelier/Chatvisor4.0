Sierra Nevada is continuing its mapping and sampling and has \nidentified additional veins within the ISE vein field.\n------------------\nAsian Battery Metals (ASX:AZ9)\nHit: 6.1m of 4.16 per cent copper, 3.51 per cent nickel, 0.93g/t 3E and 0.13 per cent cobalt from 98.2m.\nLast week Asian Battery Minerals landed a 6.1m hit grading 4.16 per cent copper, 3.51 per cent nickel, 0.93g/t 3E \nand 0.13 per cent cobalt from 98.2m.\nA 3E value refers typically to the combined value of assays for gold, platinum and palladium.\nThe result, from one of the last four holes analysed in its 2024 Phase 2 drilling program, was designed to confirm \nthe extent of high-grade mineralisation in the company's Oval gabbroic intrusion.\nThe intercept is book-ended by two broad, lower grade mineralised zones, the first of which is a dense, \ndisseminated intercept of 26.2m at 0.44 per cent copper, 0.52 per cent nickel, 0.12g/t 3E and 0.03 per cent cobalt \nfrom 78.2m. The second zone comprises a net-textured 15.3m assaying 1.15 per cent copper, 0.79 per cent nickel, \n0.35g/t 3E and 0.04 per cent cobalt from 104.3m.\nThree of the last four drillholes analysed targeted electromagnetic (EM) conductors identified from downhole \n(DHEM) responses, which the company believes could represent base metal mineralised targets.\nThe headline hole probed a strongly conductive DHEM plate in the northern half of the Oval body, which is strongly \nexpressed in high-resolution magnetics as a 500m long, 125m wide ovoid body oriented to the north-northwest.\nThe hole successfully encountered low to highly mineralised gabbroic rock from 16m depth to 142.2m, including the \nforegoing intercepts.\nA second hole in the final suite of four was collared 35m east of and on an opposing azimuth to the headline hole.\nIt targeted a separate DHEM conductor for which the source turned out to be a broad high-grade intersection in the \nnorthern third of the Oval area that includes a massive sulphide intercept of 1.8m at 3.21 per cent copper, 3.32 per \ncent nickel, 0.69g/t E3, and 0.14 per cent cobalt from 105m.\nThe 1.8m at 3.21 copper intercept lies within a broader mineralised zone comprising 19.8m at 1.23 per cent copper, \n0.98 per cent nickel, 0.36g/t 3E and 0.05 per cent cobalt from 91.2m.\nThe 19.8m zone also includes three other significant intercepts of disseminated, semi-massive and massive \nmineralisation in gabbro, the best of which are 6.6m going 1.56 per cent copper from 96.0m and 2.4m at 1.52 per \ncent copper and 1.39 per cent nickel from 102.6m.Page 4 of 4\nOrdell locks onto new gold zone in Mt Magnet\nThe third drillhole targeted an off-hole conductor plate that had been determined by DHEM surveying of a nearby \nprevious hole. It intercepted 18.5m of lower grade mineralised gabbro from 13.5m to 32m, although it includes 3.2m \nrunning 0.50 per cent copper, 0.38 per cent nickel, 0.30g/t 3E and 0.02 per cent cobalt from 25m.\nFurther support was lent to the intriguing possibilities presented by the Oval body, with the fourth drillhole testing \nthe southern extremity of the Oval gabbroic intrusive and the zone of contact with its enclosing sediments.\nThat hole was also intended to provide a vector for a subsequent DHEM survey to sniff out any new useful \nconductors within range. It intercepted disseminated mineralised gabbro with 5m going 0.17 per cent copper, 0.17 \nper cent nickel, 0.03g/t 3E and 0.01 per cent cobalt from 126m.\nThe company's recent drilling has focused mainly on identifying high-grade mineralisation in the gabbro at the Oval \nproject. It views the multiple intercepts of massive sulphide mineralisation with their varying ratios of metal \nthroughout the Oval intrusion as encouraging for the possibility of finding one or more deeper sources of high-grade \ncopper-nickel-platinum group mineralisation.\nFor its follow-up 2025 exploration program, Asian Battery Metals plans to focus on scoping out the overall scale of \nthe Oval mineralisation and to target possible deeper magmatic sources at the prospect. It also plans additional \nexploration for potential extensions of Oval and nearby look-alike prospects.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Please go ahead.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Travis. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to dial in this morning. In addition to the \nquarterly report, we've also released a presentation that we'll largely speak to during the call. Both documents have \nbeen uploaded on the ASX platform and will be available on the website shortly.\nPage 2 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nOnce again, I'm joined by our CFO, Darren Millman. Darren will provide some detail on the financials after I've run \nthrough the highlights and touched on the operational performance and our development projects. As always, there \nwill be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions at the end.\nFor those who have downloaded the presentation deck, I'll be initially speaking to Slide 3. I'll focus on the highlights \nand key achievements for the quarter. I would like to point out that there is a large amount of detail on exploration, \noperations and project development within the quarterly report itself.\nSo on Slide 3, operationally and financially, the December quarter was exceptionally strong, with the business \ngenerating a record and also sector-leading AUD 174.5 million in underlying free cash flow. After considering our \nadditional investment in Spartan during the quarter of AUD 68 million and the payment of our FY '24 AUD 0.05 per \nshare dividend, our closing cash and gold position was just over AUD 500 million.\nOur quarterly gold production was 85,311 ounces, which was a 37% increase on the prior quarter, noting also just \nshy of our record production, which occurred in the March 2024 quarter. The increase in production was mainly due \nto the introduction of ore from Cue, which performed extremely well during the quarter and also improved grades \nfrom Penny. I'll talk to these points in more detail shortly.\nLooking at the costs, we saw a 25% decrease in our all-in sustaining costs down to AUD 1,491 for the quarter. Now \nwhilst we were guiding for a reduction in all-in sustaining costs across the year, the all-in sustaining cost for the \nquarter was below our expectations and obviously benefited from the outperformance of Cue. Importantly, our \nguidance for FY '25 remains unchanged at 270,000 to 300,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of AUD 1,500 to \nAUD 1,700 an ounce.\nWhilst we are encouraged by the indicative overperformance of Cue grades, it is still relatively early days, and we \nwill continue to assess this during the March quarter as more data becomes available as mining and milling \nprogresses.\nUnfortunately, during the quarter, we did record our first LTI since May 2023. Whilst this is extremely disappointing, \nthe incident itself, which is detailed in the quarterly report, was not of a serious nature. We do strive to ensure that \nall employees and contractors remain healthy -- safe and healthy under our watch. The total recordable injury \nfrequency rate, or TRIFR, at the end of December was 8.33, which was only marginally higher than that recorded \nlast quarter.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nThere were several milestones and advancements in our key projects across the quarter with haulage to [Cue] \ncommencing mid-November following the completion of the Great Northern Highway intersection upgrade and also \ndelivery of the Rebecca Roe PFS, which is demonstrating strong economic returns.\nFor the immediate future, our focus is on delivery of the Eridanus and Mt Magnet mill upgrade studies and \nassociated mine plan in this quarter and the Rebecca Roe DFS, which is targeting a final investment decision in the \nSeptember quarter. Exploration and resource definition activities during the quarter were largely focused on \nEridanus, Penny West and the Lena pit at Cue.\nOn Slide 4, I will draw your attention on -- sorry, we're looking here at the quarterly production breakdown for the \nlast 12 months. If you look at the yellow Mt Magnet bars, you can see the previous September quarter, we focused \nlargely on the development of Cue. And now we see that asset in production, along with improved grades at Penny, \nhas been the main driver of increased production in the December quarter. As expected, Edna May production is \nslowly winding down.\nOn to Slide 5, which references quarterly production stats. The standout here is the mine grade for the quarter of \n7.3 grams per tonne, which is more than double that of the September quarter and has been driven once again by \ngrades at Cue and Penny, which were 7.4 and 17.9 grams per tonne, respectively.Page 3 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nNow whilst the ore tonnes mined reduced, it needs to be highlighted that there still is a fair amount of pre-strip and \ndevelopment taking place at Cue.",
