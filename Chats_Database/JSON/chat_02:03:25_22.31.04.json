Increasingly, \nthese are getting paired with solar and wind projects, like in Arizona. The agencies that run electric grids, utility \ncompanies and developers of renewable energies say combining technologies is essential for a green energy \nfuture. \nBatteries  allow renewables to replace fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, while keeping a steady flow of power when \nsources like wind and solar are not producing. For example, when people are sleeping and thus using less \nelectricity, the energy produced from wind blowing through the night can be stored in batteries \u2014 and used when \ndemand is high during the day. \nJuan Mendez, a resident of Tempe, Arizona, gets power from local utility Salt River Project, which is collaborating \nwith \u00d8rsted on the Eleven Mile Solar Center. As a state senator, Mendez pushed SRP to move to renewable \nenergies.\nHe thinks the power company is still investing too much in gas and coal plants, including a major expansion \nplanned for a natural gas plant in Coolidge, Arizona, near the solar center.\nPage 2 of 3\nAcross the US , batteries and green energies like wind and solar combine for major climate solution\n\u201cThis solar-plus-storage is a good step, but SRP needs to do more to provide clean energy and clean up our air and \nhelp address climate change,\" Mendez said. \nThe utility said it\u2019s adding more renewables to its energy mix and recently pledged to zero out its emissions by \n2050. \nThe U.S. has the second most electrical storage in the world, after China. In 2023, the U.S. added an estimated 7.5 \ngigawatts \u2014 62% more than in 2022, according to the BloombergNEF and the Business Council for Sustainable \nEnergy factbook. That amount can power 750,000 homes for a day and brings the total amount of installed capacity \nnationwide to nearly enough for 2 million homes for one day, according to BloombergNEF.\nIn the U.S., California  leads in energy storage as it aggressively cuts greenhouse gas emissions. It has twice as \nmuch as any other state. Residential, commercial and utility-scale battery installations increased by 757% there \nover just four years, meaning there's now enough to power 6.6 million homes for up to four hours, according to the \nCalifornia Energy Commission. \nThat's partly because in 2013, the California Public Utilities Commission told utilities to buy energy storage with a \ntarget to be met by 2020. Since then, power companies have continued to add more batteries to help the state meet \nclean electricity requirements. \nSouthern California Edison is one utility adding thousands of hours of energy storage. It is putting in solar-plus-\nbatteries to replace some power plants that burn natural gas and would typically supply electricity in the evening. \n\u201cIf it\u2019s just clean and not reliable, you really don\u2019t have anything,\u201d said William Walsh, vice president for energy \nprocurement and management. \u201cWe need both.\u201d\nIn California, batteries proved their value in September 2022, as the West was experiencing a long heat wave that \nsent temperatures into the triple digits. Electricity demand reached the highest the state had ever seen on Sept. 6, \n2022, as people cranked up air conditioners. \nWalsh credits the batteries added to the grid between 2020 and 2022 with helping to avoid blackouts. Two years \nearlier, there were rolling electricity outages in California during a similar extreme heat wave.\nTexas has the second-most battery storage after California. Last month, Schneider Electric  announced it's teaming \nup with energy company ENGIE North America on solar and battery systems in Texas to get closer to the French \nmultinational\u2019s 100% renewable energy goal in the U.S. and Canada. Before the Inflation Reduction Act, a major \nclimate law passed in 2022, the deal and the necessary $80 million investment would not have been possible, said \nHans Royal, Schneider Electric's senior director for renewable energy and carbon advisory. \nRoyal is advising other global Fortune 500 companies it works with to get into the market.\n\u201cThe industry needs that, the grid needs it,\" said Royal. \nBack in Arizona, \u00d8rsted\u2019s Eleven Mile Solar Center covers 2,000 acres in rural Pinal County. It has 857,000 solar \npanels and more than 2,000 cubes that look like large shipping containers but contain battery modules. \u00d8rsted also \nhas large solar and storage projects in Texas and Alabama, and in Europe.\nWhen the Arizona facility opens this summer, most power from the solar farm will go to Facebook owner Meta's \ndata center in Mesa. The solar power not needed by Meta, in addition to the power stored in the batteries, will go to \nthe local utility's customers. The new batteries can ensure power to roughly 65,000 homes during peak hours of \ndemand.\n\u201cWhat I think is exciting is just how rapidly this market is moving,\" said Yayoi Sekine, head of energy storage at \nBloombergNEF. \u201cThere's so much pressure for the U.S. and different regions to decarbonize, and storage is one of \nthe major technologies to enable that. There's a lot of momentum.\" Page 3 of 3\nAcross the US , batteries and green energies like wind and solar combine for major climate solution\n___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private \nfoundations.
