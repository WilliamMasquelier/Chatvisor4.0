Orsted is a major player in the sector and is set to build an \u00a38bn offshore \nwind farm in the North Sea by the end of 2027 to power more than 3.3m UK homes.\nGraphic\n \nBlow: Orsted is the largest offshore wind developer\nLoad-Date: August 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**PERSON**: [Full Name]\n**ROLE**: [Person's role or position]\n**CONTEXT**: [Brief description of how the person is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**PERSON**: Elon Musk\n**ROLE**: CEO of Tesla and SpaceX\n**CONTEXT**: Primary subject of article, discussing company strategy\n\nOnly include people who play a meaningful role in the article's content.
