Mr Forrest flew on to the Moroccan capital Rabat on Tuesday night.\nMs Benali was part of the official reception committee who welcomed Mr Forrest to Rabat in February after they had \nboth been in the Swiss town of Davos a month earlier.\nPage 2 of 2\nTwiggy's Moroccan energiser\nMr Forrest split from his wife Nicola after 31 years of marriage last year and announced they had agreed to \"live \napart\" with no mention of a divorce.

A Fortescue spokesman said yesterday: \"The Fortescue team is working with key stakeholders as we \ncontinue to develop our ambitious strategy with OCP, developed over more than two years, to develop green \nenergy, hydrogen and ammonia in Morocco.\nLoad-Date: May 29, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Leila Benali | Morocco's Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development | \"No, no I will not speak.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
