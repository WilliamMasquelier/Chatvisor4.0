Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Wayne McFaull | Fortescue employee | \"DCCL asked me to provide my opinion as to whether I consider that Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen could have invented the Element Zero process and then designed and constructed the Element Zero plant in the time available to them between their leaving Fortescue in November 2021 and the Element Zero plant being operational in January 2024 (a 26-month period).\" | N.A. |\n| Anand Bhatt | Fortescue employee | \"I am therefore concerned that Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen have intentionally not uploaded onto the Fortescue IT system and/or taken and/or deleted the above work product during or prior to ceasing their employment with Fortescue.\" | N.A. |\n| Julie Shuttleworth | Former FFI CEO | \"All of us who serve at FFI, would like to support you and see you successful, Bart, this however will necessitate a substantial behavioural change by you and leads me to our chairman's chief concern, to your failure to be a positive and encouraging leader.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
