Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 3\nLength: 2253 words\nByline: Primrose Riordan Associate editor\nBody\nIt was a meeting whispered about as Fortescue's version of the \"red wedding\" scene from Game of Thrones, in \nwhich a slew of characters were killed off in one sitting. Fortescue's executive chairman, Andrew Forrest, refers to \nit as \"judgment day\", which in the Bible is God's final sorting of people into the saved and the damned.\nAppropriately, it took place in the \"red cafe\" at the company's Perth headquarters, so named for its colour scheme. \nAnd it was a bloodbath. One person who was there says Fortescue's chief executive at the time, Elizabeth Gaines, \nwas in tears, and the rest of the company's C-suite was rattled and emotional.\nThe catalyst for the meeting was the troubled Iron Bridge magnetite mine. A joint venture between Fortescue and \nTaiwan's Formosa Steel, the mine is about 145 kilometres south of Port Hedland in the Pilbara. In early 2021, it was \nbehind schedule and over budget. Forrest was furious.\nGaines and other executives, including former chief financial officer Ian Wells, were forced to apologise and take \nresponsibility for the situation. Greg Lilleyman, a well-respected mining executive who was then chief operating \nofficer, announced he was leaving the company. Project director Don Hyma and Iron Bridge project director Manie \nMcDonald would also depart, the company confirmed later on February 16, and Gaines and Wells would forgo their \nbonuses.\n\"It was like a public shaming,\" says one person who was at the meeting. The executives were forced to make \"a \nconfession, saying they had betrayed the Fortescue values\".\nThese values are clearly laid out on the company's website and referred to repeatedly by management. They \ninclude family, empowerment, frugality, enthusiasm and \"stretch targets\". Fortescue sets deliberately ambitious \ngoals to ensure employees strive to do tasks faster and with fewer dollars.\nBut that cost-saving ambition has been put under a spotlight at Iron Bridge. The project has so far increased its \nexpected capital expenditure at least five times and has suffered from persistent leaks in the pipelines that deliver \nwater to the site and then slurry the ore product to Port Hedland. What's more, dust issues have put the company in \nregulators' sights.\nPage 2 of 4\nAndrew Forrest's 'lesson in humility'\n\"It's been a lesson in humility,\" says Forrest, in an interview with The Australian Financial Review during a visit to \nthe mine site. Labelling the project \"the company's most difficult\" mining venture, he lays the blame for the \nexpensive leaks on pipeline contractors.\nThe company has previously said cost blowouts and delays at Iron Bridge were due to cultural problems and that \nnegative news had not reached executives and directors fast enough. But interviews with at least a dozen \nFortescue insiders reveal Iron Bridge was hamstrung from the start by tough cost-saving targets and because \nplanners failed to anticipate the difficulties of piping large amounts of water in high-pressure pipelines across tough \nterrain.\nIron Bridge was much more than just another mine for Forrest. Unlike the more common hematite iron ore mines, it \nis a magnetite mine - which involves turning low-grade ore into a much higher 68 per cent grade ore through \nenergy-intensive processing. Its success is key to transforming Fortescue from a low-cost, lower-quality iron ore \noperation to one of the largest iron ore producers in the world. It allows the company to take the fight more directly \nto rivals BHP and Rio Tinto, as mining companies bet air pollution-conscious countries such as China will favour \nhigher-grade ore because it produces fewer fumes.\nCentral to the development of Iron Bridge was one of Forrest's oldest friends, former Fortescue executive Michael \nMasterman. The pair go way back. Masterman was finance director for Forrest's first disastrous business venture, \nAnaconda Nickel, before following him to Fortescue as one of the company's executives. They are also family \nfriends; Forrest is the godfather to one of his children. But they have since fallen out. Masterman left Fortescue last \nyear to set up a green metal company, Element Zero, triggering a messy legal dispute. Fortescue is now suing the \nfirm and Masterman over alleged intellectual property theft.\nBut in 2013, Masterman was a senior executive at Fortescue and crucial to arranging the finance for Iron Bridge. \nThat year, as he jetted between Shanghai and Perth, he organised for Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Group, one of the \nNorth Asian nation's biggest conglomerates, to invest $1.15 billion for a 31 per cent equity stake. Fortescue had \nalready secured an investment from Baosteel, the world's largest steel producer, with the Chinese conglomerate \nthrowing in a stake it already had in a magnetite mining lease. And so Fortescue set up FMG Iron Bridge, with the \naim of developing the Glacier Valley and North Star deposits where the mine now sits.\nIt is a huge project. Alongside an airstrip, accommodation camp and an ore-processing facility which aims to churn \nout 22 million tonnes of concentrate a year, Iron Bridge also has hundreds of kilometres of pipeline. One, which \nruns for more than 200 km from borefields in the Canning Basin to the mine, has been the most susceptible to \nleaks. \"That water pipeline failure, so that was a shock to the organisation,\" Forrest says. Another 135-km pipeline \npumps magnetite slurry to Port Hedland and a third returns water to the mine.\n\"It was absolutely the contractor who gave us the guarantee this solution would work,\" Forrest says when asked \nwho he blames for the pipeline issues. \"But going after them is a puerile practice as they are too small. Sending \npeople broke is not our speed.\" He later adds that the company was working with the contractor and manufacturer \non the issue. The prime pipeline contractor on the project, MPC Kinetic, declined to comment.\nThe company said at the start of the year that it would need to set aside $US100 million to replace 65 kilometres of \nthe pipeline that feeds raw water from the Canning Basin to the plant. But more recently, the on-site project team, \nled by operations director Graham Howard, has been able to sufficiently stem the leaks, and the company has put \nthe more expensive fix on the back-burner.\nIf all goes well this year, Howard, a Fortescue veteran, is confident Iron Bridge will meet its target to produce \nbetween 5 million and 9 million tonnes of product by the end of the financial year. But that is still less than half the \nmine's ultimate target of 22 million tonnes a year.\nIt's been a journey. He jokes to the Financial Review on the same visit last week to Iron Bridge that the amount of \nhair on his balding head tells the tale.Page 3 of 4\nAndrew Forrest's 'lesson in humility'\nBut as always with Forrest, there are even more demands. As the bus rolls into the mine site, Forrest asks why the \nplant's lights aren't sensor activated to save energy and instead stay on during the day. Executives have been \nunder relentless pressure, with much of it related to cost control - Fortescue is renowned for its focus on costs. \nWhen Iron Bridge was first proposed, the company estimated capital expenditure would be $US2.6 billion.\nOn a site visit after the announcement, Forrest warned a crowd of workers including senior engineers that they may \nas well resign if they were not committed to building the mine within budget, people with direct knowledge of the \nevent said.\nIron Bridge had been planned for some time and the company had conducted thorough cost estimates for smaller \nmines, including 11 million-tonne and 16 million-tonne versions, bringing in outside consultants and planners to put \ntogether the expected capex. But in the lead-up to the project getting the green light in 2019, the decision was \nmade to expand it to a 22 million-tonne mine.\nInstead of getting a new capex estimate, the company \"factored\" up those previous cost estimates, people with \nknowledge of the process said. Though it did take outside advice, it was not a calculation from scratch, which those \nwith knowledge of mine planning said would have been more in line with the industry norm.\nThe only way the company's internal planners could get closer to the $US2.6 billion figure authorised by the board \nwas by not including as much \"contingency\", an amount typically set aside by miners for additional, unforeseen \ncosts, and by including a large cost-reduction target.\nForrest does not deny the project was subject to cost saving targets. \"We deliver operations at the lowest cost in \nthe world. And it's who we are. We don't pretend to be like others.\" But he rejects any notion that the company \nunderplayed the costs. \"We all thought we'd get change out of $US2.6 billion as we have in our other projects, so \nwe didn't see this as different,\" he says.\n\"That's not how we roll. The board approves projects on exactly the information it has, and it got to $US3.2 billion \nwell after it had been approved and it was being built. And that's when you have the come-to-judgment day,\" he \nsays.\nFortescue's upward capex revisions may have cost the company investors. Chinese steel giant Baosteel, formerly \na shareholder, quit the project in 2021, selling its stake in the holding company for the mine. Though the motivations \nbehind the decision are unknown, the company has since participated in other Pilbara mining projects, including \nMineral Resources' Onslow Iron project and Rio Tinto's new Western Range mine.\nSources say planners underestimated the price of laying the long pipelines needed by the mine, which cost \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\nThis pressure on costs filtered down to Fortescue's contractors, who were constantly forced to revise plans after \nthe company demanded more savings.\nIn the end, the capital expenditure estimate was revised up five times. In August last year, more than two years \nafter the infamous \"red wedding\" meeting, the company announced the mine's capex at $US4 billion, more than a \nthird higher than the initial estimate. Jon Mills, an equity analyst at Morningstar who covers Fortescue, says rising \ninflation hasn't helped and could not have been anticipated.\nFortescue's tight focus on costs has attracted support and has been central to the company's success. \"They are \nmuch leaner, much more focused on lower unit cost of iron ore than their rivals and that makes their business more \nsustainable,\" says one person intimate with the project's operations.\nDelays in the ramp-up have been costly. On May 1 last year, Forrest declared that the mine had produced its first \nore. But when the mine got going in August that year, it reported a $US726 million pre-tax impairment charge - \neffectively devaluing the mine - because of delays in the project's ramp-up.Page 4 of 4\nAndrew Forrest's 'lesson in humility'\nAfter the company announced its latest production report in September, it fielded questions about why it wasn't \ngetting premium prices considering the higher grade of iron ore that the mine promised.\n\"At the moment, they aren't seeing as high a premium as they had hoped,\" says Morningstar's Mills.\nIn September, Fortescue Metals chief Dino Otranto blamed the lower prices on \"low steel volumes, depressed \nmargins\" and a \"slight oversupply\" of the concentrate market in China.\n\"So long story short, capex has been higher,\" says Mills. \"It's taken longer to ramp up, costs are going up as well for \nsimilar reasons. And then, you know, on the revenue side, they're not getting the premium they hoped for.\"\nCost blowouts have not been the only problem at Iron Bridge. In September, mine safety officers from WorkSafe \nWA issued four improvement notices and one prohibition notice \"related to dust management\".\nWorkers at the site said they were concerned about their exposure to silica dust, present in the ore mined at the \nsite, which can lead to silicosis, a potentially terminal condition. Magnetite needs to be crushed into such fine \nparticles, finer than talcum powder, that dust is inevitable. Other Pilbara sites have similar issues.\n\"People were coughing ... it gets under your mask and in your clothes,\" says one worker who was not authorised to \nspeak publicly. Forrest wore a PAPR dust mask on his visit to the mine last week.\nA rope chain separates the area where you are required to wear a dust mask and where you no longer need one, \nand the area was recently expanded. \"There has always been a requirement to wear respiratory protective \nequipment in the mandated restricted areas of the dry plant, however in September the senior site executive \nincreased the restricted area to include the entirety of the dry plant to ensure compliance,\" a company \nspokeswoman said.\nTwo workers told the Financial Review they were concerned some of the staff facilities and offices were too close to \nmine infrastructure, so dust filtered into mask-off areas.\n\"We categorically dispute this,\" the spokeswoman said. \"Our PAPR and P2 requirements are adequate. Outside of \nthe mandatory dry plant area, our sample analysis does not require protection.\"\nOne former executive says they decided to leave Fortescue not long after the \"red cafe\" meeting in 2021. \"The \nculture had changed and it felt very deliberate,\" the person says.\nBut Forrest does not resile from his actions of that day. He had just returned from overseas, and after Gaines \nalerted him there was an issue he says they decided to change the management team and conduct an audit.\n\"Here at Fortescue, you get rewarded heavily on doing well, and not if you disappoint. And that was a really deep \ndisappointment. They took the information they received and believed it, but below them there were issues, and \nunfortunately, like with me, others in leadership, the buck stops with you.\"\nLoad-Date: December 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
