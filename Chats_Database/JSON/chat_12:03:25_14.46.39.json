Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 4\nLength: 1586 words\nByline: Campbell Kwan and Bonnie Campbell\nBody\nNews feature A growing industry is devoted to obscuring true owners of high-end properties`, write Campbell Kwan \nand Bonnie Campbell.\nAcross from Bondi Icebergs, with a sweeping and unobstructed view across the iconic Sydney beach, is a \nnondescript apartment block. Unit by unit, over a decade, it has been acquired by STM 123 No 11 Pty Ltd.\nThe company now owns seven of the eight two-bedroom units inside the building. Each unit is now worth between \n$3 million and $10 million, based on the sales of similar apartments along the same street over the past year. So \nwho is behind STM 123 No 11? The company can be traced back to Vaughan Blank, a former Glencore executive \nwho now owns a swath of luxury real estate.\nFrom STM 123 No 11 to Lavender Pty Ltd and Sirgrey Pty Ltd, the wealthy are increasingly hiding behind corporate \nentities and trusts as they snap up high-end properties. Of the 50 most expensive properties sold last year, almost a \nquarter were acquired in this way. In 2018, this figure was only 12 per cent.\nPiercing the secrecy of these companies shows a growing industry - from buyer's agents to lawyers, accountants \nand realtors - devoted to obscuring the true owners of high-end property.\nDavid Morrell, a buyer's agent who specialises in prestige Melbourne property, says the wealthy are increasingly \ncreating schemes to shield their real estate transactions from view, although he adds that this is largely not for any \nnefarious reason.\n\"These very wealthy people, the wealthier they are, the more they value their privacy,\" Morrell says. \"Privacy is the \nmain driver, but I'm sure there is a seedier side. I'm seeing more and more people using a company vehicle to \npurchase properties.\"\nAlong Sydney Harbour, from Circular Quay to Barangaroo, a slew of apartments in the Crown Residences, \nBennelong Apartments, Macquarie Apartments and Opera Residences are held by shell companies - vehicles that \nlawfully hide the identity of their owners.\nPage 2 of 3\nHow ultrarich hide their huge property plays\nAt the Crown Residences, the soaring building in Barangaroo shared with the eponymous casino, 16 per cent of its \napartments are owned by corporate entities. It's a similar proportion at other harbour buildings like the Macquarie \nApartments and Bennelong Apartments, commonly referred to as \"the toaster\". At the Opera Residences, where \nalmost $500 million in property was sold within hours of the apartments coming onto the market in 2021, the figure \nis almost double at 28 per cent.\nCrown Residences is one of the country's priciest buildings. When it opened in 2021, with 76 units, the starting \nprice was $9.5 million. And it is not difficult to see why. Minutes from the city, the building has some of the best \nviews of Sydney Harbour.\nOne purchaser was Clanricarde Investments. Clanricarde is owned by Stanwill Nominees. Stanwill is ultimately \nowned by Robert Whyte, a professional investor and confidante of the late media mogul Kerry Packer with a fortune \nof $989 million, according to The Australian Financial Review Rich List this year.\nWhyte is far from alone in using a corporate vehicle to buy into Crown Residences. At least $70 million of real \nestate in the tower is owned by wealthy Malaysians Nur Jannah Ong and Saiful Ong. These apartments are all \nowned by Lavender Pty Ltd.\nAnother luxury apartment inside the residences is owned by a shell company called 5D Inertia, which belongs to \nbrothers William and Calvin Lau. The Laus quietly divested the apartment, along with four others in and near the \nSydney CBD, for $0 to the shell company in late November 2021.\nAccording to regulatory filings, both Lavender Pty Ltd and 5D Inertia are run by an accountant called Shuo Cheng. \nCheng works at a local accountancy firm in Sydney's inner west called Hannan Partners. He declined to comment.\nAnd while it is sometimes clear who the ultimate owner is - whether the Laus or the Ongs - at other times it is far \nmore opaque. Last year, Sirgrey bought into Crown Residences for $17.5 million. Sirgrey's only director is Ayhan \nBaba, a lawyer, who took over from retired accountant Steven Calfas. Neither own the apartment and Baba \ndeclined to comment.\nThe easiest way to keep a property purchase away from prying eyes is to put it in someone else's name. Nicole \nKidman, for instance, owns a three-bedroom apartment in Latitude, a Milsons Point apartment block, which she \npurchased for $7.7 million last year. The property, however, was bought in the name of the Hollywood actress's \nchildhood friend, Annette Rechner.\nA more complicated approach is to use a shell company, often linked to a trust, says family office consultant \nJoanne Sun.\n\"If you see someone from a law firm on the company, it will be very difficult to find out who actually owns it - it's \nunder layers of shell companies and discretionary trusts,\" Sun says. \"You can dig, but it'd be difficult to find out. At \nthe same time, the lawyers who advise won't be out there too much and go to different events. It exposes them in a \nway that family offices don't like.\"\nPurchases are also often made on behalf of groups of investors or numerous family members. And directorships of \nthese companies can change quietly, marking a sale of the property. \"Unless you're monitoring a specific \ncompany's every movement, it's very difficult to see even when the ownership changes,\" Sun says.\nLaws regulating the purchase of properties also allow buyer's agents to pay for deposits under their own name, \nrather than their clients. They can decide where to redirect the assets afterwards, right until two weeks before the \nproperty settles.\n\"I pay for the deposit, and it's my name on the cheque, so you can't find it that way. If they want to keep it \ncompletely silent, then it's put into a company trust and the directors are usually one of the partners of the senior \nlaw firm - and only me and the partner ever knows who bought it,\" Morrell, the buyers' agent, says.Page 3 of 3\nHow ultrarich hide their huge property plays\nIt's not just apartments that are being snapped up in discreet ways - mansions in some of the country's coveted \nlocations were also being acquired through these means.\nA Sunshine Beach, Queensland house - at 33 Ross Crescent - sold for $28 million in December. The asset settled \nunder 33 Ross Street Holdings Pty Ltd, which lists David Turner as its director. Turner runs an accountancy \nspecialising in family offices.\nIn Melbourne's Armadale, a five-bedroom mansion at 52 Hampden Road sold for $26.5 million in 2022 - also to a \nmystery wealthy buyer through a shell company called 52 Ohana Pty Ltd that pays share interests to accounting \nfirm Pitcher Partners.\nBut there is a darker side of this hidden luxury property market. Federal police last year dismantled an alleged \nChinese-Australian money laundering organisation that moved an estimated $10 billion offshore while amassing a \nblue-chip property portfolio which included Sydney mansions, a luxury city building and hundreds of acres of land \nnear the city's second airport.\nTransparency International Australia chief executive Clancy Moore says there are still billions of dollars of \nAustralian assets out there that have been acquired with dirty money due to limited checks on the cash that flows \ninto shell companies. Real estate agents, accountants and lawyers do not have to make money laundering \nreporting obligations for transactions of more than $10,000, meaning Australia is a hotbed for billions of dollars of \ndirty money. Australia is one of just five countries - alongside Haiti, Madagascar, the United States and China - that \nstill oppose regulating lawyers and other service providers.\n\"This MCG-sized gap in Australia's anti-money laundering laws means that the door is wide open for organised \ncrime gangs and corrupt officials to wash their dirty money in luxury real estate and property in Australia,\" Moore \nsays.\n\"This is often enabled by lawyers and accountants who either unknowingly, or actively, set up opaque complex \ncorporate structures to allow criminals to hide their identities, avoid detection and profit from their ill got gains.\"\nMoore says the government needed to toughen reporting obligations and create a public ownership register, which \nwould show who ultimately owns, controls or receives profits from a company or trust in Australia.\nIn many ways, both major political parties have turned a blind eye to the source of cash used to buy some of \nAustralia's most luxurious homes. A report recommending more disclosure handed to the Coalition in 2016 was not \nenacted. It was only in May that Labor allocated $166 million to expanding reporting obligations to real estate \nagents, accountants and lawyers.\nReal estate and legal lobby groups have argued that these checks will do little to create more transparency and will \nonly create an overwhelming burden on these professions. Real Estate Institute of Australia chief executive Leanne \nPilkington says the government should instead expand reporting obligations for land registry bodies rather than real \nestate agents and lawyers.\nLabor did commit, before the election to creating a beneficial ownership register. Andrew Leigh, the Assistant \nMinister for Treasury, says the government still plans to push through the register, and will start consulting on the \nscheme this year. \"A stronger beneficial ownership regime will assist regulators and law enforcement agencies to \naddress tax evasion, money laundering and other financial crime facilitated by complex legal structures and \narrangements, and will help align Australia with international approaches to enhancing transparency of beneficial \nownership,\" Leigh says.AFR\nLoad-Date: September 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
