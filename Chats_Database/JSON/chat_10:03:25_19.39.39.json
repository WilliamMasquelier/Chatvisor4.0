for reference, that's the size of Sydney - 1,000 kilometres east of Perth on the Nullarbor Plain.\nFortescue, through its green energy subsidiary Fortescue Future Industries, had proposed transforming Rawlinna \nStation into a renewable energy hub.\nGreen energy production goals\nThe acquisition, first announced in April 2023, was part of Fortescue's broader strategy to expand green energy \nproduction across WA, with the enormous tenure intended to play a key role in this vision.\nAnd yet 18 months after the initial bid, the company decided to abandon the transaction, citing \"extended delays\" \nand \"policy ambiguity\" surrounding government approvals.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue Metals withdraws from Rawlinna renewable purchase citing approval delays\nA WA Government spokesperson pointed out the complexity of processing applications for such large tracts of land, \nnoting that these assessments are governed by the Land Administration Act, which seeks to prevent excessive \nconcentration of pastoral land ownership in private hands.\nStill intending to be green\nFortescue's withdrawal, according to the spokesperson, was therefore a decision entirely within the company's \ndiscretion - moreover, it marks another instance of Forrest pulling out of a green deal before it came to fruition.\nThe company that runs Rawlinna confirmed its commitment to continuing its operations following Fortescue's exit.\nFortescue, meanwhile, said its intention was still to explore \"long-term green energy opportunities\" in the Nullarbor \nand southeast WA through other avenues, and claimed it will continue to remain active in the region's renewable \nenergy landscape.\nLoad-Date: November 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest | Mining magnate, Fortescue Metals Group | \"Fortescue's withdrawal... marks another instance of Forrest pulling out of a green deal before it came to fruition.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
