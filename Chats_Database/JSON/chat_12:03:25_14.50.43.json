Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1219 words\nByline: Stephen Bartholomeusz\nHighlight: BP and Shell led Big Oil's push into renewable energy. Now they are leading the retreat.\nBody\nBP and Shell led Big Oil's push into renewable energy. Now they are leading the retreat.\nLast week BP announced that it had sold its offshore wind assets into a joint venture with Japan's JERA, itself a \njoint venture between Tokyo Electric Power and Chubu Electric Power, to create one of the world's largest offshore \nwind businesses.\nThat followed an earlier BP announcement, in September, that it planned to sell its US onshore wind farms.\nUnder former chief executive, Bernard Looney, BP had been building its wind farm portfolio as part of an ambitious \nstrategy to cut its hydrocarbon production by 40 per cent by 2030, reduce its emissions and those of its customers \nby 35 to 40 per cent by the end of this decade and become a \"net zero\"-emissions company by 2050.\nLast year it started backing away from those commitments, saying it would cut production by only 25 per cent by \n2030 and its emissions by 20 to 30 per cent.\nThis year, under a new chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, it now appears even those reduced targets are being \nwound back.\nIt's not just BP.\nShell has scaled back its investment in renewables, including offshore wind and hydrogen; it has reduced its \nemissions' intensity targets and it has abandoned its objective of becoming the world's largest electricity company. \nNorway's energy giant, Equinor, has also announced plans to shrink its renewable energy division.\nAs they retreat from their push into renewable energy and downgrade their ambitions to build major exposures to \nelectricity generation, the UK and European oil companies are refocusing on their traditional oil and gas \nbusinesses.\nWhere previously they planned to cap or reduce their production, now they are planning and investing to increase it.\nPage 2 of 3\nBig Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare\nLast year BP raised its forecast of oil equivalent production from 1.5 billion barrels a day by 2030 to 2 million barrels \na day, planning to invest $US8 billion ($12.6 billion) more than previously budgeted on new oil and gas investments. \nSince Auchincloss became CEO, that focus on lifting hydrocarbon production has intensified.\nThe commercial logic in what they are doing is clear. BP generates returns of 15 to 20 per cent on its fossil fuel \ninvestments but only 6 to 8 per cent from its renewable assets, with wind's returns inferior to solar's.\nPloughing billions each year into wind, solar and hydrogen dilutes the overall returns on capital and reduces the \nreturns to shareholders, making them most unhappy. Having invested about $US18 billion over the past five years \nin lower-returning renewables between them, BP and Shell investors have become increasingly unhappy.\nMoreover, the UK and European energy majors are always compared with their US counterparts.\nExxon and Chevron haven't been anywhere near as committed to lowering the carbon intensity of their portfolios as \ntheir transatlantic rivals. The US majors were committed to the \"drill, baby, drill\" mantra before Donald Trump and \nsaw that reflected in their share price relativities with their UK and European counterparts.\nWhere, over the past five years, Exxon's share price has risen 54 per cent and Chevron's 23 per cent, BP's has \nfallen 22 per cent and Shell's more than 6 per cent. That kind of disparity in performance tends to galvanise \nshareholders, along with executives motivated by their remuneration.\nBy moving its offshore wind assets into a joint venture vehicle and off its own balance sheet BP will keep an \nexposure to wind but significantly reduce the amounts of capital devoted to it and the levels of debt supporting it.\nBetween them, BP and JERA plan to spend up to $US5.8 billion on their combined portfolios (which includes the \nproposed Blue Mackerel offshore wind farm in Bass Strait) by the end of 2030. With shared investment and non-\nrecourse funding, BP's capital commitment will be modest relative to what it would otherwise have been.\nBoth BP and Shell still seem committed to solar, which is less capital intensive than wind, but that won't help them \nescape the criticism from climate activist groups and ESG (environmental, social and governance) investors, who \nare particularly vocal and litigious in Europe and the UK.\nThe problem, of course, is that the companies can't satisfy both constituencies and in a contest between emissions \nand returns is one that ultimately shareholders will always win.\nWith Trump about to return to the White House and open up US federal lands to more drilling for oil and gas, and \nthe incoming Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, having a \"3-3-3\" plan that includes lifting US energy production by \nthree million barrels of oil equivalent a day, the contrast between the environment for the US producers and their \ncompetitors elsewhere will only become starker and the pressure from shareholders on companies like BP and \nShell will only intensify.\nTrump also plans to remove the generous 10-year tax credits for renewables within Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction \nAct, which, if he is successful, would make the returns from investment in US renewables even less competitive \nwith those from fossil fuels.\nAny increase in US oil production would add to the existing glut in the oil market and depress prices that are already \nunder pressure, despite the withdrawal of about six million barrels a day of supply by the OPEC+ cartel.\nThe lower prices being experienced now and likely to continue into at least the first half of next year, however, \naren't an argument for the oil majors to invest in renewables.\nReturns from oil and gas will still be superior to those from renewables and, if oil and gas prices and profits are \nunder pressure, there will be even more of an incentive to invest only in the highest-returning assets.\nThose who invest purely in renewables appear unconcerned about the gradual withdrawal of the oil majors who \ngatecrashed their sector and, seeking to gain scale rapidly, drove up the costs of developing greenfields projects.Page 3 of 3\nBig Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare\nPloughing billions each year into wind, solar and hydrogen dilutes the overall returns on capital and reduces the \nreturns to shareholders, making them most unhappy.\nThere are a lot of environmentally-sensitive and patient investment funds available from sources other than the oil \nmajors that are willing to trade off returns for their convictions and/or consistent long-term returns, so losing some \ninvestment from the oil companies shouldn't retard renewables developments.\nIt was always going to be difficult for BP and Shell to try to produce a balance of their traditional oil and gas \nbusinesses and renewable energy portfolios while satisfying both financially-motivated and ESG-driven investors.\nIt has been particularly difficult for the UK and Europeans, with their lower returns but better environmental \ncredentials, to attract investors in the US. There's been a backlash against ESG investing in the US where, \nbecause there is no significant stigma associated with the oil and gas industry, valuation metrics tend to be higher.\nIf BP and Shell want better access to those more attractive metrics, improved share price performances and \naccess to cheaper capital, they have no realistic option but to shed, and invest less in, low-returning assets. That's \nwhat they are now doing.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

Shell has significantly scaled back its investments in renewable energy, including offshore wind and hydrogen, and has abandoned its goal of becoming the world's largest electricity company, indicating a retreat from its previous green ambitions.\n\n2. The company, alongside BP, is refocusing on traditional oil and gas operations, planning to increase production rather than cap it, as the financial returns from fossil fuels remain superior to those from renewable investments.\n\n3. Shell's reduced emissions intensity targets and the overall downgrade of its renewable energy ambitions have led to dissatisfaction among investors, who are increasingly concerned about the lower returns from renewable assets compared to fossil fuels.\n\n4. The competitive landscape is shifting, with US oil majors like Exxon and Chevron maintaining a focus on fossil fuel production, contrasting with Shell's retreat from renewables, which may further pressure Shell's market position and shareholder expectations.",
