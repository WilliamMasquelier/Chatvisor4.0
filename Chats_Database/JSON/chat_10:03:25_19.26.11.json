Even some of her supporters don't fully understand the role and, at least politically, regard it as \nnothing more than a sop for the critics - that is, having now named an envoy, Anthony Albanese can safely deflect \nany allegation that his government has been a dithering, equivocating, morally limp-wristed mess on the issue.\nWhat's made matters worse, however, are the consequences of the PM's recent reshuffle of cabinet, which saw \nAndrew Giles not only dumped from immigration but also from his portfolio of multicultural affairs. Both have been \ngifted to Tony Burke, a bete noire of Jewish leaders who've criticised his tepid support for Israel in the aftermath of \nOctober 7, among other unhelpful, highly questionable remarks and positions.\nBurke, for example, backed the right of pro-Palestinian protesters to occupy universities. He's on record quoting \nHamas casualty figures as fact, and he's pledged full-hearted support for Canterbury-Bankstown Council's decision \nto fly the Palestinian flag - that was in the days after the southern Israeli massacre, well before Israel's ground \ninvasion even started in Gaza.\nIronically, he's simultaneously facing political annihilation in his own western Sydney seat of Watson, where an \nactivated Muslim population is threatening to oust him over a perception that Labor has been far too pro-Israel since \nthe start of the war.\nSomehow, Segal is supposed to report her findings on anti-Semitism to this politically conflicted minister, one who \nfaces electoral suicide if he puts a foot wrong and who's already demonstrated a total lack of insight and empathy \non the anti-Semitism itself.\nMeanwhile, not a word out of the PM's office about the impending appointment of a Special Envoy for \nIslamophobia. That's because of the genuine struggle to find a moderate Muslim leader willing to take on the role, \none that the government will accept, and one who'll at least be prepared to condemn what happened on October 7.\nPage 2 of 3\nLittle to envy about the envoys\nA tougher benchmark than everyone in cabinet realised, apparently.\nBuilding relationships The last time NSW Lands Minister Steve Kamper was spotted out on the town it was at a low-\nkey dinner in the company of a corrupt former Hurstville mayor, Con Hindi.\nAlso in attendance was construction boss Ronnie Wardan, head of Sydney firm Wardan Group, and his employee \nAmanda Ghalloub, but Kamper saw no need to declare this private meeting in his ministerial diary. He told Margin \nCall at the time that Wardan and Ghalloub were family friends and that Hindi wasn't invited but crashed the dinner \nand wouldn't go away. The minister, being a gentleman, just couldn't bring himself to tell Hindi to take a long walk.\nThe only reason to relive this matter is that Kamper has unfortunately been spotted once again in a deep, offline \nconversation with a prominent character in the NSW property game, this time developer Fouad Deiri, chairman of \nDeicorp, who had the pleasure of chewing Kamper's ear at an NRL football game last weekend.\nKamper told us he was invited to the Dragons v Bulldogs match by the St George CEO and spent most of the game \nin the Captain's Lounge. Not according to one eyewitness, who told Margin Call that Kamper seemed to spend \nmuch of the game in the Deicorp box.\nA spokesman for Kamper said the interaction with Deiri was hardly for most of the match. \"The minister dropped \ninto Fouad's box for about 15 minutes to distract himself from the score,\" they said. The Dragons, for what it's \nworth, were snuffed out 28-10 by the Bulldogs, the flak adding: \"The minister has known Fouad from when he still \nworked on the tools.\" That is, for decades, when a much younger Deiri wasn't the leader of a developer-builder \nempire and instead an apprentice carpenter starting out in the trade.\nThese sightings wouldn't be so awkward if Kamper wasn't the Minister for Lands and Property, a portfolio of \nimmense consequence to guys like Deiri and Wardan, and anyone else whose business is real estate. It seems just \nabout everyone in this sphere is very old mates with the minister!\nSubtle sledgehammer So little love has been lost between Fortescue and three former employees of the company \naccused of stealing intellectual property - if only to establish their own rival green steel start-up concern.\nFortescue's ham-fisted private investigators followed the trio around for weeks, spied on their families and rifled \nthrough their mail.\nBut court documents in the case suggest the animosity Fortescue felt towards former chief scientist Bart \nKolodziejczyk might go back well before the company launched legal action this year.\nWhat other conclusion are we to draw when the mining major named a special report in search of misconduct \n\"Project Sledgehammer\". Surely a hint of the whacking to come, if nothing else. Kolodziejczyk left the company in \nNovember 2021.\nAhead of his departure Fortescue allegedly called in Deloitte to run a forensic sweep on his laptop and phone, \nlooking for evidence he was taking proprietary information with him.\nAs it turns out, Deloitte's Project Sledgehammer (released in December) was something of a swing and a miss, \nidentifying no wrongdoing.\nYou'd expect such a bold title to get a mention in court when the trio try to have Fortescue's case against them \nthrown out next week. If nothing else, it offers an easy argument that Fortescue's legal case is as much about \ntrying to scare off would-be competitors than it is about IP theft.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Twiggy's subtle as a sledgehammer\nLoad-Date: August 13, 2024Page 3 of 3\nLittle to envy about the envoys\nEnd of Document\n        ",
