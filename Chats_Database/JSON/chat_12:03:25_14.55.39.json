The Israeli army says \nmore than 30 are dead.\nTedros said urgent action was needed in Gaza as \"famine looms, disease outbreaks spread and trauma injuries \nincrease\" among the trapped Palestinian population.\nHe called for the \"protection of remaining health facilities in Gaza... unimpeded access of humanitarian aid into and \nacross the Gaza Strip\" and a \"ceasefire\".\nHe also called for a \"functional deconfliction mechanism\", referring to the process of clearing aid missions in \nadvance with the Israeli military to ensure they can go ahead safely and unhindered.\n\"Despite deconfliction, yesterday's mission faced significant delays at the military checkpoint en route to Al-Shifa \nhospital,\" the WHO pointed out.\nIt said that \"between mid-October and the end of March, over half of all WHO missions had been denied, delayed, \nimpeded or postponed\" by the Israelis.\n\"As health needs soar, the lack of a functional deconfliction system is a major obstacle in delivering humanitarian \naid -- including medical supplies, fuel, food and water to hospitals -- anywhere close to the scale needed,\" it said.\nThe dialysis unit at Gaza's Al-Shifa hospital was destroyed in the Israeli siege AFP\n'At least 115 beds in the emergency department were burned and 14 incubators destroyed,' WHO said AFPPage 3 of 3\nGaza's Largest Hospital 'An Empty Shell With Human Graves': WHO\nLink to the original story.\nNotes\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex \nAuthoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its \nre-distributors.
