Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 1\nIron ore giant needs to hustle\nIron ore giant needs to hustle\nThe Daily Telegraph (Australia)\nApril 25, 2024 Thursday\nTelegraph Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 24\nLength: 229 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nFortescue will need to maintain close to record export rates to hit its full-year shipment guidance, and its troubled \nIron Bridge magnetite project has registered yet another production downgrade.\nFortescue has revealed the full effect of a derailment at its Pilbara iron ore operations, saying iron ore exports had \nslipped 6 per cent as a result of the outage at its rail line.\nThe company exported 43.3 million tonnes for the March quarter, down from 46.3 million tonnes for the same period \nin 2023, and down 11 per cent from the three months to the end of December. The slip in exports also pushed up \naverage C1 cash costs by 7 per cent, to $US18.93 ($29.08) a tonne.\nAlthough Fortescue said it still expected to meet its annual export guidance, the company said it was likely to come \nin towards the bottom of its 192 to 197 million tonne range.\nBut the company will need a significant performance to meet even that expectation. It will need to export 53.5 \nmillion tonnes in the June quarter.\nFortescue Metals boss Dino Otranto said the company was confident it could hit that rate, despite needing to ship \nat near-record rates.\n\"You can hold a lot of confidence in the performance that we've had over the last six weeks - March was an all-time \nrecord. So we're looking pretty good for the remainder of this quarter,\" he said. Fortescue shares closed up 16c to \n$24.76 on Wednesday.\nLoad-Date: April 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
