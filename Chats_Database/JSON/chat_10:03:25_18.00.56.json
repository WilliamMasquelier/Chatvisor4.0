It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nRisks in Twiggy's tryst with minister\nRisks in Twiggy's tryst with minister\nThe Australian\nMay 29, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian2 Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: THENATION; Pg. 3\nLength: 661 words\nByline: Nick Evans, Yoni Bashan, Mohammad Alfares\nBody\nAndrew Forrest's big plans in -Morocco could be complicated by his romantic connection with the country's Energy \nMinister, who also sits on the board of Fortescue's joint -venture company in the North African country.\nIn her first comment on the matter since The Australian -revealed her identity, Moroccan Energy Minister Leila \nBenali -refused to shed any light on a photograph of her allegedly sharing an intimate moment with the Fortescue \nchairman in France last week.\nIn footage posted to a local news site, Ms Benali was asked by a Moroccan journalist whether she had a personal \nor business -relationship with Mr Forrest.\nThe minister did not confirm the authenticity of the photograph, but did not deny it. \"No, no I will not speak,\" she \nsaid.\nThe romantic connection threatens to complicate matters for Fortescue as it draws up plans for a multi-billion-dollar \nrenewable energy and green ammonia investment in Morocco with joint venture partners OCP Group.\nIn addition to being Energy Minister, Ms Benali sits on the board of state-owned OCP, along with other Moroccan \ngovernment ministers.\nOCP is one of the biggest phosphate miners in the world, controlling Morocco's vast deposits of the fertiliser - \nestimated to make up more than 70 per cent of the world's known reserves.\nTogether the two companies plan to build a green ammonia hub in the country, adding to OCP's fertiliser exports.\nThe joint venture was announced in April, and includes -renewable energy generation and \"large-scale integrated \ngreen -ammonia and green fertiliser production capacity\".\nThe two companies also plan a research, development and education facility near Marrakesh.\nPage 2 of 2\nRisks in Twiggy's tryst with minister\nOCP's plans are controversial in Morocco. It says it has already invested about \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u0161\u00c2\u00ac2.5bn ($4bn) as part of a \n\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u0161\u00c2\u00ac12bn green program aimed at increasing the group's fertiliser production to 20 million tonnes a year - up \nfrom 12 million tonnes in 2022. Its initial plans for a green ammonia production centre were centred around the \nsmall fishing town of Tarfaya in southwest Morocco - once best known for the treacherous waters off its coast, a \n19th-century British fortress now crumbling into the sea, and for being the closest mainland town to the surfing \nresorts of the Canary Islands, about 80km to the west.\nOCP planned to build a -3.8 gigawatt wind and solar farm in the region, with an eventual production capacity of one \nmillion tonnes of green ammonia a year from 2027 and three million tonnes from 2032.\nBut, in addition to its isolation, Tarfaya is also disputed territory. It is only 35km north of the disputed regional border \nof the Western Sahara - a Spanish colony until 1975, but since occupied by Morocco.\nMoroccan control of the -region is disputed by the traditional Sahrawi people. Their separatist movement has this \nyear launched attacks on Moroccan troops in the region - which already hosts large wind farms built by companies \nowned by the country's royal family.\nIt is unclear whether Fortescue's joint venture with OCP will focus on the Moroccan company's original plans, and \nthe Australian mining and energy giant has not elaborated further on their work in the region.\n\"The Fortescue team is working with key stakeholders as we continue to develop our ambitious strategy with OCP, \ndeveloped over more than two years, to develop green energy, hydrogen and ammonia in Morocco,\" a spokesman \nsaid on Tuesday.\nFortescue's African plans have already suffered one major setback this month, after it was - replaced as the \npreferred developer of the giant Grand Inga hydro-electric project in the Democratic Republic of Congo by Nigerian \noil company Natural Oilfield Services.\nThe Grand Inga, estimated to come with a total cost of more than $US80bn ($120bn), was a favoured project of Dr \nForrest, and Fortescue's involvement was announced with fanfare in mid-2021, during the first flush of \nannouncements around the company's plans to become a green energy giant by the end of the decade.\nMARGIN CALL P13\nLoad-Date: May 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
