He said electric vehicle adoption needed to be pushed \"hard\" and \nliquefied natural gas would be \"critical\" in supporting the roll-out of renewables.\n\"Because of the urgency, we have to make our choices and decide where we're really going to put our emphasis,\" \nhe said.\nPage 2 of 2\nMackenzie: Focus on the best few energy solutions Exclusive\n\"We shouldn't be adding and adding and adding, if at the same time, we're not finding the things that are winning \nand getting behind that with a lot more investment and more focused investment, and just deciding this is going to \nwork in this sector, and let's get behind that because we don't have a lot of time.\"\nShell's business was built on selling oil and petrol for traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, but the \ncompany has also invested in electric vehicle charging stations, and Sir Andrew said the world needed to push \n\"hard\" on electric vehicles, and \"maybe harder than we're pushing it\".\nBut despite the rise of electric vehicles, he said the internal combustion engines that consume petrol were here to \nstay, and would enjoy longevity as the world embraced \"biofuels\" from agricultural waste and synthetically created \n\"e-fuels\".\n\"In looking at the future of oil, you look at the future of the internal combustion engine, and some would imagine \nthat the internal combustion engine would just kind of disappear. That won't happen,\" he said.\n\"Even in a world of very successful decarbonisation ... the internal combustion engine will continue, but it will be \nfuelled by biofuels, maybe by hydrogen or indeed e-fuels.\"\nThe comments come as big diesel consumers like Rio Tinto are urging the federal government to ramp up support \nfor biofuels, in the belief biofuels are the best way to reduce the emissions of iron ore trucks and trains in the \ndecade before batteries are expected to be a viable alternative.\nSir Andrew said liquefied natural gas would be \"critical\" to the energy transition.\n\"It is available now, it can be shipped everywhere, it is possible to increase its supply, and it is the lowest carbon \nfossil fuel,\" he said.\nInternational climate agreements were built on \"nationally determined contributions\", where each nation set a target \nfor emission reductions and attempts to deliver on it, he said. But the problem might be better tackled by industry \nsectors that worked collaboratively across borders.\n\"That's how some of the issues to do with the ozone hole were sorted in the end, trying to move away from CFCs.\"\nLoad-Date: June 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Peter Ker, Lap Phan\nDate: June 24, 2024\nTitle: Mackenzie: Focus on the best few energy solutions\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Shell warns of $3bn impairment\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Christian Moess Laursen\n### Date: July 08, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nShell warns of $3bn impairment\nShell warns of $3bn impairment\nThe Australian\nJuly 8, 2024 Monday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 19\nLength: 439 words\nByline: Christian Moess Laursen\nBody\nShell expects to book up to $US2bn ($3bn) in post-tax impairments after delaying construction of a major biofuels \nplant as European energy majors grapple with weak market conditions, while trading in its core gas division is set to \nfall on quarter.\nThe British energy giant on Friday said it expected to book an impairment after tax of between $US1.5bn and \n$US2bn mainly due to pausing construction of its biofuels facility in Rotterdam as well as the divestment of its \nchemicals refinery in Singapore.\nThe paused construction of the Dutch biofuels plant - one of Europe's largest, set to produce 820,000 tonnes of \nbiofuels a year - was largely due to weak European market conditions, with profit margins squeezed by a large drop \nin US renewable fuel-credits prices.\nShares in biofuels market leader Neste have shed nearly half their value this year, with the Finnish company in May \ncutting its renewable-fuel margin forecast. Shell's rival BP similarly paused biofuels investment at US and German \noil refineries recently.\nShell expects to write down between $US600m and $US1bn on the asset, while the impairment after the sale of its \nSingapore refinery is expected to be $US600m-$US800m.\nIn addition, Europe's largest energy company expects trading results from its integrated-gas segment, usually its \nlargest profit centre, to be lower than in the first quarter, when the unit booked $US3.68bn in adjusted earnings, due \nto seasonality.\nHowever, it expects the unit's results to match those of the second quarter last year, when it booked $US2.5bn in \nadjusted earnings - a metric that strips certain commodity price adjustments and one-time charges.\nThe company also narrowed the segment's liquids and natural-gas production outlook slightly upward to 940,000- \n980,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day for the quarter, from a previously guided range of 920,000- 980,000 BOE a \nday.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell warns of $3bn impairment\nShell, the world's largest liquefied natural gas trader, expects its quarterly LNG volumes to be between 6.8 million \nand 7.2 million tonnes, compared with the prior-year's 7.2 million tonnes.\nThis would mean a decline from the first quarter's 7.6 million tonnes. However, gas prices in Europe have rallied in \nrecent months on strong demand in Asia amid heatwaves and outages limiting supply, potentially providing a boon \nto Shell's quarterly results.\nOn the upstream side - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - Shell is expecting the unit to produce between \n1.72 million and 1.82 million BOE a day ready for sale, versus 1.70 million a year prior and 1.87 million in the first \nquarter. In the first quarter, the segment garnered $US1.93bn in adjusted earnings.\nLoad-Date: July 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Christian Moess Laursen\nDate: July 08, 2024\nTitle: Shell warns of $3bn impairment\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Arrow Energy To Develop Phase 2 Of Surat Coal Gas Project In Australia\n## Media outlet: International Business Times Australia\n### Author: Vidhya Ck\n### Date: August 12, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nArrow Energy To Develop Phase 2 Of Surat Coal Gas Project In Australia\nArrow Energy To Develop Phase 2 Of Surat Coal Gas Project In Australia\nNewstex Blogs \nInternational Business Times Australia\nAugust 12, 2024 Monday 2:01 PM EST\nDelivered by Newstex LLC.

The first gas production is expected in 2026, as phase 1 was launched in 2020,  Reuters reported.\n\"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify \nArrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast,\" Arrow CEO Zhengxin Peng said.\nThe announcement by Arrow Energy comes in the wake of calls for more investment to increase the local energy \nsupply. Australia's energy market operator and competition watchdog, too, had urged oil and gas companies to \ninvest more to increase the supply of energy.\n\"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to \nmarket,\"  Energy Connects quoted Zo Yujnovich, Integrated Gas and Upstream Director at Shell. \"QCLNG marked \nits 1000th cargo at the end of last year, reflecting its significance as a gas supplier for Australia and the region. This \ninvestment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a lower emissions \nalternative to options like coal.\"\nThe gas will flow to the Shell-operated QCLNG liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility on Curtis Island, near \nGladstone. It is expected to  meet the requirements of long-term contracts and domestic market, as part of a 27-\nyear agreement between Arrow Energy and QGC.\nLink to the original story.\nPage 2 of 2\nArrow Energy To Develop Phase 2 Of Surat Coal Gas Project In Australia\nNotes\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex \nAuthoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its \nre-distributors.
