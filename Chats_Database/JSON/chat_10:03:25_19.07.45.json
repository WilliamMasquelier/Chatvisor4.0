Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 644 words\nHighlight: Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Group has asked the court for search order in a stoush with former \nexecutives who left to start a rival green iron technology firm.\nBody\nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue Group has accused two former executives of \"industrial-scale misuse\" of its intellectual \nproperty when they left to start a rival green iron technology firm.\nThe miner has asked the Federal Court for permission to trawl through computers at three properties linked to \nformer employees Michael Masterman and Bart Kolodziejczyk to find evidence to support its claims.\nTwo of the properties are located in Perth, another is in Melbourne.\nFortescue alleges that confidential information was copied and taken when Masterman and Kolodziejczyk left the \ncompany in late 2021.\nSoon after leaving the miner, Kolodziejczyk, Fortescue's former chief scientist, and Masterman, a senior executive \nclose to Forrest, founded Element Zero with the aim of reducing the carbon footprint of Australia's most lucrative \nexport industry, iron ore.\nFortescue has positioned itself as a green energy convert, promising to spend $9.2 billion to eliminate emissions \nfrom its mining operations and become a global producer of green hydrogen and iron.\n\"The allegation at the heart of the proceedings is an alleged 'industrial-scale misuse' of what is said to be, by the \nFortescue parties, confidential information concerning its 'green [carbon dioxide free] iron' technology,\" Federal \nCourt judge John Logan said in a summary of the claim.\n\"It is alleged that this has been utilised in the designing, engineering and construction and operation by the first \nrespondent [Element Zero] of an industrial pilot plant for an electrochemical reduction process.\"\nThe court summary also names a third person connected with Element Zero, Bjorn Winther-Jensen.\nElement Zero has foreshadowed an application to set aside the search orders. Justice Logan said the application \nfor and execution of the search orders could turn into an \"industrial-scale forensic debacle\".\nLink to Image\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue accuses two former executives of 'industrial-scale misuse' of its intellectual property\nAlex Ellinghausen\n\"Element Zero believes this legal action is entirely without merit and welcomes the opportunity to respond to \nFortescue's spurious claims. Our response will include an application to vary or set aside the original search \norders,\" the company said.\n\"As Element Zero will demonstrate, its green metals technology was developed independently of and is very \ndifferent from anything that Fortescue is doing or has done in this space. We continue to rapidly advance our \ntechnology. As the matter is now before the court, we will not be making further comment at this time,\" it added.\nMasterman and Kolodziejczyk want to build a $US2.1 billion ($3.2 billion) green iron ore processing plant in the \nPilbara within five years. They raised $US10 million from investors at the start of the year and have plans for \nanother capital raising later in the year, targeting $US50 million to $US100 million.\nFortescue said it was leading the world in developing the cutting-edge solutions to decarbonise its Australian iron \nore operations by the end of the decade, and helping the world avert the worst impacts of climate change.\n\"As a first mover, our intellectual property is critical to our ongoing success in this pursuit and must be protected at \nall times,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"We invest significant resources in creating IP and are committed to vigorously managing and enforcing its \nprotection. As the matter is the subject of legal proceedings, we do not intend to comment further at this stage,\" \nthey said.\nJustice Logan's summary is the only court document available in the case. Hearings are set to resume later this \nmonth.\n\"What needs to be made pellucid is that there is no determination whatsoever of the merits of the claims made by \nthe Fortescue parties, or, for that matter, the riposte which has thus far been made on behalf of the respondents,\" \nJustice Logan said.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.
