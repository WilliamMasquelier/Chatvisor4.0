It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nShark's desperate bid to bring baby home\nShark's desperate bid to bring baby home\nThe Australian\nOctober 17, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: SPORT; Pg. 24\nLength: 526 words\nByline: DAVID RICCIO, RUGBY LEAGUE\nBody\nStar's son nearly died after being born six weeks early in Bali NRL star Jesse Ramien and his fiancee Shell have \nmade an impassioned plea for help from the federal government after their baby needed to be resuscitated for five \nminutes after being born six weeks premature at a hospital in Bali.\n\"It's been as scary as any parent could imagine,\" Ramien said. The harrowing experience has led to a distraught \nRamien contacting the Australian embassy in Indonesia in a desperate attempt to source a care flight for their \nmedically induced baby boy Teo back to Australia at an estimated cost of $130,000.\nA GoFundMe page has been set up by Ramien's friend Shavaun Hunt, the partner of Cronulla Sharks teammate \nRoyce Hunt, to help fund the costs of getting the family back to Australia.\nBoth Shell and Ramien are yet to hold their newborn for fear of infection and have been left to view him in his \nincubator during two two-hour visiting slots in the morning and afternoon at Bali's Siloam Hospital.\nSuch is the desire from Ramien to help his baby boy, the Sharks centre went so far as to say: \"I'll play for nothing \njust to get our baby boy home safely.\n\"There's just so much uncertainty here. We've been told by doctors it could be four weeks before our baby is OK to \ntravel, but that could quickly change to five, six, or seven weeks, who knows,\" Ramien said. \"We're doing \neverything to contact the Australian embassy to see how we can get home as quickly as possible, so that our boy \ncan get the medical attention he needs.\" Cronulla Sharks chief executive Dino Mezzatesta and the NRL are also \nworking closely with Australian consulate officials to fast-track the process.\nShell was 33 weeks pregnant and before leaving Sydney for Cronulla player Briton Nikora's wedding, the couple \nsecured clearance from Shell's obstetrician, as well as clearance from the airline and travel insurance cover for her \npregnancy.\nThe ordeal unfolded when Shell went into early labour last Friday and needed to undergo an emergency C-section.\nPage 2 of 2\nShark's desperate bid to bring baby home\n\"That was so worrying being in another hospital in another country,\" Ramien said. \"I wasn't allowed into the room to \nbe with Shell. It was difficult, especially for Shell.\" During this time, Shell had to be put under anaesthesia, with \ndoctors then needing to revive their newborn son for five minutes until he started breathing, when he was born just \nafter 11pm.\nHe was immediately rushed to NICU, where he remains under close watch with the new parents unable to see their \nboy until 9am the following morning.\n\"It's been really hard to get some answers, because as every parent knows, you just want the best care for your \nbaby, it's certainly been scary for Shell,\" Ramien said.\n\"The unfamiliarity of the medical system here and that ability to communicate our concerns in Bali only adds to the \nstress and emotion around this.\" Some of the names who have already donated to the Go Fund Me page include \nNRL stars Nicho Hynes, Blayke Brailey, Braden Hamlin-Uele, Connor Tracey, Hame Sele, Sitili Tupouniua and \nformer player Denan Kemp. \"We can't thank everyone for their care and generosity, we just want to see our baby \nhome safely,\" Ramien said.\nLoad-Date: October 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
