All Rights Reserved\nLength: 346 words\nBody\nAustralia's Fortescue Metals ( OTCQX:FSUMF) said it broke ground Friday at its $550M green hydrogen project in \nArizona, which it expects will produce as much as 11K metric tons/year of liquid renewable hydrogen to help \ndecarbonize heavy-duty transport in the southwest U.S.\nThe Arizona Hydrogen project is the first of Fortescue's ( OTCQX:FSUMF) planned green energy investments in \nNorth America; the company is working on other U.S. projects, including a manufacturing plant in Michigan for \nelectrolyzers, batteries and electric vehicle chargers, and with the U.S. Department of Energy to build a Pacific \nNorthwest Hydrogen Hub that would include a green hydrogen production plant in Washington state.\nFortescue ( OTCQX:FSUMF) Executive Chair Andrew Forrest, speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony, praised \nthe U.S. for supporting decarbonization projects but also noted some proposed policies that he said could stall \ninvestment.\n\"Fortescue is unashamedly a first-mover in this space, [but] we need to be encouraged to that, not punished,\" \nForrest said. \"There are rules right now under consideration with the Biden Administration that would make already \nannounced projects like this one dramatically more expensive and smaller.\"\nForrest was referring to the proposed Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, or section 45V of the Inflation \nReduction Act, which outlines how hydrogen producers qualify for the credit; draft rules propose to limit hydrogen \nproducers' ability to provide project-specific information, such as upstream emissions data, when calculating the \ncarbon intensity of their hydrogen.\nCritics say eligibility for the 45V tax credit based on national average carbon intensity, rather than the real \nemissions associated with each producer's operations, wound cause the U.S. government to essentially reward \ndirtier natural gas production while discouraging other producers from cleaning up their processes.\nMore on Fortescue\nFortescue: An Iron Ore Giant With Strong Cash Flows\nHistorical earnings data for Fortescue\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue starts work on $550M Arizona renewable liquid hydrogen project\nDividend scorecard for Fortescue\n 2022 Seeking Alpha  \nLoad-Date: May 6, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chair of Fortescue | \"Fortescue is unashamedly a first-mover in this space, [but] we need to be encouraged to that, not punished.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
