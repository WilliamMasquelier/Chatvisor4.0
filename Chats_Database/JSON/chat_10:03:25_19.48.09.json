Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's CEO | \"Forrest says Fortescue has a 'freedom culture' whereby staff can come directly to management to raise their concerns, and that employees admire him too much to unionise.\" | N.A. |\n| Brian Burke | Former WA Premier | \"Robe River, that was the start, the origin, the foundation of everything.\" | N.A. |\n| Paul Farrow | National Secretary of the Australian Workers' Union | \"At a time when everyone recognises that we've got a cost-of-living crisis, who is making the most noise [about industrial relations changes]? Companies earning $20 billion a year.\" | N.A. |\n| Geraldine Slattery | BHP's Country Boss in Australia | \"In the Pilbara, we've got a bizarre situation whereby we're being compelled by law to bargain with the union when neither the company nor employees have sought that. That's the bizarreness of it.\" | N.A. |\n| Michaelia Cash | Federal Opposition Leader in the Senate | \"In all the conversations I have had with miners over here, they've been clear that the industrial relations legislation has been set up to lower productivity and efficiency.\" | N.A. |\n| Simon Trott | Rio Tinto's Iron Ore Boss | \"Productivity should be the central theme of any reform of IR laws.\" | N.A. |\n| Rinehart | Mining Executive | \"Australia's increasing government intervention combined with ideological and expensive or impractical policies is negatively effecting new mining investment.\" | N.A. |\n| Murray Watt | Employment and Workplace Relations Minister | \"We want mining companies to do well, but we also want mining workers to do well. It's their hard work that delivers the profits for these companies.\" | N.A. |\n| Brad Gandy | WA State Secretary of the AWU | \"If you look back at the tactics that the companies used in the 1980s, that wouldn't work again.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
