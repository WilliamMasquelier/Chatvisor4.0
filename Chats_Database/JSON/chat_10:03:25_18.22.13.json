But what's the harm in a recap?\nNot only has the Fortescue empire abandoned plans to produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 (it \nwas supposed to have started on that objective last year), but now up to 700 workers who've been banging away at \nthe pipedream are also facing the sack.\nA sad outcome, and one that adds a dimension of absurdity to unseen photographs helpfully leaked to Margin Call \nthis week.\nYou've heard of the comical meme known as How it Started vs. How it's Going? Well, what a difference these \nimages show.\nIn the first, Fortescue officials lay out a tapestry of dreams to Credit Suisse bankers, in 2020, enwrought with \ndetails of a green hydrogen start-up that, by 2028, they said, would have an energy output \"larger than Saudi \nAramco \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. and growing\".\nUtter tosh, of course. Saudi Aramco remains the biggest energy company on the planet. To say Fortescue is on \ntrack to be situated in the same ballpark, let alone the same galaxy, is preposterous. The company will be lucky to \nproduce 20,000 tonnes of hydrogen a year if it manages to complete its first-round projects by 2028. No one would \nbe daft enough to hold their breath for that, except maybe the Fortescue spokeswoman who answered our inquiry, \nand who told us the company remained \"proud of the progress\" it had made so far.\nWe really shouldn't laugh. Tread softly, for you tread on their dreams. The second photograph features Forrest and \na trio of Fortescue employees - former chief of staff Claudia Blanch, company lawyer Emily Ward and ex--security \nchief Damien Rogers - in front of Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, an odd \nsight for a billionaire so fervently on the side of Ukraine these days.\nPage 2 of 3\nForrest still dreaming of power\nForrest reportedly seeded $750m into a fund with BlackRock's Larry Fink for the reconstruction of the war-torn \nnation, while his Minderoo foundation separately committed $20m to worthy causes.\nBut in 2021, Forrest was giddy about Russia, hamming it up in Red Square and busily talking green hydrogen to an \neconomy that backstrokes lazily through pools of oil and gas revenue.\nAt a St Petersburg economic forum held that year, Forrest met with Russian Deputy PM Alexander Novak and \napparently an oligarch or two. Regulation stuff, how could he not? Did he smack himself with birch leaves in a \nbanya, too? Scope out a dacha? We'll never know.\nAnd obviously this all preceded Forrest's withdrawal from Moscow, where he no longer has business, although one \nmight argue the writing was already on the wall for Kyiv as Twiggy paid a visit to the Kremlin.\nWhich makes us wonder: what was he doing there in the first place?\nEx-PwC man pops up A rare sighting this week of Sean Gregory dipping his toe back into public life. Gregory, for \nthose with short memories, was one of eight partners to be booted from PwC Australia in the aftermath of that \nbusiness with tax secrets.\nA year on since PwC shoved him off a plank accusing him (and others) of failing to stop the proverbial train before \nthe crash, he was spotted on stage at a tech and AI forum hosted on Tuesday by the Australian British Chamber of \nCommerce.\nGuests included WiseTech CEO Richard White, former News Corp exec and ABC deputy chair Peter Tonagh and \nMicrosoft's Steven Worrall (the tech giant having sponsored the gathering).\nThis would be Gregory's first time raising his head above the parapet since the mess of last year. He happens to be \na director of the ABCC and has been for two years, according to his LinkedIn account, which explains why he was \nrunning the forum.\nAs for what Gregory's been up to, word around town is that since the ugliness of PwC he's been studying the \nbusiness of artificial intelligence at MIT, with ambitions, apparently, to start a VC play on the same theme. We put \nthat to him, but he declined to comment.\nMore ACU pain Philosopher Stephen Finlay, formerly of the Australian Catholic University, was left unemployed last \nmonth after his position and those of his colleagues were unexpectedly terminated from the Dianoia Institute.\nIt's harder to come by a more heartless decision by the university and its vice-chancellor, Zlatko Skrbis. Foreign \nscholars left safe jobs at prestigious universities to be lured to ACU in 2019 on the promise of stable employment. \nThey, along with Finlay, are all out of a job, with Finlay making his feelings known last month.\n\"My family and I are now in a dire situation, as the timing of this could hardly be worse,\" he wrote on Facebook. \n\"While I am dying to be able to share more about events at ACU, I cannot say more at present.\" And perhaps now \nwe know why.\nListed on Monday in the Melbourne division of the Fair Work Commission is an unfair dismissal case between \nFinlay and the university, with Skrbis and others named as the respondents. Deputy president Bernadette O'Neill \nwill oversee the matter via the modern method of \"Teams\".\nGiven the contemptible treatment Finlay and his colleagues absorbed, this kind of court action would seem to have \nbeen inevitable, with others surely lining up to pursue the same course.\nAfter all, ACU sold them out, along with the entire philosophy institute, to address financial woes of the university's \nown making. We asked ACU for a comment but it declined.Page 3 of 3\nForrest still dreaming of power\nMinding P-2's and Q's Companies and governments live or die by the credit scores they're awarded from the ratings \nagencies. Mistakes, you'd imagine, would come by rarely.\nOr maybe not, judging by a curious release from Moody's this week. Margin Call's interest was piqued by a sudden \nupgrade to Qantas's short-term credit rating from Moody's, the timing of this adjustment a bit odd considering the \nairline won't report its annual profits for another week.\nBut it's not that Moody's has suddenly gleaned fresh insight into the airline's credit worthiness. Instead, it has \nuncovered a three-year-old mistake in its own homework.\nWe'll spare you the jargon, but essentially it \"mistakenly assigned\" a short-term rating known as P-3 to Qantas, \ninstead of P-2.\nThe difference?\nA rating of P-2 suggests a \"strong ability\" to repay short-term debt obligations, according to Moody's guidelines. The \nalternative of a P-3 rating isn't exactly a deadly downgrade, but it's more like an \"acceptable ability\" to repay those \nobligations.\nNot that this flub seemed to bother Qantas much - it never even raised a complaint. And sure, mistakes happen, but \nit does bring into question whether the ratings agencies are the paragons of exacting analysis and impeccable \nreputation they claim to be.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL A rare sighting this week of ex-PwC partner Sean Gregory\nLoad-Date: August 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Yoni Bashan & Nick Evans\nDate: August 29, 2024\nTitle: Forrest still dreaming of power\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Rear Window Young fogeys of private clubs unite!\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Myriam Robin And Mark Di Stefano\n### Date: August 29, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 3\nRear Window Young fogeys of private clubs unite!\nRear Window; Young fogeys of private clubs unite!\nAustralian Financial Review\nAugust 29, 2024 Thursday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Those under 40 (\"young\" being a relative term here) \njoined when it was explicitly not something most of their generation did.\nBy spending their time at a private membership club over, say, a pricey gym or business networking group, they \nmade a deliberate choice. They don't want female members. And they get very uppity at the old codgers keen on \nfoisting such a thing upon them.\nBeing a young fogey can be isolating. And so, last night in Melbourne, a portion of the memberships of the city's \nfour leading private members clubs gathered at the Athenaeum, where an earlier vote of the membership showed a \ndistinct preference for segregation among the younger set.\nCall it a show of force from conservative members of the Athenaeum Club, Melbourne Club, Australian Club and \nSavage Club. It follows concerns about the salami tactics by which Athenaeum's general committee seemed to be \nallowing women into the place (most recently into the Drawing Room, to align the club with \"proper etiquette and \nsocial norms\").\nAt the dinner, a presentation was planned on the mental health benefits of single-sex spaces. And then, the young \nfogeys would no doubt have compared tactics and strategies.\nAfter all, it's hard being counter-cultural.\nPage 2 of 3\nRear Window Young fogeys of private clubs unite!\nTwiggy's 'ambassador'\nleft holding her bags\nEven as executives fled Fortescue, one didn't leave Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest's side.\nIn August last year, off went CEO Fiona Hick (after six months) and CFO Christine Morris (two months). Guy \nDebelle was out from the board a week later. Some 11 executives had left Fortescue in three years. It was former \nCEO Elizabeth Gaines who stayed.\nTurns out she had so many reasons to! Last year, Fortescue shareholders found out that Gaines' transition from \nnon-executive to executive director as a result of a reshuffle came with a $794,856 one-off exertion payment, \nrelating to her role as Fortescue's first \"global ambassador\".\nThis fee was to compensate for the additional \"work, time and travel commitment\" that came with her emissary \nduties. It was awarded on top of a $1.97 million payment she was given for her CEO reign in 2023, and another \n$1.05 million for FY24.\nThose inducements are unwinding. Yesterday, Gaines' executive director pay was effectively slashed in half to \n$500,000 to reflect a \"reduction in time commitment\" for the former CEO. This is after proxies objected to her pay.\nStill, a decision to remove her travel allowance is a head-scratcher. How can a global ambassador fulfil her duties \naround the, err, globe, if she's left carrying her own bags through Perth International? Could it be that the position \nwas a nebulous panic title that her boss gave her so she wouldn't follow others out the door?\nBesides, if the company had need of a global ambassador, wouldn't it be the bloke spending an inordinate amount \nof time crossing timezones in a private jet? University lectures on lethal humidity. Media hits in the Bloomberg \nLondon studio. Drone shows over Manhattan. Global ambassador for Twiggy is as useful as being spokeswoman \nfor Donald Trump: you may as well wait to hear from the big mouth.\nGaines isn't the only one in line for a pay cut. Former Reserve Bank board member-cum-Village People enthusiast \nMark Barnaba will no longer be the lead independent director on the Fortescue board, where he was paid $1.26 \nmillion for FY24. That duty will soon fall to ex-CSIRO boss Larry Marshall.\nBut there are still plenty of benefits in staying in Twiggy's graces. Both Barnaba and Gaines were added to the \nboard of Western Australia's Greatland Gold in 2022. Two weeks later, it was reported that Twiggy's Wyloo Metals \nhad taken an 8.6 per cent stake in the gold and copper explorer. That's the thing about boardroom jobs, the most \nqualified candidates are so often the ones already in the contact book.\nGaines also sits on the board of the West Coast Eagles. She's there along with Fortescue's new PR chief Nicole \nMoody (another coincidence surely).\nGaines is so well favoured, she's talked about in Perth as the next leader of the influential AFL club. You have to \nwonder if crossing the Nullarbor to watch cellar-dwellers lose at the MCG can hold a candle to flying through Paris.\nJon Adgemis' vintage\nyacht seeks buyers\nWhat's the saying? The two happiest days in a boat owner's life are the day they buy the boat, and the day they sell \nit.\nSo, we arrive at the situation facing embattled publican and ex-KPMG dealmaker Jon Adgemis, who's living an \nintriguing day-to-day life riding the debt markets, holding off creditors, all the while living the life of a budding \nHollywood producer on Sydney Harbour. Imagine the stress!Page 3 of 3\nRear Window Young fogeys of private clubs unite!\nSome of the properties in his Public Hospitality Group have been seized. But in June, Deutsche Bank and New \nYork-headquartered Muzinich came to the rescue with a $400 million refinancing package.\nThat eases the pressure somewhat. For now. But it doesn't mean that Adgemis can't take steps to show things are \nchanging. And that's where the boat comes in.\nHe owns the 95-foot yacht called Hiilani. But unlike some of the more modern craft doing laps of the harbour, his \nHiilani has a distinctly vintage feel. It was once owned by celluloid royalty Shirley Temple.\nNews has reached us that Adgemis is seeking buyers for the yacht, turning to a local dealer to gauge interest. \nOffloading the yacht is part of the owner's quest seeking a more humble, less flashy life, apparently. The seafaring \nelite are hardly affected by the cost-of-living crisis. Though this is too retro a toy for the Bondi plastic set.\nHowever, there's always other ways to extract cash flow. Celeb accountant Anthony Bell's Ghost 2 recently played \na starring role in Ryan Gosling's Fall Guy this year, set around Sydney Harbour. Did the studio pay for the pleasure \nto have the yacht moored in one of the movie's central scenes? Adgemis certainly has new friends in the industry.\nRemember Jon: a ship is safest in the harbour, but it is not built for that.\nLoad-Date: August 31, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Myriam Robin And Mark Di Stefano\nDate: August 29, 2024\nTitle: Rear Window Young fogeys of private clubs unite!\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Australia's iron ore future is different, not dead\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Anthony Macdonald\n### Date: August 29, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nAustralia's iron ore future is different, not dead\nAustralia's iron ore future is different, not dead\nAustralian Financial Review\nAugust 29, 2024 Thursday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

In fact, it does not even want to.\nFortescue's future is firmly Pilbara iron ore. It will spend $US4 billion ($5.9 billion) this year developing hubs and \nmines, exploration and trying to decarbonise its operations, mostly focused on iron ore. Energy - the hydrogen part - \nis slated to get only $US500 million of it.\nThat's not to say Fortescue wants to keep doing what it has always done. It knows China is changing - as is what it \nwants from Australia and the miners that sell it 1 billion tonnes of red dirt a year.\nFor 60 years, China has bought that red dirt and burnt it with metallurgical coal (mostly from Queensland) to make \nsteel. It got more hungry as its property and infrastructure construction stepped up, sending the price of iron ore to \nmore than $US100 a tonne, where it has mostly stayed.\nBut China's growth has slowed, including in the all-important property sector, its steel mills have dropped production \nand even bulls such as Fortescue co-CEO Dino Otranto see the difference.\n\"We're in the middle of China changing,\" he says.\nWhat China wants, Otranto says, is higher grade and cleaner products to help decarbonise its own industries, \nincluding those steel mills. There are ongoing talks about how this will play out inside China and Fortescue is trying \nto deal itself into the discussions; executive chairman Andrew Forrest was in China for such talks yesterday and \nOtranto will be there next week, he says.\nFortescue's plan is to sell China what it is calling \"green metal\" - made in Australia, using that same red dirt from \nthe Pilbara.",
