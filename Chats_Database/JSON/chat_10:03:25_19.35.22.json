Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Bronwyn Grieve | Director of Global Sustainability and External Affairs at Fortescue | \"The government needs to think about levelling the playing field so that companies that do want to decarbonise and shift to clean fuel sources are on a level playing field with those that stay in the current environment.\" | N.A. |\n| Bronwyn Grieve | Director of Global Sustainability and External Affairs at Fortescue | \"It could look at structuring the diesel fuel tax credit in a way that allows some companies - the big fossil fuel users, your top, big-tier mining companies - to be eligible for some of those credits, only where they are willing to invest those credits into a proper decarbonisation program.\" | N.A. |\n| Warren Pearce | Chief Executive of the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies | \"We do not support proposals to change the diesel fuel rebate.\" | N.A. |\n| Bronwyn Grieve | Director of Global Sustainability and External Affairs at Fortescue | \"Fortescue has been having discussions with government about the introduction of incentives to encourage decarbonisation within industry. That's something that industry can support, and our member companies are working hard to reduce our emission in line with net zero targets.\" | N.A. |\n| Bronwyn Grieve | Director of Global Sustainability and External Affairs at Fortescue | \"nor are we pushing for an immediate cessation or removal of the diesel fuel tax credit.\" | N.A. |\n| Bronwyn Grieve | Director of Global Sustainability and External Affairs at Fortescue | \"We think there are much more nuanced and sensible solutions in the near term that can be adopted.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
