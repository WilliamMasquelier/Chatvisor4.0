BHP shareholders on Wednesday night were taking \nthe view that the negotiations with its takeover target Anglo American would probably result in a compromise. But \nAnglo American has slammed the door shut on further talks by failing to extend the deadline for BHP to make a firm \nbid in an announcement that followed its earlier increased bid.\nBHP had tried to show that it was moving to allay concerns around risks in South Africa related to its deal.\nAnother week would have allowed Anglo American time to work through the issues further.\nBut some believe BHP should have even gone as far as underwriting the transaction by taking the South African \nKumba iron ore operation from Anglo American shareholders as part of the deal, rather than returning it to them as \nplanned, BHP could combine it with some coal mines in a sale process down the track and potentially achieve a \nbetter price for the assets.\nAs reported on Wednesday, among BHP's efforts to allay fears surrounding structure was the offer of a \"reverse \nbreak fee\", and it had offered direct responses to Anglo's concerns, including offering the South African government \na three-year guarantee to maintain staffing levels in the country, sharing any costs of employee share schemes, \nand establishing a mining centre of excellence in South Africa to train mine workers and conduct research and \ndevelopment for BHP's global mining operations.\nElsewhere, an odd application to the Takeovers Panel revealed to the market on Wednesday shows that mergers \nand acquisitions remain on the agenda for Ramelius Resources.\nPage 2 of 2\nBHP shareholders remain hopeful of deal on takeover despite rebuff from Anglo American - DATA ROOM\nThe gold miner led by Mark Zeptner is seen as a sophisticated operator that will soon be more cashed-up than it \nalready is and has executed well on M&A in the past, so the market would probably support any deal it puts \nforward.\nIt walked away from a deal to buy Canadian gold miner Karora, with which Westgold Resources has agreed to \nembark on a $2.2bn merger transaction.\nBut judging by the Takeovers Panel application, it appears that Ramelius is keen to take part in some sort of two-\nway of three-way tie-up with Westgold and/or Karora.\nIt's objecting to the cost of the break fee on Westgold's deal with Karora, which is standard for deals in Canada, and \na one-year standstill agreement Ramelius and Westgold had in place from November. Expectations are that once \nthe panel examines the application, it will be thrown out.\nRamelius closed down 7 per cent on Wednesday and Westgold up 6.5 per cent. Ramelius owns two production \nand processing hubs at Mt Magnet and Edna May, both located in Western Australia and is developing its Rebecca \nand Cue Gold Projects.\nLoad-Date: May 29, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Mark Zeptner | CEO of Ramelius Resources | \"The gold miner led by Mark Zeptner is seen as a sophisticated operator that will soon be more cashed-up than it already is and has executed well on M&A in the past, so the market would probably support any deal it puts forward.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
