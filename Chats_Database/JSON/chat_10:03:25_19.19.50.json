I did both jobs. The weapon of choice was the L96A1,\" he writes on Instagram.\nBut what's a spy without another identity? According to Lancaster's prolific social media posts and interviews, he \nhas also purchased properties in France, including a chateau, which he developed into successful business for \ntourists looking to travel the countryside.\nLancaster has not returned The Weekend Australian's requests for comment, which have been left via social media \nchannels and with a call to his office.\nDetails about the PI can be revealed after Fortescue sensationally alleged Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-\nJensen stole the would-be green energy giant's intellectual property to launch their own start-up, Element Zero.\nPage 2 of 3\nMeet the veteran PI hired by Twiggy\nAlong with long term lieutenant of Dr Forrest, Michael Masterman, Fortescue has claimed that after the three men \nleft the company's green iron project between 2021 and 2022, the only way they could have rapidly developed their \nown way to process iron ore into metallic iron without burning fossil fuels is by stealing Fortescue's secrets.\nThe iron ore giant's suspicions prompted the company to launch an urgent court case in May, seeking permission to \nlaunch raids on properties of Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen to collect evidence in support of their case. In \norder to work out when to launch the raids, Fortescue was required to determine if children under 18-years-old or \nfemale occupants would be in the properties identified in search orders and when they would be there.\nHe took the job seriously, with a court hearing he or his company conducted \"19 days of surveillance that was \nundertaken of all the respondents and their employees and some family members and wives following people to \nKmart, sifting through mail and the like\".\nLancaster produced a 600 page report, containing shots taken while undercover of Dr Kolodziejczyk's wife and five-\nyear-old son along with Dr Winther-Jensen's wife and 16-year-old daughter who had been watched as she left for \nschool and returned home on one day.\nWho is Robert Lancaster?\nLancaster has left a very public profile of himself across social media and online via interviews, and in old stories he \nwrote and published on his business website: Lancaster Global Risk.\nHe served in the British army, including the 22nd SAS and in Ireland during the Troubles, between 1977 and 1989 \nafter he joined the military at 16-years-old.\n\"When I was in the infantry I spent just under three years in Northern Ireland,\" he tells the Spycraft 101 podcast, \npublished about a month ago. \"A lot of that was intelligence gathering, a lot of surveillance. A lot of patrolling.\" In a \nsocial media post, that shows an old picture with Lancaster in camouflage, he says: \"Old school Australian SF. I \nserved in 22 SAS and later in the Australian Commandos. I remain a brother.\" In another, alongside a picture of two \nblokes arm-in-arm sitting in front of five dogs, Lancaster says: \"Catch up with Bill a mate from the Australian \nCommandos with his 'wolf pack' at one of his country estates. War stories and wine flowed freely.\" His time in the \nSAS set him up for a life in the private sector, Lancaster says. He left the military following a divorce and had just \n\"had enough\". In the early 1990s he moved to Australia following a job offer. He carried out a stint in the reserve \nspecial forces in Australia from 1990, and then undertook two months-long undercover operations in NSW, he tells \nthe Spycraft podcast.\nLancaster speaks highly of his track record as a PI. After he investigated a multimillion-dollar scam in NSW's Urban \nTransit Authority in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he claims 18 people were arrested. \"If I would have been found \nout there I'd have probably been disappeared. It was very unionised, it was quite a dynamic situation,\" he says. He \nsurvived, and moved on to another undercover gig three weeks later for the NSW State Rail Authority before \nlaunching what he says is a highly sought after PI business in Lancasters Global Risk based in Sydney. After he \nstarted off doing jobs for insurance companies investigating the veracity of disablement claims, business soared \nand he says he had about 100 investigations per week within a few years of setting up the company in 1991.\nIn another story, published on his company's website, he discusses Lancaster's role in one of Australia's most \nbruising industrial disputes: that between the Maritime Union of Australia and Patrick Stevedores in 1998.\nAfter Patrick's entire workforce was sacked and replaced with ex-military men, a month long picket disrupted \nmovements across major ports across the country. \"While the industrial clash intensified, with surging lines of \ndemonstrators, mass arrests, guards in balaclavas with dogs protecting strike breakers, there was another game \nbeing played behind the scenes,\" the article says. \"In the bush around the container port, hidden in the industrial \nsprawl of Sydney's Port Botany, Lancaster had his operatives, mostly former special forces soldiers, trained in the \nart of concealment and surveillance.Page 3 of 3\nMeet the veteran PI hired by Twiggy\n\"As Lancaster puts it, and talking only because the dispute is now some four years gone: 'We had people in camo \ngear dug into bushland watching where people gathered. We can take video images form up to a kilometre away as \nlong as the conditions aren't too hot \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and identify individuals.\n\"We clearly identified the ringleaders and documented instances of violence and intimidation. We also had people \ninfiltrate picket lines with miniature covert cameras, and had people at the front and rear gates and a roving patrol, \nall armed with cameras to record acts of violence and intimidation.\"\nDiversify your business Lancaster says he runs a pension fund and a property portfolio, including in France where \nhe says he ran an eight bedroom chateau with a Michelin star chef for guests. His Instagram profile, called \nPlantagenet Manor, is private but the name links to a chateau. It does not appear to be available for stays, although \nan old posting remains online.\n\"The chateau is located in the centre of historic Chalus on nearly two acres of private grounds, surrounded by high \nwalls and hedges and is within walking distance to restaurants, cafes, bars, shops and a lovely Health Spa,\" its \ndescription reads. \"Plantagenet Manor is a beautiful eight bedroom 'petit' chateau with a heated in-ground pool that \nhas gone through a complete renovation with five new bathrooms, gourmet commercial size kitchen (and) modern \nfour poster beds.\" Photos posted to Facebook in 2022 also show some shots of a completed renovation on a \nproperty in the Sunshine Coast, nestled among palm trees and a crystal blue pool. \"After living in Sydney for about \nhalf of my life it was a big call to move to Queensland,\" he said. He says had a significant heart attack a few years \nago; more recently he has suffered another health setback and has pulled back on work. However, he continued to \nwork \"contract by contract\", he told Spycraft.\nLoad-Date: July 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
