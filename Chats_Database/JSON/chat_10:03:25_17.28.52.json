Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 684 words\nByline: James Pearson\nHighlight: Javelin Minerals' maiden drilling program at its Coogee project in WA has hit 65g/t gold and 8.5pc \ncopper to extend the strike beyond 1km northward and at depth.\nBody\nJavelin Minerals has struck high-grade gold and copper in a maiden drilling program at its Coogee project in \nWestern Australia's Eastern Goldfields, 20 kilometres northeast of Kambalda, hitting grades of up to 65 grams per \ntonne (g/t) gold and 8.5 per cent copper.\nThe results of the 2921-metre reverse circulation drill program have now pushed the mineralisation strike out past \none kilometre, significantly extending the existing resource to the north. It also extended the strike at depth \nbeneath the existing pit. The company says the results have reinforced Coogee's potential as a high-value mining \nopportunity.\nWhile drilling for extensions to the north-west trend, the bit jagged high-grade mineralisation including 5 metres \ngrading 14.22g/t gold from 143m with a 1m chunk running at 65g/t gold and 1.91pc copper from 145m.\nAnother drillhole beneath the current pit confirmed rich depth extensions with a 10m hit running at 4.55g/t gold from \n91m, including a 1m section grading 38.1g/t gold from 98m.\n'This is a fantastic start to our exploration program at Coogee.'\nJavelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell\nAnother hole drilled to the northeast confirmed lateral extensions, striking 7m grading 6.42g/t gold including 7m of \n2.54pc copper from 108m, and a 1m slice of 8.53pc copper from 109m.\nTo the south of the pit further mineralisation was picked up with another 4m intercept running at 2.22g/t gold from \n80m.\nThe Coogee resource currently stands at 3.65 million tonnes at 1.08g/t gold for a total of 126,685 ounces of gold, \nalongside 1.01mt at 0.41pc copper, containing 4133 tonnes of the red metal.\nJavelin is now reviewing all the data for a potential resource upgrade.\nPage 2 of 2\nJavelin feasts on multiple high-grade WA gold, copper hits\nSitting in a highly prospective greenstone belt, Coogee is surrounded by significant gold deposits, including Silver \nLake Resources' 400,000-ounce Salt Creek mine, the Daisy-Milano mine and the Gold Field Ltd-controlled St Ives \ngold camp.\nJavelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell said: \"This is a fantastic start to our exploration program at \nCoogee. We are focused on Coogee because we saw the potential for it to become a near-term WA brownfields \nexploration success story. The results reveal new high-grade shoots outside the existing resource, both along \nstrike and below the existing open pit.\" \nThe current campaign represents the first systematic exploration at Coogee since Ramelius Resources pulled \nstumps in 2014. After mining a 70m open pit Ramelius recovered 147,400 tonnes of material at 4.7g/t gold for \n20,400 ounces of gold.\nThe ore was processed at the nearby carbon-in-leach Burbanks Mill with metallurgical recoveries at the time \nrunning to an impressive 96.4pc.\nThe latest drilling campaign has potentially provided a company-defining moment for Javelin, given it designed an \nexploration program to chase lookalike nearby deposits that may have gone unnoticed.\nThe same near-mine theory recently massively rewarded neighbouring ASX-listed Spectrum Metals and Spartan \nResources, both of which found multi-million-dollar gold deposits lurking just north of their old open pits.\nSpectrum Metals unearthed a new 355,000-ounce deposit five years ago at Penny North grading 13.8g/t just 300m \nfrom the old Penny West open pit. Spartan had similar luck jagging a 721,000-ounce gold resource at its Never \nNever project, with grades of 5.85g/t, also just 300m north of its old pit.\nWith phase one drilling out of the way, Javelin is gearing up for a second phase to test for extensions of the newly \nidentified shoots and chase a high-priority magnetic anomaly to the north, dubbed Bullseye, along with a similar \ntarget 1.5km to the west of the old pit.\nThe gold prices, currently trading close to all-time highs and just shy of US$2900 (A$4677) per ounce, are proving a \nhuge fillip for junior gold miners at the moment. With the improving prospects of a new discovery seemingly just \naround the corner and with easy access to third party milling facilities, Javelin now has the bit well and truly \nbetween its teeth.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?
