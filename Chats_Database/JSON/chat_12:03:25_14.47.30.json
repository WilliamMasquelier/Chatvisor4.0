Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1852 words\nHighlight: Fossil fuel producers are buying large stakes in carbon companies and land to run their own carbon \noffset projects. Experts and insiders want that banned.\nBody\nLarge fossil fuel companies are making multimillion-dollar investments in carbon companies and offset projects, \nraising concerns among industry insiders and experts that the sector is funding lowest-cost and lower-quality \nemission offsets, rather than tackling climate change as was intended.\nAn investigation by this masthead has found fossil fuel companies, including Shell and Woodside, are increasingly \nentering the supply chain of the Australian carbon offsets market, buying stakes in carbon companies, registering \nprojects, trading credits or purchasing swathes of land to run their own carbon abatement projects.\nLink to Image\nJason South\nUnder the federal government's flagship policy for reducing industrial emissions, the country's top polluters can \nachieve all required emissions reductions through buying Australian carbon credits. Experts question allowing those \npolluters to have a role in the creation and sale of those credits.\n\"The guys who are doing the emitting, are now getting profits from the solution? It couldn't be more perverse. \nThey're profiting from the problem they created,\" said Daryl Killin, who previously held senior roles at major carbon \ncompanies Select Carbon and Natural Carbon.\nThe criticisms came as an investigation by this masthead revealed allegations of carbon companies using long-term \ncontracts to sign traditional owners into unfair deals, and of the industry watchdog, the Clean Energy Regulator \n(CER), having chronic problems managing conflicts of interest.\nGlobal petroleum giant Shell's subsidiary, Shell Energy Environmental Products Australia, lists its primary activity \nas to \"carry out trading\" of Australian credits. Its profit in 2021 was $3.4 million, followed by losses of $2.8 million \nand $2.2 million in 2022 and 2023.\nThe Shell subsidiary also became a 25.1 per cent shareholder of Corporate Carbon last year in a $14 million deal \nthat included a $7.25 million funding injection from its parent company, Shell Energy Holdings Australia. Its latest \nannual report said the acquisition would give Shell \"significant influence over its business decisions\".\nPage 2 of 4\n'Perverse': Woodside, Shell spend millions getting into offset game\nCorporate Carbon managing director Gary Wyatt said Shell converted an investment in its Queensland offset \nprojects into the shareholding which allowed Shell to nominate one board director.\nWyatt, who previously ran ANZ Bank's energy trading desk, said carbon credits \"fill a small bridging role\" in climate \npolicy and called for greater government regulation to reduce emissions across the broader economy. He said the \nfossil fuel industry should not be blamed for emissions.\n\"It's not a problem they [the fossil fuel industry] created,\" he said. \"It's a problem that's been created by us choosing \nto live the lifestyle that we do, which has resulted in the consumption of a large amount of fossil fuels. We've all \nbenefited from that lifestyle, but it's created a problem. But to point to the energy producers and say, you've created \nthis problem, is a very narrow framing.\"\nWyatt was \"not comfortable\" answering questions about what benefits Shell's shareholding delivered for the petrol \ngiant, but conceded the company may achieve \"cheaper outcomes\" and \"secure volumes\" of carbon credits.\nA Shell spokesperson said \"offsets are used only where emissions cannot be avoided\" and that part-owning \nCorporate Carbon allowed it to \"maximise quality and integrity\" of projects that \"deliver wider benefits to the \nenvironment and local communities\".\nShell fully acquired another carbon company, Select Carbon, in 2020.\nLand titles obtained by this masthead show ASX-listed oil and gas giant Woodside's subsidiary, Woodside Energy \nCarbon Services, owns 72 property titles in NSW and 41 titles in Western Australia to run offset projects.\nIt has nine carbon projects registered with the CER, using the reforestation method which involves planting native \ntrees. These projects have been issued more than 840,000 carbon credits since 2013. Dozens of other polluters \nhave registered carbon projects, including Santos, Inpex and Tokyo Gas Australia.\nA spokesperson for Woodside said its carbon business was established in 2018 to \"better manage the cost and \nintegrity of our carbon credits\" and it was \"open to considering an investment in a carbon developer but is pleased \nwith our carbon business's capability today\".\n\"Woodside's priority is avoiding and reducing emissions,\" the spokesperson said.\nHowever, Woodside's decarbonisation strategy has been routinely rejected by investors as undermining \ninternational climate agreements. A historic 58 per cent of shareholders voted against the plan in April over \nconcerns the company was expanding gas projects, relying too heavily on offsets and failing to cut key emissions.\nInternational conglomerates are also players in the local carbon market. Mitsubishi bought a 40 per cent stake in \nAustralian Integrated Carbon in 2021, and Mitsui invested in Climate Friendly in 2022.\nA former staff member at Climate Friendly, who declined to be named because they feared retribution, quit last year \nafter becoming uncomfortable with the influence of Mitsui and private equity firm Adamantem.\n\"The shift went from mum and dad farmers, helping those people into the scheme, to maximising profits for \nshareholders ... How do we grow the business to make sure Adamantem are happy?\"\nThe staff member questioned the company's leadership about the new investors and was told Mitsui helped Climate \nFriendly by establishing connections with fossil fuel industry customers, both in Australia and abroad.\n\"What does Climate Friendly get out of it? It's the relationships,\" they said. \"Within the industry, you need to know \nwho is buying and selling. To sell that volume of ACCUs you need the relationship. It was millions of dollars of \ntrades.\"\nThe employee said these relationships paid off and there was an unprecedented rise in Climate Friendly's trading \nvolumes after the Mitsui investment.Page 3 of 4\n'Perverse': Woodside, Shell spend millions getting into offset game\n\"The trades were massive, like nothing we had seen before ... That's fine for a one-off, then it started happening \nmore frequently. And I was like: 'Is this going be the trajectory of the business?'\"\nClimate Friendly co-executive officers Skye Glenday and Josh Harris released a joint statement saying the \ncompany's purpose had not changed from \"profit-for-purpose\" and \"tackling climate change\" through supporting \ncarbon farming.\nThey said Adamantem's investment had allowed staff to increase from 30 to 100 people and \"scale up our positive \nclimate change impacts\" and said Mitsui had a \"strong decarbonisation plan\" that had no influence on the company \nstrategy.\n\"Our driving purpose is to decarbonise Australia's land sector, which is responsible for about 20 per cent of the \nnation's greenhouse gas emissions,\" they said in a joint statement.\n \"Our staff are clear on Climate Friendly's purpose and mission, and are united by the urgent need to scale up \ncarbon farming in line with the International Panel on Climate Change's call for the world to rapidly expand carbon \nsequestration.\" \nThis masthead can also reveal the Australian Academy of Sciences (AAS) raised concerns with the CER in 2022 \nthat the $4.5 billion taxpayer-backed Emissions Reduction Fund had become too focused on supporting the \ngrowing carbon industry rather than abating emissions.\n\"Over the decade of the [Emissions Reduction Fund] operation, the scheme has become less of a climate policy \ninstrument and more of an industry policy mechanism,\" according to an internal CER email obtained by this \nmasthead under freedom of information summarising \"key take-outs\" from the Academy's review.\n\"There is a need to reinforce that the ACCU [Australian Carbon Credit Unit] scheme is fundamentally for the \nremoval, and avoidance, of greenhouse gas emissions.\"\nThe scientists identified \"several concerns or limitations\" with two of the most common methods, avoided \ndeforestation and human-induced regeneration (HIR), which rely on \"counterfactuals\" and unreliable data that \nmakes the scheme \"vulnerable to integrity accusations\" and \"accusations of doing little to prevent carbon leakage\".\nKillin said these projects dominate the market because they were cheap to run, reducing costs for polluters while \nboosting profits for the carbon \"gatekeepers\" that own most projects and make money from trading credits.\n\"We've got a cartel running the industry in Australia,\" said Killin. \"We've had fossil fuel companies running climate \npolicy in this country for decades. Carbon is no different.\"\nIn an unpublished submission to the Chubb review, Killin said barriers to entry and poor policy had made it \n\"excruciatingly painful\" to run small-scale projects that use robust methods, such as tree planting and savannah \nburning. He called for carbon companies to split up and for fossil fuel investment in supply to be banned.\n\"I am a well-informed industry insider who knows how the market really runs, rather than the 'sweetness and light' \nthat are regularly portrayed to the public,\" the submission states.\n\"We need real carbon abatement policy and actual carbon market development that encourages direct participation \nand minimises intermediary benefits.\"\nKillin called for a \"complete overhaul\" to address the \"market failure\" where vested interests had suppressed the \nprice of carbon and resulted in low transparency for participants and poor quality projects.\n\"All of this has conspired to create a cosy 'Carbon Club' in Australia. Voices of dissent and other internal criticism \nthat do not fit the industry's vacuous view of itself are ignored repeatedly,\" he said.Page 4 of 4\n'Perverse': Woodside, Shell spend millions getting into offset game\nKillin was critical of government interventions to reduce the cost of carbon credits, pointing to the government's \n\"cost containment\" policy that caps credits at $70 for companies captured by the safeguard mechanism, when \nrobust tree planting projects can cost up to $100 per credit.\n\"It's not a real market. If there is high demand, the price should go up. But every time the price goes up, the \ngovernment intervenes to bring the price down,\" he said. \"The polluters should be made to pay.\"\nUniversity of Sydney chair of political economy Dr Gareth Bryant said governments globally had intervened in \ncarbon offset markets because high prices were \"political poison\".\nBryant said the \"elegant economic reasoning\" of market-based emissions reduction always came second to \nindustry interests, and politicians were quick to \"carve out special consideration policies\" to avoid hurting fossil fuel \nprofits.\n\"That's the contradiction of carbon offsetting. Attempts to create a profitable industry around carbon offsetting are \nalways coming up against interests which see carbon offsets as a get out of jail free card for the fossil fuel industry. \nIn that battle, usually it's the fossil fuel industry that has won, globally.\"\nClimate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen declined an interview request and did not answer detailed \nquestions on record, but a spokesperson highlighted the government's increased and legislated emissions \nreduction target, and said the safeguard mechanism and renewable energy plan meant Australia was \"now on track \nfor at least 42 per cent emissions reduction by 2030\".\nGraphic\n \nDaryl Killin is speaking publicly to improve the carbon offsets market.\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nFormat your response as follows:\nTitle: [Title of the document]\nAuthor: [Author of the document]\nMedia Outlet: [Name of the media outlet]\nDate of Publication: [Date of publication]- (extract the date in the format Month Day, Year - IN ENGLISH)\nMedia type: ['National', 'Regional' or 'Industry-specific/Trade-press']\n\nHere is an example of document provided: Document(metadata='source': \"KnowledgeBase/CompanyAnalysis/Embraer/MediaCoverage/NewsEmbraer/What near-disasters, 'SNL' jabs mean for Alaska 's reputation.PDF\", 'page': [1, 2, 3], page_content='Page 1 of 3\nWhat near-disasters, 'SNL' jabs mean for Alaska 's reputation\nWhat near-disasters, 'SNL' jabs mean for Alaska's reputation - Correction \nAppended\nThe Seattle Times\nJanuary 25, 2024 Thursday\n Correction Appended\nCopyright 2024 The Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved\nSection: Pg.

In het akkoord erkent Philips geen schuld voor mogelijke schade bij pati\u00ebnten, die vreesden dat ze \nkanker, astma en andere aandoeningen hadden opgelopen door het gebruik van de Philips-apparaten. Het \nconcern kondigde gisteren ook aan dat zijn verzekeraars ruim \u20ac0,5 mrd van de kosten zullen vergoeden.\nDe schikking betreft zowel de claims voor medische schade als voor medische controle voor pati\u00ebnten. \nClaimadvocaten hadden meer dan 760 zaken aangebracht. Nog eens 60.000 pati\u00ebnten hadden zich laten \nregistreren om in een later stadium aanspraak te kunnen maken op een vergoeding. Hoeveel geld afzonderlijke \npati\u00ebnten ontvangen, is nog niet duidelijk. Het is aan de advocaten om het totaalbedrag onder hun cli\u00ebnten te \nverdelen. Philips heeft zich stevig verweerd tegen de schadeclaims. Volgens het bedrijf is uit onderzoek gebleken \ndat de uitstoot van schadelijke stoffen te gering was om ernstige gezondheidsschade te kunnen veroorzaken. \nPhilips stemde toch in met een schikking omdat de uitkomst van rechtszaken moeilijk te voorspellen is. In het \nAmerikaanse rechtssysteem kunnen jury's soms onverwacht grote schadevergoedingen toekennen. Eerder \nbereikte Philips al een akkoord over economische schade voor pati\u00ebnten, evenals een schikkingsakkoord met de \nAmerikaanse medische toezichthouder, de FDA.
