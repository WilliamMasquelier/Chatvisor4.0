This is something which I genuinely believe in,\" he said at the time.\nAndrew and Nicola Forrest announced their split in July 2023 after 31 years of marriage.\n\"Our friendship and commitment to our family remains strong,\" they said at the time.\n\"There is no impact on the operations, control or direction of Fortescue, Minderoo or Tattarang.\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
