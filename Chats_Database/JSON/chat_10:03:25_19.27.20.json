Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: CHANTICLEER; Pg. 40\nLength: 1316 words\nByline: Mark Di Stefano and Myriam Robin\nBody\nPrize behind Mark McGowan's fifth job\nFrontier Energy is one of those ASX-listed renewable energy companies longer on dreams than revenue. And yet, it \nstill managed to recruit one of the country's most powerful recent premiers, Mark McGowan, as its new non-\nexecutive chairman.\nFrontier's chief executive Adam Kiley announced McGowan's appointment yesterday as the company seeks to \ndevelop a parcel of land 120 kilometres south of Perth for a solar project. The recruiting coup was celebrated by the \nsolar shillers at the Smart Energy Council as a \"major milestone\".\nHow did Frontier get onto McGowan's radar? We can take a stab. Frontier's largest shareholder is mining \nPerthonality Grant Davey, who owns about 10 per cent of the renewable explorer's stock, and until yesterday was \nthe company's chairman.\nIn 2022, Davey was among the millionaires and billionaires at the WA Telethon Ball, the state's premier charity \ncommandeered by Kerry Stokes. That year, the top prize was a private lunch with Stokes and Prime Minister \nAnthony Albanese, with the winner ferried across the Nullarbor on a private jet donated by Tim Roberts. Davey bid \nfor it, but Roberts - no fan of the mining entrepreneur - gazumped him, bidding $525,000 for the pleasure.\nThat left Davey instead bidding on a private audience with (who else) McGowan. Did a charity event to raise money \nfor sick kids facilitate a meet-cute that ended up with a cushy post-political job on the board of a new energy \ncompany? Please dial down the Perthiness of it all.\nMcGowan getting poached into non-executive director land doesn't come free. Signing on, he was handed 2 million \nshare options, vesting over the next two years at levels between 20\u00a2 and 40\u00a2.\nThey are already in the money, and on the news of McGowan's recruitment, the share price jumped another 9 per \ncent to 50\u00a2. Nice business for Davey and the other members of the board, including Dixie Marshall, the former Nine \nnewsreader who left journalism last decade to run Colin Barnett's media operation.\nPage 2 of 3\nRear Window\nHas anyone sought more mileage so quickly in their post-political life than McGowan? The Frontier gig is his fifth \nsince announcing his shock exit from the premier's residence in May last year.\nThey're hardly benevolent public service roles either: he is now an adviser to BHP, Chris Ellison's Mineral \nResources, the soon-to-be private APM (which flew him to the Melbourne Cup for some reason), and on the roster \nof Joe Hockey's Bondi Partners.\nThe public knows veteran politicians will seek private sector careers to make the kind of money they couldn't get \nwhile in office. That it's often adjacent to their past responsibilities is part of the uncomfortable bargain. Whatever \nMcGowan's doing (so soon after proffering up excuses of being \"burned out\" and \"exhausted\"), is beginning to look \nlike a wind-up.\nTwiggy fills the ranks\nwith his PhD advisers\nFor billionaires, nothing counts so much as loyalty.\nThat's no doubt a large part of why Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest is pursuing former employees through the \ncourts, where his case against former Fortescue scientists Bartlomiej Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen \nopened yesterday.\nAnd it's probably why his current scientific team has been bolstered by those he can trust. Chief among them are \nthose who have seen him through academia's best instrument of torture. We speak, of course, of the PhD.\nIn 2019, Forrest was one of a few Australians to survive (and secure) a doctorate. In said document, he thanked a \nnumber of academics and technicians, a startling number of which later ended up involved in his corporate-\nphilanthropic empire.\nThere's Dr Shanta Barley, who was thanked for providing \"technical, logistic, intellectual and moral support\". She \nnow works at Fortescue in the role of chief climate scientist, having first been hired by Forrest's philanthropic \nMinderoo Foundation in 2020.\nProfessor Sarah Dunlop was, at the time of Forrest's PhD, a head of school at the University of Western Australia. \nShe's also with Minderoo now, where she heads up the Plastics and Human Health division.\nForrest also thanked Professor Daniel Pauly, who doesn't appear to work directly for Forrest. But Seas Around Us, \nthe research institute he heads, worked with Minderoo on its Global Fishing Index.\nForrest's PhD also notes the fieldwork and in-house technicians at the Centre for Marine Futures. Of the five names \nhe thanked, fully three (Alex McLennan, Claire Raphael and Nikki De Campe) have, in the five years since, worked \nor work for Minderoo.\nThere's nothing untoward about any of this. Minderoo is a charity shaped by Forrest's interests, and he likes marine \nbiology enough that he did a PhD on it.\nBillionaires always fill their courts with shiny personages that enter their orbit, and while few entourages look like \nthis, relatively few billionaires have spent much time on campus.\nThen, there's the trust thing, and Forrest has, by virtue of familiarity, more reason to put stock in this group of \nscientists than the ones he reckons ran off with Fortescue's trade secrets to start hydrogen start-up Horizon Zero \n(they are defending the case).\nBefore being convinced to undertake his PhD, Forrest donated $65 million to the University of Western Australia, \nfunding a new residential hall, scholarships and post-doctoral fellowships. The university can't begrudge him luring \naway a few star academics. Though, not the biggest star. The person most integral to his PhD was Professor Page 3 of 3\nRear Window\nJessica Meeuwig, whose parents he effusively thanked in its first page (\"this immense character can only wellspring \nfrom enlightened and encouraging parenting\", he gushed).\nDr Meeuwig has never worked for Fortescue. Though Forrest briefly invested in Buru Energy, the gas business \nfounded and, until Friday, chaired by her husband.\nGabby RBA spills\nits press flacks\nLast week, Labor hack turned lobbyist Stephen Conroy called deputy Reserve Bank governor Andrew Hauser \"a \nfailed ideologue\", \"wrong\", and \"a wanker\". Or a \"tosser\", he added, translating for the British recruit.\nThis childish tirade was sparked by a spicy speech in which Hauser lamented the \"extraordinary certainty\" of the \n\"gurus and charlatans, geniuses and buffoons\" quoted on the path of interest rates.\nConroy - whose TG Public Affairs lobbies for embattled telcos and unpopular supermarket chains - could be \nprecisely the kind of overconfident, underqualified commentator Hauser was thinking of. Still, if the intention is for \nReserve Bank figures to keep giving interesting speeches, its figureheads are going to need some serious PR \nsupport.\nNo one could realise this better than newish chief communications officer Sally Cray, a former political headkicker \nwho used to be Malcolm Turnbull's principal private secretary.\nNearly two weeks ago, she embarked on a root-and-branch restructure of the two dozen-strong RBA comms team. \nIt has effectively spilled their jobs, forcing all of them to reapply for new, reconfigured roles in the Hunger Games \narena. All are now waiting to find out if they've been successful. May the odds be ever in their favour.\nSeasoned insiders described this whole process as very unlike the central bank. Though, surely, that's the point. \nThe review of the bank, commissioned by federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers last year, spends a whole chapter on the \nRBA's communications strategy, in the aim of radically boosting the central bank's transparency and accessibility.\nThe government ordered the review in the wash-up of former governor Phil Lowe's disastrous prediction interests \nrates wouldn't rise until this year. But no political good deed goes unrewarded. Now, the newly chatty bank is using \nthe press conferences the government forced upon it to discuss everything from government spending to the nature \nof public interest rate debate.\nIt's the kind of thing oppositions love, and it's driving the government crazy. Can you believe it asked for this?\nLoad-Date: August 22, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
