Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue chairman | \"I understand and acknowledge exactly what you felt, and I thank you for bringing it to me.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue chairman | \"We deeply value Fortescue's LGBTQIA+ community. At a personal level, I stand with you.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue energy CEO | \"After speaking with some of you over the past few days, I am aware that by failing to clarify my views on same-sex relationships in my comments last week that I have let you down.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue energy CEO | \"I wish to state clearly that I am supportive of everyone in a same-sex marriage and same-sex relationships and value the LGBTQIA+ community.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue energy CEO | \"I have always supported and lived by all Fortescue values and policies and this is what leads me every day in my role as energy CEO.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue chief executive | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue chairman | \"If we are to stop the uncontrolled march of climate change, we need every mind at the table.

Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
