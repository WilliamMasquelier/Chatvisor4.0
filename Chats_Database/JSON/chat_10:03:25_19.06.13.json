(it) will be more likely \nto happen.\" The Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive will provide a $2 incentive per kilogram of renewable hydrogen \nproduced for up to 10 years per project between 2027-28, and 2039-40 for projects that reach final investment \ndecisions by 2030.\n\"We have been talking about our work with Fortescue on the Gibson Island ammonia plant,\" Mr Neves said.\n\"We have advanced that to engineering studies to the point where now we depend on the principal partner FFI \n(Fortescue Future Industries) to make a decision of initial financial closure on their side, and it is very much reliant \non the cost of energy.\" Fortescue said in February it was still working on front-end engineering and design studies \nfor the project \"as Australia struggles to shed its petrostate status and still suffers structurally high green electricity \ncosts\".\nTo prepare projects to become eligible for the tax credits, Labor has extended its so-called hydrogen headstart \nprogram.\nConsultancy WoodMackenzie said Australian projects - particularly midstream processors - faced enormous cost \ncompetition from a sector dominated by China.\nPage 2 of 2\nIncitec hopeful on stalled Gibson plant\n\"Australian producers in the critical mineral space are likely to continue to need help from taxpayers to combat \ncheap credit, low energy costs, (and) supportive policies in other jurisdictions,\" WoodMac's metals and mining \nresearch head Robin Griffin said.\n\"Government support can help projects to derisk by providing support at critical moments where the market is too \nreticent to invest.\" WoodMac added that could be delivered in the form of equity or by filling a project debt stack by \neither filling shortfalls or providing lower cost capital that attracts other investors.\nStill, the $2 incentive per kilogram would only cover part of the costs. The \"green hydrogen production credit will be \nbeneficial for project economics no doubt, but our current cost estimates are $US8.30 per kilogram for green \nhydrogen in Australia, and falling comparatively slowly to 2030,\" Mr Griffin said. \"So $2/kg won't immediately move \nthe needle when we expect prices of maximum $3 to allow green hydrogen to compete into steel for example.\"\nLoad-Date: May 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Mauro Neves | Managing Director at Incitec Pivot | \"I'm sure they have been doing the numbers.\" | N.A. |\n| Mauro Neves | Managing Director at Incitec Pivot | \"We have been talking about our work with Fortescue on the Gibson Island ammonia plant.\" | N.A. |\n| Robin Griffin | Metals and Mining Research Head at WoodMac | \"Australian producers in the critical mineral space are likely to continue to need help from taxpayers to combat cheap credit, low energy costs, (and) supportive policies in other jurisdictions.\" | N.A. |\n| Robin Griffin | Metals and Mining Research Head at WoodMac | \"The green hydrogen production credit will be beneficial for project economics no doubt, but our current cost estimates are $US8.30 per kilogram for green hydrogen in Australia.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
