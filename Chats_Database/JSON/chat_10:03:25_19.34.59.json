Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1418 words\nHighlight: In tough times for many junior ASX mining companies, luring a \"big dog\" onto the share register to add \nfinancial grunt has become a common boardroom pursuit.\nBody\nAfter a few years of \"easy money\", a big chunk of the small-cap mining sector has recently found the going tough as \nglobal financial pressures have seen widespread interest in the highly-speculative bottom end of the market come \nto a screeching halt.\nAnd that has required more business agility than ever, including strategic boardroom moves to try and attract \nestablished, big-spending partners to the share register.\nIn this second edition part of our occasional \"Big Dogs\" feature series, we look at four companies which have \nreceived both a timely cash injection and a share price boost up to recent highs after announcing a tie-in with a \nmuch bigger player in the industry.\nA good case in point is Kincora Copper, which revealed on May 28 that global gold giant AngloGold Ashanti had \nsigned a staged earn-in joint-venture (JV) agreement for its Northern Junee-Narromine Belt (NJNB) project in New \nSouth Wales' renowned Macquarie Arc region.\nAngloGold has the right to spend $25 million on exploration to earn an initial 70 per cent in the JV, with either a \nfurther $25 million spend or completion of a preliminary feasibility study (PFS) required to increase its stake to an \n80 per cent interest.\nThe two companies will target the prospective project that includes the Nyngan and Nevertire licences, where a \nwide range of near-untouched, sizeable intrusive-related copper-gold targets will be tested by the one piece of \nequipment that always lets you know exactly how things are - the ever-honest drill bit.\nMarket punters took a liking to the news, with the share price that closed at 3.6c on May 24 before the trading halt, \nbolting out of the gates on the morning of the announcement.\nThe price opened at 4.6c that day and shot to an intraday high of 5.7c. It then continued its march forward in the \nnext few weeks, hitting 7c on June 3 and then touching its year-high of 7.1c on June 14 for a near 100 per cent gain \nsince the announcement.\nVolumes that had as few as 12,000 shares swap hands the day before the trading halt, took a leap of faith with \nmuch higher-than-normal volumes and exceeded more than a million units in a single day for the first time this year. \nPage 2 of 3\n'Big Dogs' keep adding bite for junior mining partners\nA whopping 1.3 million shares changed hands on May 31 and more than 2 million units found a new home on the \nnext trading day on June 3.\nThe Macquarie Arc porphyry copper-gold geology is recognised as a globally-significant region, with two of \nAustralia's biggest copper-gold producing mines - Newmont Corporation's massive Cadia operation and the \nEvolution Mining-Sumitomo Group's Northparkes mine.\nIn the 2023 financial year, Cadia produced a whopping 597,000 ounces of gold at a stunningly low cost of $45 per \ngold ounce, due to huge credits from the copper that is also produced at the site.\nThe NSW Government recently released a report indicating the Macquarie Arc has produced more than 14 million \ntonnes of copper and hosts some 50 per cent of the State's gold endowment.\nAnother company benefitting from a tie-in with a powerful player is HyTerra after it revealed to the market on August \n29 that iron ore giant Fortescue's wholly-owned subsidiary, Fortescue Future Industries Technologies, will invest \n$21.9 million to acquire a 39.8 per cent stake in the company at a price of 3.4c per share, subject to shareholder \napproval.\nThe Fortescue investment funds will enable the expansion of the exploration drill program at HyTerra's Nemaha \nproject in the State of Kansas in the United States. A two-well drill program will be stretched to a six-well campaign \nafter the investment has been finalised.\nHyTerra is pursuing the discovery of white hydrogen at Nemaha as it aims to assist the push towards global \ndecarbonisation. White hydrogen, also known as natural hydrogen or geologic hydrogen, is a gas formed \nunderground by natural processes and extracted by conventional methods.\nFunds will also contribute to plans for significant additional leasing and geophysics to be conducted at Nemaha. \nThe two firms plan to enter into a strategic alliance agreement to advance the project and explore new opportunities \nglobally.\nNews of the tie-in resonated with the market, helping the 3.1c closing price before the Fortescue reveal to leap at \nthe open to 4.8c and touch an intraday peak of 5.5c.\nThe share price bounced around for a few days on massive volumes, with 90.6 million units swapping hands on the \nday of the announcement, followed by 64.3 million on August 30 and 29.2 million the next trading day. Overall, the \nprice has remained positive since, with it trading predominantly in a 4c to 5c range.\nGreen Technology Metals also got the market excited when it advised of a strategic investment from South Korea's \n21st-biggest listed company, the US$16.95 billion (AU$24.8 billion) market-capitalised EcoPro Innovation Co.\nThe world-leading electric vehicle (EV) battery metals producer agreed to subscribe for an $8 million, two-tranche \nplacement in Green Technology. It provides a foundation for co-operation between the two firms, as Green \nTechnology strives to become the first integrated lithium producer in the Canadian province of Ontario.\nThe investment was made at a significant premium to the market price.\nExecuted agreements cover proposals for upstream and downstream activities, including potential mine \ndevelopment and proposed lithium conversion facilities. It provides for a 12-month option to have exclusive rights to \nnegotiate and agree on staged investments in the Seymour and Root projects in the expectation of negotiating a \npossible JV agreement for either or both projects.\nThe deal also includes the option to undertake negotiations to form a comprehensive agreement for co-funding a \nprefeasibility study (PFS) for the Canadian lithium conversion facility, which may in turn lead to a JV for completing \na definitive feasibility study (DFS) and the co-development of the North American plant.Page 3 of 3\n'Big Dogs' keep adding bite for junior mining partners\nGreen Technology's shares rallied on the prospect of the South Korean giant bolstering the company's promising \nprojects after recent times for virtually all juniors in the lithium space that could best be described as bleak.\nThe stock opened at 9.2c on August 20 after previously closing at 6.4c, then jumped to hit an intraday high of 9.5c \non bigger than normal volumes. It ran again two days later, touching 11c on volumes of 2.8 million shares traded, its \nheaviest trading day since March, for a 71.88 per cent increase after the news of the tie-in.\nLike a lot of junior mining companies in the rare earths space, Peak Rare Earths has seen its market capitalisation \nand share price tumble south in the past few years. Yet, its Ngualla rare earths project seems to be kicking goal \nafter goal.\nThe company's shares hit a 12-month low of 17.5c on July 19 prior to revealing on July 24 that Chinese rare earths \ncompany Shenghe Resources Holding Co., through its Singaporean subsidiary, had agreed to subscribe for a 50 \nper cent interest in the Ngualla Group UK from Peak, which retains the remaining 50 per cent.\nNgualla Group has an 84 per cent interest in the Ngualla rare earths project and Shenghe agreed to stump-up a \ncool $96 million for its slice of the pie.\nThe market obviously liked what it heard and pushed the share price to 22c at the day's trading open after the \nnews, before reaching an intraday high of 23c. It then traded sideways for a period before touching 24c on \nSeptember 5.\nShenghe's big investment into the junior's rare earths project came after other positive developments for Peak, \nincluding its significant, new partner entering into an offtake agreement for 100 per cent of the rare earths \nconcentrate from the project for an initial term of seven years.\nThe icing on the cake came in the form of a consortium of lenders signing a non-binding indicative term sheet for \nthe funding of a US$176.6 million (AU$256.7 million) debt solution for the Ngualla operation.\nThe lump sum contribution from Shenghe will fund the development of the project, in addition to the balance of the \nproject's capital costs to be met by a Shenghe-arranged debt facility - a la the consortium's non-binding term sheet.\nPeak has no requirement to contribute towards equity funding for the project. It now holds a 42 per cent interest in \nNgualla and Shenghe has also moved to 42 per cent, with the Government of Tanzania holding the remaining 16 \nper cent.\nIt all just goes to show that adding a bit more bark can, in fact, lead to a harder bite.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?
