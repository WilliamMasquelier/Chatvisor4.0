Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Noel Pearson | Board member of Fortescue Metals Group | \"Noel Pearson is a prominent Indigenous lawyer, academic and activist who founded the Cape York Partnership in 2004.\" | N.A. |\n| Sharna Collard | Chief Executive of Kooya | \"Kooya has stood the test of time, and now, looking at our customer base, we have a series of blue-chip clients, including Fortescue, BHP, Telstra and Chevron.\" | N.A. |\n| Sharna Collard | Chief Executive of Kooya | \"The key to the success between Kooya and Fortescue has been incremental growth.\" | N.A. |\n| Sharna Collard | Chief Executive of Kooya | \"There is a strong synergy and alignment between First Nation businesses and our commitment to decarbonisation.\" | N.A. |\n| Sharna Collard | Chief Executive of Kooya | \"A crucial aspect of Kooya's offering is its focus on the Aboriginal social impact.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
