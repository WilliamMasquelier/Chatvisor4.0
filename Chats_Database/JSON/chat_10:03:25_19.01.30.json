Your output should be in the form of a markdown table without column titles or any additional information. Each table row should contain:\n1. The name of a real person who has expressed a quote in the provided article\n2. His role or relation with regards to Fortescue.\n3. Their original quote about Fortescue exactly as it appears in the article, without any modifications or translations\n\nGuidelines:\n- Include only real people: Exclude organizations, companies, or any other non-person entities\n- Direct connection: Ensure that each selected individual is explicitly connected to Fortescue or explicitly express his opinion on Fortescue.\n- Only include those whose statements are directly about Fortescue\n- Exclude individuals whose comments are not directly relevant to Fortescue or are too general\n- Pertinent stakeholders only: Only include the most relevant individuals\n- Do not include stakeholders who are not directly associated with Fortescue\n\nOutput Format Requirements:\n- Each line must contain exactly two columns separated by \"|\" symbols\n- Column 1: Stakeholder's name\n- Column 2: Stakeholder's role or link to Fortescue. If not described in the article, try to interpret its role. If it is not straightforward to interpret, mention \"Not mentioned\".\n- Column 3: Original quote in its original language\n\nExample of correct formatting:\n| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | \"Cette d\u00e9cision de Fortescue est tr\u00e8s importante.\" |\n| John Smith | Fortescue's CEO |\"We need to review Fortescue's proposal carefully.\" |\n| Hans Weber | Financial analyst | \"Die Strategie von Fortescue ist \u00fcberzeugend.\" |\n\nIf no relevant individuals with quotes are found, return \"None.\"\n\nArticle:\nPage 1 of 2\nForrest pursues green dream\nForrest pursues green dream\nThe Australian\nApril 8, 2024 Monday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 603 words\nByline: Matt Bell\nBody\nFortescue will open Australia's largest electrolyser manufacturing facility in Gladstone on Monday as part of plans \nby the Andrew Forrest-backed mining giant to become a major force in hydrogen and renewable energy.\nThe 15,000sq m advanced manufacturing facility in Queensland, constructed and fully commissioned in two years, \nwill have capacity to produce over 2GW of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyser stacks annually.\nThe launch has paved the way for the Queensland government to sign off on the next phase of the facility - a 50MW \ngreen hydrogen production facility called PEM50.\nFortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson said the facility had positioned Fortescue as a large-scale \nproducer of what would be an increasingly sought-after commodity in the global shift to green energy.\n\"We're strategically focused on building out our energy business,\" he said. \"Not only are we developing a pipeline of \ngreen energy projects, we're also now designing and manufacturing the specialised equipment and technology that \nwill underpin our green hydrogen projects and that of others.\" Mr Hutchinson said the facilitywould produce \nelectrolysers designed in-house by Fortescue, establishing the company as an original equipment manufacturer.\n\"The process of splitting hydrogen and oxygen isn't new, but the innovative ways the world is looking to use green \nhydrogen to decarbonise are, and that means demand for green hydrogen and for the electrolysers to produce it is \ngrowing rapidly,\" Mr Hutchinson said.\nThe Queensland government supported the site's development, providing an electrical substation, road network, \ncommunications and a local scheme water connection, as well as the allocation of land.\nThe federal government tipped $44m in under the collaboration stream of the Modern Manufacturing Initiative.\nFortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest will be in Gladstone to launch the site with representatives from \nQueensland government including Premier Steven Miles, and federal Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest pursues green dream\n\"Together we have laid the cornerstone for what will be a massive new manufacturing industry in Australia creating \nthe potential for thousands of new green energy jobs,\" Dr Forrest said.\nMore than 100 jobs were created during the construction process. The facility on the outskirts of Gladstone will \nultimately underpin more than 300 direct and indirect jobs.\nElectrolysers pass an electrical current through water, splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen.\nThe electrolyser facility is the first stage of a wider Green Energy Manufacturing Centre being developed by \nFortescue on the 100ha Gladstone site. The next phases will include a hydrogen system testing facility and \nFortescue's PEM50 green hydrogen project.\nPEM50 will receive development approval from Queensland's Coordinator-General on Monday, paving the way for \nconstruction to begin.\nIt will use the locally made Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysers with approval to produce green \nhydrogen for local and export markets. Once operational it will be Fortescue's first commercial-scale green \nhydrogen facility.\n\"Queensland is now leading the nation on investment in renewable energy, and we are now seeing that translate \ninto good manufacturing jobs in our regions,\" Mr Miles said.\n\"This is why one of my first announcements as Premier was to commit to 75 per cent emissions reduction by 2035 \non the path to net zero because it means accelerating investment in good clean economy jobs in our industrial \nheartlands.\" Mr Husic said: \"This hydrogen gigafactory shows what can be achieved when government and industry \nwork together.\"\nLoad-Date: April 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
