Qui\u00f1onero\nBody\nTras realizar un profit warning en agosto y finalmente registrar un deterioro en su cartera de proyectos de e\u00f3lica \nmarina en Estados Unidos, Orsted vuelve a asestar un nuevo golpe al sector renovable. Tras constatarse el \ndesgaste esperado en sus cuentas anuales, la compa\u00f1\u00eda ha anunciado la suspensi\u00f3n del dividendo, recortes en \nsus proyectos verdes y hasta 800 despidos.\nDurante 2023, la subida de tipos de inter\u00e9s y los problemas en la cadena de suministro obligaron a la compa\u00f1\u00eda \ndanesa, el mayor desarrollador de energ\u00eda e\u00f3lica marina del mundo, a rebajar sus estimaciones para el conjunto \ndel ejercicio. La dif\u00edcil situaci\u00f3n econ\u00f3mica a la que se enfrentaba la energ\u00e9tica deriv\u00f3 en una p\u00e9rdida de m\u00e1s del \n40% de su valor de mercado durante el a\u00f1o pasado.\nFinalmente la compa\u00f1\u00eda ha informado de un ebitda de 18.717 millones de coronas danesas (2.500 millones de \neuros), una cifra incluso por debajo de su horquilla entre los 20-23 millones. \"El ebitda en 2023 se vio afectado por \nuna provisi\u00f3n de 9.600 millones de coronas danesas para gastos de cancelaci\u00f3n relacionados con nuestra decisi\u00f3n \nde cesar el desarrollo de Ocean Wind 1\", explican desde la propia compa\u00f1\u00eda.\nAnte este escenario, Orsted ha anunciado la suspensi\u00f3n de su dividendo hasta por lo menos 2025. La firma \nllevaba incrementando la retribuci\u00f3n a sus accionistas a\u00f1o a a\u00f1o desde 2016, pasando de los 0,8 euros por acci\u00f3n \nque distribuy\u00f3 sobre los beneficios de entonces a los 1,81 euros que reparti\u00f3 con cargo a 2022 -lo que supone un \nincremento del 126% seis ejercicios-. Desde Bankinter explican que esta cancelaci\u00f3n de la retribuci\u00f3n a los \ninversores tiene como objetivo centrarse en inversiones sin necesidad de ampliar capital.\nSin embargo, la compa\u00f1\u00eda tambi\u00e9n ha anunciado que reducir\u00e1 su objetivo de construcci\u00f3n de proyectos verdes al \nmenos un 24%, hasta conseguir una capacidad entre 35 y 38 GW para 2030, frente al objetivo anterior de 50GW. \nAdem\u00e1s, Orsted eliminar\u00e1 hasta 800 puestos de trabajo, comenzando por 250 despidos en los siguientes meses, \nsaldr\u00e1 de algunos mercados e\u00f3licos emergentes como Noruega, Espa\u00f1a o Portugal y limitar\u00e1 su cartera de \npedidos e\u00f3licos marinos en Estados Unidos. \"Las cancelaciones de proyectos y los cambios en los planes de \nconstrucci\u00f3n ahorrar\u00e1n a la empresa 35.000 millones de coronas danesas (5.100 millones de d\u00f3lares) hasta 2026\", \nexplican desde Bloomberg.\nLa compa\u00f1\u00eda lleg\u00f3 a ser hace unos a\u00f1os una de las mayores energ\u00e9ticas de todo el Viejo Continente.

Desde \nentonces, su capitalizaci\u00f3n se reduce m\u00e1s de un 70% y actualmente apenas alcanza los 16.000 millones de euros, \nsitu\u00e1ndose en el puesto 14 del sector el\u00e9ctrico europeo por valor de mercado.\nEn 2024, no obstante, la firma danesa consigue revalorizarse alrededor de un 2%, siendo de los pocos valores del \nsector que aguantan en positivo en un a\u00f1o en el que la industria ya se deja casi un 7% de su valor (es la segunda \nm\u00e1s bajista del continente, tras los recursos b\u00e1sicos).\nPor el momento, los recortes de la compa\u00f1\u00eda anunciados este mi\u00e9rcoles no se est\u00e1n traduciendo en fuertes ventas \nde sus acciones que pierden alrededor de un 1%. Solo hoy han sido cinco casas de an\u00e1lisis las que han reiterado \nsu recomendaci\u00f3n de mantener posiciones en la firma y dos han reafirmado sus consejos de compra. Con todo, el \nconsejo mayoritario contin\u00faa siendo el de mantener y el consenso de expertos que recoge Bloomberg ve un \npotencial para sus t\u00edtulos del 16% durante los siguientes meses, hasta las 449 coronas danesas por acci\u00f3n que \nfijan de precio objetivo medio.\nLa noticia tampoco est\u00e1 afectando al resto de renovables y lo cierto es que en el parqu\u00e9 espa\u00f1ol, las verdes del \nIbex, Solaria y Acciona Energ\u00eda, aunque con ligeros ascensos que no alcanzan al 0,5% en ambos casos, se sit\u00faan \nentre las m\u00e1s alcistas del \u00edndice nacional en la jornada. Iberdrola, por contra, s\u00ed que sufre y registra una ca\u00edda del \n1,4%.

We have learned from the challenges and today, we \nare announcing a robust business plan with revised strategic growth ambitions for 2030.\u201d\nIn total, \u00d8rsted has written off \u00a33.3bn from its wind farm business.\nIt comes as Siemens Energy , which produces turbines for many UK wind farms, swung to a \u20ac1.58bn (\u00a31.35bn) \nprofit in its first quarter thanks to a one-off gain relating to the sale of an Indian subsidiary to its parent Siemens for \n\u00a31.8bn. \nThe German company is still reeling from cash struggles partly caused by quality issues affecting some of its \nonshore wind turbines.\nThis led to the business being forced to seek a financial guarantee from the German government last year. \nSiemens Energy has become a vital part of the UK wind industry, owning a turbine blade factory in Hull that \nemploys 1,200 people.\nOverall, the company employs 6,000 people in the UK.\nThe company has other profitable divisions, including producing technologies for gas generation and power grids.\nHowever, its business has struggled in the past year due to its troubled wind division, as faults in its 4X and 5X \nonshore wind turbine models led to them being taken off the market.\nThe problem, linked to faulty rotor blades and bearings, triggered repair costs of \u00a31.4bn.\nChristian Bruch, chief executive of Siemens Energy AG, said: \u201cThe solid first quarter is encouraging.

The company has also experienced problems in the US in attempting to secure tax credits.\nLast year, \u00d8rsted cancelled two big offshore windfarm projects in the US , the Ocean Wind I and II schemes, \nblaming a sharp rise in costs. It took a 28.4bn Danish kroner (\u00a33.3bn) hit as a result of the decision.\nThe company had also raised doubts over the cost of the Hornsea 3 project early last year. However, in December \nit reaffirmed its commitment to 2.9GW development, which is expected to supply power to about 3.3m homes.\nPage 2 of 2\nDanish windfarm firm \u00d8rsted to axe up to 800 jobs and pause dividend\nThe RBC analyst Alexander Wheeler said financial markets had been expecting \u00d8rsted to tap investors for funds, \n\u201cwhich would have resolved the issues quicker and removed future risk in this regard\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cHowever, we now have a period where \u00d8rsted needs to execute on various components of its plan to \nimprove its balance sheet metrics over the medium term.\u201d\n\u00d8rsted has 12 existing windfarms in the UK producing enough energy to power six million UK homes. It is also \nworking on a floating offshore wind project  in Scotland.\nSeparately on Wednesday, the turbine maker Siemens Energy, which was forced to strike a \u20ac15bn rescue deal with \nthe German government  last year, reported a \u20ac1.58bn first-quarter profit after selling a stake in its Indian unit.\nIt said orders remained lower than forecast in its turbine division, where newer models have suffered technical \nfaults, but it hoped to break even in that business in 2026.\nThe problems affecting the windfarm industry caused the Swedish energy firm Vattenfall to stop work  on the \nmultibillion-pound Norfolk Boreas windfarm last year because it was no longer profitable.\nThe Norwegian oil and gas producer Equinor posted quarterly profits of $8.68bn \u2013 down from $17bn a year earlier \nbut ahead of City forecasts \u2013 due to lower energy prices.\nMeanwhile, the British Gas owner Centrica signed an agreement to buy a million metric tonnes of liquified natural \ngas (LNG) from Spain\u2019s Repsol. The cargoes will be delivered to the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent between 2025 \nand 2027. Britain has a collection of gas terminals, providing fuel for domestic use and to be re-exported.\nGermany has raced to bolster its ability to import shipped LNG  since piped Russian gas supplies dropped after the \ninvasion of Ukraine, while the US last month moved to curb gas exports by pausing all pending export permits  amid \nclimate concerns.\nThe new chief executive of BP said on Tuesday  the oil and gas company would take a \u201cmore pragmatic\u201d approach \nto reaching its green targets. Shell faced calls to speed up its investment in renewable energy last week, as it \nannounced bumper profits and shareholder payouts  and increased oil and gas production.\nIn January, gas-fired power stations provided the largest share of Great Britain\u2019s electricity supply, at 35.7%, ahead \nof wind power at 33.5%, National Grid said  this week. \nLoad-Date: February 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Guardian\nAuthor: Alex Lawson\nDate: February 07, 2024\nTitle: Danish windfarm firm \u00d8rsted to axe up to 800 jobs and pause dividend\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Eolien en mer : cure radicale pour Orsted, le g\u00e9ant danois du secteur\n## Media outlet: Les Echos\n### Author: Sharon Wajsbrot\n### Date: February 07, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nEolien en mer : cure radicale pour Orsted, le g\u00e9ant danois du secteur\nEolien en mer : cure radicale pour Orsted, le g\u00e9ant danois du secteur\nLesEchos.fr\nmercredi 7 f\u00e9vrier 2024\nCopyright 2024 Les Echos tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s\nSection: ARTICLE; Moins de projets renouvelables \u00e0 d\u00e9ployer\nLength: 444 words\nByline: SHARON WAJSBROT\nHighlight: La cure est radicale : Orsted, le g\u00e9ant mondial de l'\u00e9olien en mer, cesse de verser son dividende, revoit \nses ambitions \u00e0 la baisse et engage une cure d'aust\u00e9rit\u00e9 sur ses march\u00e9s cl\u00e9s.\nBody\nL'inflation dans l'\u00e9olien en mer n'a fini pas de faire tanguer le g\u00e9ant Orsted.

The company had been consistently increasing shareholder payouts since 2016, but due to financial struggles, it has decided to halt these payments to focus on investments without raising additional capital. This move could negatively impact investor confidence and stock performance, as dividends are a key attraction for shareholders. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company has suffered a major financial setback, reporting an EBITDA of 18.7 billion Danish kroner (\u20ac2.5 billion) for 2023, which is below its projected range of 20-23 billion kroner. A significant portion of this shortfall is attributed to a 9.6 billion kroner provision for cancellation costs related to the termination of the Ocean Wind 1 project in the U.S. This financial underperformance highlights the challenges \u00d8rsted faces in managing its offshore wind projects profitably. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has decided to cut its renewable energy project targets by at least 24%, reducing its planned capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This reduction signals a retreat from its previous ambitious expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The company is also exiting several emerging offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, limiting its future growth opportunities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company is implementing significant job cuts, with up to 800 positions being eliminated globally. The first phase will see 250 layoffs in the coming months. These job losses reflect the financial strain \u00d8rsted is under and could have negative social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s market capitalization has plummeted by more than 70% since its peak in early 2021, when it was valued at over \u20ac76.5 billion. The company, once the third-largest utility in Europe, now ranks 14th in the sector, with a market value of just \u20ac16 billion. This dramatic decline underscores the financial instability and investor concerns surrounding the company. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has incurred massive financial losses, posting around \u00a32.2 billion in losses for 2023. The company has also written off \u00a33.3 billion from its wind farm business, reflecting the severe financial difficulties it faces. These losses are largely due to the abandonment of several offshore wind projects in the U.S., which resulted in billions in impairments. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s financial struggles have forced it to scale back offshore wind projects, which could result in the construction of 1,500 fewer wind turbines than originally planned. This reduction in capacity could slow the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure and impact global climate goals. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, is stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company\u2019s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company has faced significant challenges in the U.S. market, particularly in securing tax credits for its offshore wind projects. Last year, \u00d8rsted canceled two major offshore wind projects, Ocean Wind I and II, due to rising costs, resulting in a financial hit of 28.4 billion Danish kroner (\u00a33.3 billion). These cancellations highlight the financial and regulatory difficulties of expanding renewable energy in the U.S. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for the company to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s financial troubles have led analysts to speculate that it may need to seek additional funding from investors. However, instead of raising capital, \u00d8rsted has opted for cost-cutting measures, which could prolong financial uncertainty and increase risks for the company\u2019s future stability. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to implement a drastic austerity plan, including a comprehensive review of its project portfolio. The company is prioritizing projects with the highest potential returns while reducing risks in development and execution. This shift in strategy indicates a retreat from aggressive expansion and a more cautious approach to investment. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s decision to exit key offshore wind markets, including Spain, Portugal, and Norway, as well as to deprioritize certain activities in Japan, represents a significant contraction of its global footprint. This retreat could weaken its competitive position in the rapidly growing offshore wind sector. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024]",
