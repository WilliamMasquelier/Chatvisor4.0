Sources within the Fortescue leadership team believe \nChina could dramatically boost economic stimulus in response to any move by the US to ramp up tariffs.\n\"The amount of horsepower in the tank of China's economy and the ability to self-stimulate is phenomenal. You've \nseen just the edge of it,\" Dr Forrest said after Fortescue annual general meeting in Perth.\n\"I know that they (China) have so much ready to roll that, whichever way it goes, Australia is going to be all right.\n\"The biggest trading partner the US has ever and will ever have is China. Let's not forget that they butter each \nother's bread.\" Most commentators expect Mr Trump to take an axe to green energy incentives, with implications for \nFortescue's $US550m ($841m) hydrogen project in Arizona. Dr Forrest said Fortescue was already unhappy \nabout some of the rules around the Arizona project and needed more certainty on the future direction of the IRA.\n\"If you have a look at the IRA, it might get adjusted \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we need clarity,\" he said.\n\"The reason why we're not hammering into it is because we need clarity around some of the rules, which has been \nput off to after the election.\" The Fortescue founder described Mr Trump as a \"pragmatic economic guy\" who might \nsee the sense in pursuing investment in green energy.\n\"He's toed the election line. He's been really positive about green energy. He's been really positive about fossil \nfuels. Will he lean forward as much (into green energy), I don't know. But remember, he's an economic pragmatist, \nso he's going to follow the money.\" Dr Forrest was speaking after Fortescue comfortably avoided a second strike \nPage 2 of 2\nChina strong enough to survive US trade war: Forrest\non its remuneration report. The company had moved to quell shareholder unease over ad hoc payments made to \ndeparting executives in 2022-23.\nIndigenous leader Noel Pearson and infrastructure investment expert Rao-Monari were elected to the board and \nshareholders overwhelmingly endorsed bonus packages for metals division chief executive Dino Otranto and his \nenergy division counterpart Mark Hutchinson.\nShareholders received no update on when Fortescue might make final investment decisions on the Holmaneset \nhydrogen project in Norway and the Pecem project in Brazil.\nIn response to a request from Australia Shareholder's Association for more information on where money was being \nspent within the loss-making energy division, Dr Forrest promised to provide a more detailed breakdown.\nIn July, Fortescue retreated from its green hydrogen ambitions, shed about 700 jobs and abandoned a target to \nproduce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030.\nThe company shifted its focus to renewable electricity and to producing green iron in the -Pilbara.\nMr Otranto told the meeting a major barrier to green iron production in Australia was the high cost of renewable \nenergy. He said Fortescue would need the help of government to launch the technology-dependent industry.\n\"If this new industry is to truly succeed in Australia, we cannot do this alone. The cost of green energy is still a \nsignificant challenge here in Australia, and the barrier to getting a green metal industry off the ground which will \nrevolutionise Australia,\" he said.\n\"With the help of government, I firmly believe we can establish a new green metal industry here in the Pilbara.\" Dr \nForrest said Fortescue wanted help in the form of approvals and infrastructure, not taxpayer handouts or \nincentives.\nFortescue recently completed a 100MW solar farm near its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite operations. Dr Forrest \nsaid it was eyeing a big increase in capacity to 3GW and pointed to the $US6bn funding set aside to reach the \ncompany's decarbonisation target. Asked about the land required, Dr Forrest said it was substantial but indicated \ntraditional owners and other stakeholders were keen to become involved. \"People are looking for income, and I \nknow on our properties I really welcome it because the diversification of income is a really good idea,\" he said.\nDr Forrest again defended Iron Bridge after revelations WA work safety authorities had intervened over exposure to \ndust high in crystalline silica, which if inhaled can cause lung cancer and other diseases. Asked if he was worried \nabout the health of workers, Dr Forrest said: \"Of course, that's my first concern. We are all over it like nappy rash.\" \nSafety inspectors issued one prohibition notice, and four improvement notices in September related to dust \nmanagement at Iron Bridge.\nIron Bridge, built at a cost of $US3.9bn, was originally supposed to be producing 22 million tonnes of high-grade \niron ore concentrate a year by June 2023. The operations produced 1.6 million tonnes in the three months to the \nend of September and have been plagued by various setbacks and cost blowouts. \"You have a look at the \nmagnetite projects to ramp up around the world. It's not perfect, but it's going really well,\" Dr Forrest said.\nLoad-Date: November 6, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
