In September, Fortescue said it expected to ship \nabout 5 million tonnes of magnetite concentrate from Iron Bridge this financial year, but has so far managed only \nfive cargoes.\nThe company, which is controlled by billionaire Andrew Forrest, said shipments from the facility could reach as little \nas only 40 per cent of that 5 million tonne guidance, with a new range of 2-4 million tonnes.\nFortescue said it was still having trouble with supply from its borefields for the water-hungry operation, where a \nhigh pressure water line keeps springing leaks.\n\"Work is under way to evalu-ate options to de-risk and improve the performance of the high-pressure section \n(65km) of the raw water pipeline, where the leaks have occurred. It is anticipated that replacing this section of the \npipeline would not materially impact Iron Bridge's ramp up schedule and would require investment of approximately \n$US100m (Fortescue's share),\" it said.\nIt has said it still expects to ship 192-197 million tonnes for the full-year, despite the troubles at Iron Bridge and a \nderailment on its iron ore line in the Pilbara, which stopped trains for four days over the New Year weekend.\nAfter falling short of its promise to reach a final investment decision on as many as five green energy projects in \n2024, it was likely to make a call on its biggest planned hydrogen project in Australia, Mr Hutchinson said.\nPage 2 of 2\nDO OR DIE ON GREEN PROJECT\nFortescue announced the approval of two projects from its energy division in November, ticking off plans for small \nhydrogen production plants in Phoenix in the US and at Gladstone in Queensland.\nAt the time, Fortescue said it would fast-track a decision on larger projects in Norway, Kenya and Brazil.\nBut the company put off any decision on its Gibson -Island proposal in Brisbane, where Fortescue has been \nworking with Incitec Pivot on a green hydrogen feed for Incitec's mothballed fertiliser plant.\nMr Hutchinson told reporters and analysts that a final decision on the plant was likely at Fortescue's board meeting \nin February. Fortescue shares closed up 2 per cent to $28.97.\nLoad-Date: January 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue Energy boss | \"It is anticipated that replacing this section of the pipeline would not materially impact Iron Bridge's ramp up schedule and would require investment of approximately $US100m (Fortescue's share).\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Billionaire, Fortescue's controller | \"Fortescue said shipments from the facility could reach as little as only 40 per cent of that 5 million tonne guidance.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
