It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nFortescue 'remains fully committed' to Africa mine\nFortescue 'remains fully committed' to Africa mine\nThe Australian\nJanuary 1, 2025 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 695 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nFortescue has moved to allay fears its iron ore project in Gabon is in trouble despite appearing to have made little \nprogress since celebrating a first shipment from the African nation more than a year ago.\nHailed as a project that would \"open growth opportunities\" for Andrew Forrest-led Fortescue throughout Africa, \nsources close to the project suggest the mine has a strained relationship with Gabon's military rulers and stood \ndown contractors and slowed exploration activity in the lead-up to Christmas.\nFortescue said in response that there would be fluctuations in job numbers as it looked to advance the project in \nGabon, where General Brice Oligui Nguema seized power in August 2023.\nGeneral Nguema led a coup against then president Ali Bongo Ondimba, whose family had ruled for 55 years and \nshown a willingness to work with Fortescue.\n\"Fortescue remains fully committed to the Belinga iron ore project and the long-term benefits a large-scale \ndevelopment will bring to Gabon,\" Fortescue said.\n\"Our discussions with the Gabon government remain positive and we continue to work together to advance a \npotential large-scale development.\n\"The project is still in an early stage of development, with an immediate focus on exploration and studies. As a \nresult, in the short term there will be an ebb and flow in job numbers as we move through various stages, finish our \ninitial main camp construction, and allow time for studies to be completed.\n\"We remain focused on prioritising the employment of a local workforce and will explore ways to upskill and \nredeploy staff to other areas of the business where possible.\n\"In line with Fortescue's commitment to create a positive impact in the areas in which we operate, we will continue \nto engage with, and support, local communities.\" Fortescue did not respond to questions about whether exploration \nwork had come to halt, or how many employees it had on the ground in Gabon.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue 'remains fully committed' to Africa mine\nMore than 600 Gabonese, including contractors, have been employed on the project at various times, including 200 \nfrom local villages. Fortescue had also purchased more than $US30m ($48m) in goods and services from \nbusinesses in Gabon.\nFortescue owns a 72 per cent stake in Ivindo Iron, the entity that operates the Belinga project. The remainder of \nIvindo is held by Abu Dhabi's Africa Transformation and Industrialisation Fund and the Gabon government.\nPerth-headquartered Fortescue earmarked $US200m for early-stage mining development at Belinga in 2023-24.\nIt has not provided guidance on capital expenditure at Belinga in 2024-25 after shifting focus to exploration and \nstudy work.\nFortescue has flagged expenditure of $US300m-$US400m across the group on various exploration projects and \nstudies in 2024-25, with any spending on Belinga likely to come from this pool.\nJulie Shuttleworth, one of Dr Forrest's most trusted lieutenants at Fortescue for more than a decade, was running \nthe project before she left the company in June 2024.\nIn an update provided at the end of September, Fortescue said exploration work continued and to that point more \nthan 70,000 metres of reverse circulation drilling and 10,000 metres of diamond core drilling had been completed.\nSources said Fortescue was finding the going tougher in Gabon under military rule after making rapid progress \nwith Belinga under the former president.\nThe December 2023 shipment came just 10 months after Fortescue signed a mining convention with the then \nGabonese government.\nThe immaterial volume of iron ore on board was sourced from a small operation at Belinga, a potential high-grade \ndeposit in Gabon's northeast that has been subject to extensive studies and was once on BHP's radar.\nFortescue metals division chief executive Dino Otranto hailed the shipment as a remarkable achievement at the \ntime.\n\"This project has the potential to revolutionise our portfolio and ultimately create a product that will be the envy of \nour peers,\" he said. \"It will also open growth opportunities for Fortescue throughout Africa.\" Gabon handed an \noperating permit covering Belinga to the China Machinery Engineering Corporation as far back as 2006, but \nsuspended the permit after a falling-out between the parties.\nLoad-Date: December 31, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
