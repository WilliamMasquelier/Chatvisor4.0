Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Bart Kolodziejczyk | Former Fortescue chief scientist | \"The court was told Mr Kolodziejczyk also planned to introduce evidence he was allowed by Fortescue to take some documents with him when he resigned.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Former Fortescue lieutenant, now Element Zero director | \"He revealed that key customers in Asia had directly questioned the merits of using hydrogen to make steel, arguing that Element Zero's technology would be far more energy efficient than rival green steel techniques that involved the use of hydrogen.\" | N.A. |\n| John Hennessy SC | Lawyer for Element Zero | \"We say the order was improperly obtained, off on the back of what was egregious material non disclosure, and so we don't want it to continue any longer than it must out there in the marketplace.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
