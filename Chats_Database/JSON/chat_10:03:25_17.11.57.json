Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Ramelius Resources based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Ramelius Resources is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Ramelius Resources.\n\nIf Ramelius Resources is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 3\nASX newcomer Merino & Co runs hard on Melbourne Cup week\nASX newcomer Merino & Co runs hard on Melbourne Cup week\nBrisbane Times\nNovember 8, 2024 Friday 9:33 AM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1050 words\nHighlight: This week's Bulls N' Bears Runner of the Week is ... Merino & Co. The quality clothing and accessories \nbusiness shot up 650% following its ASX debut last week.\nBody\nWhat a week of racing it's been... it kicked off indubitably with the race that stops the nation - the Melbourne Cup. \nAfter a day of frivolity and fancy dress another race that stopped a nation was on for the White House - and just like \nthat, he was back! America's 45th President, Donald Trump now adds 47 to his mantle piece of political trophies \ncausing western markets and energy stocks in particular to surge. And now, with those two trivial races in the rear \nvision mirror, the real race for the Bulls N Bears ASX Runner of the Week has been decided with line honours taken \nby Merino and Co.\nMerino and Co. up 650% from listing day.\nThe ASX's newest player Merino & Co stole the spotlight from the racing and political types this week when punters \npiled into its float, pushing its stock up to a high of $1.50 from last Friday's 46.5c close, representing a gain of some \n222 per cent.\nPerhaps more remarkably, the company only floated on the ASX last Wednesday at 20c, giving it a crazy gain for \nthe two week period of 650 per cent from listing price to intra-week high.\nMerino & Co, just like Bulls N Bears, is based in Perth's Osborne Park, however, unlike Bulls N Bears, it has lots of \nChinese looking names scattered across its share register.\nIts branded lifestyle clothing and accessories business hit the boards last week after raising $6.35 million at 20c per \nshare in an initial public offering (IPO).\nThe 650 per cent surge in share price with no corresponding news in the market earnt management a glowing \n\"please explain\" from the worrisome overlords at the ASX.\nCompany management batted the \"please explain\" away with a positively vibed explanation about all the good \npublicity the float had received. That didn't stop punters from stripping almost two thirds of its share price away \nhowever when it hit 56c a share on Thursday.\nThe roller-coaster was working overtime the very next morning when Merino & Co's stock more than doubled to hit \n$1.27 the next day before closing out the week at $1.05. How exhausting...\nPage 2 of 3\nASX newcomer Merino & Co runs hard on Melbourne Cup week\nMerino and Co sell wool apparel and accessories, largely featuring Merino wool, to both Australian and international \nmarkets. 66 per cent of its $7.5m revenue in FY23 came out of China.\nSomeone out there has big plans for this company that was worth $55m at Friday's closing price of $1.05, \nrepresenting a PE ratio of 162 times its net profit before tax of $338,853 in FY23 - a ratio that Apple and Google \ncould only aspire to!\nAuKing Mining up 133 per cent\nTaking second spot on the Bulls N Bears Runners of the Week podium this week is AuKing Mining which shot up \nmore than 133 per cent to a high of 0.7c per share this week on news the company got its hands on some highly \nsort after Saudi Arabian gold licenses.\nManagement says its Shaib Marqan gold project was secured in conjunction with Saudi Arabian partner Barg \nAlsaman Mining Company (BSMC), a member of the Segia Gulf Group, a large Saudi Arabian group that has more \nthan 40 years of operating experience in the Kingdom, predominantly in the construction sector.\nThe company says Shaib Marqan is significantly underexplored and lies just 100km to the south-east of the Al Amar \ngold mine which produced nearly 30,000 ounces of gold in 2022 for Saudi outfit Ma'aden Gold.\nAuKing subsequently released 50 vein and wall-rock samples from the project that came in at an impressive \naverage of 5.8 grams per tonne gold with a peak sample boasting some 40g/t gold.\nThe company will now work with both the Saudi Ministry of Mineral Resources and its local Saudi partner BSMC, to \nfinalise a formal grant over the Shaib Marqan exploration license set to be completed in the coming few weeks.\nHere at Bulls N Bears we love hearing about junior ASX-listed companies jumping into bed with Saudi's that have \ndeep pockets - and we really love 133 per cent price hikes.\nOrdell Minerals up 102 per cent\nGold hopeful Ordell Minerals took out Runners of the Week bronze this week, flying up more than 100 per cent after \nwide-spaced reverse circulation (RC) drill results from its Barimaia gold project near Mt Magnet unveiled shallow, \nhigh-grade gold intersections across a prospective strike length of more than 1km.\nThe company touched 44.5c per share briefly from a low of 22c at last week's close on near-surface intercepts that \nran some 9.62g/t gold over 4m and another going 2.52g/t gold for an encouraging 29m in the primary hard-rock \nmineralisation.\nThe Barimaia project is a joint venture (JV) with WA's latest gold major Genesis Minerals and only recently hit the \nASX-boards following Ordell's $6 million IPO back in July of this year.\nThe company says drilling is ongoing at the project testing some 2.5km of prospective strike at Barimaia, which is \nlocated a convenient stone's throw away from Ramelius Resources' Mt Magnet gold operations in the Murchison \nregion of WA.\nQuickstep Holdings up 86 per cent\nOur final runner for the week is Sydney-based tier-1 defence supplier Quickstep Holdings who piled on 86 per cent \nfor the week.\nQuickstep - Australia's largest independent aerospace composite business - experienced an unexpected off-market \ntakeover bid from none other than its largest customer ASDAM Operations for 40c in cash per share.\nASDAM was subsequently snubbed by Quickstep who suggested the $28 million takeover offer was pennies on the \ndollar for the real value of the company. Punters, sniffing a takeover tussle then piled into Quickstep, propelling its \nstock from 22c at last week's close to a high of 41c on Friday.Page 3 of 3\nASX newcomer Merino & Co runs hard on Melbourne Cup week\nQuickstep also updated the market earlier on the successful finalisation of key pricing and product volume \nnegotiations with its Tier-1 defence customers.\nThe company said negotiations with defence suppliers, the likes of Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, were \nsuccessfully secured for the next few years and should result in appreciably increased profitability for all \nparticipating parties.\nThis has the makings of an epic takeover battle and here at Runners of the Week we like a good ringside seat. \nQuickstep has now brought in heavyweight counsel for a bit of biffo with ASDAM, albeit it has not completely closed \nthe door to another offer - presumably one that is a little loftier than ASDAM's first pass.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?
