It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nA real-life romance takes to the stage\nA real-life romance takes to the stage\nCanberra Times (Australia)\nSeptember 28, 2024 Saturday\nPrint Edition\nCopyright 2024 Australian Community Media All Rights Reserved\nSection: LOCAL GOVT; Pg. 57\nLength: 590 words\nBody\nCanberra couple Shell Abdoo and Berin Denham have written a musical about their relationship - and the season \nwill end with them getting married in the theatre in which they are performing the show.\nOnly Everything opens at The Courtyard Studio at the Canberra Theatre Centre on October 17, with a 10-show \nseason.\nAnd like any good rom-com, it will end with a wedding - but this time in real life, the nuptials taking place at the end \nof the season, in The Courtyard Studio, the couple surrounded by an audience of family and friends.\n\"We realised we had a lot of family who would be coming from out of town. They're going to want to see the show \nand they're going to want to come to our wedding, so let's not make them do two trips and do it in the same \nweekend,\" Berin said.\nIt will be a fitting finale to a musical inspired by their own fortysomething romance. They are calling it the \n\"Generation X musical\" - the one about a second chance at love after divorce, when there are kids and ex-partners \nand emotional baggage in tow, when everything is not always rainbows and unicorns and when dating comes down \nto a swipe right or left.\nShell and Berin say it's more of a dramedy, their story about falling in love later in life, blending existing families and \nnavigating the emotional landscape of their life now and what went before. \"We felt that was such a relatable story \nthat isn't being told,\" Shell said. \"Let's do a love story when you've got a few more grey hairs but you've also got \nsome beautiful experiences to draw on. It's deeper. It's got some grit to it.\"\nShell, 46, is a self-taught musician and well-known singer in live venues around Canberra. A producer and \nperformer, Berin, 48, grew up in the theatre in Canberra, the son of well-known thespian Barbara Denham.\nThe couple actually met 10 years ago when they both had parts in Rock of Ages at the Erindale Theatre. They \ndidn't connect romantically until five years later.\nPage 2 of 2\nA real-life romance takes to the stage\nAnd only after some sliding-doors moments, when things could have easily gone another way. The universe instead \nconspired to get them together. In a very rom-com kind of way. So, cue a musical that tells their story. \"Write what \nyou know!\" Shell said, with a laugh.\nThe couple both star in the musical as characters - Tori and Aaron - rather than themselves.\nDirected by Rachel Thornton, with musical direction by Nicholas Griffin, Only Everything also stars Louiza Blomfield \nas Tori's sister Emma and David Pearson as Aaron's friend Simon.\nThey have made lots of Canberra references but believe the story is universal, and they've produced the show with \na view to touring it.\nShell, who has five children, and Berin, who has two children, have created a blended family, with the three \nyoungest children living with them at home in Waramanga.\nBerin, who has a day job as a public servant, said they workshopped the musical with friends and colleagues, \nediting and rewriting to make it even more true to life. And the feedback had been positive.\n\"One of our friends was in tears during one of the read-throughs,\" Berin said.\n\"He said, 'This is the musical for Gen-X! We need this musical'.\nThe title - Only Everything - came from a real-life conversation between the couple when Shell was starting to \ndoubt herself.\n\"I said to Berin, 'Am I getting any of this right? What am I getting right in this relationship'?\" Shell said.\n\"And he would say, 'Only everything' to reassure me and then it became a thing that we would often say to each \nother.\"\nTickets to Only Everything are available at canberratheatrecentre.com.au.\nLoad-Date: September 27, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
