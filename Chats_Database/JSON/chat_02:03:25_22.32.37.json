This project was integrated with the Hornsea 3 offshore wind farm, demonstrating \u00d8rsted\u2019s commitment to combining wind energy with storage solutions [The Daily Telegraph, June 13, 2024].\n\n### 2.2.3 Recent Developments\n\nIn the latter half of 2024 and early 2025, \u00d8rsted continued to expand its offshore wind portfolio while facing new challenges. The company secured major contracts in the UK\u2019s renewable energy auction for its Hornsea 3 and Hornsea 4 offshore wind projects, benefiting from revised government policies that increased guaranteed electricity resale prices [The Telegraph, September 3, 2024]. However, this raised concerns about rising energy costs for consumers, with critics arguing that foreign energy firms like \u00d8rsted were profiting at the expense of UK households [The Telegraph, September 4, 2024].\n\nIn Poland, \u00d8rsted, in partnership with PGE, was awarded the Baltica 2 offshore wind farm project, valued at \u20ac7.15 billion, marking a significant step in Poland\u2019s goal of reaching 18 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040 [La Libre, January 30, 2025]. The project, featuring 170 wind turbines with a total capacity of 1.5 GW, was financed through \u00d8rsted\u2019s own funds, reflecting the company\u2019s strong financial position [Le Figaro, January 30, 2025].\n\nMeanwhile, \u00d8rsted faced local opposition in Germany, where its planned wind farm near Bad Orb encountered resistance from local stakeholders who argued that it threatened the region\u2019s wellness tourism industry [Energie & Management, January 20, 2025]. The opposition launched a media campaign against the project, portraying \u00d8rsted as a threat to the local environment [Energie & Management, January 20, 2025].\n\n## 2.3. Stakeholder Perspectives\n\n### 2.3.1 \u00d8rsted Leadership\n\n\u00d8rsted\u2019s CEO, Mads Nipper, has emphasized the importance of energy storage solutions in maximizing the availability of renewable energy, particularly in projects like the Eleven Mile Solar Center in Arizona [The Independent, March 15, 2024]. Duncan Clark, \u00d8rsted\u2019s UK boss, highlighted the role of battery storage in optimizing renewable energy use, particularly in the Hornsea 3 project [The Daily Telegraph, June 13, 2024]. David Hardy, CEO for \u00d8rsted Americas, underscored the significance of the Sunrise Wind project in helping New York meet its clean energy targets while strengthening the local workforce [The Independent, July 17, 2024].\n\n### 2.3.2 Government and Regulatory Bodies\n\nThe UK government, under Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, has supported offshore wind expansion, awarding \u00d8rsted major contracts in the latest renewable energy auction [The Telegraph, September 3, 2024].
