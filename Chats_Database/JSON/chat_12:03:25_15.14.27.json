Agents would not only schedule staff but make assessments of who might be the best at \na particular role, choosing who might work the register and who might be better on the floor selling clothes.\nAt big four bank ANZ, chief technology officer Tim Hogarth, who studied business information systems and \ninformation technology at the University of South Australia, holds the reins on AI.\nPrior to ANZ he worked as vice-president of innovation at TD bank in Canada and as head of application platform at \nCBA.\nWhile most financial institutions have major technology teams, Mr Hogarth said it was important to remember \"we're \na bank first\". He said: \"When people write code it's 'if this, then that' - it's deterministic. But there's a whole bunch of \nproblems we can't solve with 'if this, then that'.\n\"The way I explain it is I have both Taylor Swift and AC/DC in my playlist. You can't write rules to say 'this chief \ntechnical officer used to work in Canada, then play these songs'. But Spotify uses patterns and they discover music \nI like and overlap that with what other people like and it finds patterns between them.\" When it came to banking, he \nsaid: \"AI can essentially find trends and implement solutions faster than we can interpret them and write the code \nourselves.\" And in 2024, the technology is now brought several times a day. \"It has changed from being one of the \ntechnologies that was occasionally mentioned to every single conversation,\" he said.\nMr Hogarth said he believed Australia had not yet seen the full innovation AI would bring. \"We're at the bottom of \nthe S curve,\" he said.\nHe wants Australia to be at the forefront of the revolution rather than \"play catch-up\", and that could happen if \nAustralia didn't capitalise on the opportunity.\nUS multinational Cisco might have one of Australia's most senior AI executives, with 28-year veteran Carl Solder \nleading the charge.\nMr Solder is chief technology officer of ANZ, a role he took up after briefly leaving Cisco after spending several \nyears as vice-president of engineering, based in Silicon Valley in California.\n\"AI is software that intends to mimic human intelligence,\" Mr Solder said. \"A traditional computer program follows a \nset of fixed instructions to perform an outcome that's always the same. With AI, the outcome you'll get is going to be \na little bit more fluid.\" Last year Cisco conducted a global AI readiness that found just 5 per cent of Australian \ncustomers were ready to adopt AI. That same report found 59 per cent of respondents believed they had just 12 \nmonths to adopt AI, which leaves him to the conclusion that companies would race to adopt the technology either \nthrough off-the-shelf products from the company or going out creating their own AI product.\nLoad-Date: February 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n  Tone: Neutral\n  Sentiment Score: 0\n- Content: Page 1 of 1\nAI is 'falling short of the mark'\nAI is 'falling short of the mark'\nThe Daily Telegraph (Australia)\nNovember 30, 2024 Saturday\nTelegraph Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: WBUSINESS; Pg. 63\nLength: 274 words\nByline: Joseph Lam\nBody\nAustralian companies have been given an artificial intelligence reality check, with 58 per cent that have invested in \nartificial programs and applications saying the technology has fallen short of expectations.\nMeanwhile, about 70 per cent of investors have pulled out of active deals due to AI consideration.

There's also evidence you can use.\nA survey by tech firm CISCO in 2022 reported on Australian experiences in hybrid workplaces. Respondents \nbelonged to industries including public service, healthcare, agriculture, IT, NGOs, finance, and food and beverage \nworkers.\nAbout 84 per cent of 1042 Australians who participated in the study said they saved $US180 (now $AU268) on \naverage per week.\nSome also reported eating healthier (65 per cent), becoming physically fitter (69.5 per cent), feeling happier (84.7 \nper cent) and improving their work-life balance (82.4 per cent) . More than half of them also said their relationships \nwith family and friends had improved.\nEmpower yourself with solutions and evidence Once you've decided to speak to your manager, review your job \ndescription and see which parts allowed for remote working.\nDr Jennifer Loh, professor in management at the University of Canberra, said it's good to be prepared with solutions \nfor your boss, of how you plan to complete your duties. This will give them confidence you are capable of \nperforming well even from home.\n\"It opens up that discussion in terms of, 'this task does not need me to be on site, can I maybe work from home half \na day? I'll take care of everything, I can use the computer',\" she said.\nPage 2 of 2\nWant to work from home?

Workers \nwho are not having success in their current workplace might have the opportunity to go and negotiate more flexible \nworking arrangements elsewhere.\"\n\"At the end of the day, data tends not to lie and the data is very clear - Australian workers want and need flexibility,\" \nDr Allen said. \"We will be living with Covid for the future time and we need to be better at responding and dealing \nwith the challenges that that poses.\"\nWhat can employers do? Dr Loh said employers could help facilitate this conversation by being transparent with \ntheir staff. Providing a forum, not during a one-on-one chat, for open communication where employees find out \nabout their rights, enterprise agreements and relevant processes.\n\"[Managers] need to disseminate information, widely and officially ... where everybody appreciates their approach \ntowards managing and leading,\" she said.\nOn the other hand, the CISCO study also reported about 58 per cent of Australian respondents believed they faced \nchallenges in fully engaging with their company and coworkers during hybrid working.\nTo address this issue, employers and employees needed to work together creatively and flexibly to maintain a good \nstandard of productivity and job satisfaction, Dr Loh said.\nREAD MORE:\nCanberra employers' attitudes towards work-from-home practices in 2024 The fear of missing out is real for these \nbosses Fears 'strange' APS flexible work rights could reshape Canberra Steps to ask for what you need, according \nto the experts Ask yourself if it's safe for you to have this conversation (if it's a very rigid workplace, consider \nspeaking to a union representative)\nGather evidence you can use to mount your case (loyalty, productivity, job description)\nProvide solutions and arrangements that serve you and your employer (WFH on designated days/ half days/ one \nweek on, one week off)\nGive examples of how other businesses in your industry are being flexible\nLoad-Date: January 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n  Tone: Neutral\n  Sentiment Score: 2\n",
