New York Gov. Kathy Hochul  will be on Long \nIsland Thursday to announce that the turbines are delivering clean power to the local electric grid. Interior Secretary \nDeb Haaland  is expected to attend. \nAchieving commercial scale is a turning point for the industry, but what's next? Experts say the nation needs a \nmajor buildout of this type of clean electricity to address climate change. \nOffshore wind is central to both national and state plans to transition to a carbon-free electricity system. The Biden \nadministration has approved six commercial-scale offshore wind energy projects, and auctioned lease areas for \noffshore wind for the first time off the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico coasts. New York picked two more projects last \nmonth to power more than 1 million homes. \nThis is just the beginning, Hochul said. She said the completion of South Fork shows that New York will \naggressively pursue climate change solutions to save future generations from a world that otherwise could be \ndangerous. South Fork can generate 132 megawatts of offshore wind energy to power more than 70,000 homes. \n\u201cIt\u2019s great to be first, we want to make sure we\u2019re not the last. That\u2019s why we\u2019re showing other states how it can be \ndone, why we're moving forward, on to other projects,\u201d Hochul told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview \nbefore the announcement. \n\u201cThis is the date and the time that people will look back in the history of our nation and say, \u2018This is when it \nchanged,\u2019\u201d Hochul added.\nPage 2 of 2\nThe United States has its first large offshore wind farm, with more to come\n\u00d8rsted CEO Mads Nipper called the opening a major milestone that proves large offshore wind farms can be built, \nboth in the United States  and in other countries with little or no offshore wind energy currently. \nWith South Fork finished, \u00d8rsted and Eversource are turning their attention to the work they will do offshore \nbeginning this spring for a wind farm more than five times its size. Revolution Wind will be Rhode Island and \nConnecticut\u2019s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes next year. \nThe site where the cable will connect in Rhode Island is already under construction.\nIn New York, the state said last month it would negotiate a contract with \u00d8rsted and Eversource for an even larger \nwind farm, Sunrise Wind, to power 600,000 homes. The Norwegian company Equinor was picked for its Empire \nWind 1 project to power more than 500,000 New York homes. Both aim to start providing power in 2026. \nAfter years of planning and development, 2024 is a year of action\u2014 building projects that will deliver sizeable \namounts of clean power to the grid, said David Hardy, group executive vice president and CEO Americas at \n\u00d8rsted.\n\u00d8rsted, formerly DONG Energy, for Danish Oil and Natural Gas, started aggressively building wind farms off the \ncoast of Denmark, the U.K. and Germany in 2008. The company sold off the North Sea oil and gas assets on which \nit had built its identity to focus on clean energy, becoming \u00d8rsted. It\u2019s now one of the biggest wind power \ndevelopers.\nThe first U.S. offshore wind farm was supposed to be a project off the coast of Massachusetts known as Cape \nWind. A Massachusetts developer proposed the project in 2001. It failed after years of local opposition and \nlitigation. \nTurbines began spinning off Rhode Island\u2019s Block Island as a pilot project in 2016. But with just five of them, it\u2019s not \na commercial-scale wind farm.\nLast year brought challenges for the nascent U.S. offshore wind industry, as \u00d8rsted and other developers canceled \nprojects in the Northeast that they said were no longer financially feasible. High inflation, supply chain disruptions \nand the rising cost of capital and building materials were making projects more expensive as developers were trying \nto get the first large U.S. offshore wind farms opened. \nIndustry leaders expect 2024 to be a better year, as interest rates come down and states ask for more offshore \nwind to meet their climate goals. \nThe nation's second large offshore wind farm, Vineyard Wind, is expected to open later this year off the coast of \nMassachusetts, too. The first five turbines are providing power for about 30,000 homes and businesses in \nMassachusetts. When all 62 turbines are spinning, they'll generate enough electricity for 400,000 homes and \nbusinesses. Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners are the joint owners of that project.\nThe Biden administration wants enough offshore wind energy to power 10 million homes by 2030.
