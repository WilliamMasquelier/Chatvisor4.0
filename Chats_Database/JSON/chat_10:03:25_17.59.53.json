It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 3\nAtlassian boss sues employee\nAtlassian boss sues employee\nThe Australian\nFebruary 21, 2025 Friday\nAustralian2 Edition\nCopyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 14\nLength: 886 words\nByline: YONI BASHAN & NICK EVANS, MARGIN CALL\nBody\nWhat is it with billionaires accusing their staff of stealing precious corporate secrets?\nFirst it was Andrew Forrest suing three of his top men to try prove they'd lifted the IP to make \"green iron\" \ntechnology, which is just iron without the carbon, or like coffee without the caffeine - it's not as fun. The case \nagainst the trio is still grinding its way through the Federal Court.\nNow we hear of an even bigger billionaire, Atlassian's Mike Cannon-Brookes, who's suing the absolute pants off of \na once-trusted family office executive, Kevin Chiu, claiming corporate skulduggery has been afoot.\nChiu worked for years alongside Cannon-Brookes and his ex-wife Annie but left the business suddenly, and \nrecently, over accusations that he downloaded sensitive documents to a personal storage account.\nWhat documents? We don't know, and Cannon-Brookes' people wouldn't tell us. What we've confirmed is that this \nwas all allegedly uncovered a few weeks ago and everyone then rushed off to the NSW Supreme Court to climb all \nover Chiu and stop the alleged spread of these files. The matter was briefly mentioned on Thursday.\nBut while Chiu may be technically out the door his name is still listed on a raft of corporate documents for Cannon-\nBrookes entities. By that we mean the fashion business - Playdate Studios - run by Annie, and the insect one - \nKangaloon Crickets - which has a defunct website and was supposed to sell bugs dipped in secret herbs and spices \nto very credulous people. Stick to software, dude.\nChiu's name is also still on the papers for the Sun Cable project, for Dunk Island Philanthropy - named after the \nQueensland isle where Annie bought a $24m resort in 2022 - and for Boundless Earth, a not-for-profit that donated \nto the political campaign of former Liberal National Party minister Jack Dempsey. Are charities allowed to do that?\nSo the court's ordered Chiu to hand over his phones and iPads and computers and every username and password \nhe's ever had created to FTI Consulting for forensic analysis. As far as humiliations go, you'd rather be forced to eat \na toenail.\nPage 2 of 3\nAtlassian boss sues employee\nBut bear in mind this is all playing out amid Mike and Annie's ongoing break-up - they split in 2023 - and the carve-\nup of their $23bn in assets, all quietly being nutted out by lawyers on both sides. And it's not exactly all copacetic.\nNot only have the two billionaires split their family office but factions are forming among the staff - Team Mike and \nTeam Annie. Might Chiu be caught in the middle of this? He's not the only senior family office official to leave the \nbillionaire's realm of late. Catherine Manuel is the other major casualty of the marriage split, coming off the board of \nCannon-Brookes Services Pty Ltd in November, and seemingly pushed out by Mike as he cleans house and tests \neveryone's fealty.\nHydrogen hype It's the end of an inevitable decline for would-be hydrogen truck maker Nikola, which filed for \nbankruptcy protection in the US on Wednesday night.\nHardly a surprise, and arguably a bit overdue given founder Trevor Milton got banged-up after being convicted of \nsecurities and wire fraud by a New York City jury four months ago.\nThat was because Nikola's early promotional videos featured - among other lies - a truck the company claimed was \nrunning on hydrogen, but was actually just rolling down a hill.\nNikola actually went on to produce hydrogen-powered trucks - 83 in the September quarter last year. Not nothing, \nbut still not enough to stem losses of around $US200m in three months.\nStill, the hydrogen subsidies on offer from the administration of then US president Joe Biden are likely to disappear \nnow Donald Trump has taken charge, snuffing out Nikola's last hope.\nBut for Australian investors it's also a timely reminder of the rapid retreat of the hydrogen hype championed by \nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue.\nThere's a direct link here. Fortescue bought its hydrogen project in Phoenix, Arizona from Nikola in 2023, and \nFortescue's US energy boss Andrew Vesey was on the Nikola board when the company collapsed this week.\nNo suggestion of any wrongdoing by Vesey. He only joined the Niloka board last year - long after concerns about \nthe company's business practices had been well ventilated.\nIt also extends the run of senior US Fortescue executives that have been in proximity to green energy collapses. \nFortescue Capital boss Robert Tichio was also the chairman of collapsed battery charging company Tritium, and \nkey figure behind the float of collapsed hydrogen vehicle company Hyzon.\nAgain, no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Tichio. Surely it's time that Fortescue conceded its hydrogen foray is \nover?\nDespite edging ever-closer, Fortescue still can't admit it.\nFortescue's half-year results say that two of the four remaining hydrogen projects in its portfolio are being \n\"reconsidered\" - the one it bought from Nikola in the US, and a small-time production centre in Queensland, both \nunder threat from changes in government.\nBut Tichio's Fortescue Capital team is still being paid to raise capital for projects that no longer exist, and \nFortescue Energy boss Mark Hutchinson is still dodging questions about how many of his team remain after last \nyear's cull of 700 Fortescue staff.\nPlus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose, we suppose.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Fortescue should call time on its hydrogen hype\nLoad-Date: February 20, 2025Page 3 of 3\nAtlassian boss sues employee\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
