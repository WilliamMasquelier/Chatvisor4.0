Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 488 words\nHighlight: Iron ore shipments of 43.3 million tonnes were six per cent lower than previous corresponding quarter \nbecause of the ore derailment in late December and weather disruptions.\nBody\nGreen energy pioneer Andrew Forrest's Fortescue says it is on track to produce its target of 50 million tons of \nhydrogen by 2030 after converting and gaining world-first certification for a ship running on a mix of green ammonia \nand diesel.\nThe company successfully converted a Singapore-flagged vessel, Fortescue Green Pioneer, to run on dual-fuel \ngreen ammonia, gaining world-first certification for the technology, said Mark Hutchinson, who heads up the \nFortescue Energy division.\n\"This is a huge milestone and brings us one step closer to green shipping,\" he said.\nThe iron ore miner and green energy producer reiterated it is expected to meet its key 2030 decarbonisation \ntargets. \"We totally believe we're going to get there,\" Hutchison said, and the company's large green hydrogen \nprojects in Norway and Brazil will \"prime the pump\" for production.\n\"They're progressing well,\" he said. \"Into the 2030s, we believe there's going to be a massive demand for the \nproduct.\"\nGreen hydrogen, made by using a renewable energy-powered electrolyser to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, \nis seen as a viable alternative to carbon-emitting fossil fuels in heavy transport, heating, and power generation. \nHowever, it is still prohibitively expensive to produce.\nFortescue is also pushing ahead with decarbonising its fleet of diesel-guzzling iron ore mining vehicles in the \nPilbara. It now has three electric excavators operating and says converting its entire excavator fleet to electric will \ncut diesel use by 95 million litres every year.\nThe miner's iron ore shipments slowed over three months to March, down six per cent to 43.3 million tonnes due to \na derailment late in December and weather disruptions in January and February, Fortescue Metals chief Dino \nOtranto said in a quarterly update on Wednesday.\nHowever, he said shipments hit a record level in March as the company focused on recovering its output. Guidance \nfor total financial-year shipments remains unchanged, but will be at the lower end of the expected 192 to 197 million \ntonne range.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue takes 'milestone step towards green shipping' amid iron ore hit\nThe company's crucial high-quality Iron Bridge project is facing significant problems with a faulty water pipeline and \nplant teething issues slowing its output. Work is under way to replace a high-pressure section of the pipeline and \nimprove its performance. The mine's process plan was reconfigured to deal with the water supply issues. \"We've \ngot a process under way, I won't get into too many details of it,\" Otranto said.\nHe said China's steel demand was becoming increasingly diversified, with strong growth across infrastructure, \nmanufacturing and renewable energy sectors. \"China's rollout of wind and solar capacity blew my mind,\" Otranto \nsaid after a recent visit to the Asian powerhouse. \"Renewable energy infrastructure needs a lot of steel.\"\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.
