Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Orsted based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Orsted is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Orsted.\n\nIf Orsted is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 3\nLawsuits buffet US offshore wind projects, seeking to end or delay them\nLawsuits buffet US offshore wind projects, seeking to end or delay them\nThe Independent (United Kingdom)\nSeptember 18, 2024 Wednesday 7:49 PM EST\nCopyright 2024 Independent Print Ltd  All Rights Reserved\nSection: CONSTRUCTION NEWS, US news, US Federal Government news, Lawsuits news & OUTSOURCING \nNEWS\nLength: 858 words\nByline: Wayne Parry\nBody\n Opponents of offshore wind around the U.S. are pelting projects with lawsuits seeking to cancel them or tie them \nup for years in costly litigation.\nThe court cases represent another hurdle the nascent industry must overcome, particularly along the East Coast \nwhere opposition to offshore wind farms is vocal and well-organized. \nThey add another pressure point for an industry already struggling with escalating prices, shaky supply chains, and \na handful of highly publicized turbine failures that opponents are seizing on as proof that the structures are \nunreliable and unsafe, something the industry denies.\nThere are 13 cases pending in federal courts targeting offshore wind projects, according to the American Clean \nPower Association, an offshore wind trade group. An undetermined number of additional lawsuits are active in state \ncourts, they said.\nRobin Shaffer is president of Protect Our Coast NJ, a citizens group that has filed numerous lawsuits in New Jersey \nagainst two offshore projects currently or previously proposed. \nShaffer said his group was at least partly responsible for scuttling two New Jersey wind farms proposed by Orsted \nthat the Danish wind giant scrapped last October, saying they were no longer financially workable.\n\"An ancillary benefit of our legal strategy is to give pause or doubt in the minds of investors in the big corporations \nthat are undertaking these projects,\" he said. \"Last year, we saw Orsted leave its commitment to build Ocean Wind \noff the southern New Jersey coast amidst the uncertainty of two lawsuits we filed, as well as another filed by Cape \nMay County.\"\nPage 2 of 3\nLawsuits buffet US offshore wind projects, seeking to end or delay them\nOpponents cite altered views of the horizon from wind turbines and concerns about what the structures might do to \nmarine life. They also cite rising projected prices for electricity generated from the wind farms, and point to recent \nturbine collapses off Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts and at Doggers Bank off the English coast as proof the \ntechnology is risky.\nSupporters say offshore wind is necessary to combat climate change, which they call the principal threat to the \nocean and its inhabitants.\n\"Offshore wind projects undergo rigorous environmental reviews and permitting processes, in addition to a lengthy \npublic comment period,\" said Jason Ryan, a spokesman for the Clean Power Association. \"The current slate of U.S. \noffshore wind projects under construction and development are among the most carefully planned and analyzed \ninfrastructure projects in U.S. history; we are confident their permits will withstand legal scrutiny.\"\nPaulina O'Connor, executive director of the New Jersey Offshore Wind Alliance, said offshore wind is needed to \ncombat climate change.\n\"On the heels of one of the hottest summers on record, it is disappointing to see another frivolous lawsuit filed by \nthose with opposing views,\" she said of the most recent lawsuit.\nThat action was filed Friday by Save LBI, another New Jersey citizen group. It claims that Atlantic Shores, the New \nJersey project furthest along its state's approval path, would violate noise ordinances during pile driving and \noperation of hundreds of wind turbines. The group says it has several other lawsuits on the way. Atlantic Shores \ndeclined to comment.\nOther litigation in New Jersey challenged Orsted's now-scrapped wind farm plan, a state tax break the company \nwould have received, and even the placement of a power cable that would bring electricity from the project onshore. \nA group of Jersey Shore towns sued Atlantic Shores, and fishing and environmental groups sued two federal \nagencies overseeing offshore wind projects. They are appealing the dismissal of their suit after a judge ruled they \nhad no legal standing to sue.\nOffshore wind foes in other states are also turning to the courts.\nIn March, The National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative watchdog group in Virginia, sued Dominion Energy \nand the federal government hoping to block a wind farm off the coast of Virginia Beach. Dominion called the suit \nmeritless and said it employs multiple layers of protection for the marine environment.\nLast year, a Rhode Island nonprofit known for its seaside mansions sued the federal government challenging the \npermitting process for offshore wind energy projects off Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. The Preservation \nSociety of Newport County said the presence of hundreds of wind turbines off the New England coast would ruin \nocean views from several of its historic properties.\nAlso in Rhode Island, the anti-wind group Green Oceans sued the federal government in April, saying it illegally \ngave Orsted permits for its South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects. Orsted declined comment on the \nlawsuit but noted that South Fork is fully operational and Revolution recently installed its first turbine.\nOn the West Coast, the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians in Oregon, whose \nculture reveres the ocean, sued the federal government Tuesday over plans to hold an offshore wind energy \nauction next month.\nAnd in March, fishermen sued California over plans for three floating wind farms.\n___\nFollow Wayne Parry on X at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC Page 3 of 3\nLawsuits buffet US offshore wind projects, seeking to end or delay them\nLoad-Date: September 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Orsted.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
