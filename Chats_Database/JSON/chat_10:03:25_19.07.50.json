Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's CEO | \"As a first mover, our intellectual property is critical to our ongoing success in this pursuit and must be protected at all times.\" | N.A. |\n| Justice John Logan | Federal Court Judge | \"What needs to be made pellucid is that there is no determination whatsoever of the merits of the claims made by the Fortescue parties, or, for that matter, the riposte which has thus far been made on behalf of the respondents.\" | N.A. |\n| Fortescue Spokesperson | Not mentioned | \"We invest significant resources in creating IP and are committed to vigorously managing and enforcing its protection. As the matter is the subject of legal proceedings, we do not intend to comment further at this stage.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
