Notoriously private, Creasy wouldn't respond when we asked.\nAnd it isn't the only late-life change for the legendary digger. As we reported two years ago, he and partner Annie \nGuo welcomed a baby, which, arriving now at the age of tantrums and bitter defiance, should make running a \nremote mine in the kiln of WA's northwest seem like a refreshing vacation.\nOverpriced Libs Prices are clearly booming on the rubber-chicken circuit.\nWe're at a loss to explain why, but the expense of attending a Liberal Party fundraiser is getting way out of hand.\nPage 2 of 2\nProspector Creasy gets his mine\nA private dinner scheduled with John Howard for October 15 was originally priced at $10,000 a pop - that was \nhalved two weeks later, presumably because the expense was exorbitant. The same event (on Lygon Street, \nMelbourne) is now being offered for 20 people, instead of 10, at a cost of $5000. Cheaper, but hardly a steal.\nDinner with Peter Dutton isn't much more affordable. He's down for an event in Canberra next month where tickets \nare selling for $10,000, or roughly double what Anthony Albanese and members of his cabinet charge. Dutton has a \nsecond event in the offing, also $10,000, to be held in Melbourne around the same time.\nAre we to take this jacked-up pricing as a signal of Liberal confidence in their own polling numbers?\nFor an example of just how inflated this fundraising bubble has become, take a look at Liberal hopeful Tim Wilson.\nHe's not even a member of parliament (anymore) yet he's charging $10,000 \"per plate\" for a lunch with New \nZealand's Regulation Minister David Seymour, someone who, according to Wilson, \"is coming to Melbourne to do \none lunch in support of my campaign to take back Goldstein\".\nUnexpected, too, that a conservative-minded Seymour, leader of the right-wing ACT Party, would be embraced so \nwholly by a moderate like Wilson, whose invitation says: \"It will truly be a wonderful lunch with robust and enlivening \ndiscussion.\" No doubt. But for ten large?\nThe market for bloviating is definitely due for a correction. Taking a stand A low-hanging morsel from Fortescue's \ncontinuing beef with Element Zero and its co-founders Michael Masterman, Bjorn Winther-Jensen and Bart \nKolodziejczyk, all of whom stand accused of stealing intellectual property to start their rival green iron business.\nA veritable library of affidavits have been lodged with the Federal Court, from both sides, but one previously-\nredacted number demands renewed attention.\nRat-holed inside 691 pages filed by Adrian Huber, Fortescue's senior legal counsel, are details of a confidential \ninvestigation that had been run into Kolodziejczyk. He held the role of chief technology officer at Fortescue Future \nIndustries from late 2019 until his resignation in October 2021, at which time \"concerns\" were raised over his \nqualifications and experience \"as represented on his resume\".\nThat much has been reported. The short version of the story is that Fortescue alleged Kolodziejczyk - coldly \nreferred to by the investigation as \"the Subject\" - misrepresented his CV and the former chief scientist, in his own \naffidavit, denied ever doing so.\nLesser known until now is that Fortescue was sufficiently miffed about these \"numerous gaps\" that it hit up \nrecruitment firm Gerard Daniels - two years after it recommended Kolodziejczyk for the job - asking for its money \nback.\nGerard Daniels, it said, had \"admitted in writing that they had failed to manage the reference check process \nproperly\", resulting in a Fortescue claim for $67,000. \"The employee due diligence had effectively been outsourced \nby FMG (Fortescue Metals) to Gerard Daniels,\" the report said.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL For $5000, a cut-price dinner with John Howard\nLoad-Date: September 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
