In September, Fortescue said it expected to ship \nabout 5 million tonnes of magnetite concentrate from Iron Bridge this financial year, but has so far managed only \nfive cargoes.\nThe company, which is controlled by billionaire Andrew Forrest, said shipments from the facility could reach as little \nas 40 per cent of that 5 million tonne guidance, giving a new range of 2 to 4 million tonnes.\nFortescue said it was still having trouble with supply from its borefields for the water-hungry operation, where a \nhigh-pressure water line keeps springing leaks.\nFortescue owns about 70\"per cent of the operation, with the remainder controlled by Taiwan's Formosa.\nAfter falling short of its promise to reach a final investment decision on as many as five green energy projects in \n2023, the company is likely to make a call on its biggest planned hydrogen project in Australia, Mr Hutchinson said.\nFortescue announced the approval of two projects from its energy division in November, ticking off plans for small \nhydrogen production plants in Phoenix in the United States and at Gladstone in Queensland.\nAt the time, Fortescue said it would fast-track a decision on larger projects in Norway, Kenya and Brazil.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue D-Day looms\nBut the company put off any decision on its Gibson Island proposal in Brisbane, where Fortescue has been \nworking with Incitec Pivot on a green hydrogen feed for Incitec's mothballed fertiliser plant.\nAt the time, Fortescue cited high Australian energy costs for the deferral. In late December, Genex Power told the \nmarket it had extended a deadline for Fortescue to close a deal for power from its proposed Bulli Creek solar farm \nby two months until the end of February.\nMr Hutchinson told reporters and analysts that a final decision on the plant was likely at Fortescue's board \nmeeting. \"We're working hard to get this project over the line. We have a board meeting coming up later in February \nand I would imagine there will be a 'go or no go' decision made at that board meeting,\" he said.\nLoad-Date: January 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
