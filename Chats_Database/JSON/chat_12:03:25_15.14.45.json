Here's how to ask your boss\nContent: Page 1 of 2\nWant to work from home? Here's how to ask your boss\nWant to work from home? Here's how to ask your boss\nCanberra Times (Australia)\nJanuary 20, 2024 Saturday\nPrint Edition\nCopyright 2024 Australian Community Media All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 6\nLength: 704 words\nByline: Bageshri Savyasachi\nBody\nIf you're employed at an office where working from home has not been welcome after COVID lockdowns, asking for \nflexible working conditions may feel daunting.\nPeople and management experts in Canberra have some suggestions that may help you ask for what you need.\nThose who can complete their official duties just as well from home, it is worthwhile reminding yourself of the \nbenefits of flexible working to build confidence. There's also evidence you can use.\nA survey by tech firm CISCO in 2022 reported on Australian experiences in hybrid workplaces. Respondents \nbelonged to industries including public service, healthcare, agriculture, IT, NGOs, finance, and food and beverage \nworkers.\nAbout 84 per cent of 1042 Australians who participated in the study said they saved $US180 (now $AU268) on \naverage per week.\nSome also reported eating healthier (65 per cent), becoming physically fitter (69.5 per cent), feeling happier (84.7 \nper cent) and improving their work-life balance (82.4 per cent) . More than half of them also said their relationships \nwith family and friends had improved.\nEmpower yourself with solutions and evidence Once you've decided to speak to your manager, review your job \ndescription and see which parts allowed for remote working.\nDr Jennifer Loh, professor in management at the University of Canberra, said it's good to be prepared with solutions \nfor your boss, of how you plan to complete your duties. This will give them confidence you are capable of \nperforming well even from home.\n\"It opens up that discussion in terms of, 'this task does not need me to be on site, can I maybe work from home half \na day? I'll take care of everything, I can use the computer',\" she said.\nPage 2 of 2\nWant to work from home? Here's how to ask your boss\n\"The employer will then obviously have to recognize they need to be flexible because the responsibility of that \nparticular employees does not need them to be on site,\" she said.\nAccording to demographer Dr Liz Allen, from the Australian National University, ACT's population flows and \nworkforce suggest that employees possess significant power.\n\"If you are a good employee, and you have demonstrated that loyalty with your employer, you should not fear \nasking for flexible working arrangements,\" Dr Allen said.\n\"From a demographic point of view, they have a lot more power than they realise, particularly in Canberra. Workers \nwho are not having success in their current workplace might have the opportunity to go and negotiate more flexible \nworking arrangements elsewhere.\"\n\"At the end of the day, data tends not to lie and the data is very clear - Australian workers want and need flexibility,\" \nDr Allen said. \"We will be living with Covid for the future time and we need to be better at responding and dealing \nwith the challenges that that poses.\"\nWhat can employers do? Dr Loh said employers could help facilitate this conversation by being transparent with \ntheir staff. Providing a forum, not during a one-on-one chat, for open communication where employees find out \nabout their rights, enterprise agreements and relevant processes.\n\"[Managers] need to disseminate information, widely and officially ... where everybody appreciates their approach \ntowards managing and leading,\" she said.\nOn the other hand, the CISCO study also reported about 58 per cent of Australian respondents believed they faced \nchallenges in fully engaging with their company and coworkers during hybrid working.\nTo address this issue, employers and employees needed to work together creatively and flexibly to maintain a good \nstandard of productivity and job satisfaction, Dr Loh said.\nREAD MORE:\nCanberra employers' attitudes towards work-from-home practices in 2024 The fear of missing out is real for these \nbosses Fears 'strange' APS flexible work rights could reshape Canberra Steps to ask for what you need, according \nto the experts Ask yourself if it's safe for you to have this conversation (if it's a very rigid workplace, consider \nspeaking to a union representative)\nGather evidence you can use to mount your case (loyalty, productivity, job description)\nProvide solutions and arrangements that serve you and your employer (WFH on designated days/ half days/ one \nweek on, one week off)\nGive examples of how other businesses in your industry are being flexible\nLoad-Date: January 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**ENTITY**: [Organization Name]\n**TYPE**: [Type of organization - e.g., Company, Government Agency, NGO, etc.]\n**DESCRIPTION**: [Brief description of how the entity is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**ENTITY**: Tesla, Inc.\n**TYPE**: Company\n**DESCRIPTION**: Main subject of article, discussing Q4 earnings report\n\nOnly include entities that are meaningful to the article's content.
