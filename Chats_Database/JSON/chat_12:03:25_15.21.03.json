And is it really \nalmost here?\nThe Conversation - Australia\nOctober 28, 2024 Monday 7:08 PM EST\nCopyright 2024 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1260 words\nByline: Flora Salim, Professor, School of Computer Science and Engineering, inaugural Cisco Chair of Digital \nTransport & AI, UNSW Sydney\nHighlight: AI systems more intelligent than humans in some ways already exist - but general-purpose superhuman \nintelligence is probably still a long way off.\nBody\nIn 2014, the British philosopher Nick Bostrom published a book about the future of artificial intelligence (AI) with the \nominous title Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies. It proved highly influential in promoting the idea that \nadvanced AI systems - \"superintelligences\" more capable than humans - might one day take over the world and \ndestroy humanity.\nA decade later, OpenAI boss Sam Altman says superintelligence may only be \" a few thousand days\" away. A year \nago, Altman's OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever set up a team within the company to focus on \" safe \nsuperintelligence\", but he and his team have now raised a billion dollars to create a startup of their own to pursue \nthis goal.\nWhat exactly are they talking about? Broadly speaking, superintelligence is anything more intelligent than humans. \nBut unpacking what that might mean in practice can get a bit tricky.\nDifferent kinds of AI\nIn my view the most useful way to think about different levels and kinds of intelligence in AI was developed by US \ncomputer scientist Meredith Ringel Morris and her colleagues at Google.\nTheir framework lists six levels of AI performance: no AI, emerging, competent, expert, virtuoso and superhuman. It \nalso makes an important distinction between narrow systems, which can carry out a small range of tasks, and more \ngeneral systems.\nA narrow, no-AI system is something like a calculator. It carries out various mathematical tasks according to a set of \nexplicitly programmed rules.\nPage 2 of 3\nWhat is AI superintelligence? Could it destroy humanity? And is it really almost here?\nThere are already plenty of very successful narrow AI systems. Morris gives the Deep Blue chess program that \nfamously defeated world champion Garry Kasparov way back in 1997 as an example of a virtuoso-level narrow AI \nsystem. \nSome narrow systems even have superhuman capabilities. One example is Alphafold, which uses machine learning \nto predict the structure of protein molecules, and whose creators won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry this year. \nWhat about general systems? This is software that can tackle a much wider range of tasks, including things like \nlearning new skills. \nA general no-AI system might be something like Amazon's Mechanical Turk: it can do a wide range of things, but it \ndoes them by asking real people. \nOverall, general AI systems are far less advanced than their narrow cousins. According to Morris, the state-of-the-\nart language models behind chatbots such as ChatGPT are general AI - but they are so far at the \"emerging\" level \n(meaning they are  \"equal to or somewhat better than an unskilled human\"), and yet to reach \"competent\" (as good \nas 50% of skilled adults). \nSo by this reckoning, we are still some distance from general superintelligence.\nHow intelligent is AI right now?\nAs Morris points out, precisely determining where any given system sits would depend on having reliable tests or \nbenchmarks. \nDepending on our benchmarks, an image-generating system such as DALL-E might be at virtuoso level (because it \ncan produce images 99% of humans could not draw or paint), or it might be emerging (because it produces errors \nno human would, such as mutant hands and impossible objects). \nThere is significant debate even about the capabilities of current systems. One notable 2023 paper argued GPT-4 \nshowed \"sparks of artificial general intelligence\".\nOpenAI says its latest language model, o1, can \"perform complex reasoning\" and \"rivals the performance of human \nexperts\" on many benchmarks.\nHowever, a recent paper from Apple researchers found o1 and many other language models have significant \ntrouble solving genuine mathematical reasoning problems. Their experiments show the outputs of these models \nseem to resemble sophisticated pattern-matching rather than true advanced reasoning. This indicates \nsuperintelligence is not as imminent as many have suggested.\nWill AI keep getting smarter?\nSome people think the rapid pace of AI progress over the past few years will continue or even accelerate. Tech \ncompanies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in AI hardware and capabilities, so this doesn't seem \nimpossible.\nIf this happens, we may indeed see general superintelligence within the \"few thousand days\" proposed by Sam \nAltman (that's a decade or so in less scifi terms). Sutskever and his team mentioned a similar timeframe in their \nsuperalignment article.\nMany recent successes in AI have come from the application of a technique called \"deep learning\", which, in \nsimplistic terms, finds associative patterns in gigantic collections of data. Indeed, this year's Nobel Prize in Physics \nhas been awarded to John Hopfield and also the \" Godfather of AI\" Geoffrey Hinton, for their invention of Hopfield \nNetworks and Boltzmann machine, which are the foundation for many powerful deep learning models used today.  Page 3 of 3\nWhat is AI superintelligence? Could it destroy humanity? And is it really almost here?\nGeneral systems such as ChatGPT have relied on data generated by humans, much of it in the form of text from \nbooks and websites. Improvements in their capabilities have largely come from increasing the scale of the systems \nand the amount of data on which they are trained. \nHowever, there may not be enough human-generated data to take this process much further (although efforts to \nuse data more efficiently, generate synthetic data, and improve transfer of skills between different domains may \nbring improvements). Even if there were enough data, some researchers say language models such as ChatGPT \nare fundamentally incapable of reaching what Morris would call general competence. \nOne recent paper has suggested an essential feature of superintelligence would be open-endedness, at least from \na human perspective. It would need to be able to continuously generate outputs that a human observer would \nregard as novel and be able to learn from. \nExisting foundation models are not trained in an open-ended way, and existing open-ended systems are quite \nnarrow. This paper also highlights how either novelty or learnability alone is not enough. A new type of open-ended \nfoundation model is needed to achieve superintelligence.\nWhat are the risks?\nSo what does all this mean for the risks of AI? In the short term, at least, we don't need to worry about \nsuperintelligent AI taking over the world.\nBut that's not to say AI doesn't present risks. Again, Morris and co have thought this through: as AI systems gain \ngreat capability, they may also gain greater autonomy. Different levels of capability and autonomy present different \nrisks.\nFor example, when AI systems have little autonomy and people use them as a kind of consultant - when we ask \nChatGPT to summarise documents, say, or let the YouTube algorithm shape our viewing habits - we might face a \nrisk of over-trusting or over-relying on them. \nIn the meantime, Morris points out other risks to watch out for as AI systems become more capable, ranging from \npeople forming parasocial relationships with AI systems to mass job displacement and society-wide ennui. \nWhat's next?\nLet's suppose we do one day have superintelligent, fully autonomous AI agents. Will we then face the risk they \ncould concentrate power or act against human interests?\nNot necessarily. Autonomy and control can go hand in hand. A system can be highly automated, yet provide a high \nlevel of human control. \nLike many in the AI research community, I believe safe superintelligence is feasible. However, building it will be a \ncomplex and multidisciplinary task, and researchers will have to tread unbeaten paths to get there.\nFlora Salim receives funding from Australian Research Council and Cisco.
