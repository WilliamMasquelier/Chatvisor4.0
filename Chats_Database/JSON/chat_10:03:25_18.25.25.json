The Fund performance compared to a 21% sterling return \\nregistered by the Gold Bugs Index and the GDXJ equity ETF. However, we anticipate that the lag in performance of \\nthe smaller equities held in the Fund will catch-up with larger peers given their relatively attractive valuations.\\nGold was one of the stronger commodities with the price rising over 9% during March to new all-time highs. Silver is \\nlatterly starting to catch-up, registering a 10% price increase over the month. Prices held despite a more hawkish \\nmove in US FED rate expectations after FOMC minutes indicated broader US labour markets were stubbornly \\nresilient despite relatively tepid economic growth. Increasingly there appears to be a focus on ever growing \\ngovernment debt levels which have shown little sign of reversing, as evidence by the latest US congression Budget \\nOffice projections.\\nRecent physical gold buying has been led by China, with a pick-up in retail demand showing in import data. This \\nhas been potentially driven by broader concerns on the economy, particularly the weak regional property sector. \\nAlongside this is the healthy net central bank demand: People's Bank of China (PBoC) data showed China's gold \\nreserves continued to rise with the addition of 0.39 Moz in February taking official reserves to 72.6Moz (+10% year-\\non-year). Physical gold ETF's showed a pick-up in buying but aggregate holdings nevertheless ended 246k ounces \\nlower over the month.

This was closely \\nfollowed by Australian gold producer Karora which received bid interest from ASX-listed Ramelius, as well as \\nreports of a further interested party also in discussion with the company. While we do not focus our stock selection \\nspecifically on M&A targets, we believe quality undervalued assets should result in a higher probability of them \\nbecoming targets. The sector remains short of growth projects, and so we would anticipate a pick-up in M&A activity \\ngoing forward. This should help close the discounts of junior miners to the larger.

Unlike plenty of its listed peers, Westgold \\nhasn't benefited from higher gold prices given issues around digesting the Karora acquisition.\\nWestgold CEO Wayne Bramwell plans to use sale proceeds to increase capacity at its Higginsville mill from 1.6 \\nmillion tonnes a year to well above the 2 million mark. A spokesperson declined to comment.\\nThe up-for-grabs Lakewood was acquired by Karora to add an extra million tonnes in capacity for its flagship Beta \\nHunt gold mine, on top of the 1.6 million tonnes capacity at its existing Higginsville mill, amid a production ramp-up.\\nSources said since the merger, Westgold has narrowed its focus on fewer but bigger mills, which are fed by fewer \\nbut bigger mines - in a bid to finetune its cost base against movements in gold pricing. This strategy, at its Beta \\nHunt mine, means processing the ore via the lower-cost and larger Higginsville mill.\\nProcessing a tonne of ore via the Lakewood mill costs $50, while Higginsville can handle the same amount for $30 \\nor more. Should Westgold expand Higginsville as expected, this cost could be brought down to the $20 range, the \\nsources said.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nWestgold shops gold mill acquired in $2.5b Karora merger; Street Talk\\nThe mooted deal comes after Westgold and rival Ramelius Resources locked horns last year over Karora, as \\nrevealed by Street Talk. The stoush ended when the $3 billion Ramelius decided to walk away, while Westgold \\nprogressed and took the keys to Karora in August. But the proceedings also outed the fact that Ramelius had \\napproached Westgold with a merger proposal but was knocked back.\\nA fortnight ago, Westgold shares tanked after the miner cut its 2025 production guidance by as much as one-fifth \\nand warned of higher costs after paying big for Karora.

The media coverage focuses on its financial performance rather than operational or ethical concerns, framing it as a volatile stock in the resources sector. Karora Resources, despite its neutral sentiment, is frequently discussed in the context of mergers and acquisitions, particularly its acquisition by Westgold Resources and previous interest from Ramelius Resources. The coverage is transactional, emphasizing its role as a target rather than its operational strengths or weaknesses. Rio Tinto, with a slightly positive sentiment, is consistently mentioned in relation to stock performance, often in the context of broader market trends. Unlike Fortescue, Rio Tinto's portrayal is more balanced, with mentions of both gains and losses, reflecting its stability as a major mining player rather than a company in crisis.",
