It operates in the Mining, exploration and drilling of gold, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Ramelius Resources based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Ramelius Resources is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Ramelius Resources.\n\nIf Ramelius Resources is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nSouthern Cross and Mawson in rethink\nSouthern Cross and Mawson in rethink\nThe Australian\nJune 12, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 19\nLength: 463 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nCanadian-listed Mawson Gold wants to reverse its spin-out of Victorian precious metals explorer Southern Cross \nGold, pitching a merger that would result in the combined company being listed on the Australian and Toronto stock \nexchanges.\nSouthern Cross has been drilling out its promising Sunday Creek gold and antimony project, which sits only 60km \nnorth of Melbourne, with high-grade hits this year having pushed the -company's valuation to almost $550m - with a \nfive-fold increase on its share price from only a year ago.\nMawson spun out Southern Cross in 2022 in order to instead focus on new gold and uranium projects in Finland \nand Sweden, retaining just under half of Southern Cross stock after the company's initial public offering on the \nAustralian market.\nThe Canadian-listed company had planned to distribute its holding in Southern Cross to its own shareholders, but \nits own exploration efforts have lagged those of its Australian cousin and Mawson now wants to take the Victorian \ngold project back into the fold, according to Tuesday's -announcement by both comp-anies.\nUnder the proposed deal, Mawson will sell off its Scandinavian assets and consolidate its own shares - offering \nSouthern Cross shareholders a one-for-one deal that would result in the company's Australian stock holders \nemerging with 50.4 per cent of the joint company.\nThe re-merged company would be dual-listed in both Australia and Canada. Southern Cross is yet to declare an \ninitial resource at Sunday Creek, but has released a number of impressive drilling hits over the past year, including \na 20-metre strike grading 62.7 grams a tonne gold.\nWhile any ore mined at the project in the future is likely to be more difficult to process than traditional Australian \ngold mines, the company also says its drilling has revealed substantial grades of antimony - considered a critical \nmineral by most Western governments.\nPage 2 of 2\nSouthern Cross and Mawson in rethink\nBut, while Southern Cross stock has been buoyed by the recent rise in the price of the precious metal, Tuesday's \nmerger announcement came amid a blip in the gold price as Chinese authorities halted gold buying in May, and a \nshift in strategy on US -markets as investors begin to factor in potential rate cuts in the country.\nMajor Australian gold stocks tumbled on Tuesday, with Newmont shares closing down 3.3 per cent at $61.49, \nEvolution Mining off 6.5 per cent at $3.76, Genesis Minerals down 8.8 per cent at $1.815, and Northern Star \nResources off 5.1 per cent at $13.82.\nIn other heavy falls, Regis Resources closed down 8.1 per cent on Tuesday at $1.765 and Ramelius Resources \nwas down 7.3 per cent at $1.855. The merger announcement was received favourably by Southern Cross \nshareholders, however, with its shares bucking the falls across the gold sector, closing up 2c at $2.82.\nLoad-Date: June 11, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Ramelius Resources.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
