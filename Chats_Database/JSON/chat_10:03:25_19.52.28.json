Everyone's hopes around market development and customers \ncommitting just haven't materialised.\" As part of its flagship Future Made in Australia plan, the -Albanese \ngovernment in 2024 provided a budget allocation of $6.7bn to provide a $2 incentive for every kilogram of green \nhydrogen produced from 2027-28. It also committed $2bn for new projects under the Hydrogen Headstart program.\n\"That $2 per kilogram hasn't been enough to make a difference,\" Mr Scaysbrook said. \"It certainly doesn't appear to \nbe making enough difference for the projects that are now falling over.\" In the US, green hydrogen producers were \nexpecting to tap into a $US3/kg tax incentive. But Mr Trump has indicated the Inflation Reduction Act which \ncontained the subsidy is likely to be wound back.\n\"Probably under this administration no one will be developing green hydrogen projects in the US even with the \n$US3 /kg leg-up - even if it remained,\" Mr Scaysbrook said.\nGreen hydrogen - produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen through zero-emissions technologies - has \nso far proven to be more hype than a major new energy source, its critics maintain.\nThe battle to build a hydrogen export industry from scratch also looms as a major political divide ahead of the \nfederal election. Labor has included green hydrogen as a central plank in its plan for Australia to become a \nrenewable energy superpower. Energy Minister Chris Bowen said in September it was \"no exaggeration\" to say \ngreen hydrogen would be on the ballot paper.\nLoad-Date: March 5, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
