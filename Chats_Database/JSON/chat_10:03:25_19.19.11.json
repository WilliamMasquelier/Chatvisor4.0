But Dr Forrest told shareholders \nattending the Fortescue AGM his green dream would take the company to a new level entirely, and by 2030 \nFortescue would be challenging global energy majors such as Chevron.\nFortescue would be targeting production of as much as 235 gigawatts of renewable energy, Dr Forrest told \nshareholders - more than five times the capacity of Australia's National Electricity Market at the time.\nThe edges of the plan had been leaking out for months, as Dr Forrest and a small group of insiders had been \ntouring the world trying to stitch up deals with global governments to allow the company first choice of potential \nenergy projects. The company's new subsidiary, Fortescue Future Industries, had signed a deal for the potential \ndevelopment of hydroelectric power in Papua New Guinea only a month before, along with early stage agreements \nin Indonesia. And the company had already hired a raft of renewable energy experts - including former Pacific \nHydro boss Rob Grant - to help form its renewable energy plans.\nBy the November shareholder meeting Dr Forrest and his team had spoken with more than 25 governments around \nthe world, with another 24 on the list for the touring party.\nThat landmark presentation in November 2020 kicked off a bewildering array of announcements from the tour - \nincluding early stage agreements with India, Indonesia and Brazil - and plans to get involved in the world's biggest \nrenewable energy project, the Grand Inga project in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nAlarm bells were ringing in the market by mid-2021, however, when Fortescue's announcement it planned to spend \nup to 10 per cent of its net profits on green energy projects - or $US400m to $US600m that financial year - sparked \nconcerns the green energy project was looming as a major distraction from the company's main iron ore business.\nPage 2 of 3\nFortescue now marching 'to the one beat'\nFortescue chief executive Elizabeth Gaines faced a hostile reception from analysts and investors at the company's \nregular quarterly production briefing in July, with analysts and fund managers demanding the company give the \nmarket a \"clear business case\" for its green energy investments. But resurgent iron ore prices meant the rivers of \ncash were still rolling in and the backlash never really translated into a hit to Fortescue's share price - Dr Forrest \nargues the reverse happened, in fact, as green-focused investment firms piled into the company's stock.\nAnd the growing criticism certainly did not slow the flurry of announcements. By November 2021 FFI had inked \nagreements for hydrogen and renewable energy projects in more than 20 countries, and analysis by The Australian \nestimated that it would cost close to $200bn for Fortescue to make good on delivering just half of those projects.\nBy then FFI had more 700 staff, its own private jet to ferry energy boss Julie Shuttleworth around the world, and a \nvast portfolio of potential projects.\nBut even then cracks were appearing in Dr Forrest's green vision. An investigation by The Weekend Australian in \nlate 2021 revealed that the internal culture of FFI had become increasingly chaotic amid ruthless internal \ncompetition - so much so that insiders described its inner workings as being like the Hunger Games.\nAt the same time Dr Forrest's passion for Fortescue's project - which he genuinely believes is a key part of saving \nthe planet from the worst impacts of global warming - riled up the rest of Australia's mining industry, which until then \nhad been watching on with bemused fascination, after The Australian revealed the Fortescue founder was lobbying \nfor a phase-out of the federal government's diesel fuel rebate scheme, worth billions to the mining industry.\nBoiler room explosion It is bizarre to reflect that catalogue only reflects the first year of Fortescue's grand energy \nproject.\nEven close followers of the company amongst journalists and market analysts struggle to chronicle the bewildering \narray of announcements, promises and backflips - and executive departures - over the next few years.\nBut if there was a moment that sums up the chaos within the company, it is the complete implosion at the most \nsenior ranks in the company in September 2021.\nNewly appointed mining boss Fiona Hick left the company only days after Fortescue celebrated its 20th birthday \nwith a lavish bash in the Pilbara. She was quickly followed out the door by new chief financial officer Christine \nMorris, high-profile FFI recruit Guy Debelle. In an explosive interview with The Australian, Dr Forrest claimed the \nextraordinary events were sparked after he returned from an overseas trip to find the company's strategy had been \nhijacked by members of its executive team, over differences in opinion over Fortescue's green strategy. \"You put a \nlighthouse on a hill and aim at it (but) there was a feeling that another lighthouse was emerging and the \norganisation - particularly when the chairman was overseas for three months - was being pushed towards -another \nlighthouse,\" he said at the time.\nIs the dream over?\nThe spectacular departure of Hick and Morris did not end the upheaval in Fortescue's executive ranks, far from it. \nBut 10 months on, Fortescue now faces another round of major change as Dr Forrest this week reset the \ncompany's strategy - finally conceding that the company's most ambitious goal, of producing 15 million tonnes of \ngreen hydrogen a year by 2030, cannot be achieved in the face of soaring global energy costs.\nBut Dr Forrest rejects any suggestion the company's green energy dream is dead. Speaking to the Australian this \nweek, he said the company's commitment to decarbonise its own iron ore operations by 2030 is unwavering, and \nthe company will shift its green energy focus to building the massive amounts of wind and solar power needed to \nbring down energy costs and make hydrogen viable.\nAnd as for the 700 staff that will leave as part of the reset? Dr Forrest says that is \"heartbreaking\", but necessary as \nFortescue brings its iron ore and green energy arms back together.Page 3 of 3\nFortescue now marching 'to the one beat'\nBut the tension between those two arms has been at the centre of the chaos within Fortescue since the green \nenergy project first began - according to both former Fortescue employees and Dr Forrest's own words along the \nway.\nThe decision to build Fortescue Energy as a company within a company was a deliberate decision, the Fortescue \nfounder told The Australian this week, because it otherwise may not have happened at all.\n\"I had no choice. I tried for a couple of years to get green energy, and going green into the psyche of Fortescue. \nWe had a very good, very well run company, with shareholder returns which hit new records across Australia and \ntens of billions of dollars issued to shareholders. A super successful company - and strong resistance to change,\" \nhe said.\n\"And you can't have improvement without change. You can't be smug, fat and happy. And so as to not threaten the \niron ore sector at all with a major new initiative, we did it through a major startup. And that grew and grew.\" \nFortescue Energy had more than 1900 employees at the end of June 2023, according to the company's last annual \nreport. That may well be dramatically slimmed down by the latest restructuring.\nBut Dr Forrest says all of Fortescue is now \"all marching in the same direction, to the same drum beat\". \"There is \nno one else that is going to lead the world into a secure and non-fossil fuel future. It may as well be us, so it is us,\" \nhe said. And Dr Forrest rejects any suggestion that Fortescue's latest reset is a sign its green strategy is failing, \npointing to the green iron technology the company is developing, its acquisition of a role developing in the giant \nBelinga iron ore deposit in Gabon, its early stage green ammonia joint venture in Morroco, and its development of \nnew technology in shipping, trucking and rail. \"The failure here is a failure of your understanding - and I'm not being \nunkind here. We didn't just go after green hydrogen, we went after green technology - we went after what \nopportunities there could be in changing the world.That led to opportunities being offered to us,\" he said.\nLoad-Date: July 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
