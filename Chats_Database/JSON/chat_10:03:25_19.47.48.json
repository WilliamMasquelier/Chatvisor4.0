Pg. 43\nLength: 470 words\nByline: Giuseppe Tauriello\nBody\nThe boss of WA iron ore developer Red Hawk Mining is urging shareholders to back a $254m takeover offer from \nFortescue, arguing the mining major is best placed to progress the company's Blacksmith project in the Pilbara, as \nworries over Chinese demand and tariffs in the US escalate.\nFortescue is offering Red Hawk shareholders $1.05 per share as part of its off-market cash bid, increasing to $1.20 \nif it manages to secure at least 75 per cent of Red Hawk shares within seven days.\nAt that price, the transaction values Red Hawk at $254m, representing a 46 per cent premium on its closing price \non January 24 - the last day of trade before the deal was announced to the market on Tuesday.\nRed Hawk managing director Steven Michael said the offer represented an \"attractive outcome\" for shareholders, \namid an uncertain outlook for Australia's iron ore producers.\n\"From a Red Hawk shareholder point of view, it's a very clear path to realising their return on their investment in a \nvery short period of time,\" he said.\n\"I think it is fair to say that the iron ore market, where we sit today at about $US104 a tonne - there is probably more \nrisk to the downside than the upside.\n\"Things like Simandou on the horizon coming out of Guinea sometime this year may have an impact, obviously \nChina has slowed down a little bit, and there's always the risk of the new tariffs being imposed out of the US that \nmay have an impact as well.\" As part of a pre-feasibility study released last year, Red Hawk was looking to invest \nclose to $250m into the development of Blacksmith - a 243 million tonne resource measured at 59.3 per cent iron \ngrade.\nThe project was designed to ramp up to more than 5 million tonnes in annual production over its more than 20 \nyears life.\nPage 2 of 2\nRed Hawk Mining soars on major's takeover offer\nHowever, with the project located just 30km west of Fortescue's Solomon iron ore operations, there is an \nopportunity for Fortescue to integrate a much larger project into its existing operations, which provide a direct rail \nlink to Port Hedland.\n\"For a company of our size, funding a project at $250m, or possibly more, would be a challenge,\" Mr Michael said.\n\"In the hands of Fortescue, if they end up with control of this project, they would look to integrate it straight into \ntheir existing infrastructure.\" Red Hawk's directors have unanimously endorsed the bid, including representatives \nfrom the company's two largest shareholders - New Zealand's Todd family through its TIO (NZ) subsidiary, and \nOCJ Investment (Australia), who together control more than 80 per cent of the company's shares.\nFortescue said its offer represented a \"significant and attractive premium\" for Red Hawk shareholders.\nFortescue's offer closes on March 3. Red Hawk shares jumped early and stabilised to close 44.5 per cent higher \non Tuesday at $1.18. Fortescue closed 0.37 per cent higher at $18.88.\nLoad-Date: January 29, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Steven Michael | Managing Director of Red Hawk Mining | \"From a Red Hawk shareholder point of view, it's a very clear path to realising their return on their investment in a very short period of time.\" | N.A. |\n| Steven Michael | Managing Director of Red Hawk Mining | \"In the hands of Fortescue, if they end up with control of this project, they would look to integrate it straight into their existing infrastructure.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
