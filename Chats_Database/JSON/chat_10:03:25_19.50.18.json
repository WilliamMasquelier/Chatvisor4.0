This comprises $1bn for cultural loss, $678.1m for economic loss, \n$34.8m for the specific destruction of sites and $112.1m for healing the trauma of social disruption it says FMG \ncaused.\nThe Yindjibarndi claim to have new evidence in the form of \"a remarkable document\" showing FMG was supporting \nthe splinter group, known as WYAC, as early as 2011.\nIt says the document was discovered last August.\n\"It is an invoice and corresponding purchase order from (law firm) Corser & Corser to FMG for $107,000. The \ninvoice is dated 4 March, 2011,\" Yindjibarndi says in its submission filed to the Federal Court on Wednesday.\nPage 2 of 2\nYindjibarndi want $1.8bn in mining compo\n\"It refers to a meeting to be held on 16 March and is for anticipated expenses for 214 WYAC members to be paid \n$500 expenses each.\n\"This is a clear and significant measure of support for one side of what was already a serious division in the \ncommunity.\n\"There should be no difficulty in inferring that FMG gave the support to further its own commercial interests.\" \nYindjibarndi's submission, made public by the Federal Court on Wednesday, says there are several such invoices \nfor Corser & Corser's representation of WYAC totalling $590,000.\nFMG released a short statement on Wednesday as hearings in the case continued in the Federal Court.\n\"Fortescue accepts that the Yindjibarndi People are entitled to compensation. However, the parties disagree on the \namount of that compensation,\" the company statement said.\n\"It is noteworthy that Fortescue has agreed and pays financial compensation under all of its other seven native title \nagreements.\" The Federal Court hearings are being live-streamed to the Pilbara town of Roebourne, where \nYindjibarndi people gathered to watch at the community centre called Ganalili. The centre was once the notorious \nVictoria Hotel, the scene of a violent clash between off duty police and Aboriginal males that ended in the death in \ncustody of 16-year-old John Pat in 1983.\nThe Yindjibarndi bought the building in 2014 and turned it into a community hub with cafe, accommodation, general \nstore and offices.\nFMG is yet to make its own closing submissions in court. That is when the company is expected to address in detail \nall the claims made by the Yindjibarndi throughout the hearings and in the document published by the court on \nWednesday.\nLoad-Date: February 19, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
