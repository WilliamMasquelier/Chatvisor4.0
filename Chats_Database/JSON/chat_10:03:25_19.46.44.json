Their only priority \nis to maximise their profits and -produce as much oil and gas as possible.\" Exxon's complaint said the case was \nabout \"the corrupting influence of foreign money in the American legal system and \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the sordid for-profit \nincentives and outright greed that tries to hide behind so-called public impact litigation\".\nThe case focuses on the role of IEFJ, a charity established by Dr Forrest and run out of the Mounts Bay Road \nheadquarters of Minderoo and his Tattarang -family office.\nAccording to the lawsuit, IEFJ, Exxon says, has directed hundreds of thousands of dollars to US law firm Cotchett, \nPitre & McCarthy to help \"smear campaigns\" by Mr Bonta and US not-for-profits against Exxon and its plans to \nexpand its plastic recycling operations. Mr Bonta has branded Exxon's recycling ambitions as a \"myth\" and a \n\"sham\".\nPage 2 of 3\n'Foreign agent': Forrest named in Exxon lawsuit\n\"Why would Mr Bonta or -anyone who claims to be serious about cleaning up the environment and helping solve \nthe plastic-waste issue take such extreme measures to shut down the emerging and developing advanced recycling \nindustry?\" the Exxon complaint said \"The answer is foreign influence, personal ambition, and a murky source of \nfinancing rife with conflicting business interests.\n\"With apparently no appreciation for the irony of their claim, Mr Bonta and his cohorts are now engaging in reverse \ngreen-washing; while posing under the banner of environmentalism, they do damage to genuine recycling programs \nand to meaningful innovation.\" Exxon noted in its complaint that Dr Forrest was the largest shareholder in \nFortescue, which it said was competing with Exxon in the low-carbon-solutions and energy-transition sector.\nThe company described efforts by Dr Forrest and Fortescue to transform the miner into a green-energy \npowerhouse, including its ambition to sell green hydrogen to the world in competition with American oil and gas \nproducers. Those plans have since been radically scaled back.\n\"Having failed to successfully compete against ExxonMobil in the marketplace, Fortescue has, on information and \nbelief, orchestrated a campaign to compete by turning the wheels of American justice to the company's self-\ninterested purposes,\" the Exxon complaint said. \"More specifically, Fortescue funds Minderoo, which owns and \ncontrols the IEJF, which hired an American law firm to bring claims against ExxonMobil on behalf of the US \nProxies.\" (Minderoo says Exxon's description of its relationship to IEFJ is incorrect.) Exxon said the scale and \nnature of IEFJ's engagement with US law firm Cotchett was significant enough to require the firm to register itself as \na foreign agent under the US Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\"Together, Bonta and the US Proxies - the former for political gain and the latter pawns for the Foreign Interests - \nhave engaged in a deliberate smear campaign against ExxonMobil, falsely claiming that ExxonMobil's effective and \ninnovative advanced recycling technology is a 'false promise' and 'not based on truth',\" the complaint said.\nMr Bonta has accused Exxon of simply stockpiling, rather than recycling, plastic waste it had collected and has \nlabelled Exxon's advanced recycling \"a false promise\". Those attacks, Exxon said, had had a \"chilling effect\" on its \nability to attract third-party customers and secure permits.\nExxon noted in its lawsuit that Dr Forrest himself had in a 2019 TED Talk talked up the merits of advanced plastics \nrecycling, when he called for a voluntary levy on virgin plastics to help make the economics of advanced plastics \nrecycling more competitive.\nDr Forrest's Fortescue, while named in the complaint, is not a party to the lawsuit.\nThe accusations of foreign influence driving legal activism against the oil and gas sector echo accusations levelled \nagainst Australia's Environmental Defenders Office in the wake of its failed legal challenge against Santos and its \nBarossa gas project.\nThe EDO receives a significant portion of its donations from foreign sources. Opposition resources spokeswoman \nSusan McDonald has repeatedly called for greater transparency over the origins of that offshore funding.\nDr Forrest said he was dedicated to steering the world away from a future reliant on fossil fuels, and said any \naccusation of commercial benefit was completely false. \"The fossil-fuel industry know they are on borrowed time \nand that technological solutions exist to phase out fossil fuels,\" he said. \"If the company I founded, Fortescue, one \nof Australia's biggest polluters and most successful companies can profitably cease the use of fossil fuels and go \n'real zero' by 2030 - in just five years - heavy industry will be quick to follow.\" A Fortescue spokesman said the \ncompany rejected the assertions made against it in the lawsuit, including that it had orchestrated litigation against \nExxon to gain a competitive advantage.\n\"While the world was in turmoil in 2021, Fortescue seized the opportunity to meet with governments around the \nworld to begin its green transformation and this has been pivotal to setting the company up for its future success,\" \nthe spokesman said.Page 3 of 3\n'Foreign agent': Forrest named in Exxon lawsuit\n\"Fortescue has an industry-leading plan to stop burning fossil fuels and achieve 'real zero' across its Australian iron \nore operations by the end of the decade. It is this commitment that continues to set the bar for other companies - \nincluding those in the oil and gas industry - to follow.\" A Minderoo spokesman said it was clear that recycling was \nnot an effective means to curb the environmental and human health harms of plastics. \"Minderoo Foundation is \ncommitted to reducing the production of plastics which have a devastating impact on human health, with exposure \nto chemicals found in plastics increasing risks throughout the entire human life cycle, including impacting birth \noutcomes, child neurodevelopment, reproductive health, and metabolic, endocrine and nutrition systems,\" the \nspokesman said.\nLoad-Date: January 8, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"I am personally delighted Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-examination.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"The fossil-fuel industry know they are on borrowed time and that technological solutions exist to phase out fossil fuels.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"If the company I founded, Fortescue, one of Australia's biggest polluters and most successful companies can profitably cease the use of fossil fuels and go 'real zero' by 2030 - in just five years - heavy industry will be quick to follow.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
