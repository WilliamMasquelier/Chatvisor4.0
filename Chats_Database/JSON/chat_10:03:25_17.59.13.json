Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 14\nLength: 1313 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue pursued a $200 million deal to buy West Virginia coal assets in 2022 because chairman Andrew Forrest \nwanted to cultivate a relationship with a key Democratic senator who was playing kingmaker to the Biden \nadministration's flagship climate and energy legislation at the time.\nInternal documents provided to a Connecticut court as part of a dispute between the mining giant and its one-time \nUS partner show Democrat senator Joe Manchin was personally trying to broker a deal between Fortescue and the \nAmerican company that owned the coal-fired generators in the same week he cast the deciding vote on the \npassage of the $US369 billion Inflation Reduction Act.\nKnown as the IRA, the scheme had the potential to unlock billions of dollars worth of taxpayer support for the sort of \ngreen hydrogen projects that Forrest wanted Fortescue to build. The documents show Forrest lost interest in plans \nto buy the West Virginia assets from Energy Harbor as soon as Manchin used his vote to secure the passage of the \ngreen subsidy scheme.\nEvidence of a close relationship between Forrest and Manchin has emerged from the lawsuit filed by Fortescue's \nformer partner in the bid for the assets, the family office of US billionaire Paul Tudor Jones.\nThe Tudor Jones camp is seeking compensation from Fortescue for costs incurred during their short partnership, \nand has argued that the ASX-listed company was interested in buying the coal-fired power stations as a way of \nwinning influence over Manchin and, by extension, the IRA.\nAs evidence, Tudor Jones' flagship company Kid Shelleen presented an email sent by Fortescue's then-North \nAmerican energy president, Paul Browning, to Forrest and other company executives on July 27, 2022.\n\"We pursued Energy Harbor at AF's [Andrew Forrest's] request based on his Manchin relationship, but there are \nplenty of other retiring coal assets we can pursue in areas with better renewable resource,\" Browning said in the \nemail to executives Julie Shuttleworth and David Hunt.\nPage 2 of 3\nForrest's $200m bid to 'influence' senator\nBrowning informed them that Fortescue leaders - including energy boss Mark Hutchinson, energy executive Andy \nVesey and finance boss Guy Debelle - had decided to walk away from the deal \"unless AF wants us to proceed \nbased on Manchin relationship\".\nThe email about Fortescue \"walking away\" from the deal was sent on the same day that Manchin agreed to join his \nfellow Democratic Party representatives in supporting passage of the IRA through the US Senate.\nManchin's support was critical, and could not be taken for granted because he had defied his Democrat colleagues \nby blocking earlier versions of the IRA - formerly known as the Build Back Better Act - on three occasions.\nThree days after voting for the IRA, Manchin wrote to Forrest asking why Energy Harbor had not heard from \nFortescue to finalise the transaction.\n\"[Energy Harbor executive] Jay Bellingham with Pleasants Power Station says he hasn't heard anything from your \nteam in two weeks concerning the sales agreement with you, please reach out and let me know, thank you, Joe \nManchin,\" said a copy of Manchin's message to Forrest on July 30, 2022.\nThe original $US135 million offer lobbed by Fortescue in May 2022 was downgraded to about $US50 million in July \n2022, much to the displeasure of Bellingham.\nVesey told the court in December that he was involved in a call with Forrest, Manchin and Bellingham as they \nattempted to solve disagreements over the deal. At the time, Vesey said Forrest was reluctant to take on the cost of \nrehabilitating land at the coal assets.\n\"Andrew [Forrest] said, 'we're not cleaning up their mess and that's their responsibility', and Joe Manchin talked to \nJay Bellingham and agreed with Andrew and said 'it's not their [Fortescue's] responsibility to clean it up, it's yours', \nand that was fundamentally the end of the call,\" Vesey said.\nFortescue planned to buy the plants and convert them to produce clean hydrogen, which can be burned as a fuel \nor used as a chemical catalyst.\nNegotiations with Energy Harbor came amid a frenetic three-year period when Fortescue was striking scores of \npreliminary agreements for clean energy projects around the world.\nVesey told the court that Forrest had targeted West Virginia - a big coal-producing state - so he could demonstrate \nto the world how carbon-intensive economies could be retrofitted to thrive on cleaner industries.\n\"The opportunity in West Virginia was important to demonstrate we could go into a heavily [coal] dependent state, \ntake a ... coal asset that was operating, close it down, turn it into a green hydrogen facility, continue to provide the \neconomic benefits to those employees in that community and to have the political support of the two senators and \nthe governor at that time,\" he said.\n\"The fact that Joe Manchin supported and took a high-risk political position of supporting a conversion of a coal \nplant ... we thought we should participate in making this a reality.\"\nIn May 2022, Forrest's close relationship with Manchin was cited by Browning as one of the reasons Energy Harbor \nhad selected Fortescue as its preferred bidder, despite the company not being the highest bidder.\n\"We will now move into exclusive negotiations. I'm sure your visit and Senator Manchin's support were important to \ntheir decision,\" Browning wrote in an email sent to Forrest and other executives on May 17, 2022.\nFortescue's $US135 million preliminary offer to Energy Harbor had not been disclosed to any sharemarkets at the \ntime of the May 2022 email, but regardless, Browning suggested to Forrest that he should let Manchin know that \npreferred bidder status had been secured.Page 3 of 3\nForrest's $200m bid to 'influence' senator\n\"You might want to drop a note to the senator. Something like 'Joe, in confidence I want to let you know that we \nrecently submitted our bid for Pleasants and Sammis power plants and Energy Harbor has accepted it and informed \nus that we will now move into exclusive negotiations. Your interest and support made all the difference and I thank \nyou.',\" Browning said in the same May email to Forrest and other Fortescue executives.\nOn July 10, 2022, Hunt, who at the time was Fortescue's chief commercial officer for the North American energy \ndivision, wrote to Vesey, Browning and former Fortescue executive Felicity Gooding about the fact Fortescue had \nlowered its offer to Energy Harbor from $US135 million to about $US50 million.\nHunt implied that Fortescue would have driven a harder bargain were it not for its desire to foster a relationship \nwith Manchin. \"If it were not for the Manchin angle, I'd be advocating for taking an aggressive stance, but I think that \nwe need a wider view on the decision,\" Hunt wrote.\nFortescue declined to comment.\nManchin announced in November 2023 that he would not seek re-election, and is now an adviser at Bondi Partners, \na lobbying firm run by former federal treasurer Joe Hockey, and Apollo Global Management.\n\"Connecting businesses to West Virginia has been a top priority because our state has always been, and must \ncontinue to be, a powerhouse for America's future,\" Manchin said when asked about the transaction.\n\"I am proud of the work we did in passing the IRA to strengthen America's energy independence. Today, we are \nproducing more fossil and renewable energy than at any point in our history. I have remained steadfast in my \ncommitment to an all-of-the-above energy strategy - one that embraces every resource at our disposal while \nensuring economic growth and national security.\n\"I have always believed that hydrogen is one of the most promising clean fuels for the future, and as we continue to \nadvance and mature the technology, it has the potential to play a major role in our energy landscape.\"\nManchin and Forrest eventually dropped their support for the IRA.\nFortescue said in February that it was considering pausing its hydrogen projects, including a $US550 million \nhydrogen refuelling station it was building in Arizona.\nLoad-Date: March 9, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
