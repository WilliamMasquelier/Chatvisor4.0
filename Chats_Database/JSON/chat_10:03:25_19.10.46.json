Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 13\nLength: 542 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nFiona Hick has joined the board of gold and copper producer Evolution Mining in her first major career move since \nleaving Fortescue after just six months as chief executive of its iron ore division.\nMs Hick is considering at least one other non-executive director role as her career enters a new chapter after a \nbruising experience at Fortescue.\nAs a board member she will become a member of Evolution's risk and sustainability committee, and is expected to \nbecome a non-executive director at a second ASX-listed company within the next few weeks.\nMs Hicks has not spoken publicly since her abrupt departure from Fortescue in August, announced on the same \nday as the company's full-year results.\nFortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest said at the time that her departure - announced shortly after a major \ncelebration in the Pilbara to celebrate the company's 20th anniversary - was \"friendly and mutual\".\nDays later Dr Forrest claimed Ms Hick had not fully supported his reinvention of the iron ore miner as a green \nenergy producer and had faced a choice to \"get on the bus, or get off the bus\".\n\"What we have now is literally a galloping herd of people who want to see this company go green. So if you want to \nstep outside that, you're given a choice,\" the billionaire businessman said.\nEvolution executive chairman Jake Klein said Ms Hicks was \"a highly regarded executive and her depth of \nexperience, and skills will complement those of our existing directors and further enhance the board\".\nPerth-based Ms Hick has held senior roles with Rio Tinto and Woodside Energy over a 29-year career in the \nresources industry. She was also president of the West Australian Chamber of Minerals and Energy between 2021 \nand 23 and in that job pushed the industry to tackle sexual assault and harassment problems.\nPage 2 of 2\nEx-Fortescue chief joins the Evolution board\nAt Woodside, she held leadership positions in the areas of health, safety and environment, strategy and planning, \nand engineering, and was executive vice president of the oil and gas giant's Australian operations when she left to \ntake on the top job at Fortescue.\nMs Hick recently joined the Evolution board on visits to the company's Cowal and Northparkes mines. She said the \nvisits \"reinforced my view of the quality of the people and assets within the company\".\nEvolution acquired a majority stake in the Northparkes copper and gold mine in Central Western NSW from China \nMolybdenum Company for $720 million last year. Metals Acquisition Corp had also bid on the mine, while ASX-\nlisted Sandfire Resources had considered an offer.\nCMOC has owned Northparkes for almost a decade, paying Rio Tinto $US820 million for its 80 per cent stake in \nDecember 2013. It started to test the market for the 29-year-old asset earlier this year as BHP closed in on its $9.6 \nbillion acquisition of OZ Minerals.\nEvolution shares fell 6.5\u00a2 yesterday to close at $3.42.\nMs Hick joined Fortescue in February 2023 and was tasked with keeping the iron ore operations firing, sorting out \nthe problematic Iron Bridge magnetite project, decarbonising mining, starting iron ore production in Gabon, and \ndeveloping a critical minerals division.\nHer departure last August made her the 10th senior executive to leave Fortescue in three years; others have exited \nover the past 11 months.\nLoad-Date: July 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's executive chairman | \"What we have now is literally a galloping herd of people who want to see this company go green.
