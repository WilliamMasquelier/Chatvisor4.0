Shell's rival BP similarly paused biofuels investment at US and German \noil refineries recently.\nShell expects to write down between $US600m and $US1bn on the asset, while the impairment after the sale of its \nSingapore refinery is expected to be $US600m-$US800m.\nIn addition, Europe's largest energy company expects trading results from its integrated-gas segment, usually its \nlargest profit centre, to be lower than in the first quarter, when the unit booked $US3.68bn in adjusted earnings, due \nto seasonality.\nHowever, it expects the unit's results to match those of the second quarter last year, when it booked $US2.5bn in \nadjusted earnings - a metric that strips certain commodity price adjustments and one-time charges.\nThe company also narrowed the segment's liquids and natural-gas production outlook slightly upward to 940,000- \n980,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day for the quarter, from a previously guided range of 920,000- 980,000 BOE a \nday.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell warns of $3bn impairment\nShell, the world's largest liquefied natural gas trader, expects its quarterly LNG volumes to be between 6.8 million \nand 7.2 million tonnes, compared with the prior-year's 7.2 million tonnes.\nThis would mean a decline from the first quarter's 7.6 million tonnes. However, gas prices in Europe have rallied in \nrecent months on strong demand in Asia amid heatwaves and outages limiting supply, potentially providing a boon \nto Shell's quarterly results.\nOn the upstream side - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - Shell is expecting the unit to produce between \n1.72 million and 1.82 million BOE a day ready for sale, versus 1.70 million a year prior and 1.87 million in the first \nquarter. In the first quarter, the segment garnered $US1.93bn in adjusted earnings.\nLoad-Date: July 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Shell warns of $3bn impairment\n## The Australian\n### Christian Moess Laursen\n### July 08, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Shell, to report.

Shell anticipates a post-tax impairment of up to $US2 billion ($3 billion) primarily due to the suspension of its biofuels plant construction in Rotterdam and the divestment of its chemicals refinery in Singapore, reflecting challenges in the European energy market.\n\n2. The decision to pause the biofuels project is attributed to weakened market conditions, particularly a significant drop in US renewable fuel-credits prices, which has also affected competitors like Neste and BP.\n\n3. Shell's integrated-gas segment, typically its largest profit center, is expected to report lower trading results compared to the previous quarter, although it may match the earnings from the same quarter last year.\n\n4. Despite a projected decline in quarterly LNG volumes, Shell could benefit from rising gas prices in Europe due to increased demand in Asia, which may positively impact its financial results.\n\n5. On the upstream side, Shell's production outlook for crude oil and natural gas is slightly improved, with expected output between 1.72 million and 1.82 million BOE per day, indicating a cautious optimism amidst broader market challenges.",
