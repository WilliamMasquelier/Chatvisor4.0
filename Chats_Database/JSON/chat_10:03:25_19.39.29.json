Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: PROPERTY; Pg. 31\nLength: 635 words\nByline: Larry Schlesinger\nBody\nAustralia's biggest sheep station, Rawlinna, has been listed for public sale for the first time since being developed in \nthe 1960s by veteran grazier Hugh MacLachlan - after mining magnate Andrew Forrest abandoned plans to acquire \nit for a renewable energy project.\nSpanning 1,046,323 hectares - about the size of Greater Sydney - Rawlinna Station, about 400 kilometres east of \nKalgoorlie, has a carrying capacity of almost 70,000 sheep and is considered a \"wool powerhouse\". It shares its \nborder with the Trans Australia train line running from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie and is a stop on the Indian Pacific \nluxury train route. The Australian Financial Review's Street Talk column revealed in April last year that Fortescue \nhad entered into a conditional contract with the MacLachlan family's Jumbuck Pastoral to purchase the station's \npastoral lease and continue to run it as a sheep operation while developing a renewable energy project. The \nacquisition was conditional on approval from the West Australian government.\nA Fortescue spokeswoman confirmed the company was no longer proceeding with the acquisition of Rawlinna \nStation. \"We have been waiting for ministerial approval of the transfer for 11 months. Following this extended \nperiod, with policy ambiguity remaining regarding government approval, we have chosen to withdraw from the sale \nof Rawlinna, which was always a long-term energy opportunity for Fortescue,\" said the spokeswoman.\n\"Fortescue remains committed to pursuing long-term green energy opportunities in the Nullarbor and south-east \nWA region via alternate arrangements.\"\nJumbuck Pastoral has now appointed Elders to sell Rawlinna via a staged expressions-of-interest process \ncommencing this month. Price expectations are understood to be above $20 million for the land (excluding \nlivestock).\nMr MacLachlan, a relative of former AFL chief executive and new Tabcorp boss Gillon McLachlan, discovered the \nsite for the sheep station in the mid-1950s as he was travelling from South Australia to Perth on the Indian Pacific.\nWhen the train stopped at a remote siding called Rawlinna, he observed that it had good quality underground water \nand saw the potential for a vast sheep operation across the vast open saltbush, bluebush and grass plains.\nPage 2 of 2\nKey sheep station on sale\nMr MacLachlan first placed a survey peg in the ground in the 1960s. Through careful planning and substantial \ninvestment, he turned it into the largest sheep station in Australia and an iconic property in the livestock sector. \nAmong its standout features is a 400-kilometre boundary fence.\nRawlinna is part of 136-year-old Jumbuck Pastoral, one of the country's biggest sheep and beef producers. \nJumbuck still controls vast agricultural landholdings despite the MacLachlans splitting up their rural empire last year \nfollowing the departure of brothers Jock and Callum from the business.\nFollowing the breakup, Mr MacLachlan and his daughters Airlie MacLachlan, Islay McKenzie and Brooke Yates \nretained Blina Station in WA, Bulgunnia Station and Commonwealth Hill in SA, and Gunbar Station in NSW, as well \nas Rawlinna.\nJock MacLachlan took charge of McCoys Well Station in South Australia and Derby Station in Western Australia \nwhile Callum retained Wave Hill Station and Killarney Station in the NT.\n\"This represents a rare opportunity to acquire Australia's largest sheep station during a period of unprecedented \ngrowth in demand for quality Australian fibre and protein,\" said Elders executive general manager of network Tom \nRusso.\n\"The station is strategically located to give access to both the western and eastern markets and is a powerhouse of \nwool production, having carried up to 69,000 sheep in recent history. The short-term opportunity is immense as \nRawlinna has benefited from an outstanding season and is very conservatively stocked presently.\"\nLoad-Date: November 6, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\nNone\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
