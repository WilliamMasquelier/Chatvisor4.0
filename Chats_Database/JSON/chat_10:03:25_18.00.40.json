Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: CHANTICLEER; Pg. 40\nLength: 1254 words\nByline: Mark Di Stefano and Myriam Robin\nBody\nMost of the attention around the government's gambling ad reforms is focused on what appears on TV. And look, \nno one likes settling in for Friday night footy and finding out their eight-year-old has memorised Sportsbet slogans.\nEveryone knows there will be new some types of restrictions on advertising announced soon, covering both TV and \nonline. But what about the entirely new generation of gambling content that slips through the cracks, and in fact, is \nnot considered advertising at all?\nTake Dabble, the self-described Millennial bookmaker that has taken a lot of the social usability of Facebook and \nmashed into a betting account. Customers place bets like any other bookie, but they also set up social media \nprofiles and follow each other.\nOne way it rapidly grew was relying on real Facebook pages and automated chatbots to lure (mostly) men with free \ntips if they signed up for accounts.\nThen there was ex-AFL player Heath Shaw who joined as an investor. He did wonderful things, like when he posted \na video promoting Dabble in a male mental health Facebook group that discussed things such as depression, \nanxiety and suicide.\nRed flags? Pish posh. Tabcorp sensed an opportunity. The ASX-listed wagering giant under now-ousted chief \nAdam Rytenskild was struggling with the youth market, so the company invested $33 million into Dabble for a 20 \nper cent equity stake in 2022. Last year, Tabcorp's investor relations general manager Terry Couper joined \nDabble's board.\nCashed-up - and with a new veneer of respectability - Dabble keeps growing.\nTake the case of Benny Scarf, whose online videos have turned him into a star. In his videos, Scarf tells his \n\"punnas\" he'll place 5\u00a2 for every Instagram follower he has on a \"best bet\" (being a short-priced favourite). At day \n82, he's got more than 184,000 followers, so the clips show him flashing wads of $100 bills, walking into his local \nTAB, and bantering while he puts down $9000 punts, often on fringe country races on a weekday.\nPage 2 of 3\nRear Window Tabcorp's youth bookie has its own viral star\nNext he's watching the race in his living room, sometimes swinging a golf club, screaming at his runner to come \nhome. He loses his marbles if he loses, and like the best viral videos, it's fun stuff! But yes, sure, make no mistake, \nit's promoting degenerate problem gambling.\nIt's made him into the industry's version of an influencer. In his recent video from the track, he's mobbed by \nstrangers wanting selfies with him. One follower recently asked what everyone was thinking under a recent video: \n\"Does anyone know how Benny is funding this?\"\nWould you believe he's getting money from Tabcorp's Dabble? It gives him a fee for all the followers who use the \nlink in his bio, or by entering his name at sign-up.\nIt's affiliate marketing, and in some cases online bookmakers are known to share the losses of a customer with the \nperson who referred them. Dabble did not return a request for comment, and neither did Scarf.\nSo, take a step back. An online bookmaker part-owned by Tabcorp is giving money to someone who films viral \nvideos of himself spending thousands of dollars a day in a TAB. And because he doesn't explicitly promote a \ncompany in the video, well, it's not \"advertising\" is it? No legal disclaimers. Just a customer acquisition funnel \nstrapped to Instagram's rocket algorithm.\nOne recommendation many skipped over in late Labor MP Peta Murphy's inquiry was banning \"commissions being \npaid to staff or any third party involved in the referral\" of gambling services. That would make the gambling \ninfluencer business less lucrative.\nLast week, new Tabcorp boss Gillon McLachlan used this masthead to say all staff were being told to return to the \noffice five days a week. Scarf reacted to the news, writing sarcastically: \"Bad guys in turmoil.\"\nOh, Benny. If only everyone got to spend their office hours down at the TAB.\nFortescue puts words\nin Rio's mouth\nGrandiose claims are not uncommon for Fortescue's Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest. But when his mining company \nannounced a $3 billion contract with German mining manufacturer Liebherr, it was someone else singing his \npraises.\n\"Fortescue's partnership with Liebherr marks a turning point in the history of the mining industry,\" the release \nquoted Rio Tinto chief Jakob Stausholm as saying. And he didn't stop there, further praising the \"foresight and \ncourage\" of \"first mover Fortescue\", with the consolation that \"while we can't always be first, we can be fast \nfollowers\".\nIf any Rio Tinto shareholder thinks their usually understated chief executive is sounding a lot like Forrest, well, \nthey'd be right.\nTurns out it was Fortescue operatives who drafted and suggested the quotes to Rio Tinto, which never approved \nthem despite them being sent to journalists shortly after 7am yesterday.\nThe erroneous release was withdrawn 90 minutes later, with Fortescue telling journalists the quotes were \n\"mistakenly included\". But no hard feelings. Stausholm, who had indicated he was open to some public comment, \ninstead wrote on Fortescue's LinkedIn post later in the morning, lauding the company for a \"significant\" agreement \nthat constituted a \"bold step\".\nSo, what do we make of this, besides the inadvisability of not getting exceedingly generous quotes duly signed off? \nWell, it's instructive in once more revealing the breadth of Fortescue's ambition. Not only does it aim to mine \nwithout carbon emissions (the Liebherr trucks will not run on diesel), but it hopes for the broader industry's \nwholehearted praise and gratitude for leading the way.Page 3 of 3\nRear Window Tabcorp's youth bookie has its own viral star\nThis is even as Forrest, in the same release, lashed said industry majors for their lack of leadership, lamenting with \nall the certainty of an Old Testament prophet how \"the time of others persuading you that greenwashing is a better \nreturn to shareholders and your community is over\".\nIs this the best way to convince others to join Forrest's crusade? One may as well hope for the heavens to open \nand bestow a permanent halo atop Twiggy's forehead, a voice ringing out and proclaiming celestial approval of his \nmission. We wouldn't count on it, but hey, a man can dream.\nPwC chairman sells\npublishing business\nNew PwC chairman John Green has been a banker and a lawyer, as well as the proprietor and chairman of his own \nfamily-run publishing business.\nAll three careers are now drawing to a close, the last with the sale of the Green family's Pantera Press to Hardie \nGrant, due to be completed at the end of this month.\nProminent Pantera authors include political journalist Simon Benson, media entrepreneur Tim Duggan, and \niconoclastic political activist Nyunggai Warren Mundine. And then, there was John Green himself, who as well as \nchairing the family business, has through it released a series of financial thrillers.\nSome suggest an imagination not ill-placed in considering how, for example, wonky consultants could knowingly or \ninadvertently bring an organisation to its knees.\nConsider the blurb for The Trusted, released in 2013 and focused on financial terrorists keen on destroying Wall \nStreet \"from the inside\".\n\"What if the people we trust most are those we should trust least,\" the author asks. What indeed.\nGreen's author biography notes he stopped working as a banker two years before the global financial crisis, \n\"enough of a lag so no one could accuse him of starting the whole mess\". It also notes his status as an \"aficionado\" \nof \"magic and mentalism\".\nWe can't think why board recruiters don't regularly require such skills. Just think how familiarity with sleight of hand \ncould have helped the previous members of PwC's governance board.\nLoad-Date: September 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
