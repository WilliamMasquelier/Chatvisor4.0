Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: OPINION; Letters; Pg. 35\nLength: 676 words\nByline: Michael Woodley\nBody\nFor the past 15 years, my community in the resource-rich Pilbara region has been engaged in a David and Goliath \nbattle against Fortescue, which has mined without our free, prior and informed consent and without a native title \nland use agreement, despite having our rights affirmed by the High Court of Australia.\nWe are often asked why the Yindjibarndi are so determined to battle a mining giant that can engage in limitless \nlawfare against Aboriginal people with meagre resources.\nWe fight because we owe it to our ancestors and future generations to ensure that Yindjibarndi people's long, hard \njourney to prove our legal rights under the Native Title Act is seen and respected, and because the law must lead to \nconsequences if a proponent chooses to disrespect First Australians.\nWe are proud of what we have accomplished over the past 10 years without having an agreement with Fortescue. \nAny visitor to the bustling mining town of Karratha can't help but notice the dozens of vehicles owned by our \ncontracting business, Yurra. This business, founded in 2013, has grown to employ more than 430 people working in \ndiversified sectors, including contracts with Rio Tinto, Woodside and the City of Karratha. We have also established \ncultural organisations that promote and preserve our traditions for the benefit of our young and to share with non-\nIndigenous Australians.\nThe Yindjibarndi have achieved all this despite the absence of a native title agreement with Fortescue for its \nSolomon Hub mine - which operates on our land and has generated more than $80 billion in revenue since 2013.\nOur main source of income is a rail tariff paid by Rio Tinto from a modernised agreement signed in 2022. This is the \nresult of a positive relationship with Rio Tinto Iron Ore on an Indigenous Land Use Agreement that was executed in \ngood faith.\nOur renewable energy business, Yindjibarndi Energy Corporation, has breathtaking plans to drive the \ndecarbonisation of the Pilbara through projects that could generate up to three gigawatts of green energy in coming \ndecades. YEC's projects are some of the most advanced Indigenous-led developments in Australia.\nPage 2 of 2\nWhy we're still fighting Goliath Talking point\nYEC is the result of a joint venture with the global green energy player ACEN, and our agreement allows the \nYindjibarndi people to take an equity share of up to 50 per cent in projects. Our people have already benefited \ndirectly by taking part in heritage and environmental surveys that are required for all government approvals.\nWe also want to invest in our majority-owned Yindjibarndi Water, which is looking at alternative groundwater \nsupplies to the Millstream aquifer, water treatment initiatives for YEC and support for carbon farming and \nagricultural pursuits.\nWith fair compensation for the impact of mining on our Ngurra (country), the Yindjibarndi people will be in a strong \nposition to achieve even greater results in the decades to come.\nNext week, the Federal Court will hear final submissions in a case that the Yindjibarndi people initiated. This flowed \non from our 2020 win in the High Court, which affirmed our exclusive native title possession over the land where \nSolomon Hub operates.\nThe respondents in this case, the state of Western Australia and Fortescue, both agree that we are entitled to \ncompensation, though we disagree on how much.\nAt the heart of the case is whether the courts should take a real-world view and award compensation based on the \ntypes of agreements that fair-minded corporations have reached with traditional owners. We certainly think this \nshould be the case.\nEconomic compensation based on this approach, plus reparations for the damage to heritage, spiritual values, \nenvironment and social disruption, are before the courts and perhaps that will set the bar on native title agreements. \nThis is why our legal team believes our Federal Court case is arguably the most significant litigation brought by an \nIndigenous community since Eddie Mabo's case in 1993.\nMichael Woodley is the CEO of the Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation, the plaintiff in the Federal Court \ncase.\nLoad-Date: February 15, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Michael Woodley | CEO of the Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation | \"We fight because we owe it to our ancestors and future generations to ensure that Yindjibarndi people's long, hard journey to prove our legal rights under the Native Title Act is seen and respected, and because the law must lead to consequences if a proponent chooses to disrespect First Australians.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
