Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 18\nLength: 620 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nFortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest and oil and gas producer Woodside Energy have emerged as \nunlikely allies in the fight over legislative changes they say are threatening hydrogen projects in the United States.\nThe two biggest Perth-based companies on the ASX have found common ground in lobbying against plans by US \nTreasury officials to restrict the availability of tax credits for hydrogen developments through the Biden \nadministration's Inflation Reduction Act. Both companies had counted on access to those incentives to underpin \ntheir US hydrogen ventures.\nDr Forrest has warned the provisions, known as 45V, threaten to \"kill off\" Fortescue's $US550 million ($836 million) \nhydrogen project in Arizona. Woodside has similar concerns about its H2OK project in Oklahoma, a key plank in the \ncompany's decarbonisation strategy.\nIn a submission to officials in the US, Woodside has warned that instead of incentivising hydrogen production, 45V \nwould add costly requirements that are \"virtually impossible to meet\". Woodside has committed more than $100 \nmillion in procuring equipment for H2OK.\nOf particular concern for Woodside and Fortescue is a requirement that requires companies accessing tax credits \nto match each hour of production to an hour of renewable power consumption. The rule is designed to ensure \nsubsidies are not given to hydrogen made from fossil fuel power during times when solar and wind power are \nunavailable.\nWoodside's H2OK plan involves using electricity from Oklahoma's power grid to run electrolysers to produce liquid \nhydrogen. It would source renewable energy certificates to offset the emissions from the non-renewable power \nincluded in that supply.\nFortescue also plans to use renewable energy certificates in Arizona.\nWoodside wants the US to instead offer annual - rather than hourly - matching. Hourly matching raises the spectre \nof having to shut down plants when wind and solar power is unavailable to maintain tax credit status.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue, Woodside allies on green hydrogen\nIn a submission to the government, Woodside said: \"Switching to hourly matching would require the procurement of \nthe type of electrolyser that can ramp up and down in response to intermittent renewable electricity. These issues \nwill increase costs, resulting in an increased levelised cost hydrogen in an already challenging macroeconomic \nenvironment.\"\nWoodside is pushing for annual matching to apply to hydrogen projects that start construction before the end of \n2027 and 10-year grandfathering of annual matching for first-movers.\nIn a similar submission, Fortescue is pushing for annual matching to apply for projects that start production before \nthe end of 2028 and 10-year grandfathering. Fortescue says it is \"difficult to have confidence\" in the feasibility of its \nproject without changes to the 45V proposal.\nSpeaking this month in Buckeye, Arizona, where Fortescue plans to build its hydrogen project, Dr Forrest claimed \nthat lobbyists for big oil and gas producers were behind the draft provisions in 45V.\nHe has previously criticised Woodside, Australia's biggest oil and gas producer, and its chief executive Meg O'Neill, \ndescribing her as \"hard-edge trained by the biggest liar we've ever seen around climate change over the last 40 \nyears, and that's ExxonMobil\".\n\"Can we please look at the fact that Meg is driving an agenda to get carbon bombs going as quickly as possible,\" \nhe said in an incendiary interview last year. He separately told the ABC that fossil fuel executives should have their \nheads \"put on spikes\", and said Ms O'Neill was \"peddling poison\".\nWoodside accused Dr Forrest of using \"violent imagery\" and resorting to \"personal vitriol\". \"Such language sets a \nterrible example for public debate and should be condemned,\" it said.\nLoad-Date: May 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"Dr Forrest has warned the provisions, known as 45V, threaten to 'kill off' Fortescue's $US550 million ($836 million) hydrogen project in Arizona.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"Fortescue says it is 'difficult to have confidence' in the feasibility of its project without changes to the 45V proposal.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
