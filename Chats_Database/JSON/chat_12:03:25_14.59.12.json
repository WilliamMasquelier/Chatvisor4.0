Delays in approvals and higher costs of construction have \nslowed the rollout of big renewable energy projects despite plenty of interest from global investors.\nThe Coalition has proposed a network of nuclear power stations as the best way to move away from fossil fuel as \ncoal plants shut. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton will use a speech in Sydney today to again pitch nuclear power as \na long-term renewable energy solution, hitting back at an attack on the plan last week by Energy Minister Chris \nBowen.\nWhile conceding nuclear power will have a \"significant upfront cost\", Mr Dutton will claim that the 80-year lifespan of \neach plant means they will outlast renewable electricity sources many times over. He will not, however, release any \ncostings.\nPage 2 of 3\nRules put transition at risk: Shell; Exclusive\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese, however, is banking on mechanisms which incentivise the development of wind \nand solar projects to hit targets. That, the government says, can be supported by gas to ensure supply if demand \nsurges.\nShell has long criticised the investment climate for gas. Ms Wake pointed to duplication between state and federal \nenvironmental approvals and \"ambiguous\" requirements on Indigenous consultation as some of the reasons for \ndelays and higher costs.\nBut she said similar hurdles were now evident for wind and solar projects, putting at risk private investment needed \nto underpin the move away from fossil fuels.\n\"If we're going to reach net zero by 2050, for Australia to really thrive through the energy transition, we're going to \nneed not one wave of investment, but a second, a third, a fourth, multiple waves of investment and what that \nrequires is successful delivery of projects,\" she said. \"We need a really harmonised set of regulatory settings so that \nwe can deliver projects - whether they're in the gas or the renewables or firming space - predictably and deliver the \nlowest cost, most reliable, lowest-emissions energy.\"\nLondon-listed Shell is one of the country's biggest energy players. It owns the Queensland Curtis LNG venture at \nGladstone, one of the state's three large gas export projects. It owns gas power and solar plants, the ERM Power \nelectricity retailer, which sells to business, and household energy retailer Powershop.\nIn the west, its portfolio includes the Prelude floating LNG plant, a stake in Chevron's Gorgon LNG venture, and a \nsmall holding in Woodside Energy's North West Shelf.\nMs Wake said the Australian business represented \"quite a powerful microcosm\" of a \"balanced\" energy transition, \nbut added that funders of these projects had \"choices on where to go\", signalling Shell could look elsewhere if \ninvesting became too difficult.\nThese issues were raised by Clean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton in a speech earlier this month, \nwhen he described environmental and planning rules for wind farm development as \"not fit for purpose\" and one \nreason for a difficult year in 2023, when few decisions were made on whether to proceed with big projects.\nThe Clean Energy Council, which represents major renewable energy developers, has warned that a big increase in \ncommitments for generation projects will be needed by the end of December to reach the level of work needed to \nhit government targets.\n\"We should have big expectations for the second half of this year,\" said Mr Thornton. \"As a nation, we didn't do a \ngreat job of preparing for this complex transition. So we now need to draw on every ounce of tenacity to confront \nthese challenges.\"\nMs Wake said the transition away from fossil fuel needed plenty of capital, urging governments to \"leave the \npopulism and the ideology and the party politics to one side and really get behind what is in Australia's best \ninterests\".\nMs Wake pointed to Shell's Crux LNG project in Western Australia as one that suffered from the fallout from the \nlitigation over Indigenous consultation at Santos' Barossa gas project in the Timor Sea and Woodside's \nScarborough LNG project.\nThe $3.6 billion Crux project, which was approved in 2022, is intended to supply replacement gas for Prelude LNG \noff the north-west coast. She said Shell had had to significantly broaden and lengthen consultation, taking in talks \nwith 18 traditional owner groups even though none of the project infrastructure will come onshore.\n\"It felt to me like an example of additional complexity that added delay and costs to projects without delivering a \nsignificantly better outcome for traditional owner groups, and in fact, put a huge burden on them,\" she said of the \nproject.Page 3 of 3\nRules put transition at risk: Shell; Exclusive\nShell's clean energy portfolio in Australia has almost 1.5 gigawatts of renewable generation and storage, including \na 49 per cent interest in developer WestWind Energy, the Gangarri solar farm in Queensland, a battery in the NSW \nRiverina, and the Rangebank battery south-east of Melbourne, which is due online later this year.\nBut it has a bigger pipeline of projects, including a big battery at Wallerawang in NSW and a smaller storage project \nin WA's Wheatbelt region.\n\"There's another bit over a gigawatt of other battery projects that are there in the pipeline, so if we hit a permitting or \na contracting roadblock on one of them, we can shuffle the deck in terms of the sequence,\" Ms Wake said.\nIn all, Shell aims to have 4GW of renewables and storage operating by 2032.\nLoad-Date: September 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Rules put transition at risk: Shell; Exclusive\n## Australian Financial Review\n### Angela Macdonald-Smith\n### September 23, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Shell, to report.

Shell's chairwoman, Cecile Wake, highlighted that a \"dysfunctional and enormously complicated\" regulatory system in Australia is hindering the transition to clean energy, jeopardizing the country's ability to meet its 2030 climate targets.\n\n2. The company faces significant challenges in both gas and renewable energy sectors due to overlapping state and federal regulations, which have led to delays and increased costs for major projects, including Shell's own Crux LNG project.\n\n3. Shell's investment strategy in Australia is at risk as the company may consider redirecting its capital elsewhere if the regulatory environment does not improve, indicating a potential shift in focus for future energy investments.\n\n4. The Clean Energy Council has echoed Shell's concerns, stating that current environmental and planning rules for renewable energy projects are inadequate, which has resulted in a lack of progress on large-scale developments necessary to meet government targets.\n\n5. Shell aims to expand its renewable energy portfolio to 4GW by 2032, but the company emphasizes the need for a harmonized regulatory framework to facilitate multiple waves of investment across both gas and renewable sectors to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.",
