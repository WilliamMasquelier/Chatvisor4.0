Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 19\nLength: 411 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nWest Australian gold producers are poised to capitalise on their riches by turning to mergers and acquisitions \naccording to Deloitte, whose annual stocktake of WA-based companies found gold a rare bright spot in a year of \nvalue destruction for critical minerals.\nCompanies exposed to green metals and headquartered in the west lost an aggregate $23 billion in market \ncapitalisation in 2023-24, the professional services firm found.\nThe winners were gold miner Red 5, up by 273 per cent as of June 30, Emerald Resources (up 90 per cent) and \nRamelius Resources (up 76 per cent).\nBroadening the field to the top 100 WA companies captures gold play Spartan Resources, which jumped 626 per \ncent, and copper and gold explorer FireFly Metals (up 545 per cent).\nRuling off a year to forget were Hancock-backed lithium producer Liontown Resources down 65 per cent, Delta \nLithium (down 57 per cent), Lynas Rare Earths (down 13 per cent), Iluka Resources (down 41 per cent) and nickel \nand lithium producer IGO (down 63 per cent).\nDeloitte audit and assurance partner Dave Andrews said commodity price volatility made WA mining ripe for deals.\n\"There is a clear linkage between M&A priorities and the energy transition. We can expect it to continue to dominate \nthe M&A landscape, but not in isolation, with the gold industry bringing together regional asset portfolios and \nbuilding operational scale,\" he said.\nThe string of gold deals in the past 12 months has spanned Red 5 and Silverlake, Ramelius and Musgrave, \nEmerald and Bullseye, and Genesis and Dacian.\nWestgold completed its $2.5 billion merger with Toronto-listed Karora last week to create a mid-tier gold producer.\nMr Andrews said Ramelius, which has done seven deals in six years, was \"at it again\" grabbing a near 18 per cent \nstake in Spartan.\nPage 2 of 2\nBig gains turn miners' eyes to M&A Returns\nSpeaking after Ramelius released June quarter results last week, chief executive Mark Zeptner said his company \nwould take a wait and see approach on Spartan and its Never Never discovery.\n\"Whilst we'd like to have Never Never in our portfolio, we actually look at it as a nice to have, rather than a need to \nhave,\" he said at the time.\nRamelius' $87 million spending spree on Spartan stock came after revelations Ramelius had been in takeover \ntalks with Westgold late last year and that the two gold producers had agreed to a 12-month \"mutual standstill\".\nWestgold moved on through the Karora merger. The sector is aiming to fill the void left by Newmont's acquisition of \nNewcrest Mining.\nLoad-Date: August 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**ENTITY**: [Organization Name]\n**TYPE**: [Type of organization - e.g., Company, Government Agency, NGO, etc.]\n**DESCRIPTION**: [Brief description of how the entity is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**ENTITY**: Tesla, Inc.\n**TYPE**: Company\n**DESCRIPTION**: Main subject of article, discussing Q4 earnings report\n\nOnly include entities that are meaningful to the article's content.
