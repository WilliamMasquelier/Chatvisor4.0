So, gold is very much a contrarian investment in the current market.\" Mr Judd said \nasset allocation to gold was currently running at les than half its historical long-term average.\n\"This shows there is significant gold demand potential which could manifest into real demand should the sentiment \nof Western investors towards gold turn positive,\" Mr Judd said.\n\"In our view, this is likely to occur when there is more conviction that central banks will ease monetary policy.\" Citi \nhas also rerated its short and midterm gold price forecasts to $US2200 an ounce and $US2300 an ounce \nrespectively, against $US2165 an ounce currently.\n\"We would favour owning gold - both outright and against silver - heading into a sluggish GDP and rate cut \nenvironment,\" Citi said in a note to clients.\nPage 2 of 2\nThree winners singled out from extended gold rush - DATA ROOM\n\"Gold prices should also be supported by US dollar weakness on the eventual Fed pivot and strong physical \ndemand.\" Ramelius on Tuesday said it was \"well-placed to execute quickly on transactions\" should they present \nthemselves, \"utilising reliable due diligence methodology with a match-fit team\".\nIt pointed to seven assets it has bought and integrated over the past six years as proof of this. Red 5 is the largest \nholding in The Victor Smorgon Partners Resources Gold Fund, and Mr Judd said its recent merger with Silverlake \nResources and entry into the ASX 200 was likely to underpin a rerating in the stock.\nLoad-Date: March 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**ENTITY**: [Organization Name]\n**TYPE**: [Type of organization - e.g., Company, Government Agency, NGO, etc.]\n**DESCRIPTION**: [Brief description of how the entity is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**ENTITY**: Tesla, Inc.\n**TYPE**: Company\n**DESCRIPTION**: Main subject of article, discussing Q4 earnings report\n\nOnly include entities that are meaningful to the article's content.
