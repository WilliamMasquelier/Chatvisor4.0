Shell previously expected LNG volumes of 6.7 million-\n7.3 million tonnes.\nGains from integrated gas trading are expected to be significantly higher quarter-on-quarter, while the trading result \nfrom chemicals and crude oil refineries is seen to be significantly lower. The former segment was expected to make \nan adjusted earnings loss, the company said.\nHowever, the expected uptick in fourth-quarter gas trading comes despite declining oil and gas prices throughout \nthe period, with oil hitting a five-month low in early December, reflecting supply and demand concerns despite \nsupport from geopolitical uncertainty.\nUpstream production - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - is expected to meet the guided range of 1.75 \nmillion to 1.95 million BOE a day at 1.83 million to 1.93 million a day. It reported 1.75 million BOE a day in the third \nquarter.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell takes earnings hit of up to $7.7bn in quarter\nElsewhere, Saudi Aramco said it would cut crude prices to all regions, including its largest market in Asia - a move \nthat comes amid weaker global oil prices and increased production by producers outside the Organisation of the \nPetroleum Exporting Countries.\nAfter a summer rally attributed in large part to Saudi Arabia's decision to implement a production cut of one million \nbarrels a day on top of existing cuts by other members of OPEC and its allies, including Russia, crude fell sharply in \nthe fourth quarter. Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ have extended cuts into 2023.\nWest Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, fell more than 21 per cent in the fourth quarter of the calendar \nyear to post a 2023 decline of 10.7 per cent. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell around 19 per cent in the fourth \nquarter to lose 10.3 per cent in 2023.

Shell reported fourth-quarter earnings impairments between $US2.5bn and $US4.5bn, primarily due to macroeconomic factors and strategic portfolio decisions, particularly concerning its Singapore chemicals and products assets.\n\n2. Despite the earnings hit, Shell's integrated gas production is expected to meet its targets, with projected production volumes between 880,000 and 920,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, consistent with previous guidance.\n\n3. The company anticipates a significant increase in gas trading profits, which contrasts with lower trading results from chemicals and crude oil refineries, indicating a mixed performance across its business segments.\n\n4. Shell's cash flow from operations is expected to be negatively impacted by a $US900m charge related to emissions payment timing, highlighting ongoing financial pressures linked to environmental compliance.\n\n5. The broader oil market context shows declining prices, with West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude experiencing significant drops in the fourth quarter, which may affect Shell's future pricing strategies and profitability.",
