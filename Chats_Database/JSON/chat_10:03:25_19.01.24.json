Ltd.\nSection: DOMESTIC NEWS\nLength: 514 words\nDateline: LISMORE April 8\nBody\n  For almost 20 years, Yindjibarndi people of the Pilbara have been battling iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group, \nthe company founded by billionaire Andrew Forrest.\n   Some traditional owners say the rifts between family and community members caused by the dispute may never \nheal.\n   The long-running native title fight is back in the Federal Court on Monday after years of legal action.\n   The case will finally determine whether Yindjibarndi native title holders should be compensated for Fortescue \nmining on their land for years without agreement.\n   A Fortescue spokesperson said in a statement the company was committed to seeing the matter settled and was \nprepared to pay compensation.\n   But in court documents the company contends the amount should \"not entitle a claim for royalties calculated by \nreference to the value of iron ore at the FMG tenements or any rent or royalties paid by FMG to the State\".\n   \"The question that must be answered is: what is the value of the native title rights and interests held by the YP \n(Yindjibarndi people) that have been lost, diminished, impaired or affected?\"\n   In 2017, the Federal Court recognised the Yindjibarndi had exclusive possession over the area of land where \nmost of FMG's Solomon mine is located.\n   FMG's Solomon hub, made up of the Firetail, Kings Valley and Queens Valley iron ore mines, together have an \nannual production range of 65 to 70 million tonnes.\n   When Fortescue began planning the Solomon hub it started negotiating with the Yindjibarndi Aboriginal \nCorporation (YAC), whose members including Stanley Warrie conducted heritage surveys for the project, thinking \nthat would mean protection of important sites.\n   The relationship began to sour in 2007 when Yindjibarndi people realised FMG could legally destroy their sacred \nsites and was doing so in construction of the mine.\nPage 2 of 2\nWA:Yindjibarndi compensation case returns to court\n   When YAC refused to accept FMG's royalty offer, the miner gave financial backing to a break-away group, Wirlu-\nMurra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation, which paid people $500 each to attend a meeting that voted in favour of \nthe deal in 2010.\n   \"The split between YAC and WYAC has changed everything ... some of the young people go against each other \nfrom each side, fighting in the streets,\" Mr Warrie told the court in an on-country hearing in April 2023.\n   \"We try to tell them 'No, we don't go about it this way' and we try to do the right thing but I don't think we will ever \nbe able to bring peace back to the community.\n   \"FMG has caused this split.\"\n   FMG says social disharmony isn't compensable and the company did not cause it.\n   Since mining began at Solomon in 2013, FMG has shipped iron ore reportedly worth about $50 billion, legally \ndestroying dozens of significant Yindjibarndi sites.\n   FMG has not paid the recognised native title holders a cent.\n   In the upcoming hearings expert witnesses will give evidence on the economic, environmental and social damage \nresulting from the mine.\n   Their exclusive native title rights over this land were affirmed by the High Court in 2020, which refused FMG \nspecial leave to appeal.\nLoad-Date: April 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
