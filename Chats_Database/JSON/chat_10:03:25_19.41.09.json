We have been waiting for ministerial \napproval of the transfer for 11 months,\" the spokesman said.\n\"Following this extended period, with policy ambiguity remaining regarding government approval, we have chosen \nto withdraw from the sale of Rawlinna, which was always a long-term energy opportunity for Fortescue.\n\"Withdrawing from the sale provides certainty for the Rawlinna workforce and the Nullarbor community in relation to \nthe current and future operations at Rawlinna.\" Fortescue said they remained committed to pursuing long-term \ngreen energy opportunities in the Nullabor and southeast WA.\nFollowing the withdrawal, Jumbuck Pastoral listed the station publicly, via a staged expression of interest campaign \nvia Elders.\nIt is understood the station is for sale bare (excluding livestock), and it is expected to attract offers greater than \n$20m.\nPage 2 of 2\nTwiggy abandons Rawlinna Station purchase\n\"The portfolio of agricultural assets that has been acquired by Jumbuck over many years of sustained investment is \ntruly extraordinary,\" said Elders executive general manager of network, Tom Russo.\n\"Whilst the divestment of Rawlinna constitutes a significant sale, in the context of their overall portfolio, this is \nmerely a refinement to better align the asset base with Jumbuck's strategy moving into the future. Jumbuck's \nintention is to continue to invest in the improvement and growth of their proudly Australian family-owned agricultural \nenterprise.\n\"Given the strategic advantages and efficiencies that can be achieved by operating an enterprise at this scale, we \nanticipate receiving offers from both large private and corporate investors within Australia and -internationally.\" \nRawlinna Station was established in the 1960s after Hugh MacLachlan sighted a remote siding called Rawlinna as \nhe was travelling from South Australia to Perth on the Indian Pacific. Last October, the 136-year-old company split \ntheir 5.2 million-hectare empire of 12 stations between brothers Jock and Callum MacLachlan and their father, \nHugh. Jumbuck Pastoral retained the 112,000ha Gunbar Station alongside the 513,000ha Commonwealth Hill and \n309,600ha Bulgunnia Station in South Australia and 254,648ha Blina Station in WA's Kimberley following the carve \nup.\nLoad-Date: November 13, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest | Mining magnate, founder of Fortescue | \"Fortescue is no longer proceeding with the acquisition of Rawlinna Station.
