The orders allowed it to carry out surprise \nraids on the houses of Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen to seize millions of files for their case following what \nthe Element Zero personnel described as \"unprecedented\" surveillance.\nMr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk challenged the initial decision to grant Fortescue the search orders, but \nFederal Court judge Brigitte Markovic dismissed their application.\nA Fortescue spokesman reiterated a previous statement about the case: \"Fortescue will vigorously defend \nElement Zero's attempt to have the decision of the court overturned,\" he said.\n\"Two Federal Court judges have found a strong prima facie case that the Element Zero parties misused \nFortescue's confidential information and breached its rights.\n\"Fortescue remains committed to protecting its intellectual property and investment in green technologies, and \nlooks forward to progressing the matter to a final trial.\" The Element Zero team has lodged an appeal against \nJustice Markovic's decision to allow the search orders.\nShe had found Fortescue failed to inform the primary judge about a series of meetings that took place involving the \ntwo companies and a subsequent nondisclosure agree-ment that was signed by Mr Masterman.\n\"The primary judge erred in failing to set aside the search orders made by the duty judge on 14 May, 2024 \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 after \nfinding there was a material nondisclosure by Fortescue when making their ex parte application,\" the appeal \napplication says.\nPage 2 of 2\nElement Zero appeals against raid decision\n\"The primary judge ought to have set aside the search orders, in whole or in part.\" Justice Markovic found that it \nwas not \"Fortescue's intention to mislead the court\" and there was no misuse of the search orders as alleged.\nBut Element Zero disagrees, and its application also says the judge erred because Fortescue did not disclose that \nDr Kolod-ziejczyk had been instructed to work from home after he gave his notice to quit.\nThe application said that as a result, Dr Kolodziejczyk worked on his personal devices and communicated with \nFortescue colleagues - including sending them documents containing the work he was doing.\n\"The primary judge erred in exercising a discretion not to set aside the search orders,\" the application states. \nElement Zero said it was not right to form the view that Fortescue had a strong prima facie case and the material \nnon-disclosure would not have changed the court's decision.\nJustice Markovic made those observations in her judgment, when she chose to not set aside the search orders.\nJustice Markovic also said in her judgment that Element Zero failed to explain why the Fortescue case was \nunwarranted.\nElement Zero said Justice Markovic erred in her reasons not to dispel the orders when she found there was a lack \nof utility in doing so, and when Fortescue could apply for the search orders to be made again and independent \nexperts had already filed their reports.\nMr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk have asked the court to allow their appeal and an order that the search orders \nbe -dismissed.\nAn Element Zero spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday, but previously said the original search orders \nwere carried out \"after unprecedented surveillance of Element Zero employees and strangers by private \ninvestigators\". \"(This) represented massive overreach by Fortescue,\" he said.\nLoad-Date: November 27, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Michael Masterman | Co-founder of Element Zero | \"This represented massive overreach by Fortescue.\" | N.A. |\n| Bart Kolodziejczyk | Co-founder of Element Zero | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n| Bjorn Winther-Jensen | Co-founder of Element Zero | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
