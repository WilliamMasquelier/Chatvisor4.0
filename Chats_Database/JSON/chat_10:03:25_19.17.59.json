Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 17\nLength: 771 words\nByline: Andrew Tillett and Brad Thompson\nBody\nThe Albanese government is sticking with its plan to dole out billions in taxpayer-funded handouts for green \nhydrogen despite Fortescue scaling back ambitious production goals and axing 700 jobs.\nBillionaire Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest's abandonment of plans to produce 15 million tonnes of green \nhydrogen by 2030 has sparked questions over the government's subsidies and tax credits to get the industry off the \nground as part of its Future Made in Australia agenda.\nOpposition energy spokesman Ted O'Brien said Fortescue's decision had \"blown a gaping hole\" in the \ngovernment's energy plans and, coupled with gas shortages, put energy security at risk. \"The collapse of this \nproject is symptomatic of Labor's failing all-eggs-in-one-basket 'renewables only' plan which is eating away at \nAustralia's energy future,\" Mr O'Brien said.\n\"Despite offering billions in taxpayer funds these projects are still failing to get off the ground. If increasing gas \nsupply was critical yesterday, it is absolutely essential today as the hopes that green hydrogen can play a role in \nsupporting supply fades. We remain optimistic about the success of hydrogen in the long-term playing a role in our \nfuture energy mix, but we will not follow Labor's mistake.\"\nWhile Dr Forrest is the highest-profile advocate for green hydrogen, the government points out he was not the only \nplayer, with more than 100 clean hydrogen projects in Australia, including 13 already operating and 17 under \nconstruction.\n\"Australia has more than 50 companies actively progressing renewable hydrogen project investment, making our \ncurrent clean hydrogen pipeline amongst the largest globally, valued at more than $225 billion,\" Climate Change \nMinister Chris Bowen said.\n\"This underpins strong collaborative relationships with export partners who are keen to receive Australia's green \nhydrogen in coming years.\nPage 2 of 2\nPM stays with hydrogen despite Fortescue retreat\n\"Green hydrogen will be one of the best ways Australia can decarbonise domestic heavy emitters and help develop \nrobust low carbon manufacturing, and industry.\n'The government is committed to working alongside commercial interests to deliver on this potential.\"\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese insisted his government's energy plan remained on track.\n\"We want to make sure that we deliver the clean energy that Australia needs and that when coal-fired power \nstations close, as they've announced their closure, there isn't a gap in the energy security that Australia needs,\" he \nsaid. \"That's why we need a real plan that's fully costed, and that's being rolled out with the certainty being provided \nfor investment.\"\nClimate Energy Finance director Tim Buckley said Dr Forrest was not alone in betting big on green hydrogen as \npart of the energy transition but costs had, in fact, gone up instead of following the usual pattern of better \naffordability for clean technology such as batteries, solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\"Twiggy went way too hard, way too fast and way too hyped about hydrogen,\" Mr Buckley said.\n\"Australia put out like 50 per cent of the world's press releases of hydrogen in the last five years but none of them \nhave come to fruition.\"\nWith Australian coal and gas exports to decline as the world decarbonises, Mr Buckley expressed doubt green \nhydrogen would be able to fill the void, pointing out the first ship capable of transporting chilled hydrogen at scale \nwas at least 10 years away.\nHe said green hydrogen's value was helping Australian resources companies to pivot to value-adding, such as \nprocessing critical minerals and producing strategic metals such as green steel.\nThe Superpower Institute, led by Rod Sims and Ross Garnaut, has warned it will be difficult for Australia to become \na major player in green iron production without a green hydrogen industry.\nThe institute estimates the annual export value of green iron to be $295 billion, or three times the current value of \niron ore exports.\n\"Green aluminium exports could be worth an additional $60 billion, compared with the current value of bauxite and \nalumina exports of $10 billion,\" it said in a report now sitting with the Department of Industry.\nMr Sims argues the government should double down on the hydrogen production tax incentive by introducing \ncapital grants of 50 per cent or equivalent tax credits for the first movers who build green iron plants.\nThe former ACCC boss had no issue if that meant Fortescue qualified for green iron support on top green \nhydrogen handouts.\n\"He could be helping Australia to start a $300 billion industry,\" Mr Sims said. \"And yet, if we don't help him, he won't \ndo it. So this isn't just money for someone who's going to do something anyway.\"\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
