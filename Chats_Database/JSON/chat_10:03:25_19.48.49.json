Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Chairman of Fortescue | \"the most stupid deal I have seen for a long while.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Chairman of Fortescue | \"in itself makes me wonder deeply about the commercial nous of Paul Browning.\" | N.A. |\n| David Hunt | Former Chief Commercial Officer of Fortescue | \"Fortescue would make a solo bid for the assets, rather than continue with the joint bid.\" | N.A. |\n| Paul Browning | Former President of Fortescue's North American clean energy unit | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue Energy Boss | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n| Andy Vesey | Former AGL Energy Chief Executive, replaced Paul Browning | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
