To get out \nof that awkward era as soon as possible is the responsibility for any good government,\" Dr Forrest said.\n\"Any government of Australia which goes out of its way to annoy its biggest customer is probably going to stop \nbeing that customer's favourite supplier.\n\"You can't run around kicking your customers and still expect to sell a lot of boots.\" Dr Forrest's stake in his iron ore \nminer Fortescue Metals, whose main customer is China, has made him one of the richest men in Australia. He is \nnow driving the company to push into hydrogen and the production of \"green steel\".\nHe was also critical of Peter Dutton's recent decision to flag that he would abandon Australia's 2030 carbon-\nreduction targets if he came to power.\nHe said maintaining the goal was critical for business planning, and warned that scrapping the target could lead to \nAustralia missing out on the enormous economic opportunity around the global -energy transition.\n\"Barnaby Joyce and others know I am likely to call out behaviour which is going to be directly against the standard \nof living, the national interest, the economic growth of Australia,\" he said.\n\"Causing fear and division or claiming you can run a business, let alone a country, without targets just says to me \nyou've obviously never employed anyone, you've never created value from scratch.\" Slowing down the energy \nPage 2 of 2\n'Awkward': Forrest hails an end to 'puerile' politics\ntransition by scrapping the target, he said, would mean slowing down the economic growth opportunities associated \nwith the transition.\n\"The reason why we can drive potentially the next big economic wave, the biggest economic growth, the highest \nemployment multiplier and economic multiplier in Australia's recent history is thanks to the necessity to address \nclimate change,\" he said.\n\"There is a serious economic opportunity here for every single Australian. You wouldn't want to stand in the road of \nthat.\" The Chinese Premier's visit to Fortescue's Perth facility will centre on the efforts the company is putting into \ndeveloping hydrogen-fuelled trucks and a battery-powered locomotive it has named \"the infinity train\".\nDr Forrest will also detail Fortescue's plans to develop an Australia-China green iron supply chain. \"We have the \nleading tech in the world now,\" he said. \"I see this as a really key historical step to creating the next wave of major \neconomic growth and employment for Australia.\" Dr Forrest said this week's visit showed China too had shifted its \ndiplomatic approach. \"You can see wolf diplomacy failed, and the dip-lomacy of Premier Li is absolutely the right \nstep,\" he said. \"We've always been able to export and drive the standard of living we have in Australia. Now the last \nthing we want to do is start hurting that standard of living, hurting that economic growth, and a strong relationship \nbetween China and Australia is absolutely necessary to continue the growth of the economies of both countries.\"\nLoad-Date: June 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Chairman of Fortescue | \"Australia's attitude to China during that period was puerile and was matched only by China's response.
