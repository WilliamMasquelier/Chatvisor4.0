This represents a \n70% payout of net profit after tax.\"\nGreen energy focus\nDespite green energy losses, the company is committed to its energy transition ambitions.\n\"We're steadfastly committed to the green energy transition and making solid progress towards our goals, while \nalso maintaining the financial discipline that has made Fortescue a success for the past 20 years,\" Fortescue \nEnergy CEO Mark Hutchinson said.\n\"This year, Fortescue took our first energy projects to Final Investment Decision. We turned the soil to launch \nArizona Hydrogen, our green hydrogen project in the United States, and started work on Gladstone PEM50, a \n50MW green hydrogen project utilising Fortescue's own electrolyser technology.\n\"Our board has also agreed to fast-track two more projects, with Holmaneset in Norway and Pec\u00e9m in Brazil \nprogressing to feasibility phase.\n\"We officially opened our Gladstone Electrolyser Centre in Queensland earlier this year and started selling our \nelectrolyser systems. This technology and our other Fortescue Zero products and solutions are key to everything \nwe are doing.\n\"Not only are we using them to decarbonise our own mining operations by 2030, we're also now selling them to \nother customers, so they too can eliminate emissions.\n\"These are significant achievements, and we must continue to be focused, move fast, be agile and deliver for our \nshareholders and our customers.\" \nFinances in review\nFortescue achieved a total of 191.6 million tonnes in iron ore shipments during FY24, bolstered by robust \noperational performance across its hematite supply chain and the first shipments from the Iron Bridge project.\nThe company reported a revenue increase of 8% compared to FY23, reaching US$18.2 billion. This growth was \ndriven by an 8% rise in the average revenue from hematite, which stood at US$103 per dry metric tonne (dmt).\nThe hematite C1 cost also saw a 4% increase, reaching US$18.24 per wet metric tonne (wmt). This was primarily \ndue to higher labour rates and cost escalations related to the mine plan, though these were partially mitigated by a \ncontinued emphasis on cost control.\nFortescue's underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 7% year-\nover-year to US$10.7 billion, reflecting the revenue increase. The underlying EBITDA margin remained strong at \n59%.Page 3 of 3\nFortescue delivers net profit after tax of US$5.7 billion\nMeanwhile, the company's underlying net profit after tax (NPAT) rose by 3% to US$5.7 billion. This increase was \nmainly due to the higher EBITDA, although it was partially offset by increased depreciation and amortisation \nexpenses stemming from higher capital expenditure and the commissioning of assets, including Iron Bridge, in \nFY24.\nIt maintains a robust balance sheet, characterised by low-cost, investment-grade terms and the absence of financial \nmaintenance covenants.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the company reported a cash balance of US$4.9 billion and gross debt of US$5.4 billion, \nresulting in a net debt position of US$0.5 billion. Fortescue's credit metrics remained strong, with a gross debt to \nlast 12 months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) ratio of 0.5 times and a \ngross gearing of 22%.\nThe company also demonstrated strong cash flow performance, with net cash flow from operating activities \nreaching US$7.9 billion, a 7% increase from the previous year. Free cash flow grew by 18%, totalling US$5.1 \nbillion.\nIn FY24, Fortescue's total capital expenditure and investments amounted to US$2.9 billion. This included US$1.9 \nbillion for sustaining and hub development, US$271 million for exploration and studies, US$155 million for iron ore \nprojects, US$224 million for decarbonisation efforts, and US$317 million invested by Fortescue Energy.\nLooking forward, FY25 guidance based on an assumed FY25 average exchange rate of AUD:USD 0.68 is:\n  \n\u2022 Iron ore shipments of 190-200 million tonnes, including 5-9 million tonnes for Iron Bridge (100 per cent \nbasis);  \n\u2022 C1 cost for hematite of US$18.50-US$19.75/wmt;  \n\u2022Fortescue Metals capital expenditure of US$3.2-US$3.8 billion; and  \n\u2022Fortescue Energy net operating expenditure of approximately US$700 million and capital expenditure of \napproximately US$500 million.\nLoad-Date: August 27, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue's CEO | \"The team has delivered another year of outstanding performance contributing to the third highest earnings in Fortescue's history and free cash flow of US$5.1 billion.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue Energy CEO | \"We're steadfastly committed to the green energy transition and making solid progress towards our goals, while also maintaining the financial discipline that has made Fortescue a success for the past 20 years.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
