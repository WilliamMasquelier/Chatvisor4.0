Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 11\nLength: 1031 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nTwo of the original architects behind Fortescue's clean energy pivot believe their start-up can solve the carbon \nfootprint of the Australian iron ore industry without using the hydrogen and membrane technology being popularised \nby their former employer.\nOne of Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest's most senior lieutenants of the past 25 years, Michael Masterman, \nhas joined forces with former Fortescue chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk to create a metals processing start-up \nthat is already turning iron ore into pure iron at laboratory scale.\nDubbed Element Zero, the new company has a patented method of \"electro-reduction\" that uses an alkaline \nsolution and electric current to separate pure iron from the waste products in iron ore such as silica, alumina and \noxygen.\nMr Masterman and Mr Kolodziejczyk say Element Zero's patented process can work for the hematite ores that \ndominate the Australian iron ore industry, plus other metals such as nickel.\n\"Everything we do was developed after Fortescue and doesn't bring anything from Fortescue,\" said Mr \nKolodziejczyk.\nElement Zero is part of a rush to develop \"green iron\" technologies that could help Australian miners reduce the \nscope 3 emissions created when their customers cook iron ore and coking coal together to make steel.\nThe oxygen in iron ore combines with the carbon in coking coal during the steel-making process to make carbon \ndioxide.\nBig miners Rio Tinto, Fortescue and BHP are investigating future options to export pure iron from Western \nAustralia rather than iron ore, by removing the oxygen and other waste products.\nPure iron has traditionally been extracted from iron ore in some parts of the world using the potent greenhouse gas \nmethane, under a process called direct reduced iron.\nPage 2 of 3\nEx-Fortescue duo's green-iron play\nMiners such as Fortescue have studied whether they can make carbon-free DRI by using green hydrogen rather \nthan methane to remove the oxygen.\nBut experts have warned that converting the Pilbara iron ore industry to hydrogen DRI would be extremely \nexpensive, costing up to $30 billion and requiring the installation of enough renewables to double Australia's power \ngeneration capacity.\nHydrogen DRI also struggles to work on the hematite ores that dominate the Australian export industry.\nPart of the breakthrough at Element Zero \"is being able to show that we can process the iron ore of all the majors \nand all the magnetite miners,\" said Mr Masterman, adding that the company had trialled ore from several miners, \nincluding Fortescue.\n\"Importantly for Australia's future, because iron ore grades are coming down, our technology works very efficiently \non the currently sub-economic, sub-55 per cent iron ores.\"\nUnder Element Zero's process, iron ore is dissolved into a clear, alkaline solution that does not include water. When \nrenewable electricity is passed through the solution, the pure iron plates on to a cathode, from where it can be \ncollected for sale.\nElement Zero is commissioning a green iron pilot plant in the Perth suburb of Malaga, where 100 kilograms of iron \nore will be fed into the process each day.\nMr Kolodziejczyk received an Order of Australia in 2022 for services to hydrogen energy science.\nBut he said the lack of hydrogen in Element Zero's process was an advantage because it lowered capital costs and \nallowed for a more direct and efficient use of renewable power.\nFortescue announced last February that it had developed a method for making green iron without requiring \nhydrogen, but Dr Forrest said that breakthrough was based on Fortescue's secret membrane technology.\nMr Masterman said he believed technologies reliant on membranes would be hard to scale up, and stressed that \nElement Zero did not use membranes.\n\"If you want to build a plant that is say 5 million tonnes per year, you can't pass 5 million tonnes a year through a \nvery expensive piece of plastic,\" he said, in reference to membranes.\nMr Masterman's association with Dr Forrest goes back to the late 1990s when he was the finance boss at troubled \nminer Anaconda Nickel.\nHe later held senior roles at Fortescue, including as international projects boss, before serving as chief financial \nofficer and chief investment officer within Fortescue's Future Industries division between 2020 and 2022.\nHe was also chairman of Dr Forrest's private company Squadron Energy until late 2021; Squadron is now \nAustralia's biggest owner of renewable power assets.\nDuring their time at FFI, Mr Masterman and Mr Kolodziejczyk were among the small group that spent most of 2020 \ntravelling on Dr Forrest's private jet to more than 30 nations on the hunt for clean energy projects.\nMr Masterman said leaving Fortescue better enabled him to focus on a smaller number of projects.\n\"There became a point in time where, for me, [there were] too many time zones; let's come back and focus,\" he \nsaid. \"So I stepped back in 2022 and focused on where there are opportunities for very, very large-scale \ndecarbonisation.\"\nSome of the green iron technologies being pursued by Fortescue were developed by Mr Kolodziejczyk during his \ntime at the company, and his name is still on some Fortescue patents.Page 3 of 3\nEx-Fortescue duo's green-iron play\nAsked why he did not pursue Element Zero's electro-reduction method while working at Fortescue, Mr \nKolodziejczyk said the idea had not dawned on him until later. \"You actually had to step out of Fortescue to \nbrainstorm, ideate and develop a pathway,\" he said. \"We tested it in our garage initially to make sure it works.\n\"We can move significantly faster being a small start-up company.\"\nMr Masterman said he hoped Element Zero could have a good working relationship with Fortescue in the future.\n\"We need a broad church to be successful here,\" he said.\n\"There are enormous incentives for the major iron ore companies to solve this problem and enormous incentives for \nthe major steel companies to solve this problem.\n\"We want to be in a position, with the support of the full industry, to be able to deploy at scale quickly.\"\nElement Zero was registered with ASIC in December 2022 and raised $9 million from US venture capital fund \nPlayground Global in August.\nThe money was part of a $10 million raising that will help fund studies on a larger plant that would consume a tonne \nof iron ore per day.\nLoad-Date: January 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
