Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 25\nLength: 502 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue Energy boss Mark Hutchinson told staff he loves diversity in the workplace despite leading a religious \ngroup that advocates for heteronormative sexual values.\nMr Hutchinson issued a message to Fortescue staff on Thursday to break his silence over how he juggles his \nleadership role at religious group Alpha International with Fortescue's stated support for workplace inclusivity.\nAlpha is an evangelical Christian group which broadcasts video sermons that tell teenagers that Jesus wants to \n\"guide\" them in their sexuality, and tells them the Bible is clear about how sex should be practised.\n\"The Bible is clear about it; sex is designed for a man and a woman in the commitment of marriage,\" says Canadian \npastor Jason Ballard in one of the videos distributed by Alpha.\nMr Hutchinson declined to comment for a fortnight when asked by The Australian Financial Review earlier this \nmonth whether his leadership role at Alpha clashed with Fortescue's stated support for LGBTQ employees.\nBut Mr Hutchinson wrote to Fortescue staff on Thursday after the Financial Review published details of Alpha's \nsermons and its mission to \"re-evangelise the nations\".\n\"Our entire global workforce come from different faiths, religions and backgrounds - and what I love is our diversity \nin all of its forms,\" he wrote.\n\"I love our values and our diversity. These values guide me as CEO in everything I do.\"\nA former Fortescue staff member, who identifies as homosexual, said it was notable that Mr Hutchinson spoke in \n\"generalities\" in the message and did not directly mention LGBTQ staff members.\nThe former staff member said Mr Hutchinson's generalities were at odds with Alpha's very precise description of \nhow sex should be practised.\nPage 2 of 2\nEvangelical Fortescue head 'loves diversity' Equal opportunity\nMr Hutchinson's note to staff came on the same day that Rio Tinto struck a three-year support deal with PrideWA, \nthe LGBTQ advocacy group that cut ties with Fortescue in early 2022 after a short partnership.\nRio Tinto iron ore boss Simon Trott directly named LGBTQ employees as a group he wanted to support.\n\"As one of Western Australia's largest employers, we deeply value our LGBTQIA+ team members and remain \ncommitted to building a safe and inclusive environment where everyone can be themselves,\" he said on Thursday.\nRio will have a float in Perth's Pride Parade on November 23, and Mr Trott said close to 100 employees were \nexpected to march beside the float.\nPrideWA chief Lauren Butterly said the new deal showed that Rio \"values their LGBTQIA+ employees, as well as \nour Western Australian LGBTQIA+ community\".\nFortescue revealed on Thursday that its unit costs in the West Australian iron ore division were 12 per cent higher \nin the three months to September than at the same time last year.\nFortescue blamed the cost surge on higher than normal movements of waste rock, and signalled unit costs should \nbe lower in the months ahead.\nFortescue shipped 47.7 million tonnes of ore in the three months to September.\nFortescue's annual meeting of shareholders will be held in Perth on November 6.\nLoad-Date: October 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue Energy boss | \"Our entire global workforce come from different faiths, religions and backgrounds - and what I love is our diversity in all of its forms.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue Energy boss | \"I love our values and our diversity.
