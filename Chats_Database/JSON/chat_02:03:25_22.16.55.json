The company had been consistently increasing shareholder payouts since 2016, but due to financial struggles, it has decided to halt these payments to focus on investments without raising additional capital. This move could negatively impact investor confidence and stock performance, as dividends are a key attraction for shareholders. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company has suffered a major financial setback, reporting an EBITDA of 18.7 billion Danish kroner (\u20ac2.5 billion) for 2023, which is below its projected range of 20-23 billion kroner. A significant portion of this shortfall is attributed to a 9.6 billion kroner provision for cancellation costs related to the termination of the Ocean Wind 1 project in the U.S. This financial underperformance highlights the challenges \u00d8rsted faces in managing its offshore wind projects profitably. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has decided to cut its renewable energy project targets by at least 24%, reducing its planned capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This reduction signals a retreat from its previous ambitious expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The company is also exiting several emerging offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, limiting its future growth opportunities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company is implementing significant job cuts, with up to 800 positions being eliminated globally. The first phase will see 250 layoffs in the coming months. These job losses reflect the financial strain \u00d8rsted is under and could have negative social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s market capitalization has plummeted by more than 70% since its peak in early 2021, when it was valued at over \u20ac76.5 billion. The company, once the third-largest utility in Europe, now ranks 14th in the sector, with a market value of just \u20ac16 billion. This dramatic decline underscores the financial instability and investor concerns surrounding the company. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has incurred massive financial losses, posting around \u00a32.2 billion in losses for 2023. The company has also written off \u00a33.3 billion from its wind farm business, reflecting the severe financial difficulties it faces. These losses are largely due to the abandonment of several offshore wind projects in the U.S., which resulted in billions in impairments. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s financial struggles have forced it to scale back offshore wind projects, which could result in the construction of 1,500 fewer wind turbines than originally planned. This reduction in capacity could slow the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure and impact global climate goals. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, is stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company\u2019s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company has faced significant challenges in the U.S. market, particularly in securing tax credits for its offshore wind projects. Last year, \u00d8rsted canceled two major offshore wind projects, Ocean Wind I and II, due to rising costs, resulting in a financial hit of 28.4 billion Danish kroner (\u00a33.3 billion). These cancellations highlight the financial and regulatory difficulties of expanding renewable energy in the U.S. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for the company to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s financial troubles have led analysts to speculate that it may need to seek additional funding from investors. However, instead of raising capital, \u00d8rsted has opted for cost-cutting measures, which could prolong financial uncertainty and increase risks for the company\u2019s future stability. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to implement a drastic austerity plan, including a comprehensive review of its project portfolio. The company is prioritizing projects with the highest potential returns while reducing risks in development and execution. This shift in strategy indicates a retreat from aggressive expansion and a more cautious approach to investment. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s decision to exit key offshore wind markets, including Spain, Portugal, and Norway, as well as to deprioritize certain activities in Japan, represents a significant contraction of its global footprint. This retreat could weaken its competitive position in the rapidly growing offshore wind sector. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024] - \u00d8rsted has suffered a massive financial loss, reporting a net loss of 2.7 billion euros for 2023. This marks a significant downturn from the previous year when the company had recorded a profit of approximately 2 billion euros. The losses stem largely from the cancellation of major offshore wind projects in the U.S., including Ocean Wind 1 and 2, which resulted in impairments of 3.8 billion euros. Additionally, the company has set aside 1.5 billion euros in provisions for potential compensation payments related to these canceled projects. This financial instability raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to sustain its aggressive expansion strategy in the renewable energy sector. [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to implement drastic cost-cutting measures, including the elimination of 600 to 800 jobs worldwide. This decision is part of a broader austerity plan aimed at reducing fixed costs by 130 million euros by 2026. The job cuts will have significant social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities, further highlighting the financial strain the company is under. [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]\n\n- The company has announced a suspension of dividend payments until at least 2025, a move that could negatively impact investor confidence. \u00d8rsted had previously been a reliable dividend payer, making this decision a major shift in its financial strategy. The suspension reflects the company\u2019s urgent need to preserve capital amid mounting financial losses, but it may also deter investors who rely on dividends for returns. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s market value has plummeted by 70% over the past three years, reflecting a severe loss of investor confidence. The company, once a leader in the offshore wind sector, has seen its stock price decline sharply due to financial struggles, project cancellations, and rising costs. This decline in market capitalization raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s long-term viability and its ability to attract new investments. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]\n\n- The company has been forced to scale back its renewable energy ambitions, reducing its planned offshore wind capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This represents a significant retreat from its previous expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The reduction in capacity means fewer wind turbines will be built, potentially impacting the broader offshore wind industry. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has exited several key offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, as part of its cost-cutting strategy. This retreat limits the company\u2019s future growth opportunities and weakens its competitive position in the rapidly expanding offshore wind sector. The decision to withdraw from these markets reflects the financial pressures \u00d8rsted is facing and its need to focus on more profitable projects. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024]\n\n- The company has incurred significant financial losses due to the cancellation of major offshore wind projects in the U.S. The abandonment of Ocean Wind 1 and 2 alone resulted in a financial hit of 3.7 billion euros. These cancellations were driven by rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and higher interest rates, which made the projects financially unviable. The failure to complete these projects raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. [de Volkskrant, Marc van Den Eerenbeemt, February 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles have forced it to sell off assets worth 15 billion euros in an effort to stabilize its balance sheet. This asset divestment strategy indicates the severity of the company\u2019s financial difficulties and its need to generate liquidity. However, selling off key assets could weaken \u00d8rsted\u2019s long-term growth potential and reduce its influence in the offshore wind sector. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]\n\n- The company has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have significantly increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for \u00d8rsted to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. The combination of these factors has contributed to the company\u2019s financial downturn and forced it to reassess its investment strategy. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s leadership has been in turmoil, with its chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company\u2019s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning, further complicating \u00d8rsted\u2019s efforts to recover from its financial difficulties. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024] - \u00d8rsted experienced a leadership crisis in late 2023, with the abrupt dismissal of its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Daniel Lerup and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Richard Hunter following a disastrous financial year. The company suffered a massive loss of \u20ac2.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to high write-offs from abandoned offshore wind projects on the U.S. East Coast. This leadership shake-up reflects the severity of \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles and raises concerns about stability at the top levels of management. Frequent executive turnover can disrupt strategic planning and investor confidence. [Energie & Management, Volker Stephan, February 27, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to divest a significant stake in its U.S. onshore wind farms, selling off equity ownership in four wind farms with a total capacity of 957 MW for approximately $300 million. This marks the company\u2019s second major asset divestment in the U.S., highlighting its need to generate liquidity amid financial difficulties. While \u00d8rsted retains operational control, the sale indicates that the company is struggling to maintain its ambitious renewable energy expansion without offloading assets. Such divestments could weaken its long-term market position in the U.S. renewable energy sector. [Nordic Business Report, Anonymous, March 13, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted and other offshore wind developers faced significant financial challenges in 2023, leading to the cancellation of multiple projects in the U.S. Northeast. High inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising costs of capital and building materials made these projects financially unviable. These cancellations represent a major setback for \u00d8rsted\u2019s U.S. expansion strategy and could slow the overall growth of offshore wind energy in the country. The inability to complete these projects raises concerns about the company\u2019s financial resilience and its capacity to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. [The Independent, Jennifer McDermott, March 14, 2024] There are no negative issues found related to \u00d8rsted in the provided articles. - \u00d8rsted has decided to exit the French renewable energy market by selling its wind and solar assets to Engie. This move is part of a broader strategy to scale back its ambitions and focus on markets where it sees higher value potential. However, this retreat from France signals financial distress and a lack of confidence in its ability to compete in the region. The company had already suffered a significant financial loss of 2.7 billion euros in 2023, largely due to setbacks in the U.S. market. This withdrawal could weaken \u00d8rsted\u2019s position in the European renewable energy sector and limit its future growth opportunities. [Le Figaro, Elsa Bembaron, April 29, 2024] - \u00d8rsted has decided to exit the French renewable energy market by selling its wind and solar assets to Engie.

[El Economista, Rub\u00e9n Esteller, April 29, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s stock price has plummeted by more than 50% since late 2021, reflecting a severe loss of investor confidence. The company, once a leader in the offshore wind sector, has seen its market value decline sharply due to financial struggles, project cancellations, and rising costs. This decline in market capitalization raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s long-term viability and its ability to attract new investments. The company\u2019s financial troubles have made it a less attractive option for institutional investors, further exacerbating its difficulties. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, June 01, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted was forced to cancel two major offshore wind projects in New Jersey in October 2023, citing financial infeasibility. These cancellations represent a major setback for the company\u2019s U.S. expansion strategy and could slow the overall growth of offshore wind energy in the country. The failure to complete these projects raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial resilience and its capacity to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. The company had been far along in the approval process before abruptly scrapping the projects, which may damage its reputation with regulators and investors. [The Independent, Wayne Parry, July 17, 2024] - \u00d8rsted has been forced to cancel its flagship green fuel factory, the FlagshipONE project in Sweden, due to a lack of demand for e-methanol. The project was intended to supply container ships with 55,000 tonnes of methanol annually, contributing to the global transition away from fossil fuels. However, the company was unable to secure long-term contracts at viable prices, leading to a financial impairment of 1.5 billion Danish kroner (\u00a3172 million). This cancellation highlights the challenges \u00d8rsted faces in diversifying beyond offshore wind and raises concerns about the viability of large-scale green fuel projects. The decision also reflects broader struggles in the renewable energy sector, as other energy majors have similarly scaled back ambitious projects. [Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 15, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has suffered another financial setback with a 2.1 billion Danish kroner impairment at its Revolution Wind project near Martha\u2019s Vineyard, off the U.S. East Coast. The delay in constructing the onshore substation has pushed the commercial operation date from 2025 to 2026, leading to additional financial losses. This delay follows the company\u2019s earlier cancellations of two major offshore wind projects in New Jersey, Ocean Wind I and II, which had already resulted in significant financial impairments. The repeated project delays and cancellations raise concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments efficiently and profitably. [Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 15, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to delay the start of commercial operations at its 704 MW Revolution Wind project off the U.S. East Coast by a year, now expected to begin in 2026. This delay contributes to an impairment cost of 3.2 billion Danish kroner ($472 million) in its second-quarter financial results. The postponement follows the company\u2019s earlier decision to cancel two major wind farms off the New Jersey coast, Ocean Wind I and II, due to surging costs. These setbacks, combined with \u00d8rsted\u2019s broader financial struggles, including job cuts and market withdrawals, indicate significant instability in its offshore wind expansion strategy. [The Guardian, Jillian Ambrose, August 15, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial troubles have led to a major restructuring effort, including the elimination of up to 800 jobs and a retreat from key offshore wind markets such as Spain, Portugal, and Norway. The company has also suspended dividend payments for the 2023-2025 financial years in an attempt to stabilize its finances. These drastic measures reflect the severe financial strain \u00d8rsted is under, as it struggles with rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and higher interest rates. The job cuts and market withdrawals could weaken \u00d8rsted\u2019s competitive position in the offshore wind sector and slow the global transition to renewable energy.

August \nals \u201efrustrierend und unbefriedigend\u201c. Der Markt f\u00fcr E-Fuels entwickele sich in Europa nicht so schnell wie erwartet. \nDadurch sei die Nachfrage \u00fcberschaubar, wodurch die hohen Investitionskosten sich nicht wie gew\u00fcnscht \neinspielen lie\u00dfen.\nDamit ist das Projekt \u201eFlagship-One\u201c f\u00fcr Orsted zu einer teuren unvollendeten Idee geworden. Die Anlage in \nSchweden sollte E-Fuels auf der Grundlage von gr\u00fcnem Methanol herstellen. Etwa 55.000 Tonnen davon sollten \nab 2025 j\u00e4hrlich an Abnehmer in Schifffahrt und Industrie gehen.\nDer Verlust des Jahres 2023 war ma\u00dfgeblich auf das Konto aufgegebener Offshore-Windkraftprojekte vor der US-\namerikanischen Ostk\u00fcste gegangen. Nun muss Orsted auch bei \u201eRevolution Wind\u201c Geduld beweisen. Das mit dem \nUS-Partner Eversource entwickelte Projekt umfasst einen 304-MW-Windpark f\u00fcr den Bundesstaat Connecticut und \n400 MW f\u00fcr Rhode Island. Allerdings ist der Boden f\u00fcr ein Umspannwerk belastet, was den Start f\u00fcr die \nWindfarmen von 2025 auf 2026 verschiebt.\nPage 2 of 2\nOrsted beerdigt nach Turn-around das n\u00e4chste Projekt\nLoad-Date: August 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Energie & Management\nAuthor: Volker Stephan\nDate: August 16, 2024\nTitle: Orsted beerdigt nach Turn-around das n\u00e4chste Projekt\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: ORSTED SCRAPS GREEN 'MEGA' PLANT PLANS\n## Media outlet: The Daily Mail\n### Author: Emily Hawkins\n### Date: August 16, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 1\nORSTED SCRAPS GREEN 'MEGA' PLANT PLANS\nORSTED SCRAPS GREEN 'MEGA' PLANT PLANS\nThe Daily Mail (London)\nAugust 16, 2024 Friday\nEdition 1, National Edition\nCopyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

The business, which is controlled by the Danish \ngovernment, has become one of the UK's leading developers of offshore wind, with 12 wind farms in UK waters.\nThey include Hornsea 1 and 2 off the Yorkshire coast - together comprising one of the world's largest wind farms.\nThe company produces 7pc of the UK's power and is planning further expansion including two more wind farms \nnear Hornsea and a massive floating one off Scotland. However, its ventures into new technologies and regions \nhave hit the company hard this year, with Mads Nipper, group president and chief executive of \u00d8rsted, announcing \na total of 3.9bn kroner of impairments.\nThe FlagshipONE project would have used renewable electricity to produce hydrogen that could then be combined \nwith CO2 to produce methanol.\nThe aim was to produce 55,000 tons of methanol a year, enough for one large container vessel, making it a large-\nscale pilot project.\nPage 2 of 2\nGreen fuel factory axed in net zero blow\nMr Nipper said the company had been unable to secure long-term contracts to buy its e-methanol at a viable price. \nHe said: \"The liquid e-fuel market in Europe is developing slower than expected, and we have taken the strategic \ndecision to deprioritise our efforts within the market and cease the development of FlagshipONE.\n\"We will continue our focus and development efforts within renewable hydrogen, which is essential for \ndecarbonising key industries in Europe and closer to our core business.\"\n\u00d8rsted suffered a second impairment totalling 2.1bn kroner at its Revolution wind farm project near Martha's \nVineyard, off the US east coast. Construction delays at its onshore substation are the key cause. Mr Nipper said: \n\"Despite encouraging progress on our US offshore wind project, Revolution Wind, the construction of the onshore \nsubstation for the project has been delayed.\n\"This means that we have pushed the commercial operation date from 2025 into 2026, which led to an impairment.\n\"This is, of course, unsatisfactory.\"\nThe company reported a pre-tax profit of 3.9bn kroner, up from 2.4bn kroner in the same period last year, and net \nprofits of 931m kroner.\nTancrede Fulop, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said \u00d8rsted had outperformed expectations especially in \noffshore wind, but the impairments \"underscore the impact of project delays\".\n\u00a3172m The cost of \u00d8rsted's decision to scrap the FLAGSHIPONE project in Sweden amid a lack of demand from \ncustomers\nLoad-Date: August 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Daily Telegraph\nAuthor: Jonathan Leake\nDate: August 16, 2024\nTitle: Green fuel factory axed in net zero blow\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Les carburants de synth\u00e8se tanguent face aux incertitudes \u00e9conomiques et r\u00e9glementaires\n## Media outlet: Les Echos\n### Author: Nicolas Rauline\n### Date: August 23, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 3\nLes carburants de synth\u00e8se tanguent face aux incertitudes \u00e9conomiques et r\u00e9glementaires\nLes carburants de synth\u00e8se tanguent face aux incertitudes \u00e9conomiques et \nr\u00e9glementaires\nLesEchos.fr\nvendredi 23 ao\u00fbt 2024\nCopyright 2024 Les Echos tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s\nSection: ARTICLE; Le transport maritime h\u00e9sitant\nLength: 1073 words\nByline: NICOLAS RAULINE\nHighlight: L'abandon par le danois Orsted de son m\u00e9gaprojet d'e-fuel en Su\u00e8de marque le retour \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 d'un \nmarch\u00e9 sur lequel des centaines de millions d'euros ont \u00e9t\u00e9 investis. Mais, pour les porteurs de projet de ces \ncarburants bas carbone, ce n'est pas forc\u00e9ment une mauvaise nouvelle.\nBody\nC'est l'un des premiers coups d'arr\u00eat sur un march\u00e9 prometteur. Au coeur de l'\u00e9t\u00e9, le danois Orsted a annonc\u00e9 \nl'arr\u00eat de son grand projet d'e-fuel en Su\u00e8de, FlagshipOne. Le premier du genre en Europe, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9 il y a \ndeux ans. \u00ab Nous croyons toujours au march\u00e9 des e-fuels, sur le long terme, mais l'industrialisation de la \ntechnologie, ainsi que le d\u00e9veloppement commercial ont progress\u00e9 beaucoup plus lentement que pr\u00e9vu \u00bb, a fait \nsavoir le groupe.\nLes e-fuels ou carburants synth\u00e9tiques ont pourtant suscit\u00e9 de gros espoirs pour d\u00e9carboner les transports. Ils sont \nproduits \u00e0 partir d'hydrog\u00e8ne obtenu par l'\u00e9lectrolyse de l'eau, avec une source d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 bas carbone, et du \nCO2. Avec ce processus, on peut obtenir des carburants automobiles, mais aussi du e-m\u00e9thanol, qui peut \nalimenter le transport maritime ou des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s chimiques, du e-k\u00e9ros\u00e8ne, pour faire voler les avions, ou encore \ndu e-m\u00e9thane, pour se substituer au gaz naturel, d'origine fossile. L'avantage, c'est que l'on obtient une mol\u00e9cule \nsimilaire \u00e0 celle d'un carburant traditionnel et qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de changer les \u00e9quipements - mais leurs \nd\u00e9tracteurs avancent que les carburants de synth\u00e8se rejettent aussi des gaz \u00e0 effet de serre. N\u00e9anmoins, ils en \n\u00e9mettent 70 % moins que les carburants d'origine fossile, selon une \u00e9tude de l'ONG Transport & Environnement.\nLe transport maritime h\u00e9sitant\n\u00ab Les march\u00e9s sont \u00e0 des degr\u00e9s de maturit\u00e9 diff\u00e9rents, explique Jean-Philippe H\u00e9raud, responsable du \nprogramme biocarburants et e-fuels \u00e0 l'Ifpen. Pour les carburants de synth\u00e8se, le march\u00e9 existe d\u00e9j\u00e0, il s'agit de \nprendre le relais de produits hydrocarbures pour les d\u00e9carboner. Pour du e-m\u00e9thanol, qui alimentera en partie le \ntransport maritime, le risque sera plus important, car c'est un march\u00e9 en devenir. \u00bb\nPage 2 of 3\nLes carburants de synth\u00e8se tanguent face aux incertitudes \u00e9conomiques et r\u00e9glementaires\nFlagshipOne \u00e9tait d\u00e9crit par Orsted comme \u00ab le plus grand projet de e-m\u00e9thanol en construction en Europe \u00bb. Il \ndevait permettre la production de 55.000 tonnes de e-m\u00e9thanol par an \u00e0 partir de 2025, destin\u00e9 principalement au \ntransport maritime, en utilisant de l'hydrog\u00e8ne d'origine renouvelable et du CO2r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 sur une centrale \u00e0 \nbiomasse voisine. L'investissement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 500 millions d'euros. \u00ab Les exploitants de navires ne sont \npas pr\u00eats \u00e0 accepter les co\u00fbts \u00e9lev\u00e9s du m\u00e9thanol durable, avec une marge de manoeuvre limit\u00e9e pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer \nces d\u00e9penses suppl\u00e9mentaires sur leurs clients \u00bb, r\u00e9sume S&P dans une note, estimant que le m\u00e9thanol durable \nserait deux \u00e0 cinq fois plus cher que le m\u00e9thanol d'origine fossile.\nLire aussi :\nEN CHIFFRES - Carburants de synth\u00e8se : la France place ses pions\nDECRYPTAGE - Pourquoi les e-fuels peinent encore \u00e0 convaincre\nPour Elyse Energy, qui d\u00e9veloppe trois projets de carburants synth\u00e9tiques en France, dont deux en phase d'\u00e9tudes \nd'ing\u00e9nierie dans le Rh\u00f4ne et \u00e0 Lacq (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques), la d\u00e9cision d'Orsted ne doit toutefois pas jeter le \ndiscr\u00e9dit sur l'ensemble du march\u00e9. \u00ab Ce type d'annonce est naturel dans cette phase du march\u00e9. Certains projets \npassent la barre de l'investissement, d'autres non. C'est sain et on a connu cela dans toutes les fili\u00e8res \n\u00e9mergentes, les \u00e9nergies renouvelables, le GNL ou le p\u00e9trole de schiste \u00bb, souligne son cofondateur, Benoit \nDecourt. Les projets se multiplieraient m\u00eame en France.\nLa question du prix de l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9\nReste que les d\u00e9cisions finales d'investissement sont loin d'\u00eatre prises et que de nombreux points d'interrogation \nsubsistent. En premier lieu, la stabilisation du co\u00fbt des mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res. \u00ab L'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 est la premi\u00e8re d'entre \nelles, elle peut repr\u00e9senter jusqu'\u00e0 80 % des co\u00fbts, ce qui est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent d'un actif industriel classique dans le \nsecteur, affirme Jean-Philippe H\u00e9raud. Mais la s\u00e9curisation des sources de CO2sera aussi un enjeu majeur. \u00bb La \nr\u00e9glementation europ\u00e9enne impose qu'\u00e0 partir de 2040, les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s industriels soient aliment\u00e9s en majorit\u00e9 par du \nCO2biog\u00e9nique (provenant de la biomasse agricole ou foresti\u00e8re ou contenu dans la mati\u00e8re organique du sol). Le \ncadre doit donc s'adapter, alors que le d\u00e9bat sur la biomasse bat son plein, et les projets s\u00e9curiser ces sources.\nLire aussi :\nDECRYPTAGE - Climat : 6 choses \u00e0 savoir sur les carburants de synth\u00e8se d\u00e9fendus par l'Allemagne\nLes incertitudes en France sur le prix de l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 future, avec des n\u00e9gociations qui doivent reprendre entre le \nprochain gouvernement et EDF, n'aident pas, non plus, au bouclage des projets. \u00ab La comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 des projets \nfran\u00e7ais d\u00e9pendra de leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u00e9curiser des contrats d'achat d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 bas carbone sur le long terme \u00e0 un \nprix suffisamment bas \u00bb, indique Charlotte de Lorgeril, de Sia Partners, qui dirige le bureau fran\u00e7ais des e-fuels.\nLe cadre r\u00e9glementaire, qui commence \u00e0 voir le jour sur certains march\u00e9s, doit encore \u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9. \u00ab Il y a un \nbesoin de r\u00e8gles du jeu claires et stabilis\u00e9es pour pouvoir prendre des d\u00e9cisions finales d'investissement d\u00e8s 2025 \nou 2026 \u00bb, soutient Benoit Decourt.

            "content": "- \u00d8rsted has suffered a significant financial setback, writing off over $500 million due to delays at a U.S. offshore wind farm and the cancellation of its Swedish hydrogen project, FlagshipONE. The company has been struggling financially for some time, prompting CEO Mads Nipper to implement a recovery plan that includes cost-cutting measures, exiting certain markets, selling assets, and laying off hundreds of employees. These drastic steps highlight the severity of \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial difficulties and raise concerns about its long-term stability in the renewable energy sector. [De Telegraaf, Anonymous, August 15, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to delay the completion of its Revolution Wind offshore wind project in the U.S. by a year due to construction setbacks at its onshore substation. This delay has resulted in a financial impairment of 3.9 billion Danish kroner, further exacerbating the company\u2019s financial struggles. The postponement of this project, which was developed in partnership with Eversource, raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments efficiently and profitably. [Energie & Management, Volker Stephan, August 16, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has abandoned its ambitious FlagshipONE project in Sweden, which was intended to be Europe\u2019s largest e-methanol production facility. The company cited an inability to secure long-term contracts at sustainable prices and significantly higher project costs as the primary reasons for the cancellation. This decision has resulted in a financial impairment of \u00a3172 million, marking another costly failure in \u00d8rsted\u2019s efforts to expand beyond offshore wind. The cancellation also reflects broader struggles in the renewable energy sector, as other energy majors have similarly scaled back ambitious projects. [The Daily Mail, Emily Hawkins, August 16, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s decision to scrap the FlagshipONE project in Sweden represents a major setback for the company\u2019s diversification strategy. The project was expected to produce 55,000 tonnes of e-methanol annually for the shipping industry, but \u00d8rsted was unable to secure buyers at viable prices. This failure highlights the slow development of the e-fuel market in Europe and raises concerns about the company\u2019s ability to successfully expand into new renewable energy technologies. The financial hit from this cancellation, amounting to 1.5 billion Danish kroner, adds to \u00d8rsted\u2019s growing list of impairments. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 16, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has suffered another financial impairment of 2.1 billion Danish kroner due to delays at its Revolution Wind project near Martha\u2019s Vineyard, off the U.S. East Coast. The delay in constructing the onshore substation has pushed the commercial operation date from 2025 to 2026, leading to additional financial losses. This setback follows the company\u2019s earlier cancellations of two major offshore wind projects in New Jersey, Ocean Wind I and II, which had already resulted in significant financial impairments. The repeated project delays and cancellations raise concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments efficiently and profitably. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 16, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s stock price has plummeted by more than 7% following the announcement of impairment losses totaling 3.2 billion Danish kroner (\u00a3370 million) in the second quarter due to project delays in the U.S. The company has faced setbacks with its Revolution Wind project off the coasts of Connecticut and Rhode Island, as well as impairments related to its canceled Ocean Wind project and the abandoned FlagshipONE green e-methanol project in Sweden. These financial hits indicate ongoing difficulties in executing large-scale renewable energy projects profitably, further eroding investor confidence. [Proactive Investors (UK), Josh Lamb, August 15, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s withdrawal from the FlagshipONE project in Sweden underscores the broader challenges facing the synthetic fuel market. The company had planned to invest over 500 million euros in the facility, which was expected to produce 55,000 tonnes of e-methanol annually. However, the high costs of production and the reluctance of shipping companies to pay a premium for sustainable methanol led to the project\u2019s cancellation. This failure highlights the economic and regulatory uncertainties surrounding synthetic fuels and raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to successfully diversify its renewable energy portfolio.
