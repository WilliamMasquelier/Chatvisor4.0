Victor Smorgon Group's equities team, which manages in excess of $500m in \\nfunds across its equities strategies for members of the Smorgon family and private investors out of South Yarra in \\nMelbourne, has quickly made a name for itself as a stockpicker in the resources space.\\nTwo of the seven limbs of its global multi-strategy portfolio involve a gold and decarbonisation strategy, managed \\nrespectively by Cameron Judd and Ben Salter.\\nVSG's two big commodity bets have been playing out over the past seven years in gold, and three in \\ndecarbonisation, which counts its primary exposure as copper miners.\\nJudd and Salter came into VSG from their transaction with the Stawell gold mine in Victoria, a private operation that \\nexposed the gulf between the profitability of well-run gold mines and the valuations seen in equities.\\nEven with the massive rise in prices to $US2650/oz and recent pullback after Donald Trump's election win in the \\nUS, Judd remains bullish on the fundamental outlook for gold.\\n\\\"I know we've had a decent run in price, but the fundamentals for gold are very strong and I think will continue to get \\nstronger,\\\" Judd says.\\nWhile it can hold bullion, shorts and a limited number of pre-IPO opportunities, VSG is happy going long on gold \\nequities and investing in miners over physical gold, given inflationary pressures had eased and gold miners are \\ngrowing their margins.\\nJudd says the main things VSG looks for in its gold equity portfolio are liquidity, low jurisdictional risk and especially \\ncashflow.\\n\\\"In the near term we're happy with development stories but we want to be able to see growth in the near term not a \\nlong way out,\\\" he said. \\\"One of those investments was Red 5, now Vault Minerals. We started off back in 2018, \\nlooked at all the developers at the time, and Red was the one we thought had the most meat on the bones.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nBright prospects: Why gold and copper are set to shine in the next few years\\n\\\"Developers are notoriously volatile but it had more fat in that it could absorb any hiccups along the way. That's still \\na fairly large position for us, it's definitely a lot smaller than it was, but the way it's performing now and what we \\nthink it's going to be in the next 12 months, we're still very happy with that as cash generation and that's where \\nwe've positioned the -portfolio.\\\" After a merger with Silver Lake Resources, Vault is now trading at 34c with a \\nmarket cap of over $2bn.\\nOther names that fill a similar mould include Regis Resources and Ramelius Resources.\\n\\\"A gold mine should be printing cash, especially at these margins, so that's where we're positioned at the moment,\\\" \\nJudd says. \\\"We like Regis for the moment - it printed $85m in free cash in the last quarter and it should do a similar \\nor more amount in this next quarter.\\n\\\"Then we've also got the North American exposure. Calibre Mining Corp is one of those that we like that will \\nsignificantly increase their production of gold in the second quarter, they're saying, of next year, but we think a little \\nbit earlier.\\n\\\"The CEO Darren Hall is an Australian with significant experience and we think that it's an interesting project. It's \\ngoing to keep growing but also generating good cash, fully funded with a strong balance sheet.\\\" Carbon capers The \\ndecarbonisation strategy has grown from 3 per cent of the overall portfolio weighting in the global multi-strategy \\nfund to 18 per cent today.\\nMost of that is in copper, with VSG sidestepping the opaque and volatile lithium market that surged to record highs \\nin 2022 before crashing to loss-making levels this year.\\nSubstitution from aluminium and scrap could cap hopes from red metal optimists that copper could surge beyond \\nthe $US5/lb record prices seen earlier this year to $US6, $US8 or even $US10/lb. But portfolio manager Ben Salter \\nremains cautiously upbeat that supply will struggle to keep pace with demand as the electrification trend continues.\\n\\\"We're probably conservatively bullish I would say,\\\" Salter says. \\\"I'd say the market will be balanced next year but \\ntight, so not a lot of room for error. You can look at what happened in Panama (where the government suddenly \\nclosed First Quantum's Cobre Panama mine last year).\\n\\\"It took 400,000 tonnes of copper out of the market and that had a positive impact on everyone.\\n\\\"Over time, we think with the electrification of everything \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a6 probably the use of copper in grid spending especially \\nhelped by data centres (and) China electrification, we think copper will be in demand more than can be met by \\nsupply. Over the medium to long term there's a strong case for copper prices' escalation, but not immediately or not \\nspectacularly.\\\" Salter said that should facilitate good margins for producers and developers with good projects, with \\ncurrent prices around $US9000/tonne.\\nIn Australia, VSG likes MAC Copper, which owns the soon to be 50,000 tonnes per annum Cobar mine in NSW. \\nInternationally, NGEx Minerals is on its radar. Part of the Lundin Group that recently dealt half of the Filo Del Sol \\nand Josemaria projects in Argentina to BHP for over $US3bn, NGEx owns three large copper projects in \\nArgentina's Andes.

The project is situated in a highly fertile greenstone belt with numerous gold deposits and abundant \\ngold occurrences nearby. The Coogee, Salt Creek, Daisy-Milano and Lucky Bay gold deposits, plus the major St \\nIves gold camp are specifically relevant to exploration of the project. The project tenements have undergone \\nvarying levels of exploration with the discovery of gold in the 1800's at Hogans Find. Modern exploration \\ncommenced in the 1900's by BHP who discovered the Carnilya Hill Nickel deposit. The Coogee gold deposit \\nlocated within the project tenements was discovered in the mid-1990's by Sovereign Resources and was \\nsubsequently mined by Ramelius Resources (ASX : RMS) in 2013. Ramelius mined an open cut pit \\n(approximately 70m deep) at Coogee in 2013, with reported production of 147,400 tonnes at 4.7 g/t Au for a \\nrecovered 20,400 ounces of gold. Processing was at the Burbanks Mill (conventional carbon-in-leach processing \\nfacility), south of Coolgardie with metallurgical recovery of 96.4%\\nGeology and Prospectivity\\nThe project is located in the southern part of the Norseman - Wiluna Greenstone Belt within the Parker Domain of \\nthe Kalgoorlie Terrane (Griffin and Hickman, 1988a). The project is situated in a highly fertile greenstone belt with \\nnumerous gold deposits and abundant gold occurrences nearby. The Coogee, Salt Creek, Daisy-Milano and Lucky \\nBay gold deposits, plus the major St Ives gold camp are specifically relevant to exploration of the project. The \\nCoogee Deposit is hosted within a package of intermediate to felsic volcanics and volcaniclastics, comprising \\ndacite, andesite and rhyolite lithologies. The primary mineralised zone comprises a moderately southwest dipping \\nshear zone at the contact between the dacitic crystal tuff unit and a locally porphyritic andesite flow. Gold is directly \\nassociated with pyrite, which is frequently intergrown with magnetite and high gold values coincide with increased \\npercentages of pyrite and magnetite. Magnetite rich zones have also been intersected, but without pyrite, they do \\nnot host gold mineralisation.\\nCOOGEE WEST E26/177 GEOPHYSICS RESULTS AND TARGETS\\nLocated immediately west of M26/477 the southern half of this tenement covers Lake Lefroy with the northern half \\ncontaining widows of weathered outcrop and Cenozoic cover. Historically the Exploration Licence has been \\nsporadically explored with wide spaced reconnaissance aircore drilling across the salt lake completed by Ramelius \\nwith and RC and diamond drilling completed in the north by Terrain Minerals. The tenement is covered by 50m line \\nspaced aeromagnetic data and variable gravity on 100m to 400m spaced lines with 100m stations. The magnetic \\nimagery highlights variably magnetic northwest trending mafic and ultramafic units which are intruded by granitic \\nintrusions and surrounded by sediments and intermediate to felsic tuffs. Filtered gravity provides complimentary \\ninformation to the magnetics, displaying local gravity highs over ultramafic and mafic units and gravity lows over \\nsediments and granitic intrusions. CG-04 Target Zone discrete untested circular magnetic anomaly of approximately \\n700nT approx. 1.5km west of the Coogee Pit. This represents a higher priority drill target based on the stronger \\nmagnetic response compared to the CG-01 (400nT) target zone which is known to hosts gold-copper mineralisation \\nnorth of the Coogee Pit. The top of the anomaly starts from 300 vertical metres extending down to 1km in depth - no \\ndrilling has tested this anomaly and represents a high-order drill Au-Cu target.\\nContact:\\nBrett Mitchell Paul Armstrong\\nExecutive Chairman Investor Relations\\nJavelin Minerals Limited Read Corporate\\nEmail: info@javelinminerals.com.auPage 3 of 4\\n-Javelin Minerals Limited - Compelling gold-copper drill targets identified at Coogee Gold Project\\nCompetent Persons Statement\\nThe information in this report that relates to Exploration Targets and Exploration Results is based on information \\ncompiled by Pedro Kastellorizos.

Limited All Rights Reserved\\nLength: 927 words\\nHighlight: Javelin Minerals has increased the JORC resource estimate for its Coogee gold-copper project near \\nKambalda in Western Australia by a whopping 158 per cent.\\nBody\\nJavelin Minerals has increased the JORC resource estimate for its Coogee gold-copper project near Kambalda in \\nWestern Australia's Goldfields region by 158 per cent to 3.65 million tonnes at 1.08 grams per tonne gold and 1.01 \\nmillion tonnes at 0.41 per cent copper.\\nThe company says the significant upgrade relates to a revised gold content of 126,685 ounces and was determined \\nfrom an independent review of historic estimates, assumptions and drilling. Its total supergene and primary \\nindicated resource is 963,242 tonnes at 1.31g/t gold for 40,562 ounces, while the complementary copper resource \\nadds 4133 tonnes of the red metal.\\nPrevious operator Ramelius Resources' 2022 estimate for Coogee put the resource at 1.43 million tonnes at an \\naverage grade of 1.07g/t gold for 49,034 ounces, of which 614,000 tonnes at 1.43g/t gold for 28,252 ounces lay \\nwithin the total indicated category for supergene and primary ores.\\nA key consideration in the upgrade from the previous 2022 mineral resource estimate includes an increase in the \\ndepth of the overall resource envelope, taking it from 90m below surface - the original open-pit resource limit - to \\nnow include gold and copper mineralisation down to 225m. It is a significant depth increase of 135m.\\n'The scope for growth at Coogee is clearly immense. The mineralisation is open and we have numerous compelling \\ntargets.'\\nJavelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell\\nThe new estimate also considers a jump in the assumed rate of recovery from the 96 per cent experienced during \\nprevious treatment of open-pit ores, to 96.4 per cent following metallurgical testwork by Javelin, which it says is \\nconsistent with processing figures from the previous owner's open-pit operation in 2013.\\nJavelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell said: \\\"This is a strong result which provides a solid platform on \\nwhich to build a very substantial gold inventory on the doorstep of the world-class St Ives Goldfield. The scope for \\ngrowth at Coogee is clearly immense. The mineralisation is open and we have numerous compelling targets.\\\"\\nPage 2 of 2\\nJavelin rolls out 158 per cent increase in Coogee gold\\nThe company says gold mineralisation at Coogee extends along strike for 1.2km at an average width of 350m, \\nextends to more than 225m vertically and exhibits strong potential to extend along strike to the north-west and also \\ndown-dip.\\nNews of the upgrade comes hard on the heels of Javelin's recent revelation that it had identified eight copper-gold \\nexploration targets at its Coogee project after independent and collaborative reviews of reprocessed geophysical \\nand other data. Of key significance in the present resource upgrade context is that initial interpretations of two of \\nthose targets point to a prevailing trend of north or north-westerly and down-dip extension gold mineralisation \\npotential in the area immediately north of the old Coogee open pit.\\nThe two recently-identified targets include a big untested magnetic anomaly just 300m north/north-east from the \\nCoogee open pit, which management believes could host gold-copper mineralisation.

However, Javelin says prior drilling was poorly targeted at the project and was not deep enough to follow the \\ninterpreted structures properly.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nJavelin rolls dice to replicate Spectrum, Spartan success at Eureka\\nJavelin has a theory that the old-timers were too focussed on the existing pit and given the ordinary gold prices at \\nthe time, were not motivated to spend too much money exploring the areas around it.\\nSpectrum Metals and Spartan Resources both spectacularly proved this was a mistake at their respective projects. \\nSpectrum stumbled across the Penny North gold deposit just 300m north of its old mined out Penny West open pit \\nin WA and subsequently sold the whole company to Ramelius Resources for $230m (which increased dramatically \\non settlement day as the deal involved Ramelius shares that ran hard between the announcement of the deal and \\nthe settlement of the deal). The maiden resource at Penny North was just over 300,000 ounces going a whopping \\n16.8 g/t gold.\\nMore recently Spartan employed the same near mine theory when it stubbed its toe on the 1.5m ounce Never \\nNever discovery lurking just 300m north of its mothballed Gilbey's open pit in WA's Murchison.\\nOminously, the Eureka project already has sniffs of gold 300m north of the old Eureka pit too - some of which are in \\nounce to the tonne dirt like a 4m intercept going 32.6 g/t gold from 104m. Another previous 1m hit came in at an \\nimpressive 14.72 g/t gold and notably, was from surface, demonstrating the potential range of mineralisation.\\nAbout 600m north of the old pit, Javelin has even more impressive numbers to follow up on like 4m at 135 g/t gold \\nfrom 53m and 4m grading 11 g/t gold from 42m.\\nIn fact, the entire area is littered with old drill numbers that are begging to see the drill bit again. For example, \\ndirectly under the old pit a 23m hit going 3.32 g/t gold from 112m and another 5m hit further up from 33m going an \\nimpressive 25.6 g/t gold both need more attention.\\nThere are even hints of mineralisation about 300m to the south of Eureka which include 13m at 2.22 g/t gold from \\n51m and 6m at 13.88 g/t gold from 38m.\\nWhilst some of the drill intersections that require follow up may seem remarkable in grade, they are perhaps not all \\nthat remarkable when considering the project was first mined from 1897 up to 1940 for a total 809 tonnes averaging \\na crazy 27.8 g/t gold - no doubt Javelin will be counting on some of that dirt being left behind by the old-timers.\\nNotably, Eureka is not Javelin's first rodeo and is an extension of the same near mine exploration theory it is \\nemploying at its Coogee gold project at the north end of Lake Lefroy, just east of Kambalda and about 55 km south-\\neast of Kalgoorlie.\\nThe Coogee gold deposit was discovered in the mid-1990s by Sovereign Resources next to Gold Fields' world-\\nclass St Ives gold mining complex.\\nJavelin acquired 100 per cent of the Coogee project in 2020 from Ramelius Resources and Serena Minerals for \\nequity and both companies are now major shareholders.\\nRamelius mined the Coogee open pit for gold to 70m depth until 2013, producing 20,400 ounces at a respectable \\naverage head grade of 4.7g/t gold. Ramelius subsequently became a major shareholder in Javelin.\\nThe Coogee mining lease has been a key focus for Javelin's since acquisition. The Coogee open pit and its \\nimmediate surrounds have not been subject to any systematic exploration drilling since Ramelius ended mining at \\nthe site.\\nWhen Javelin acquired the project, it contained an estimated 10,600 ounce gold resource at 3.4g/t gold which, after \\na 12-month drilling program, then jumped to 49,000 ounces at 1.07g/t gold in 2022.\\nIn August, Javelin announced the Coogee gold project hosts a recently upgraded JORC 2012 compliant mineral \\nresource amounting to 3.65 million tonnes at 1.08g/t gold for 126,685 ounces of gold and 1.01 million tonnes at \\n0.41 per cent copper for 4133t tonnes of the red metal in a separate inferred \\\"copper domain\\\", north of the old pit.Page 3 of 3\\nJavelin rolls dice to replicate Spectrum, Spartan success at Eureka\\nOnce again, modelling shows gold mineralisation extending north along strike for 1.2km at an average width of \\n350m and to more than 225m vertically under the old Coogee open pit and still open to the north and down-dip.\\nJavelin upped its drilling metreage for the greater Coogee area from 2500m to 3000m for a planned reverse-\\ncirculation and diamond drilling program set to be launched in mid-November.\\nThe decision came after the company identified several opportunities to extend known mineralisation below the old \\nopen pit and in extensions towards Coogee North and beyond to a pronounced magnetic high feature.\\nThe proposed drilling was prompted by results from Javelin's extensive reviews of reprocessed geophysical and \\nother data which had lifted Coogee's resource estimate to the current inventory figure of 126,685 ounces of gold.\\nJavelin's recent full data review and new magnetics reinterpretations and modelling have identified eight new \\ntantalising geophysical targets.\\nIt will now direct its focus toward testing five of the nearest priority walk-up targets at the Coogee mine - and also \\nnorth and west of the old mine - including a prominent and curious looking ovoid magnetic anomaly in the south-\\neast of its exploration licence, adjacent to the mining lease.\\nReview work has also identified a new 3km-long potential gold trend west of and parallel to the Coogee pit structure \\nand Javelin believes there is the potential there for a \\\"big gold-copper system\\\" that could lie at depth to the north-\\nwest.\\nJavelin says previous drillholes at Coogee North were also not deep enough to test the nearby screaming magnetic \\nanomaly which could represent a potential repetition of the historic Coogee lode and the company has earmarked \\nten drillholes for 1650m to test it.\\nSignificantly, once Javelin dials in the current Eureka gold mine resource and adds on its Coogee resource it will \\nnow have a total resource endowment of 238,700 ounces of gold in two of the best mining addresses in Australia.\\nIt is probably fair to say that Javelin has been in something of a slumber for a couple of years however since falling \\nunder the control of Executive Chairman and well known West Perth corporate finance player Brett Mitchell back in \\nFebruary, it has forged a new way forward and eked out a solid \\\"near mine exploration strategy.\\\"\\nHalf of that strategy came from a strategic review of Coogee instigated by Mitchell that ended in some screaming \\nnear mine targets that look like they are begging to be drilled.

Gold has also had double-digit returns in \\nmost other major currencies, including the Australian dollar, where it has surged by an impressive 25 per cent.\\nThese gains have been driven by investor optimism about upcoming US interest rate cuts and lingering geopolitical \\nrisks. In the past three interest rate easing -cycles in the US, the US dollar gold price has averaged an increase of \\n40 per cent.\\nDespite the gold price being near all-time high levels, gold equities have underperformed. Since August 2020, when \\nthe Australian gold equities index was at its all-time high, gold equities have underperformed the gold price by about \\n45 per cent. In our view, the potential for gold equities to catch up is a significant opportunity for investors, given the \\nfundamentals for gold remain very strong.\\nTo date, gold's performance has been due to significant buying from central banks and eastern investors who have \\nmainly acquired physical gold. In contrast, western investors, who typically favour gold mining equities, have for the \\nlarge part not participated in the gold run so far.\\nRecent figures indicate that the average investor currently holds less than 1 per cent of gold in their total portfolio, \\nwhich is significantly less than the four-decade average of 2 per cent. This is even lower than the estimated 6 per \\ncent in 1980 when the last inflation-led gold bull market occurred and the gold price reached its all-time high of \\nabout $US2850 per ounce on an inflation-adjusted basis. The potential entry of western investors and a higher gold \\nprice is likely to be a tailwind for the gold equities to rerate higher. The fight for relevance in investor portfolios has \\nbeen challenging for the gold sector versus other more favoured sectors, such as technology. Persistent cost \\npressures have negatively impacted gold miners' ability to generate free cashflow and provide an attractive return to \\ninvestors.\\nHowever, with gold prices now rising faster than inflation, cash margins are expanding. We estimate that the \\naverage cash margin for the Australian gold miners is at record levels of $1700 an ounce of gold produced. Recent \\ncompany results indicate this is being translated into financial performance, with Australian gold miners such as \\nPage 2 of 2\\nA golden opportunity as stocks trail the commodity's price\\nNorthern Star and Ramelius generating strong free cashflow, allowing them to return capital to investors through \\nincreased dividends.\\nThe relative valuation of gold miners versus the rest of the market is also attractive. Based on forward earnings \\nmultiples, Aus-tralian gold miners are trading at a 40 per cent discount to the rest of the market. In addition, the \\nmarket consensus gold price for the next 12 months is about 10 per cent lower than the current gold price of $3780 \\nin Australian dollars. Should the gold price remain at these levels for an extended period, then the market will need \\nto upgrade its forward earnings forecasts, making gold equities even cheaper. Gold miners' cashflow generation \\npotential and attractive valuation compared to the rest of the market cannot be ignored by the market for too long.\\nThe disconnect in equity performance is even more apparent in the gold developers and explorers. The \\noutperformance of developers and explorers is typically later in the cycle when investors are looking for value \\nfurther down the mine life cycle. At current discounted levels, it remains cheaper to acquire someone else's ounces \\nthan it is to discover new ounces. The potential for sector consolidation could further enhance the appeal of gold \\nminers as an investment, particularly in an environment where the price of physical gold continues to rise, and more \\ninvestors seek exposure.\\nThe Victor Smorgon Group has been well placed in gold for some time now and has capitalised on the record run of \\nthe precious metal. Our Global Multi Strategy Fund and Resources Gold Fund can invest internationally, and prefer \\nstocks that are attractively priced, operate in safe jurisdictions and are forecast to generate strong cashflow yields in \\nthe next year.

In the past three interest rate easing -cycles in the US, the US dollar gold price has averaged an increase of \\n40 per cent.\\nDespite the gold price being near all-time high levels, gold equities have underperformed. Since August 2020, when \\nthe Australian gold equities index was at its all-time high, gold equities have underperformed the gold price by about \\n45 per cent. In our view, the potential for gold equities to catch up is a significant opportunity for investors, given the \\nfundamentals for gold remain very strong.\\nTo date, gold's performance has been due to significant buying from central banks and eastern investors who have \\nmainly acquired physical gold. In contrast, western investors, who typically favour gold mining equities, have for the \\nlarge part not participated in the gold run so far.\\nRecent figures indicate that the average investor currently holds less than 1 per cent of gold in their total portfolio, \\nwhich is significantly less than the four-decade average of 2 per cent. This is even lower than the estimated 6 per \\ncent in 1980 when the last inflation-led gold bull market occurred and the gold price reached its all-time high of \\nabout $US2850 per ounce on an inflation-adjusted basis. The potential entry of western investors and a higher gold \\nprice is likely to be a tailwind for the gold equities to rerate higher. The fight for relevance in investor portfolios has \\nbeen challenging for the gold sector versus other more favoured sectors, such as technology. Persistent cost \\npressures have negatively impacted gold miners' ability to generate free cashflow and provide an attractive return to \\ninvestors.\\nHowever, with gold prices now rising faster than inflation, cash margins are expanding. We estimate that the \\naverage cash margin for the Australian gold miners is at record levels of $1700 an ounce of gold produced. Recent \\ncompany results indicate this is being translated into financial performance, with Australian gold miners such as \\nPage 2 of 2\\nA golden opportunity as stocks trail the commodity's price\\nNorthern Star and Ramelius generating strong free cashflow, allowing them to return capital to investors through \\nincreased dividends.\\nThe relative valuation of gold miners versus the rest of the market is also attractive. Based on forward earnings \\nmultiples, Aus-tralian gold miners are trading at a 40 per cent discount to the rest of the market. In addition, the \\nmarket consensus gold price for the next 12 months is about 10 per cent lower than the current gold price of $3780 \\nin Australian dollars. Should the gold price remain at these levels for an extended period, then the market will need \\nto upgrade its forward earnings forecasts, making gold equities even cheaper. Gold miners' cashflow generation \\npotential and attractive valuation compared to the rest of the market cannot be ignored by the market for too long.\\nThe disconnect in equity performance is even more apparent in the gold developers and explorers. The \\noutperformance of developers and explorers is typically later in the cycle when investors are looking for value \\nfurther down the mine life cycle. At current discounted levels, it remains cheaper to acquire someone else's ounces \\nthan it is to discover new ounces. The potential for sector consolidation could further enhance the appeal of gold \\nminers as an investment, particularly in an environment where the price of physical gold continues to rise, and more \\ninvestors seek exposure.\\nThe Victor Smorgon Group has been well placed in gold for some time now and has capitalised on the record run of \\nthe precious metal. Our Global Multi Strategy Fund and Resources Gold Fund can invest internationally, and prefer \\nstocks that are attractively priced, operate in safe jurisdictions and are forecast to generate strong cashflow yields in \\nthe next year. Australian gold miners that we are attracted to include Ramelius and Red5. International gold miners \\nthat have consistently delivered include -Agnico Eagle and Alamos Gold.

Victor Smorgon Group's equities team, which manages in excess of $500m in \\nfunds across its equities strategies for members of the Smorgon family and private investors out of South Yarra in \\nMelbourne, has quickly made a name for itself as a stockpicker in the resources space.\\nTwo of the seven limbs of its global multi-strategy portfolio involve a gold and decarbonisation strategy, managed \\nrespectively by Cameron Judd and Ben Salter.\\nVSG's two big commodity bets have been playing out over the past seven years in gold, and three in \\ndecarbonisation, which counts its primary exposure as copper miners.\\nJudd and Salter came into VSG from their transaction with the Stawell gold mine in Victoria, a private operation that \\nexposed the gulf between the profitability of well-run gold mines and the valuations seen in equities.\\nEven with the massive rise in prices to $US2650/oz and recent pullback after Donald Trump's election win in the \\nUS, Judd remains bullish on the fundamental outlook for gold.\\n\\\"I know we've had a decent run in price, but the fundamentals for gold are very strong and I think will continue to get \\nstronger,\\\" Judd says.\\nWhile it can hold bullion, shorts and a limited number of pre-IPO opportunities, VSG is happy going long on gold \\nequities and investing in miners over physical gold, given inflationary pressures had eased and gold miners are \\ngrowing their margins.\\nJudd says the main things VSG looks for in its gold equity portfolio are liquidity, low jurisdictional risk and especially \\ncashflow.\\n\\\"In the near term we're happy with development stories but we want to be able to see growth in the near term not a \\nlong way out,\\\" he said. \\\"One of those investments was Red 5, now Vault Minerals. We started off back in 2018, \\nlooked at all the developers at the time, and Red was the one we thought had the most meat on the bones.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nBright prospects: Why gold and copper are set to shine in the next few years\\n\\\"Developers are notoriously volatile but it had more fat in that it could absorb any hiccups along the way. That's still \\na fairly large position for us, it's definitely a lot smaller than it was, but the way it's performing now and what we \\nthink it's going to be in the next 12 months, we're still very happy with that as cash generation and that's where \\nwe've positioned the -portfolio.\\\" After a merger with Silver Lake Resources, Vault is now trading at 34c with a \\nmarket cap of over $2bn.\\nOther names that fill a similar mould include Regis Resources and Ramelius Resources.\\n\\\"A gold mine should be printing cash, especially at these margins, so that's where we're positioned at the moment,\\\" \\nJudd says. \\\"We like Regis for the moment - it printed $85m in free cash in the last quarter and it should do a similar \\nor more amount in this next quarter.\\n\\\"Then we've also got the North American exposure. Calibre Mining Corp is one of those that we like that will \\nsignificantly increase their production of gold in the second quarter, they're saying, of next year, but we think a little \\nbit earlier.\\n\\\"The CEO Darren Hall is an Australian with significant experience and we think that it's an interesting project. It's \\ngoing to keep growing but also generating good cash, fully funded with a strong balance sheet.\\\" Carbon capers The \\ndecarbonisation strategy has grown from 3 per cent of the overall portfolio weighting in the global multi-strategy \\nfund to 18 per cent today.\\nMost of that is in copper, with VSG sidestepping the opaque and volatile lithium market that surged to record highs \\nin 2022 before crashing to loss-making levels this year.\\nSubstitution from aluminium and scrap could cap hopes from red metal optimists that copper could surge beyond \\nthe $US5/lb record prices seen earlier this year to $US6, $US8 or even $US10/lb. But portfolio manager Ben Salter \\nremains cautiously upbeat that supply will struggle to keep pace with demand as the electrification trend continues.\\n\\\"We're probably conservatively bullish I would say,\\\" Salter says. \\\"I'd say the market will be balanced next year but \\ntight, so not a lot of room for error. You can look at what happened in Panama (where the government suddenly \\nclosed First Quantum's Cobre Panama mine last year).\\n\\\"It took 400,000 tonnes of copper out of the market and that had a positive impact on everyone.\\n\\\"Over time, we think with the electrification of everything \\u00e2\\u20ac\\u00a6 probably the use of copper in grid spending especially \\nhelped by data centres (and) China electrification, we think copper will be in demand more than can be met by \\nsupply. Over the medium to long term there's a strong case for copper prices' escalation, but not immediately or not \\nspectacularly.\\\" Salter said that should facilitate good margins for producers and developers with good projects, with \\ncurrent prices around $US9000/tonne.\\nIn Australia, VSG likes MAC Copper, which owns the soon to be 50,000 tonnes per annum Cobar mine in NSW. \\nInternationally, NGEx Minerals is on its radar. Part of the Lundin Group that recently dealt half of the Filo Del Sol \\nand Josemaria projects in Argentina to BHP for over $US3bn, NGEx owns three large copper projects in \\nArgentina's Andes.

The VanEck Gold Miners exchange-traded fund \\nclimbed nearly 20 per cent in 2024 versus a 38 per cent rally for the gold price in Australian dollars.\\nBut easing cost inflation that has plagued the mining sector for the last three years and an ongoing surge in prices \\nhas seen the trend reverse course. VanEck's Gold Miners ETF is up 17 per cent already this year while the Aussie \\ndollar spot price has climbed 6.3 per cent.\\nLocal fund managers are bullish that gold has much further to run after the US dollar price climbed above $US2942 \\nan ounce for the first time and the Australian dollar gold price breached $4500 an ounce.\\nVictor Smorgon Partners' Resource Gold Fund returned a chunky 13.3 per cent in January and portfolio manager \\nCameron Judd believes the valuations of ASX gold stocks still don't reflect the outlook for the yellow metal.\\n\\\"Gold's performance in times of uncertainty or crisis could see it push towards $US3600,\\\" Mr Judd said. \\\"Despite \\nthe strong gold price performance and fundamentals supporting further appreciation, gold miners are trading at \\ndiscounted valuations on the ASX.\\\"\\nWall Street's biggest banks believe a $US3000 price tag is imminent. Citi said it was possible within the next three \\nmonths, while JPMorgan has a year-end target of $US3150. Bank of America said on Thursday that gold could \\nreach $US3500 an ounce if investment demand rises 10 per cent this year.\\nThe unprecedented surge in the gold price has been fuelled by investors seeking safe haven assets as US \\nPresident Donald Trump unleashes aggressive trade and geopolitical policies. There are fears the president will \\naccelerate inflation, forcing central banks to raise rates in a way that damages global growth.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nGold funds burst out of the blocks with rocketing returns; Commodities\\nVictor Smorgon's top holdings include ASX-listed Vault Minerals and the world's largest gold miner, US-based \\nNewmont, which recently acquired Newcrest. The fund also owns Australia's biggest gold miner, Northern Star, \\nwhich agreed to buy rival De Grey in a $5 billion deal.\\nMr Judd is also expecting international companies to make further plays for local miners and explorers given the \\ncheaper valuations of ASX gold stocks, aided by a weak local currency.\\n\\\"The lower Australian dollar makes gold miners even cheaper to buy as demand for the precious metal rises,\\\" Mr \\nJudd said.\\nCollins St Asset Management is also finally starting to reap the benefits of the catch-up in gold stocks after taking a \\nstake in a basket of miners through its flagship value fund nearly two years ago. Founder Michael Goldberg said the \\nopportunity was so large that the firm launched a special situations fund in March 2023 focused solely on gold \\nstocks.\\nHe believes the sector is finally ready to realise its potential after the Collins St Special Situation Fund surged 13 \\nper cent, after fees, in January. It's up another 9 per cent so far in February.\\n\\\"I think 2025 might be the year that we see a rapid catch-up,\\\" he said. \\\"Not relying on higher gold prices per se, but \\njust a recognition by the market of the earnings potential for those companies, in particular the early-stage \\nproducers.\\\"\\nCollins St is focused on small and mid-cap companies, which have a lower cost of production, unhedged sales \\nbooks and an ability to ramp up sales and output in the near term. This includes Catalyst Metals, Black Cat, \\nWestgold Resources and Ramelius Resources.\\nArgonaut's Global Gold Fund has also shown signs of a rebound following a disappointing 2024 when the portfolio \\nreturned just 4.5 per cent net of fees. The fund stormed back in January with an 8.8 per cent return.
