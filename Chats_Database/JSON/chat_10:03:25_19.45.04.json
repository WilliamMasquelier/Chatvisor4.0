Chinese high roller junket operator \nSuncity allegedly pumped billions of dollars into Star Casino, with Star's turnover from Suncity reportedly worth \n$2.1bn, $4bn and $5.9bn for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years.\nASIC has alleged the board continued to allow the junket operator to expand its operations instead of scrutinising its \npotential organised crime links and money laundering risks.\nIn 2022, an inquiry revealed the casino stopped short of issuing Suncity a third warning letter after it was busted \nexchanging bundles of cash for casino chips, breaching anti-money laundering rules.\nInstead, Star allegedly renewed its agreement with the junket operator in 2018. Other board members Kathleen \nLahey, Richard Sheppard, Gerard Bradley, Sally Pitkin, Benjamin Heap, Zlatko Todorcevski, Paula Martin and Greg \nHawkins have been named in the lawsuit.All 11 former executives have denied the allegations.\nANDREW FORREST V ELEMENT ZERO Mining giant Fortescue managed to keep an explosive lawsuit it lodged \nagainst some former senior executives secret for a while.\nPage 2 of 2\nBIG STAKES FOR BIG END OF TOWN\nBut in June, a judgement was published that revealed Andrew Forrest's company obtained court orders to launch \nraids on the homes and offices of former Fortescue chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk, long term Forrest lieutenant \nMichael Masterman and former staff member Bjorn Winther-Jensen.\nIt was revealed Fortescue accused Element Zero of \"industrial-scale misuse\" of confidential information concerning \nits green iron technology. Element Zero denied the allegations.\nThe case continues, after Element Zero failed to appeal a decision that granted the search orders. They will file \nanother appeal to overturn that decision.\nCOLES, WOOLWORTHS DEFEND 'FAKE' DISCOUNT ALLEGATIONS Supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths \ndeny claims they misled consumers by promoting \"illusory discounts\" on hundreds of common grocery products.\nThe Australian Competition & Consumer Commission claimed products like tampons and fly spray were sold at \nregular long term prices, before they were subject to a hike of at least 15 per cent for a brief period and then \n\"discounted\" at a price higher than, or the same as, the regular price that applied before the spike.\nBoth supermarkets have denied the allegations, saying surging supplier prices and other cost increases led it to \npump up the value of the goods. The allegations were a tough initiation for Woolies new CEO Amanda Bardwell.\nTrial dates have not been set, but could be in the second half of the year.\nPRATT FAMILY FACES TWO COURT FIGHTS The billionaire Pratt family are now embroiled in two court fights \naimed at protecting their wealth.\nThe latest legal saga was launched by Heloise Pratt after she accused her ex-husband and billionaire investor Alex \nWaislitz of criminality and acting \"dishonestly\" by paying himself and his charitable foundation $1.147m without her \nknowledge and approval.\nMr Waislitz denies the allegations. The case appears to centre on control of the $1.3bn stock investment empire run \nby Mr Waislitz but also owned by Ms Pratt for more than three decades.\nIn the other matter, late family patriarch Richard Pratt's love child Paula Hitchcock secured a partial win in her bid to \nclaim an equitable slice of the family trust in October.\nThe matter has dragged on since 2022, and could do again in 2025 after Ms Hitchcock asked the court to update \nher pleadings again.\nASIC V CBUS After ASIC sued the $92bn super fund Cbus over allegations they delayed insurance payments to \nvulnerable families in November, the matter could slow down in 2025.\nASIC claimed it took more than a year in some cases for the fund - which is chaired by Labor National President \nWayne Swan - to pay out death and disabilities payments.\nIt prompted the regulator to issue the entire sector with a warning to big super that they will crack down on the $4 \ntrillion sector over failures to track end-to-end death benefits claims handling times and \"weak\" -practices.\nAccording to court updates Cbus will not be required to file a defence to the allegations until May 16 after ASIC \nlodges a full statement of claim. The case is then listed for mediation on June 23.\nLoad-Date: January 1, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
