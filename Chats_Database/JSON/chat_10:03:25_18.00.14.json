It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nWA:Community, Country 'ruptured' over iron ore mine damage\nWA:Community, Country 'ruptured' over iron ore mine damage\nAAP Newsfeed\nFebruary 19, 2025 Wednesday 4:54 PM AEST\nCopyright 2025 Australian Associated Press Pty. Ltd.\nLength: 428 words\nDateline: BRISBANE Feb 19\nBody\n  Traditional Owners are seeking $1.8 billion in compensation from iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group over \neconomic and cultural loss.\n   Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation wants $1 billion for cultural damage, while $678 million is being sought \nfor economic loss, according to documents filed to the Federal Court.\n   In their closing submission, lawyers for the Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation said the loss of Country as a \nconsequence of Fortescue's Solomon Mine Hub in the Pilbara \"is equated to a suffocation affecting country and \nindividuals as hollowness and emptiness\".\n   \"The fact that the Yindjibarndi are getting nothing for their Ngurra (Country) from this manjangu (stranger) is a \ncause of deep spiritual loss,\" Yindjibarndi lawyer Justin Edwards told the court on Wednesday.\n   The total number of sites that have been damaged or destroyed is in excess of 285, according to Yindjibarndi's \nclosing submissions.\n   On Monday, Yindjibarndi lawyer Vance Hughston said cultural sites must have an economic value, asking how \nmuch it was worth for a nation to have sites dating back tens of thousand of years.\n   \"They're the sort of things that people say are priceless,\" Mr Hughston said.\n   The Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation is also seeking compensation for specific destruction of sites and for the \ncost of healing the trauma caused by social disruption.\n   Fortescue began mining at the Solomon hub in the Pilbara in 2013 without agreement from the Aboriginal \ncorporation, instead dealing with a breakaway group.\n   Fortescue and the Yindjibarndi attempted to negotiate a Land Use Agreement for the Solomon Mine Hub, but no \nagreement was ever reached.\n   Division arose among Yindjibarndi people, including in relationship to the negotiations with Fortescue, the \nsubmission said, resulting in the formation of Wirlu-Murra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation.\nPage 2 of 2\nWA:Community, Country 'ruptured' over iron ore mine damage\n   \"Yindjibarndi people divided publicly in August 2010 over a Land Access Agreement. They have remained divided \nsince then,\" Yindjibarndi's submissions says.\n   On Wednesday, Mr Edwards described the division as a \"rupture\" in the community, which had impacted the \npractice of cultural ceremony.\n   \"They haven't been done for years now, or been done for years as a group of Yindjibarndi people, as a \ncommunity,\" he said.\n   \"The significance of those ceremonies is not just a personal significance, it's a significance, Your Honour, for the \nCountry.\"\n   \"The rupture in this community can be properly understood as a rupture in Country when that spiritual relationship \nis fully understood.\"\nLoad-Date: February 19, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
