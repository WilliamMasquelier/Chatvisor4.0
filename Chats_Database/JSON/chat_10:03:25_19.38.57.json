(Australia)\nNovember 1, 2024 Friday\nCopyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved\nLength: 359 words\nHighlight: Billionaire Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest has withdrawn from a bid to transform Australia's largest sheep \nstation into a green energy hub, blaming delays in government approval.\nBody\nMining billionaire Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest has withdrawn from a bid to purchase Australia's largest sheep station \nwith the goal of turning it into a green energy hub.\nMr Forrest's Fortescue Metals Group first indicated its intention to acquire the 1-million-hectare Rawlinna Station, \n1000km east of Perth, on the Nullarbor Plain, in April 2023.\nThe company \u2013 via its subsidiary Fortescue Future Industries \u2013 had planned to generate renewable energy on the \nhistoric station, which spans an area roughly the size of Sydney. \nBut now, about 18 months later, the ABC can reveal that FMG has walked away from the sale.\nIn a statement, a Fortescue spokesperson cited \"extended delays\" in ministerial approval as cause for the decision \nto withdraw.\n\"We have been waiting for ministerial approval of the transfer for 11 months,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"With policy ambiguity remaining regarding government approval, we have chosen to withdraw from the sale of \nRawlinna, which was always a long-term energy opportunity for Fortescue.\"\nA state government spokesperson said applications for \"significant areas of land\" were complex and required \n\"rigorous assessments\".\nThey said the Land Administration Act required the state government to be \"satisfied the transfer would not result in \na concentration of control of pastoral land as to be against the public interest\". \nPage 2 of 2\nAndrew 'Twiggy' Forrest's Fortescue Metals pulls out of Rawlinna Station sale\n\"The decision by the applicant to withdraw the application for consent was a matter determined by them,\" the \nspokesperson said. \nRawlinna Station's parent company, Jumbuck Pastoral, has been contacted for comment.\nWhat's next for Rawlinna?\nEstablished in the 1960s, Rawlinna is one of Australia's most iconic sheep stations.\nBut questions now surround its future.\nIn an online newsletter posted in July 2023, Jumbuck Pastoral said Rawlinna had been \"sold to Fortescue Future \nIndustries\".\nFortescue said withdrawing from the sale provided \"certainty\" to the Rawlinna workforce, many of whom \nwereevacuated earlier this year after record-breaking rainfallon the Nullarbor.\nFortescue said it remained committed to \"long-term green energy opportunities\" in the Nullarbor and south-east \nWA \"via alternative arrangements\".\nLoad-Date: November 1, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew 'Twiggy'
