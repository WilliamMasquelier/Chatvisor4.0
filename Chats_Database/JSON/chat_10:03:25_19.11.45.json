Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 22\nLength: 854 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nDispute A bitter falling out reveals pressure behind the transition.\nBillionaire Andrew Forrest has the Chinese Communist Party to thank for holding up the iron ore price.\nIn the 12 months since The Australian Financial Review lifted the lid on his separation from wife Nicola and the \ndivvying up of their Fortescue wealth, it appears the life of Australia's eighth-richest person has become more \ncomplicated.\nThrough all this, the iron ore price has defied forecasts: trading above $US110 ($163) a tonne in a low-growth \nworld. Iron ore's outlier status hinges on optimism about what China's leadership might do in response to its growth \ndilemma.\nThe Fortescue executive chairman's judgment is in question over revelations that private investigators hired by the \ncompany watched and photographed the families of former employees. The spying reveals a dark side to the noble \nquest to produce so-called green iron by Fortescue, which makes nearly all its money from selling iron ore to \nChinese steel mills.\nFortescue has accused key figures behind its leap into clean energy of copying and taking the company's \nintellectual property when they left to start a rival green iron business, Element Zero.\nFortescue hired private investigators to trail Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen in \nthe lead-up to raids on homes and Element Zero premises.\nThe actions, which included photographing Winther-Jensen, his wife and teenage daughter at their home in the \nPerth suburb of Scarborough, and Kolodzijczyk's wife at their Melbourne home, were revealed in an affidavit \nreleased by the Federal Court this week.\nCameras are everywhere these days but even WA premier Roger Cook has questioned if Fortescue went too far. \nForrest himself was photographed planting a kiss on the streets of Paris in May. Moroccan energy minister Leila \nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue 's green iron dreams sullied by surveillance tactics in tech row\nBenali, who is on the board of one of Fortescue's joint venture partners in a green ammonia project, later denied \nthat she was the woman in the picture.\nUnder Federal Court rules, an independent lawyer must carry out raids under privately obtained search warrants of \nthe kind granted to Fortescue.\nLawyers acting for Element Zero will seek to have the Fortescue claim they stole intellectual property thrown out. \nThey have also pointed to reputational damage suffered by the three men and say the search and seizure orders \nwere improperly obtained.\nFortescue is making no apologies and is standing by its allegations of \"industrial-scale misuse\" of its work on green \niron. Element Zero says its technology was developed independently and is very different from anything Fortescue \nhas done.\nOne-time trusted Forrest lieutenant Masterman and former Fortescue chief scientist Kolodziejczyk founded \nElement Zero in December 2022; they were part of the Fortescue team that travelled the world with Forrest in 2020 \nin the hunt for clean energy projects.\nThe green hydrogen dream remains elusive. Throughout most of last year, Fortescue maintained it would make \nfinal investment decisions on five green energy projects by December 31.\nThree were announced at the company's annual general meeting in November, and Fortescue said at the time that \nit still hoped to hit the target by the year-end. Seven months later, Fortescue remains stuck at three.\nIt was due to host Cook, other officials and the media on a site tour of its clean energy hub at Christmas Creek on \nJune 21 but cancelled the event because of heavy rain.\nThe heavens opened up days earlier when Forrest hosted Chinese premier Li Qiang at a Fortescue research hub \non the outskirts of Perth, where it is trialling hydrogen, ammonia and battery power for use in its mining machinery.\nSpeaking in May at a JP Morgan forum, Forrest talked up the prospect of a fully integrated Australia-China green \niron supply chain. He said Fortescue would produce 200 million tonnes of green iron ore annually through its \nefforts to achieve zero emissions, and Chinese manufacturers would supply the equipment and electrolysers. In the \nsame presentation, Forrest predicted Morocco would become the \"leading green molecule and green electron \nprovider\" in a transformation of the global fertiliser industry.\nMeanwhile, his US interests are getting expensive. Forrest has warned that plans by US Treasury officials to restrict \nthe availability of tax credits for hydrogen developments through the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act \nthreaten the viability of the $US550 million Arizona project, one of the three big bets. Fortescue has counted on \naccess to those incentives to underpin the US hydrogen venture.\nIn WA, where Fortescue still makes all its money, the $US3.9 billion Iron Bridge magnetite operations remain in \nneed of fixing. It was slated to produce just 2 million tonnes in 2023-24, and it remains unclear if it will ever hit a \nnameplate capacity of 22 million tonnes a year.\nAmong its issues, Iron Bridge has been plagued with high turnover. This week, Fiona Hick joined the board of gold \nand copper producer Evolution Mining in her first major move since leaving Fortescue after just six months as chief \nexecutive of its iron ore division.\nLoad-Date: July 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's Executive Chairman | \"Fortescue would produce 200 million tonnes of green iron ore annually through its efforts to achieve zero emissions.\" | N.A. |\n| Roger Cook | WA Premier | \"Even WA premier Roger Cook has questioned if Fortescue went too far.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Former Fortescue Chief Scientist | \"Element Zero says its technology was developed independently and is very different from anything Fortescue has done.\" | N.A. |\n| Bart Kolodziejczyk | Former Fortescue Chief Scientist | \"Element Zero says its technology was developed independently and is very different from anything Fortescue has done.\" | N.A. |\n| Bjorn Winther-Jensen | Former Fortescue Employee | \"Element Zero says its technology was developed independently and is very different from anything Fortescue has done.\" | N.A. |\n| Fiona Hick | Former Chief Executive of Fortescue's Iron Ore Division | \"This week, Fiona Hick joined the board of gold and copper producer Evolution Mining in her first major move since leaving Fortescue after just six months as chief executive of its iron ore division.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
