Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue co-CEO | \"We're in the middle of China changing.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue co-CEO | \"Up until now, it hasn't been economic to do it.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue co-CEO | \"Some of the sceptics still say it is not economic and 'you're wasting your time'. We don't agree with that.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue co-CEO | \"That's why we need to muscle our way back in and say 'no, our ores have a future'.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue co-CEO | \"The Australian government needs to think similarly here - China has always wanted our commodities, and the next ones are sun and wind.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
