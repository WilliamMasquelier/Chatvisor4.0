The time of others persuading you that \ngreenwashing is a better return to shareholders and your community is over.\nDr Forrest said the size of the deal was \"jaw-dropping\".\n\"It really does point the way for the future of the mining industry going zero emissions, and it points the way for \nheavy industry running out of excuses,\" he said.\n\"If these two companies are issuing their largest agreements ever, and it's 100 per cent zero emissions, then that \ntells you which way heavy industry, particularly the mining industry, is going.\n\"This is where the smart end of town is going. This is where we're leading, and we're doing it for shareholders.\" \nUnder the deal with Liebherr, Fortescue will purchase 360 autonomous, battery-electric trucks, 55 electric \nexcavators and 60 battery-powered dozers.\nThe deal is an expansion of an original agreement struck between the two companies in 2022, for 120 haul trucks.\nPage 2 of 2\nFORREST: EASY TO GO GREEN\nFortescue developed the battery technology to be used in the haul trucks and jointly developed the Automated \nHaulage Solution, with the trucks employing a robotic charging system which will avoid issues such as having to \nqueue machines for charging, the company said.\n\"All of the trucks in this fleet will ultimately be equipped with a zero emission battery power system developed by \nFortescue Zero and the jointly developed Autonomous Haulage Solution - both of which were built to be scalable \nso they can be retrofitted onto existing Liebherr haul trucks,\" the company said. \"This means that trucks purchased \ntoday are already future-proofed for tomorrow.\nThe T 264 fleet, about 360 trucks, has already begun arriving to Fortescue's Western Australian operations. On \nWednesday, Fortescue shares closed up 4.7 per cent to $18.85.\nLoad-Date: September 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
