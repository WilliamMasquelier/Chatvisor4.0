Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 625 words\nHighlight: Mining billionaire Andrew Forrest's Fortescue will slash 700 jobs, as the company tempers its ambition \nto be a major producer of the clean fuel hydrogen.\nBody\nMining billionaire Andrew Forrest's Fortescue will slash 700 jobs and merge its mining and energy divisions, as the \ncompany tempers its ambition to be a major producer of the clean fuel hydrogen.\nThe $70 billion miner announced late on Wednesday - shortly after Forrest addressed its almost 16,000 staff - that \nthe cuts would mainly hit white-collar roles.\nLink to Image\nAlex Ellinghausen\nSince 2020, Forrest has toured the world promoting the virtues of green hydrogen as an emissions-free fuel and \nseeking to partner with governments that have areas suitable for producing the vast amounts of wind, solar or \nhydropower required.\nForrest defended the high-profile quest, which involved Fortescue assessing 150 projects across the world at one \nstage in the search for cheap electricity, as a targeted effort to ensure value for shareholders.\n\"The 'scattergun' critics obviously haven't gotten a lot of new industries off the ground,\" he said.\nHowever, Fortescue's reassessment on Wednesday highlights a realisation that producing the huge amount of \nenergy required to separate hydrogen from water is extraordinarily costly.\nIt now plans to switch its focus to reducing that cost. Forrest said it would enable the company to compete \"blow \nfor-blow\" with \"fossil fuel peddlers\".\nIn recent years, Forrest has set increasingly ambitious climate goals for the iron ore miner that made him Australia's \nrichest man.\nHe first charged the mine operations with the goal of emitting net zero carbon emissions by 2030, two decades \nahead of the two bigger Pilbara miners, Rio Tinto and BHP.\nPage 2 of 2\nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue slashes 700 jobs, tempers green hydrogen ambitions\nLater, Forrest demanded zero actual emissions, removing the option to buy carbon offsets for any emissions that \nwere technically difficult or prohibitively expensive to eliminate.\n\"We've got this unfolding miracle of Fortescue going fully green this decade,\" he said.\nInitially, Fortescue touted green hydrogen as vital to decarbonise its own operations but more recently its efforts \nhave almost exclusively focused on electrifying its operations, which are heavily dependent on diesel, and ensuring \nthat the electricity used is renewable.\nForrest's goals covered both Fortescue's own emissions - termed Scopes 1 and 2 - and the far greater carbon \npollution from the steel mills buying Fortescue iron ore, known as Scope 3 emissions.\nIn late 2021, Fortescue targeted zero Scope 3 emissions by 2040 and the production of 15 million tonnes a year of \ngreen hydrogen by 2030.\n\"That is what the world needed, and that's where we always start,\" he said, adding that the targets were set before \nthe \"massive spikes\" in energy prices in part caused by the market upheaval after Russia invaded Ukraine.\nIn early 2023, Fortescue committed to making final investment decisions on at least five green hydrogen projects \nby December 2023. It achieved two: a plant to make 30 tonnes of liquid hydrogen a day in Arizona and a $US150 \nmillion ($223 million) investment in a facility in Gladstone, Queensland.\nThere are no more commitments to investments, but Fortescue will keep investigating the feasibility of a project in \nNorway that is three times bigger than the Gladstone plant, and may also launch a study into an opportunity in \nBrazil.\nAs part of the restructure accompanying the job cuts, Fortescue will retain dual chief executives - Dino Otranto for \nmining and Mark Hutchinson in energy - but will merge other senior corporate roles.\nTwo executives who have been with Fortescue for 18 months or less have emerged as major winners. Chief \nfinancial officer for mining Apple Paget will take on that role for the entire company, and Shelley Robertson will \nmove from chief corporate officer to chief operating officer.\nThe Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day's trading.

Woodside Energy has struggled to get a US hydrogen project signed off without enough \ncustomers willing to pay a premium for low-carbon fuels.\nDr Forrest said lower energy prices were the priority for world leaders at a time when war in Ukraine and the Middle \nEast had roiled commodity markets, driven up the cost of energy and challenged the economics of hydrogen, which \nis more expensive than natural gas. \"In that environment, you're not going to bring in major sources of green \nhydrogen, which relies on cheap energy prices,\" he said. \"We are not going to swim against the tide.\"\nThe Albanese government promise of $6.7 billion of production tax credits for hydrogen arrived barely a year after \npumping $2 billion of taxpayers' funds into the Hydrogen Headstart policy.\nAnd energy sources say Japanese importers are increasingly looking at hydrogen only as a long-term alternative, \npreferring in the nearer term substitutes that are compatible with existing transport and utility infrastructure.\nGrattan Institute energy policy director Tony Wood said: \"The reality is that the queue of people being prepared to \npay Twiggy Forrest a lot of money for green hydrogen is not very long.\"\nPage 2 of 3\nLabor's hydrogen goal stalls as Fortescue trims ambitions\nGreen hydrogen is made by using renewable energy to split water into its constituent parts, and Fortescue had \nshaped as a likely beneficiary of those federal schemes.\nBut Dr Forrest said Fortescue would focus in the immediate future on generating and distributing clean power, \nrather than using that clean power to make hydrogen. \"We're going to stay where we know we can win, and that's \ngreen electricity. Nothing beats green electricity,\" he said.\nDr Forrest is already a big producer of renewable power in his private capacity through Squadron Energy, which \nowns many Australian wind farms.\nThe job cuts announced by Fortescue yesterday will continue efforts under way for close to 18 months to reduce \nduplication between the energy and mining divisions.\nOne layer of duplication will remain: energy boss Mark Hutchinson and mining boss Dino Otranto will continue to be \ndual chief executives of Fortescue and report to Dr Forrest as executive chairman.\nWhile the top three at Fortescue will remain in place, the rapid turnover of senior executives has continued, with \nenergy executive Eva Hanly and marketing director Vivienne Tieu leaving the company.\nDual company secretary-general counsel Phil McKeiver has lost the company secretary role, in a move that \nappears to be driven by his handling of a bitter legal dispute with green iron rival Element Zero.\nFortescue hired private investigators to follow and monitor the former executives behind the Element Zero start-up \nand their families as part of a lawsuit over an alleged intellectual property breach.\nYesterday, Dr Forrest said no member of the Fortescue board had been aware of the strategy and the board \n\"struggled\" to align the actions with Fortescue's values.\nMr McKeiver had offered his resignation, but it had been rejected, the iron ore billionaire said.\n\"I'm proud of the guy for taking full responsibility.\"\nFortescue appointed Mona Gill as company secretary; Mr McKeiver will continue as general counsel.\nIron ore prices are predicted to slide over the next five years as new supply from Africa and Western Australia \nenters the market, but Dr Forrest said the job cuts were not driven by this.\n\"We're going to sadly lose around 4.5 per cent of our direct workforce, 3 per cent of our indirect workforce,\" he said \nof the proposed cuts.\n\"It's not a big number in percentage terms, but we still don't like doing it. But it's not to jam operating costs down, it \nis to streamline this organisation and keep the genius of simplicity.\"\nThe job cuts will affect Fortescue staff around the world and also add to the thousands of job losses in the \nAustralian resources sector this year at loss-making nickel mines, lithium mines and Alcoa's Kwinana alumina \nrefinery.\nYesterday, Fortescue appointed Apple Paget as chief financial officer of the combined group, ending the previous \nstructure where the mining and energy divisions had their own CFOs, such as former Reserve Bank deputy Guy \nDebelle, who lasted just 143 days.\nFormer Mineral Resources executive Shelley Robertson was named as Fortescue's chief operating officer.\nFortescue will continue to push ahead with three green hydrogen projects that were the subject of final investment \ndecisions last year; one in Arizona, one in the Pilbara, and a $US150 million venture near Gladstone, which will \nstart construction this year.Page 3 of 3\nLabor's hydrogen goal stalls as Fortescue trims ambitions\nFortescue said two more hydrogen projects in Norway and Brazil remained under consideration, and the \nNorwegian project was close to a final investment decision.\nDespite abandoning the 2030 hydrogen goal, Dr Forrest said Fortescue would eventually get to 15 million tonnes \nof hydrogen production and would retain its promise to have zero greenhouse gas emissions globally by 2030 \nwithout relying on carbon offsets. It bills its hydrogen as zero carbon.\nDr Hutchinson said Fortescue would continue to make hydrogen electrolysers at its Gladstone factory at a time \nwhen many customers were enduring long waits for electrolysers to be delivered.\nBut Fortescue's plan to retrofit Incitec Pivot's Gibson Island fertiliser plant near Brisbane into a low-carbon version \nof itself is on the backburner because of high electricity costs in Australia.\nLoad-Date: July 20, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Peter Ker, Angela Macdonald-Smith\nDate: July 18, 2024\nTitle: Labor's hydrogen goal stalls as Fortescue trims ambitions\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Humiliating move raises serious fears for our reputation\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Nick Evans\n### Date: July 18, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nHumiliating move raises serious fears for our reputation\nHumiliating move raises serious fears for our reputation\nThe Australian\nJuly 18, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKETWATCH; Pg. 24\nLength: 471 words\nByline: Nick Evans, COMMENT\nBody\nHowever Fortescue may try to spin it, the announcement it will slash 700 roles from its global headcount is more \nthan just an attempt to remain \"lean, impactful and agile\".\nThe last time Fortescue made cuts this deep into its workforce was when it sacked 1000 people in a single day in \n2012, when the tumbling iron ore price combined with Fortescue's massive debts to create an existential crisis for \nthe iron ore producer.\nFor Fortescue to abandon its ambitions to produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030, and make \nsimilarly deep cuts to its workforce, represents a humiliating backdown.\nNot because the company has abandoned the goal in the face of reality. But because Andrew Forrest and his \nleadership team spent the past three years waving away genuine concerns about the plans that were being \nexpressed by investors, market analysts, hydrogen and energy experts, and even the company's own staff - many \nof whom left in frustration well ahead of Wednesday's announcement.\nIn that time Fortescue has become increasingly erratic in its strategy and less tolerant of criticism - both internally \nand from the media and the investment community, as the company embraced the new vision of its founder and the \n\"creative chaos\" that came with it.\nYou cannot fault Forrest for his ambition, his commitment to innovation, and his attempt to try to drive a shift to \ngreen energy by bringing the scale of Fortescue's resources to bear on a problem others have found too difficult to \ngrapple with.\nHopefully some good will eventually come of all that frenzied work. But belief alone cannot defy reality, and it has \nbeen clear for some time that Fortescue took on more than it could ever handle - perhaps to the detriment of \nprojects that could have been achieved.\nPlenty of voices inside Fortescue have been saying that along the journey, but have been told to get with the \nprogram or leave.\nPage 2 of 2\nHumiliating move raises serious fears for our reputation\nThe reputational damage brought about by the retreat from this green foray is enormous, both to Fortescue and to \nother Australian companies operating overseas.\nForrest has spent the past four years touring developing nations making big promises about the jobs that green \nhydrogen will bring, and the economic transformation his company could help deliver to some of the poorest \ncountries in the world, if they give Fortescue access to their resources.\nFew, if any, of those promises will now be delivered - and that will not be easily forgotten the next time an Australian \ncompany rolls into town looking for support for a mining or energy project.\nMany investors will welcome Wednesday's backdown as offering hope the company will return its focus to the \nmining arm where it makes its money. But real questions still need to be asked about how the rest of the Fortescue \nboard did not reign in Forrest's green ambitions well before now.\nLoad-Date: July 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Nick Evans\nDate: July 18, 2024\nTitle: Humiliating move raises serious fears for our reputation\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Andrew Forrest downplays hit from Fortescue job cuts, saying 'Twiggy is not walking back from hydrogen'\n## Media outlet: ABC Premium News\n### Author: Keane Bourke, Nicolas Perpitch\n### Date: July 18, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 3\nAndrew Forrest downplays hit from Fortescue job cuts, saying 'Twiggy is not walking back from hydrogen'\nAndrew Forrest downplays hit from Fortescue job cuts, saying 'Twiggy is \nnot walking back from hydrogen'\nABC Premium News (Australia)\nJuly 18, 2024 Thursday\nCopyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1009 words\nByline: By WA state political reporter Keane Bourke and Nicolas Perpitch\nHighlight: Mining magnate Andrew Forrest says a move to slash 700 jobs from Fortescue is not a sign he is \npulling away from his green hydrogen ambitions.\nBody\nAndrew Forrest says a move to slash 700 jobs from Fortescue is not a sign he is pulling away from his green \nhydrogen ambitions.\nThe company \u2013 which made its start mining iron ore but working to push into clean energy \u2013 announced the \nredundancies late yesterday, saying they would be finalised by the end of the month.\nSpeaking on morning radio, the mining magnate and self-described \"hardcore bloke from the bush\" declared: \n\"Twiggy is not walking back from hydrogen.\"\nHe told Nine Radio in Perth the job losses, which are expected to be finalised by the end of the month, were about \nstreamlining the company.\n\"It's in community, it's in government relations, it's in HR, Fortescue people,\" Mr Forrest said.\n\"It's in all the, if you like, white-collar jobs where there's duplication between mining and energy.

This is something which I genuinely believe in,\" he said today.\n\"It's a bit like, I don't know \u2026 antibiotics or penicillin. The world has to have it.\n\"We just have to work out now how to produce it cheaply enough.\"\nBringing down energy prices was a key challenge to achieving that, Mr Forrest said, adding he was still committed \nto eliminating all fossil fuels from Fortescue's operations by the end of the decade, which would help lower costs.\n\"So what we're doing is investing upstream, investing now into the generation of green electricity, pushing down the \nprice of power for the benefit of every punter in Australia,\" he clarified later in the day.\n\"And of course at the end of it when power prices really do come off then we'll have a very commercial form of \ngreen hydrogen which is absolutely essential to get into the world.",
