The joint venture said 450 new gas -production wells, a new field compression station, 27km pipeline and \nroad and infrastructure upgrades over two phases would be developed.\nArrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said first gas from the expansion has been targeted for 2026.\n\"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify \nArrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast,\" he said.\nThe gas from the project would flow to the Shell-operated QCLNG liquefied natural gas facility on Curtis Island, \nnear Gladstone, to meet long-term contracts and supply domestic customers, the joint venture partners said.\nShell integrated gas and upstream director Zoe Yujnovich said the expansion underscored its commitment to the \ndomestic market. \"QCLNG marked its 1000th cargo at the end of last year, reflecting its significance as a gas \nsupplier for Australia and the region,' she said.\nLoad-Date: August 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**PERSON**: [Full Name]\n**ROLE**: [Person's role or position]\n**CONTEXT**: [Brief description of how the person is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**PERSON**: Elon Musk\n**ROLE**: CEO of Tesla and SpaceX\n**CONTEXT**: Primary subject of article, discussing company strategy\n\nOnly include people who play a meaningful role in the article's content.
