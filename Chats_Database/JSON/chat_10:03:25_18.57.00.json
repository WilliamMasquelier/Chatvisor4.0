Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 15\nLength: 399 words\nByline: Brad Thompson and Peter Ker\nBody\nThe chief financial officer of Fortescue's energy division, Deborah Caudle, has exited the company after less than \nfive months, adding to the roll call of names quitting the miner's executive ranks.\nMs Caudle was announced as the CFO of Fortescue's energy division on August 2, but did not join the miner until \nSeptember. A Fortescue spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that Ms Caudle had departed after a corporate \nrestructure.\n\"As part of our transition to a One Fortescue model, there has been consolidation of Fortescue's finance \nfunctions,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\"We thank Deborah Caudle for her fantastic contribution to Fortescue and wish her the very best. In the interim, \nApple Paget, acting metals CFO, will take on additional responsibilities.\"\nIt is the third prominent departure from Fortescue in the past seven days; the exit of former prime minister Malcolm \nTurnbull was legally formalised last week, while external affairs boss Fiona Sugden has left to join Prime Minister \nAnthony Albanese's team.\nWhile Fortescue has suffered high turnover across all sections of its executive ranks over the past four years, the \nchurn among finance professionals in its clean energy division has been particularly high.\nOne of Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest's longest-serving lieutenants, Michael Masterman, ceased serving as \nCFO of the clean energy division in 2022 and is now pursuing a green iron start-up called Element Zero.\nMr Masterman was replaced by former Reserve Bank of Australia deputy governor Guy Debelle, who lasted just \nfive months as CFO and severed his final links to Fortescue in September when he ceased to be a director of \nFortescue subsidiaries.\nDr Debelle's replacement, Felicity Gooding, lasted just eight months in the role before quitting in July and being \nreplaced by Ms Caudle.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue finance boss lasts five months\nLong-serving chief financial officer Ian Wells - whose role straddled both Fortescue's mining and energy divisions - \nquit in January last year and left the company 22 days later.\nHis replacement as CFO of Fortescue's minerals division, Christine Morris, lasted barely two months before exiting \nin August. She was replaced by Ms Paget.\nMs Morris left just days after Fortescue's mining chief executive Fiona Hick exited the company after her six \nmonths in charge of its flagship iron ore riches.\nRatings agency Moody's said in September that Fortescue's high churn was \"negative\" for its credit rating.\nLoad-Date: February 2, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Deborah Caudle | CFO of Fortescue's energy division | \"We thank Deborah Caudle for her fantastic contribution to Fortescue and wish her the very best.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Chairman of Fortescue | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Former CFO of Fortescue's clean energy division | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n| Guy Debelle | Former CFO of Fortescue's clean energy division | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n| Felicity Gooding | Former CFO of Fortescue's clean energy division | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n| Ian Wells | Former CFO of Fortescue's mining and energy divisions | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n| Christine Morris | Former CFO of Fortescue's minerals division | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
