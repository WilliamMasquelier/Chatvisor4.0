So, gold is very much a contrarian investment in the current market.\" Mr Judd said \nasset allocation to gold was currently running at les than half its historical long-term average.\n\"This shows there is significant gold demand potential which could manifest into real demand should the sentiment \nof Western investors towards gold turn positive,\" Mr Judd said.\n\"In our view, this is likely to occur when there is more conviction that central banks will ease monetary policy.\" Citi \nhas also rerated its short and midterm gold price forecasts to $US2200 an ounce and $US2300 an ounce \nrespectively, against $US2165 an ounce currently.\n\"We would favour owning gold - both outright and against silver - heading into a sluggish GDP and rate cut \nenvironment,\" Citi said in a note to clients.\nPage 2 of 2\nThree winners singled out from extended gold rush - DATA ROOM\n\"Gold prices should also be supported by US dollar weakness on the eventual Fed pivot and strong physical \ndemand.\" Ramelius on Tuesday said it was \"well-placed to execute quickly on transactions\" should they present \nthemselves, \"utilising reliable due diligence methodology with a match-fit team\".\nIt pointed to seven assets it has bought and integrated over the past six years as proof of this. Red 5 is the largest \nholding in The Victor Smorgon Partners Resources Gold Fund, and Mr Judd said its recent merger with Silverlake \nResources and entry into the ASX 200 was likely to underpin a rerating in the stock.\nLoad-Date: March 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Three winners singled out from extended gold rush - DATA ROOM\n## The Australian\n### Cameron England\n### March 27, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Ramelius Resources, to report.

Ramelius Resources has been highlighted as a top pick by The Victor Smorgon Group, indicating strong confidence in its potential for growth within the Australian gold sector, especially as its market value surpasses $2 billion.\n\n2. The company is positioned to capitalize on acquisition opportunities, with Ramelius stating its readiness to execute transactions quickly, supported by a proven track record of integrating seven assets over the past six years.\n\n3. Market analysts suggest that a shift in central bank monetary policy could lead to increased demand for gold, which would benefit Ramelius Resources, as the company is well-placed to respond to changing market conditions.\n\n4. Despite the current strength in gold prices, there is a noted disconnect between gold price increases and gold ETF demand, which could present a contrarian investment opportunity for Ramelius if investor sentiment shifts positively.",
