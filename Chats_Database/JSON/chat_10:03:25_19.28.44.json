Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 27\nLength: 654 words\nByline: Joshua Peach\nBody\nFund managers including Ellerston Capital's Chris Kourtis and brokers are turning bullish on Andrew Forrest's \nFortescue, despite the slumping iron ore price weighing heavily on the longtime ASX pariah.\nIn the past two weeks, four equity research firms - Citi, Morningstar, JPMorgan and Morgans Financial - have \nupgraded their outlook for the iron ore giant, all citing Fortescue's beaten-up share price as attractive for investors.\nLikewise, Mr Kourtis, portfolio manager at Ellerston Capital, told investors this month he had switched out the fund's \nholding in BHP for a stake in Fortescue, noting the latter had fallen much harder than its peers this year.\n\"Following the sharp de-rating, we believe FMG now offers a compelling entry point at current bombed-out levels,\" \nMr Kourtis told investors, adding this was the first time the fund had owned the stock.\nAnalysis by The Australian Financial Review earlier this year found that Fortescue was the least-held of the ASX's \n10 largest companies by Australian fund managers. That trend appears to have continued, according to a report \nfrom JPMorgan, which ranked the miner as the \"most unloved\" stock among Australian hedge funds.\nThat may start to change, however, with three buy ratings on Fortescue shares, marking the most bullish outlook \non the stock from analysts in more than 18 months. Morningstar upgraded its Fortescue rating to hold.\nLast week, Citi analysts said the company's 100 per cent iron ore exposure had \"proved problematic\", but it \nnonetheless slapped a buy rating on the shares given the historically cheap price.\n\"[We] upgrade to buy given the depth of the valuation discount rather than our still cautious iron ore view,\" Citi \nanalysts told investors last week.\nThe slew of buy ratings follows a 41 per cent decline in Fortescue shares since the start of the year, outpacing a \nretreat in iron ore peers BHP and Rio Tinto, which have fallen 21 per cent and 19 per cent respectively in 2024.\nThe shares have been weighed down by falling iron ore prices, which was down as much as 30 per cent this year \non slowing global growth and waning demand from China's property sector.\nPage 2 of 2\nWeak share price lures funds to Fortescue Iron ore\nThe weaker commodity price arrives at an already challenging time for Fortescue, which last month delayed its \nmuch-hyped push into green hydrogen and continues to battle a federal court case relating to an IP feud with three \nformer executives.\nFurther, signs that longtime funding partner US-based Capital Group has been selling billions of dollars in shares \nhave also hurt investor confidence in recent weeks.\nDespite the headwinds, Mr Kourtis said the bearish outlook was reflected in its already-weak share price.\n\"Negative sentiment around sluggish but flat Chinese steel demand, elevated China port inventory and an \nimproving iron ore supply outlook from West Africa have weighed on the big three Australian iron ore producers,\" he \nsaid.\n\"However, we believe the valuation buffer now accounts for much of the risk to spot prices moving below $US100 a \ntonne.\"\nWhile the steepening sell-off in iron ore and mining shares - the commodity fell 9 per cent last week to trade well \nbelow $US100 a tonne - caught Fortescue buyers off guard, it was profitable for some hedge funds. Those include \nSydney's Sage Capital, which said its short against Fortescue was the top contributor to returns last month.\nLooking ahead, Sage Capital portfolio manager Sean Fenton said he remained bearish on the outlook for iron ore. \n\"We anticipate iron ore and lithium to remain weak due to excess industrial capacity created in China due to \ndomestic policy that encourages the economy to diversify away from housing,\" he said.\nOthers also remain cautious, with nine of the 16 equity analysts covering the stock sticking with a sell rating. UBS \nreiterated its sell recommendation this week, saying the iron ore miner was more exposed to further weakness in \nthe iron ore price than diversified miners BHP or Rio Tinto.\nLoad-Date: August 23, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Chris Kourtis | Portfolio Manager at Ellerston Capital | \"Following the sharp de-rating, we believe FMG now offers a compelling entry point at current bombed-out levels.\" | N.A. |\n| Chris Kourtis | Portfolio Manager at Ellerston Capital | \"Negative sentiment around sluggish but flat Chinese steel demand, elevated China port inventory and an improving iron ore supply outlook from West Africa have weighed on the big three Australian iron ore producers.\" | N.A. |\n| Sean Fenton | Portfolio Manager at Sage Capital | \"We anticipate iron ore and lithium to remain weak due to excess industrial capacity created in China due to domestic policy that encourages the economy to diversify away from housing.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
