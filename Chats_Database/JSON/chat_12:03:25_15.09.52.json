Focus on how the article portrays Shell in terms of its actions, reputation, performance, and impact. The tone should be categorized as one of the following:\n\nPositive: The article reflects well on Shell, highlighting favorable aspects.\nNeutral: The article presents information about Shell in a balanced, objective manner without any strong positive or negative bias.\nNegative: The article is critical of Shell, highlighting challenges, controversies, failures, or unfavorable developments.\n\nProvide the final tone assessment as \"Positive,\" \"Neutral,\" or \"Negative.\"\n\nHere is the article content: Page 1 of 1\nShell mulls sale of chemicals assets\nShell mulls sale of chemicals assets\nThe Australian\nMarch 4, 2025 Tuesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 17\nLength: 311 words\nByline: Ben Dummett Lauren Thomas\nBody\nShell is exploring a potential sale of its chemicals assets in Europe and the US, part of a continuing drive to refocus \nthe company's business on its most profitable operations.\nThe oil and gas company is working with bankers at Morgan Stanley on a strategic review of its chemicals \noperations. The process is in the early stages and Shell has yet to commit to any final decisions.\nAmong the assets included in the review is Shell's Deer Park -facility in Texas. The site produces a range of \nchemicals such as light and heavy olefins, which can be used to make pharmaceuticals, detergents, adhesives and \nwire coating. The operation is -located adjacent to a refinery, which Shell previously sold its stake in. Shell also has \nchemical facilities in Pennsylvania and Louisiana in the US, and in -Europe it has plants in the UK, Germany and \nThe Netherlands.\nPotential bidders for the assets could range from private-equity firms to Middle Eastern buyers wanting to expand \ninto the West.\nSince chief executive Wael Sawan took the helm of Shell at the start of 2023, the company has worked to focus \nmore on its most profitable operations. To that end, the company has rolled back some of its green-energy targets \nand pledged to pump more oil and gas. Shell's chemicals business has been seen as lagging behind for years. It is \ncapital-heavy and subject to cyclical ups and downs, resulting in losses in recent years that have weighed on the \ncompany's overall performance. Anaemic gas prices and rising capacity in chemical manufacturing have caused \nthe petrochemical market to languish recently. The company has already signalled its willingness to shed lower-\nmargin chemicals operations. Last year, it struck a deal to sell its chemicals park in Singapore to a joint venture that \nincludes Glencore, the mining company, and Chandra Asri, an Indonesia-based chemicals producer.\nLoad-Date: March 3, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should solely be one of these three words based on your assessment: \"Positive\", \"Neutral\", or \"Negative\". Nothing else\n                ",
