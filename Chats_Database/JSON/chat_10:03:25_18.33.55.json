The company's share price closed down nearly 14 per cent at 98c.\nMoelis Australia's Paul Hissey said the Bellevue update appeared to manifest concerns about the miner's ability to \nramp up head grades and would do little to silence a growing chorus of doubters.\n\"There is also some abstruse disclosure in the result which a sceptic may choose to infer additional \nunderperformance for the quarter,\" he said.\n\"We retain our neutral investment view ...\" Bellevue said it was on track to produce 90,000 ounces from what has \nbeen touted as one of Australia's highest-grade gold mines in the six months to June 30. On an annualised basis, \nthat would equal the top range of original 2024-25 guidance of 180,000 ounces. Bellevue also said it would reach \nan annual production rate of 200,000 ounces from early in the June quarter.\nBellevue has a five-year growth plan to produce 250,000 ounces annually by 2027-28, and said in October that it \nhad completed key infrastructure upgrades and was on track to hit the original 2024-25 guidance.\nOn Monday, Bellevue said gold sales in the December quarter totalled 26,230 ounces at an average sale price of \n$3339 an ounce, and it had $81m in cash and gold on hand compared to $109m at the end of the September \nquarter.\nBellevue said it encountered lower grades and geological variability in mining of the outer edges of the main ore in \nthe December quarter. The Bellevue update coincided with updates from two other gold producers - considered \ncentral players in sector consolidation.\nPage 2 of 2\nBellevue belted as mine fails forecast\nGold Road said its Gruyere mine, owned in partnership with Gold Fields, produced a quarterly record 91,631 \nounces in the three months to December 31.\nGruyere, operated and managed by Gold Fields, produced 287,270 ounces across 2024, below annual guidance of \n290,000-305,000 ounces.\nGold Road owns 17 per cent of De Grey Mining, the target of a $5bn takeover offer from Northern Star, and is \nshaping up as a potential king maker if a rival offer emerges.\nIn its December quarter update, Ramelius Resource hailed record free cash flow of $174.5m before splashing out \n$68m to increase its stake in Spartan Resources to 19.9 per cent and dividend payments of $43.4m. Ramelius, \nled by noted deal-maker Mark Zeptner, took its investment in Spartan from 18.3 per cent to the takeover brink in \nDecember after participating in a $220m Spartan capital raising aimed at restarting mining at the Dalgaranga \nproject in WA.\nLoad-Date: January 6, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
