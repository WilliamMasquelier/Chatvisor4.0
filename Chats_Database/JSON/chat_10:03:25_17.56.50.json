His story is not \nonly inspiring but also reflects the broader efforts of Fortescue to integrate First Nations values and business \npractices into their operations, culminating in a remarkable $5bn investment with Indigenous service providers and \nsuppliers.\nEarly life and career beginnings Mr Wheelock, a Badimaya/Wajarri man, grew up in Broome, Western Australia, \nspearing, and enjoying the freedom that those early days of growing up in the Kimberley had to offer.\nHis early life was shaped by the rich cultural heritage of classic Broome, as well as the challenges of Kimberley life. \nWhile his career began in the pearling industry, seeking more stable employment and driven by a desire to \ncontribute more significantly to his community, he enrolled in a Certificate III in Geoscience Practices at his local \nTAFE, setting his sights on the mining and resources sector.\n\"I started mining in my early 20s,\" Mr Wheelock recalls.\n\"Mining just made sense to me personally because of the fly-in, fly-out arrangement, and it offered a clear path for \ncareer advancement.\" His early days in the state's biggest industry were marked by a commitment to continual \nlearning and development, completing a degree in Mine Engineering and recently earning a Global Executive MBA.\nRise through the ranks at Fortescue Mr Wheelock's career at Fortescue spans over a decade, during which he \nhas held numerous leadership roles. Starting off as a technical services superintendent in 2011, he quickly \nadvanced through the ranks, as he pressed to always do more - a common theme of his life. He served as the \nproduction superintendent at Cloudbreak and later as the mining manager at both Fortescue's Cloudbreak and \nSolomon mines, where he oversaw critical operations and drove significant improvements in efficiency and safety. \nIn his role as general manager Eliwana, Mr Wheelock was instrumental in the operational readiness and \nPage 2 of 3\nLeader inspires change\nmanagement of the Eliwana Mine. His strategic vision early on, and his hands-on style saw the successful \ncommissioning and operation of the site in December 2020.\nIn March 2023, Mr Wheelock took on the role of Fortescue's general manager First Nations, where he has been \ninstrumental in consolidating the miner's First Nations functions into a cohesive unit. This strategic move has \nstreamlined processes and enhanced the company's engagement with Indigenous communities, ensuring that \nFortescue's initiatives have been both more co-ordinated and more impactful.\nPassion for Indigenous empowerment Throughout his personal and professional life, Mr Wheelock has been \npassionate about creating opportunities for Indigenous people. His efforts align perfectly with Fortescue's \ncommitment to fostering Indigenous employment, training, and business development, with some of the most \nambitious targets for Indigenous engagement.\n\"We have a huge amount of talent within our organisation, and it's recognised which has given the opportunities \nthat those individuals deserve on their own merit,\" Mr Wheelock says.\n\"It's not because I'm Aboriginal that I am in this critical role; it's because of my track record in running operations, \nmanaging teams and solving complex problems. However being Aboriginal does give me unique and diverse \nperspectives.\" Mr Wheelock's personal journey of continuous professional development and his rise to leadership \npositions within Fortescue serve as an inspiration to many Indigenous people. He embodies the potential for \nsuccess when opportunities are made available and supported by strong organisational commitment at every level.\nFortescue's $5bn commitment to Indigenous businesses Fortescue's \"Billion Opportunities\" program, which began \nin 2011, is designed to boost Indigenous business participation across the company's entire supply chain.\nIn August this year, days before this magazine was launched, the initiative saw over $5bn in contracts awarded to \nmore than 190 Indigenous services and suppliers. In the 2023 financial year alone, there was more than $505m \nspent with Indigenous-owned businesses. Such a significant milestone underscores the company's dedication to \nfostering Indigenous economic independence and meaningful participation well ahead of its time.\nTime and again, Fortescue has demonstrated its commitment to seeing Indigenous-owned businesses get a bigger \nshare of the pie when it comes to their operations and engagement, but it's not without effort.\nAs Mr Wheelock says, \"We have to make sure we're helping Indigenous-owned businesses remove roadblocks or \nwhere they're having issues. Our Aboriginal business development team, that's their task, to help ensure they're \nsupporting these companies. We're really proud of this achievement.\n\"Even in Perth, it's not just about where our operations are. We've got things from coffee beans to stationery, we \nlook for wherever there's opportunity for Aboriginal businesses to be involved with our organisation.\"\nThe broader impact of Fortescue's initiatives Fortescue's approach to Indigenous engagement extends well \nbeyond business contracts. The company has over 1400 Aboriginal employees and ensures that there is \ncomprehensive cultural awareness training and support for Indigenous heritage across the company.\nThese efforts are all part of Fortescue's broader strategy to integrate Indigenous perspectives into all aspects of \ntheir operations. \"It makes you realise, when you take a step back and go, wow, we've actually achieved some \npretty incredible outcomes,\" Mr Wheelock says.\nNet zero commitment Fortescue's dedication to sustainability is encapsulated in its ambitious goal to achieve real \nzero terrestrial emissions by 2030 without the use of carbon offsets. This initiative is a testament to the company's \nforward-thinking approach and its commitment to reducing its environmental footprint.\n\"Fortescue emits more than 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent each year,\" Mr Wheelock notes. \"Our $US6.2bn \ninvestment in achieving Real Zero by 2030 is a significant step towards mitigating climate change and setting a new \nstandard in the industry.\" The integration of Kooya's electric all-terrain vehicles, for example, into Fortescue's \noperations is a tangible example of how the company's sustainability goals align with its commitment to supporting Page 3 of 3\nLeader inspires change\nIndigenous businesses. This collaboration with an Indigenous-owned business not only contributes to reducing \ncarbon emissions but also ensures that Indigenous enterprises play a central role in Fortescue's decarbonisation \njourney.\nA vision for the future Mr Wheelock's vision for the future is closely tied to Fortescue's ongoing efforts to uplift \nIndigenous communities through meaningful engagement and sustainable practices. His leadership and dedication \ncontinue to drive positive change within the company and beyond. \"We are incredibly proud of our approach to First \nNations engagement, whether it's through business opportunities, employment, or cultural heritage support,\" he \nsays. \"The journey has been challenging but immensely rewarding. I look forward to continuing this work and \nmaking a lasting impact.\" Rosli Wheelock's story is a powerful reminder of the transformative impact that dedicated \nindividuals and forward-thinking companies can have on Indigenous communities in Australia. Together with \nFortescue, it's these alignments of similar values and dedication which continue to lead the way in Indigenous \nengagement and environmental sustainability, and Mr Wheelock's role will undoubtedly be central to their ongoing \nsuccess. With a strong foundation in operational excellence and a deep commitment to Indigenous empowerment, \nhe is poised to help further Fortescue's vision of creating a sustainable and inclusive future. His work not only \nbenefits Fortescue but also sets a benchmark for other companies in the industry to follow and helps lift up \nIndigenous people across the country. \"\nLoad-Date: August 13, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
