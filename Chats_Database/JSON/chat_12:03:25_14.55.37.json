It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 4\n'Do it now - write down everything'\n'Do it now - write down everything'\nThe Courier Mail (Australia)\nAugust 4, 2024 Sunday\nCourierMail Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: CONFIDENTIAL; Pg. 65\nLength: 1717 words\nByline: Justin Lees\nBody\nThe diaries of Australia's WWI correspondent reveal a tale of heroism, writes Justin Lees\nOne hundred and ten years ago this weekend, a conflict erupted that would devastate the world and leave \nrepercussions still felt today.\nThe First World War witnessed Australia's first actions on the global stage, post-Federation - and gave this country \nboth the Anzac legend and, some argue, decades of intergenerational trauma.\nFor so many, understanding Australia's journey through the 1914-1918 conflagration came via the narrative of one \nman: Charles Bean, a reporter who became Australia's official war correspondent and followed its course from \nbeginning to end.\nOften at the front, he made handwritten notes in scores of notebooks and diaries.\nThose 20,000 pages became a basis for the eventual 12-volume official history of the war.\nKept at the Australian War Memorial - which itself sprang from an idea conceived by Bean - the diaries provide a \nbehind-the-scenes view of the events he experienced; and a fascinating sense of how he witnessed history.\nOver the coming months the diaries will be made easily accessible online as part of the memorial's Transcribe \nproject. Ahead of that, to mark the anniversary of the start of the war, we share an exclusive selection of edited \nexcerpts, with context provided by AWM historian Robyn Van Dyk, taking us through Bean's War.\n'GOODBYE' War was declared on Germany and its allies by Britain and the Dominions on August 4, 1914. Bean \nwas appointed to his war correspondent role after winning a reporters' ballot in September and his first diary entry \ncame the next month.\nSaid goodbye to mother at 'Northampton', 27 Acland St. Taxie'd to Port Melbourne with father taking luggage. \nMorning tea at Mia Mia with Father & Tig (Bean's youngest brother, Montague). Archie (Whyte, a newspaper \ncolleague and mentor) and Father came to Port Melbourne & after being held up on pier managed to get onto wharf \nPage 2 of 4\n'Do it now - write down everything'\nthrough Colonel Wallace & Major Dowse. Father left at 1.10 with Archie. Crowd in afternoon broke line of sentries & \nrushed wharf. Sailed at 3. Watched St Kilda pier for father & mother & thought I saw them waving a white \nhandkerchief.\n21 October, 1914\nINTO ACTION Bean went ashore with Australian forces at Gallipoli, on April 25, 1915, and stayed there for the \ncampaign.\nYou can't begin writing it too early. Do it now - write down everything in your diary.\n31 March, 1915, quoting advice given by General Sir Ian Hamilton, commander of the British Mediterranean \nExpeditionary Force.\nANZAC COVE Wanting a comprehensive record of the assault on April 25, Bean kept up a running commentary, \nbeginning the night before at sea, through the dawn landing and into that tension-filled first night at Anzac. Despite \nviolence and danger, he managed a small joke about his messy scrawl.\nIf I am plugged and anyone gets this diary they'll probably think I was either tight (drunk) or very unnerved when I \nwrote it. The fact was it was written by night when no candles were to be had and I had to do as best I could in the \nmoonlight.\n25 April, 1915\n'RECKLESS OBEDIENCE' The infamous, costly battles of Lone Pine and The Nek were part of the 1915 August \nOffensive, an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to break through the Ottoman lines. For Bean, it began with a bid to \nfind his officer brother 'Jack' (John), as men assembled in trenches before storming the enemy lines at Lone Pine \non the evening of August 6.\nLeft Monash and went along to see Jack \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I thought I would get near where he started from \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but tunnel was \ncrowded.\n3rd Battalion started to move into position about 2.30. It needed time as trench was narrow & they had to get down \nvery small tunnels to secret firing line. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 About 5.25 as I reached a convenient point \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 crowded with 3rd \nBattalion \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I saw not slightest trace of nervousness. Men all had packs with some sort of tucker or knick-knacks \nin. Presently order came: Pull down top (sand) bags in the recess - so as to make it easier to get over. Whole \ntrench looked suspiciously ragged. Officer took whistle from wrist. 'Prepare to jump out' he said. Put whistle \nbetween his teeth. I didn't hear mines go - presently he blew whistle.\nAugust 6, 1915\nBean was wounded in the leg just before dawn the next day. He had the wound dressed but the bullet was too \nclose to his femoral artery to be removed - he took it to his grave in 1968.\nI was moving on again when something gave me a whack (like a stone thrown hard) in the upper part of the right \nleg \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I was pretty sure I had been hit by a stray which had gone in on the right & not come out \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 so I knew I \nmust go back. I could limp along pretty well.\nAugust 7, 1915\nHobbling back for medical attention, he was just below The Nek as 600 dismounted Light Horsemen began their \nfateful attack. None reached the enemy trenches and 372 were killed or wounded.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 As I got opposite the Sphinx (a rocky promontory) a tremendous bombardment broke out. It really was a \nbombardment this time - not the feeble affair of 5pm yesterday. The dawn was just growing & the shell shaped cliff \naround the Sphinx, bellowed with sound.Page 3 of 4\n'Do it now - write down everything'\nI believe the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was a bit slow in getting out - didn't start for a minute or so after the finish \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \nand the Turks had time to get up again & get out their rifles. Few men reached the Nek \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The whole essence of \nthe attack was that it should issue suddenly \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 whilst the Turks were staggered by the heaviness of the first blows \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The whole chance lay in avoiding the risk of this battle crystallising again into a trench battle & that could only \nbe done by sacrificing everything to speed \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The point in which some of these Brigade Commanders seem to me \ngrievously to have failed \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 - they stopped before the enemy stopped them \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 August 7, 1915\nIn his official histories after the war, Bean hails the courage of the ordinary troopers, displaying \"reckless \nobedience\" as they followed orders to charge into \"certain destruction\", despite having just seen their comrades \nmown down.\nTHE MINCING MACHINE After the evacuation from Gallipoli in December 1915, most Australian forces went to the \nWestern Front, Bean with them. It was during the hellish fighting around the pulverised French village of Pozieres, \nin the 1916 Somme Offensive, that he saw industrial warfare in its most destructive form - near-continuous artillery \nfire, attacks and counter-attacks that cost 23,000 Australian casualties over 42 days. By comparison, 8700 \nAustralians died and 18,000 were wounded in eight months at Gallipoli. Among the 6800 killed at Pozieres was \nBean's cousin Leo Butler.\nAfter an awful series of adventures with shrapnel and gas shell arrived at General MacLagan's dugout in \nContalmaison. In the scurry of the last 100 yards across shrapnel swept roads in middle of which I had to put on my \ngas helmet - forgot to thank British signaller from 2nd Brigade who acted as my guide. Felt very sick with gas just \nbefore getting in but helmet is certainly a help. We have had several men lose their way here already. Pioneers \nsheltering under their own dump. Someone coughing. Helmets on again. 12.30 Bombardment around v. heavy. \nAromatic smell of gas all round.\n23 July, 1916\nPozieres has been a terrible sight all day \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The men are simply turned in there as into some ghastly giant mincing \nmachine. They have to stay there while shell after huge shell descends with a shriek close beside them \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 each \nshrieking tearing crash bringing a promise to each man - instantaneous - I will tear you into ghastly wounds - I will \nrend your flesh and pulp an arm or a leg - fling you, half a gaping quivering man ... to lie there rotting and \nblackening like all the things you saw by the awful roadside, or in that sickening dusty crater.\n29 July, 1916.\nBean's sense of duty compelled him to return repeatedly - although he did wonder if it would get him killed.\nThe whizzbang shell burst 50 or 80 yards to our left, & I ducked. I was ashamed of myself the next minute. The \nman on the side of the trench stood up there with his back to that little spitting shell as if it were no more than rain. \nThey didn't any of them even trouble to look round. About 5 fragments of small size hissed past us & they took no \nmore notice of it than if a small boy were throwing mud. They were busy about their job - getting a heavy burden \nalong over the crest to the right place.\nThey were stretcher bearers - Australian stretcher bearers. They had their white flag there - I had often heard of \ntheir work here before. But, by Jove, I never saw it as we saw it that morning. They have been the same from the \nday we landed in Gallipoli.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 I always feel surprised when I get alive out of Pozieres - I don't pretend to be brave. I want very much to write \nthe history of this war and every time one gets into those hot corners I wonder if I am not really doing the wrong \nthing. However, I had resolved to understand the country out on that left. Going back this morning in the car ... past \nthe ruins of La Boiselle I resolved - I will go to Pozieres once more, with the official photographer, to get the pictures \nthe Australian records seem to need. And that will finish the job.\n22 August, 1916Page 4 of 4\n'Do it now - write down everything'\nPEACE AT LAST At 11am on 11 November 1918, the Armistice signed by Germany finally brought an end to the \nwar. It came as most of the Australian forces were having a period of rest behind the front lines. Some Australians \ncelebrated into the night, but many described the end of the war as an anti-climax.\nReturning to Lille that evening, Bean heard very little noise, but noticed the street lights were on: \"Subdued - but still \nlights\". He describes some \"gruff cheers\", and the \"occasional bleating of some child's tin trumpet\".\nOne could not realise it. No more gun flashes; no more flares. Tonight the streets would be bright - the towns would \nbe lit; the cars would take the blackpainted eyelids off their headlights. The munition factories would have to bring \ntheir work gradually to an end; the business of the world for the last four years has finished. We had won - beyond \nall hope, everything exactly as the most optimistic democrat would have planned it.\n11 November, 1918 *You can apply to join the Australian War Memorial's Transcribe project as a volunteer, \ntranscribing historical documents, at transcribe.awm.gov.au\nLoad-Date: August 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
