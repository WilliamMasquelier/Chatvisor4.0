Shell's rival BP similarly paused biofuels investment at US and German \noil refineries recently.\nShell expects to write down between $US600m and $US1bn on the asset, while the impairment after the sale of its \nSingapore refinery is expected to be $US600m-$US800m.\nIn addition, Europe's largest energy company expects trading results from its integrated-gas segment, usually its \nlargest profit centre, to be lower than in the first quarter, when the unit booked $US3.68bn in adjusted earnings, due \nto seasonality.\nHowever, it expects the unit's results to match those of the second quarter last year, when it booked $US2.5bn in \nadjusted earnings - a metric that strips certain commodity price adjustments and one-time charges.\nThe company also narrowed the segment's liquids and natural-gas production outlook slightly upward to 940,000- \n980,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day for the quarter, from a previously guided range of 920,000- 980,000 BOE a \nday.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell warns of $3bn impairment\nShell, the world's largest liquefied natural gas trader, expects its quarterly LNG volumes to be between 6.8 million \nand 7.2 million tonnes, compared with the prior-year's 7.2 million tonnes.\nThis would mean a decline from the first quarter's 7.6 million tonnes. However, gas prices in Europe have rallied in \nrecent months on strong demand in Asia amid heatwaves and outages limiting supply, potentially providing a boon \nto Shell's quarterly results.\nOn the upstream side - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - Shell is expecting the unit to produce between \n1.72 million and 1.82 million BOE a day ready for sale, versus 1.70 million a year prior and 1.87 million in the first \nquarter. In the first quarter, the segment garnered $US1.93bn in adjusted earnings.\nLoad-Date: July 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Christian Moess Laursen\nDate: July 08, 2024\nTitle: Shell warns of $3bn impairment\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Arrow to expand Queensland gas project\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Colin Packham\n### Date: August 13, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nArrow to expand Queensland gas project\nArrow to expand Queensland gas project\nThe Australian\nAugust 13, 2024 Tuesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 637 words\nByline: Colin Packham\nBody\nShell and PetroChina's joint venture Arrow Energy will expand its Surat Gas Project as it moves to capitalise on \ngrowing demand, a move likely to stoke opposition from environmentalists.\nThe expansion will be welcomed by Australia's energy industry, which is struggling to lock in supplies amid rapidly \ndepleting stocks across the east coast.\nArrow said it would expand the project in Queensland's Western Downs to produce 4000PJ of gas for long-term \ncontracts and to supply the domestic market.\nThe JV said 450 new gas production wells, a new field compression station, 27km pipeline, and road and \ninfrastructure upgrades over two phases would be developed.\nArrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said first gas from the expansion was targeted for 2026.\n\"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify \nArrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast,\" Mr Peng said.\n\"Natural gas is an important part of the energy transition, and the expansion demonstrates the faith our \nshareholders have in our ability to manage and deliver large-scale projects.\" Gas from the project will flow to the \nShell-operated QCLNG liquefied natural gas facility on Curtis Island, near Gladstone, to meet long-term contracts \nand supply domestic customers, the joint venture partners said.\nZoe Yujnovich, Shell's integrated gas and upstream director, said the expansion underscored its commitment to the \ndomestic market.\n\"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to market,\" \nshe said.\n\"QCLNG marked its 1000th cargo at the end of last year, reflecting its significance as a gas supplier for Australia \nand the region.

But Australia's east coast faces a \nlooming crisis as offshore gas from Victoria's Bass Strait - the traditional bedrock of the country's supplies - rapidly \ndepletes.\nThe Australian Energy Market Operator has warned the country must urgently unlock new supplies to prevent a \ncatastrophic shortfall but new developments are struggling to secure regulatory approvals and/or the support of \nlocal communities.\nAnalysts have warned the country's $2.5 trillion economy will be significant harmed by a shortfall. The \nmanufacturing sector is particularly exposed with gas its only viable energy source, and any interruptions could \nthreaten their viability.\nHouseholds could also be disrupted. Victoria is the most gas-dependent state, relying on the fuel source to heat \nhomes, and a shortfall could make heating prohibitively expensive.\nOther states will also be hit. Gas is used as a so-called peaker, burnt to provide electricity during periods of high \ndemand or low supply from other fossil fuels or renewables. If Australia's National Electricity Market has insufficient \ngas on hand, the price of electricity will spike. Higher electricity bills was a key driver behind Australia's spike in \ninflation, which in turn forced the Reserve Bank of Australia to raise interest rates 13 times.\nWith a looming shortfall, gas developers have insisted governments fast-track applications, a request that the \nfederal Labor government has refused - insisting it must properly assess each application. The gas industry has \naccused the government of slow walking, which indicates its support for gas - a claim denied by Labor.\nLoad-Date: August 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Colin Packham\nDate: August 13, 2024\nTitle: Arrow to expand Queensland gas project\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Shell, PetroChina plan to expand Surat gas project\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Angela Macdonald-Smith\n### Date: August 13, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nShell, PetroChina plan to expand Surat gas project\nShell, PetroChina plan to expand Surat gas project\nAustralian Financial Review\nAugust 13, 2024 Tuesday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It is \nexpected to cost about $2 billion. Shell did not give an estimated cost for the second phase, but it is also expected \nto reach into the billions of dollars.\nThe decision to proceed with the second phase of the Arrow project follows increasingly urgent warnings from the \nAustralian Energy Market Operator about the need for investment in new gas supply to head off shortages expected \nlater this decade on peak-demand winter days.\n\"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to market,\" \nsaid Zoe Yujnovich, director of integrated gas and upstream for Shell.\n\"This investment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a lower-\nemissions alternative.\"\nStill, the drilling of the up to 450 new wells involved will only maintain existing supplies rather than increase \nproduction and does not address shortfalls that are looming because of declines in supplies in the southern states, \nsaid Rick Wilkinson, chief executive of consultancy EnergyQuest.\n\"This makes no change at all to the supply-demand balance and the requirement for new gas to come on for the \neast coast of Australia,\" he said.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell, PetroChina plan to expand Surat gas project\nMr Wilkinson said that for the full development of the project, thousands of wells needed to be drilled, \"so this is one \nstep of many that are required for capital to be allocated to the project to maintain flat production\".\nArrow, jointly owned by Shell and its Chinese state-owned partner, holds the largest reserve of undeveloped gas on \nthe east coast, where elevated contract prices and a limited choice of supply have been sources of constant \ncomplaint among manufacturers.\nShell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said the project would support up to 400 jobs and create opportunities for \ncontractors and local suppliers.\n\"At its core, this project promotes stronger regional communities, and it also has wider benefits for Australian \nmanufacturing and industry more broadly,\" said Ms Wake.\nShell said the project was underpinned by a 27-year sales deal between Arrow and QGC, a division of the London-\nbased oil and gas giant. In investor briefings last year, the company flagged that it would secure additional gas for \nits LNG facilities in Queensland \"to increase value for shareholders\". The second phase of the project will require \nthe construction of 27 kilometres of pipelines, as well as other infrastructure upgrades.\nIt is opposed by farming families and landholders in the Darling Downs, who said they were worried about the risk \nof damage to water and land. The project is also opposed by environmental groups, concerned about increased \nemissions from fossil fuel production.\nThe go-ahead comes despite years of annual losses by Arrow. The company had originally intended to develop four \nLNG export projects in Queensland but abandoned those plans after the first three plants were built.\nShell later took over BG Group in one of the biggest takeovers in the oil sector, giving it ownership of one of those \nthree plants, Queensland Curtis LNG.\nIt opted to use gas from the Arrow project to instead supply that plant, a major facility near Gladstone, Queensland \nthat was completed in 2014.\nArrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said production from this second phase was expected to start in 2026. \nConstruction will begin later this year. Surat is expected to comprise up to 2500 gas wells and produce 4000 \npetajoules of gas in total.\n\"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify \nArrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast,\" Mr Peng said in a statement.\nLoad-Date: August 15, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Angela Macdonald-Smith\nDate: August 13, 2024\nTitle: Shell, PetroChina plan to expand Surat gas project\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Shell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Angela Macdonald-Smith\n### Date: September 10, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nShell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes\nShell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes\nAustralian Financial Review\nSeptember 10, 2024 Tuesday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Elixir, chaired by coal seam gas entrepreneur Richard Cottee, late last month \nreported a successful flow of gas to the surface from its Daydream-2 well in the area.\nOmega, which is backed by Queensland coal seam gas pioneer Tri-Star Group and Brian Flannery's Ilwella Group, \nis now moving the rig used by Shell for its wells to its Canyon site where it expects to start drilling a well on \nSeptember 20 to test the flow of gas in its acreage for the first time.\n\"If we're successful here this could be the next big wave of development post the coal seam gas wave,\" said \nOmega CEO Trevor Brown, a former vice president geoscience at Santos.\nHe said that while the Beetaloo Basin was more advanced in terms of proving up the flow of gas, the Taroom \nTrough had several compelling reasons that gave it a quantifiable commercial advantage.\nLoad-Date: September 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Angela Macdonald-Smith\nDate: September 10, 2024\nTitle: Shell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: 'Perverse': Woodside, Shell spend millions getting into offset game\n## Media outlet: WA Today\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: September 18, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 4\n'Perverse': Woodside, Shell spend millions getting into offset game\n'Perverse': Woodside, Shell spend millions getting into offset game\nWA Today\nSeptember 18, 2024 Wednesday 12:13 AM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
