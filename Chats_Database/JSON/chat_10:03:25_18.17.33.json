Far from it.\nBut in the biggest shake-up of Fortescue's structure and strategy in several years, Forrest has put Fortescue's \nlong-held target of 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 on the backburner, and \"de-prioritised\" several \ngreen hydrogen projects in the $70 billion giant's pipeline.\nIn a series of moves that will be welcomed by investors, but provide more evidence of how the global energy \ntransition is spluttering, Fortescue will also slash 700 jobs by bringing its mining and energy divisions under one \nroof, eliminating duplication of corporate functions, and some layers of management.\nForrest will not countenance the idea that this is some sort of retreat or even a pivot; his determination to turn \nFortescue into what he calls the world's go-to company for green solutions - green metals, green energy and green \ntechnology - remains as strong as ever.\nBut the changes announced yesterday speak to both the reality of an energy transition that has been stalled by \ncost-of-living worries and rising energy prices caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle \nEast, and caution among some Fortescue investors about the prospective returns from the company's green \nenergy strategy.\nIn June, US fund manager Capital Group sold more than $1.4 billion of Fortescue shares, ceasing to be a \nsubstantial shareholder in a move some read as a reaction to Fortescue's strategic shift.\nForrest insists that the 15 million-tonne green hydrogen target remains a big part of Fortescue's ultimate plan, and \nhe's personally disappointed that the rest of the world - particularly the \"weenies\" in the traditional energy sector - \nare \"not seeing as clearly what I am seeing, which is that the world must turn away from fossil fuels\".\nBut in what will be music to the ears of the market, Forrest says the company is determined to maintain financial \ndiscipline.\nPage 2 of 3\nReality bites for Forrest's dream\n\"We are not going to swim against the tide,\" he says. \"The tide is the Australian government, every government, \nevery leader, every president, every energy minister I've met around the world in the last three years saying 'we've \ngot to get energy prices down'.\n\"Now, in that environment, you're not going to bring on major sources of green hydrogen, which relies on cheap \nenergy prices.\n\"We're going to stay where we know we can win, and that's green electricity. We'll be producing 15 million tonnes \n[of green hydrogen] and more. But to get there, we're going to make sure that the supply chain's right.\"\nThe pressure on the global green hydrogen sector is building. On Tuesday night, the European Court of Auditors \nreleased a report that found despite the European Union pumping (EURO)18.8 billion ($30.45 billion) into the \nsector, its target of importing 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 was unrealistic and \"not really founded \nupon the capacity at hand\".\nForrest remains a believer in the ability of green hydrogen to replace fossil fuel, but says Fortescue will not \"put the \nhorse behind the cart\" by pushing ahead with green hydrogen projects where the economics don't stack up due to \npersistently high electricity prices.\nGreen hydrogen projects on Fortescue's books, including in the US, Canada, the Democratic Republic of Congo \nand South Australia, will now be put on hold while the company pushes ahead with five key projects. Three of these \n- a $US550 million ($817 billion) liquefied green hydrogen facility in Arizona; its $US150 million Queensland plant at \nGladstone, which is aiming to produce green hydrogen next year; and its $US50 million green iron project at \nChristmas Creek in the Pilbara, which seeks to produce 1500 tonnes of green iron from green hydrogen - have \nalready been approved by the board and are under way.\nTwo more - a green hydrogen project in Norway and another in Brazil - are in the feasibility phase, but have now \nbeen prioritised because both countries have access to abundant, cheap, renewable energy.\nNo changes to Fortescue's capital expenditure forecasts were announced yesterday.\nThe announcement of 700 jobs cuts will not make for a very happy birthday for some at the company, which \ncelebrates the 21st anniversary of its founding today.\nBut Forrest, who says no management team ever likes announcing job losses, is adamant the redundancies do not \nreflect pressure on iron ore prices or the spluttering energy transition, but are instead part of an evolution of the \ngroup.\nIt was necessary, he says, to originally set Fortescue Energy up as a sort of internal start-up, with its own \ninfrastructure and teams. This was, in part, because the miner was \"fat and happy\" and some inside the company \ncould not see the need to shake up its highly successful mining business.\nBut with the two sides of the business now working closely together - particularly on the push to decarbonise \nFortescue's existing iron ore operations by 2030, a target Forrest clearly hopes to beat - he says the need for two \nsilos is gone.\n\"This is not to jam operating costs down, it's to streamline this organisation and keep the genius of simplicity,\" he \nsays.\nDespite the embrace of a \"one Fortescue\" model, Forrest will continue with two chief executives: metals boss Dino \nOtranto, and energy boss Mark Hutchinson.\nForrest says the leaders will be able to access resources as needed from a reshuffled corporate team led by chief \nfinancial officer Apple Paget (who moves into the role permanently after acting in the position since last August); \nchief operating officer Shelley Robertson (who has been promoted from chief corporate officer); and Mona Gill, who \nassumes the role of company secretary from Phil McKeiver.",

[The Advertiser, Nick Evans, July 18, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has abandoned its ambitious target of producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year by 2030, signaling a major retreat from its clean energy goals and raising doubts about the feasibility of its transition away from iron ore. [The Australian, Nick Evans, July 18, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s decision to scale back its hydrogen ambitions is a blow to the Australian government\u2019s plan to become a hydrogen superpower, which has been supported by more than $8 billion in taxpayer-funded incentives, raising concerns about the effectiveness of government subsidies in driving the industry forward. [Australian Financial Review, Peter Ker, Angela Macdonald-Smith, July 18, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s job cuts and restructuring efforts come amid a period of rapid executive turnover, with key figures such as energy executive Eva Hanly and marketing director Vivienne Tieu leaving the company, continuing a pattern of high leadership instability. [Australian Financial Review, Peter Ker, Angela Macdonald-Smith, July 18, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s retreat from its green hydrogen ambitions has caused significant reputational damage, as the company had spent years making big promises to developing nations about the economic transformation green hydrogen would bring, many of which will now go unfulfilled. [The Australian, Nick Evans, July 18, 2024].  \n\n- Investors and analysts have criticized Fortescue for ignoring warnings about the feasibility of its hydrogen plans, with many experts, including its own staff, having raised concerns about the strategy before the company was forced to scale back its ambitions. [The Australian, Nick Evans, July 18, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has spent hundreds of millions of dollars exploring green hydrogen and ammonia projects worldwide but has only made three final investment decisions, with one being a small-scale pilot plant, highlighting the slow progress and potential financial risks of its renewable energy strategy. [The Australian, Graham Lloyd, July 18, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s decision to shelve its 15-million-tonne green hydrogen target by 2030 leaves the Australian government with a major gap in its renewable energy transition plans, as billions in public subsidies were directed toward hydrogen development, raising concerns about the broader impact of Fortescue\u2019s retreat from the sector.
