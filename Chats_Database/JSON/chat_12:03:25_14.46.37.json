Not as rare as pearl but with its tactile silkiness is \nthe nacre shell, Pinctada maxima or mother of pearl. Ancient Egyptians were using it in at least 4200BC and pieces \nhave been found in pyramids and tombs of the ruling classes. Closer to home, it has also been important in the \nTorres Strait and New Guinea cultures as intricately carved talismans and adornments.\nThen in 1869, the financial value of the shells was discovered almost by accident. Legend has it that Tudu Islanders \nshowed \"Tongutapu Joe\", a Pacific Islander working for Captain William Banner, a rich patch of pearl shell on the \nWarrior Reefs. There was an immediate rush by the Pacific Islander-crewed boats to Torres Strait to dive for the \nnew high-profit commodity.\nThe coveted large gold-lipped shell was already known in Europe and America as a luxury product. Pearl buttons \nwere made from Torres shells as well as spoons, knife handles, inlays in fine furniture, inkwells, snuff boxes, fans \nand card cases.\nTorres Strait Islander participation began immediately, and men from Mabuiag, Tudu and other places in the central \nand eastern parts of Torres Strait were the first to get involved. Records show that within three years 500 Pacific \nIslanders were working in Torres Strait on pearling luggers. These men, many from the Loyalty Islands of New \nCaledonia and from Vanuatu and Rotumah, were the first speakers of a new language: Beach-la-Mar, or Pacific \nPidgin English. The labour force for boat-handling, work on the shell-stations, and diving also included Malays, \nFilipinos and Japanese. It was a melting pot of Asian and Pacific cultures driven by a beautiful shell.\nInitially the shells in the shallow waters were harvested from the luggers by breath-holding free divers from what \nwere known as \"swimming boats\". The divers would toss the shells into the jib-and-mizzen craft. They were \nassisted by wooden goggle-shaped glasses, which fitted tightly around the eyes for protection and to prevent water \ninterfering with the diver's vision, but nothing protected them from shark attacks.\nPage 2 of 2\nRush down the Strait to lug up pearl shells\nThen, as the shallow reefs were depleted, the more complex method of diving suits were needed to go deeper. By \n1871, a diving suit was designed, allowing access down to 20 fathoms (about 37m). The divers risked their lives in \nrubberised canvas suits, heavy boots laden with lead, and helmets with thick glass. The divers were paid according \nto the amount of shell they collected, so every minute on the bottom was precious. Their lives were in the hands of \nthe tenders above, who operated the air pumps to keep them alive. By the end of the 1930s, divers were going \ndown to 40 fathoms in areas such as the eerily named Darnley Deeps. The \"bends\", or decompression sickness, \nkilled many divers who diced with death to collect as many shells as possible. Cyclones were also a threat to the \nsafety of the pearling fleets, with one cyclone in 1899 sinking more than 50 luggers, and killing 300 men.\nThe pearling luggers were gaff-rigged ketches constructed of wood measuring 15m-20m in length, with low waists \nand bulwarks to assist diving. The two-masted and vividly coloured pearling luggers with their graceful curved lines \nwere a magnificent sight as they entered the open sea under full sail. There were many hundreds of luggers \nworking across the north of Australia, from Thursday Island to Broome, many of the luggers built by Japanese \nshipwrights who set up business.\nPenguin at the Queensland Maritime Museum is a Thursday Island style of pearling lugger, built by Japanese \nboatbuilder Tsugitaro Furuta from Osaka. Like most of the luggers, Penguin was requisitioned by the Royal \nAustralian Navy in WWII to assist the war effort in coastal defence work in the north. After the war, the invention of \nplastics marked the end of the industry and only a handful of the luggers survived. \"Penguin is the only lugger of its \nkind left in the world,\" said John Hockings, descendant of Thursday Island pearling \"royalty\" whose family ran a \nfleet of 21 luggers from 1868 to 1971. \"I spoke the Pacific pidgin as a child, it was the first truly multicultural \ncommunity.\" Penguin is being restored by an enthusiastic group of volunteers at the Museum.\nJohn Mitchell, of Holland Park, recalls his father working on the engines of the luggers that were introduced in the \n1930s. \"After the war, Dad left the Air Force and worked as an onboard mechanic for the luggers. They were \nserviced in the South Brisbane Dry Dock and he sailed with them back to the Strait,\" he said. \"I went with him once \nto Broome and we just slept on the deck - great fun for a kid.\" The Queensland Pearling exhibition is at the \nQueensland Maritime Museum until February 14.\nCONTACT JAYNE KEOGH If you have an idea for a Way We Were feature or want to get in contact, email Jayne \nKeogh at waywewere@news.com.au\nLoad-Date: January 25, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
