[Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has never had an Indigenous land use agreement with the Yindjibarndi people, despite mining on their land for over a decade, leading to a $500 million compensation claim for unpaid royalties, interest, and damages for cultural and spiritual losses, which could result in a significant financial and reputational impact on the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued in court that compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should not be based on the value of the minerals extracted from their land, despite industry standards where native title holders receive a percentage of royalties, raising concerns about the company's approach to Indigenous compensation. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest held private meetings in a Perth park with Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation leader Michael Woodley in an attempt to settle a billion-dollar compensation case, but the talks failed as the parties remain hundreds of millions of dollars apart, highlighting the ongoing dispute and lack of resolution. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue is facing a potential $1 billion compensation claim from the Yindjibarndi people, including $500 million for economic losses and an additional $500 million for the destruction of more than 240 culturally significant sites, which could have major financial and reputational consequences for the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue was left exposed to the Yindjibarndi compensation claim in 2020 after the High Court denied the company special leave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings, which found that a large part of its Solomon iron ore mining hub was built without permission from traditional owners, raising legal and ethical concerns about its operations. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued that any compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should be funded by the State of Western Australia because it granted the mining tenements, but the WA government maintains that Fortescue should pay, creating further uncertainty over the company's financial liability. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Institutional investors are increasingly avoiding Fortescue, making it the least-held stock among the 10 largest companies on the ASX, with concerns over its lower iron ore grades, high executive turnover, and heavy spending on unprofitable green hydrogen projects. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been ranked as the \"least-loved\" stock among major Australian companies in a JPMorgan survey of 50 fund managers, reflecting ongoing skepticism about its business strategy and financial stability. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Analysts and brokers have been bearish on Fortescue for an extended period, with most maintaining a sell rating on the stock since November 2022, in contrast to competitors BHP and Rio Tinto, which have never held a majority sell rating since at least 2009. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue lost its final buy rating in January after JPMorgan's head of Australian resources advised investors to take profits, with the stock subsequently falling more than 10% from its peak in early February, raising concerns about its valuation and future performance. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's unconventional management style under Andrew Forrest has left the investment community baffled, with concerns that the company's entrepreneurial approach lacks the structured management seen in competitors like BHP and Rio Tinto. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been criticized for its approach to Indigenous compensation, with an expert witness arguing in court that the company\u2019s attempt to exclude the value of minerals from compensation calculations is \"nonsensical\" and unfair to the Yindjibarndi people. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue began mining at the Solomon hub in 2013 without an agreement from the Yindjibarndi\u2019s registered native title body and instead dealt with a breakaway group, raising ethical concerns about its treatment of traditional owners. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has slammed the Biden administration\u2019s proposed hydrogen incentive rules, arguing that they could triple the cost of low-carbon hydrogen projects and stifle growth in the sector, potentially impacting the company\u2019s green energy ambitions. [Australian Financial Review, Peter Ker, April 22, 2024]. - Fortescue's iron ore shipments fell 6% in the March quarter compared to the same period last year due to a derailment in late December and weather disruptions, raising concerns about the company's logistics resilience and ability to meet its full-year shipment targets. [The Age, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's Iron Bridge project continues to face significant operational issues, with a faulty water pipeline and plant inefficiencies slowing output, forcing the company to undertake costly repairs and reconfigure its processing plant, which could delay production targets. [The Age, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has forecast that its full-year iron ore shipments will likely come in at the lower end of its guidance range due to operational setbacks, including a derailment and adverse weather, which could impact revenue and investor confidence. [Seeking Alpha, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's Iron Bridge magnetite project has suffered another production downgrade, with expected shipments now reduced to just 2 million tonnes, significantly below previous guidance, highlighting ongoing challenges in ramping up the project. [The Australian, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's iron ore exports dropped 11% from the December quarter, and the decline in shipments pushed up average C1 cash costs by 7% to $18.93 per tonne, increasing operational expenses and potentially squeezing profit margins. [The Australian, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue will need to maintain near-record export rates to meet its full-year shipment guidance, requiring an ambitious 53.5 million tonnes in the June quarter, which may be difficult given recent logistical and operational setbacks. [The Daily Telegraph, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's Gibson Island hydrogen project has been sidelined despite receiving a $13.7 million government grant, with the company citing high Australian power prices as a major obstacle, raising doubts about the financial viability of its domestic green hydrogen ambitions.

It includes energy and water-intensive \nindustries such as silicon chip manufacturing, with Arizona coming from nowhere to fourth place among US states. \nApologists for the Albanese government might look for excuses in the global subsidy arms race unleashed by the \nBiden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. They might claim Arizona has easy access to a much bigger market.\nYet Arizona's hi-tech manufacturing boom started before Biden came to power and came at the expense of \nneighbouring California, where manufacturing is declining.\nIt isn't hard to work out why. Arizona's top state income tax rate is 2.98 per cent. California's is 13.3 per cent. \nCorporate tax in Arizona is 6.96 per cent compared to 8.84 per cent in California. For energy-hungry industries such \nas hydrogen and the IT sector, however, the biggest attraction is the industrial electricity price: 7.47 cents a kWh in \nArizona compared to 18 cents in California.\nAlbanese continues to talk a big game, promising jobs, industry and prosperity will flourish under the Future Made \nin Australia Act. Details are scarce, but the PM told ABC's 7.30 this month there would be new government \nprograms attached to the Act, as well as a recalibration of old ones.\nYet the long history of manufacturing decline in the past 50 years is a story of broken promises and failed industry \nwelfare programs. The Hawke government's generosity in granting $36m to the Kodak film factory in Victoria in \n1988 (roughly $100m in today's money) failed to stop the introduction of digital cameras or development of the \nsmartphone. Hundreds of millions of dollars thrown at the car industry failed to save the Holden Commodore. \nIndeed, evidence that industry assistance programs work as intended is difficult to find.\nIt's more than three decades since Bob Hawke's Labor government eschewed industry protectionism as a means to \nmake Australia globally competitive. Yet governments, state and federal, of both political persuasions, have found it \ndifficult to go cold turkey. The federal government's guide to grants lists 330 different types of industry assistance. \nIn 2019, the last year before Covid-19, the Productivity Commission calculated total government assistance to \nbusinesses at $13.9bn in tariff assistance, tax concessions and direct grants.\nThat is why we can say with some certainty that more government grants are no substitute for the economic \ndiscipline practised by the Republican administrations of governors Jan Brewer and Doug Ducey or the far-sighted \ndecision of the Arizona government in the 1980s in overseeing the construction of the second-largest nuclear \nreactor in the US. The 3.9GW Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station remains the backbone of the Arizona \nelectricity grid, producing some of the cheapest power in the country.\nAlbanese is hardly the first prime minister to enter office who has failed to learn from King Canute, instead suffering \nfrom the delusion that getting your hand on the levers of state gives you the power to alter the tides. The outgoing \ntide of deindustrialisation shows no sign of abating.

However, \n45V, in its current form, is a straitjacket on the industry and works against the Biden administration's own climate \ngoals,\" he said. Dr Forrest said the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act was helping the US make serious \nstrides towards decarbonising its economy, but said the proposed rules were \"fine print shoved into the IRA \nlegislation to do everything it can to kill off what is the saviour in energy for humanity and every organic life on \nEarth\".\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest slams US hydrogen regime\n\"You deserve much better than faceless people wandering around with chequebooks full of lobbying money, putting \nin a landmine into the law which is getting green hydrogen off the ground,\" he said.\n\"That landmine is put in by fossil fuel lobbyists - they masquerade as environmentalists and I can tell you they're \nnot, I can tell you that they're paid for by the fossil fuel sector.\" Fortescue ticked off on the development of the \nArizona hydrogen project late last year. The company plans to spend $US550m ($837m) building a plant capable of \nproducing 11,000 tonnes of liquid hydrogen a year for sale to the heavy transport -industry.\nScheduled to begin production in 2026, Fortescue has said the plant will be supplied by utility Arizona Public \nService with \"new sources of wind and solar generation under its regulated extra high load factor tariff, together with \ngreen attributes under its Green Power Partners program\".\nThe Arizona grid was still dominated by fossil fuel generation in 2022, however, according to the US Energy \nInformation Administration.\nAbout 42 per cent of the state's net energy generation came from natural gas plants, with 12 per cent from coal-\nfired power stations. Another 29 per cent came from nuclear generation, and 16 per cent coming from solar, wind \nand hydro-electric sources.
