Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 24\nLength: 1041 words\nByline: Cecile Lefort\nBody\nA bet on Fortescue when the iron ore miner was in deep trouble is one of the proudest moments of fund manager \nSean Sequeira's career.\nIt was early 2016 and Fortescue had just posted its earnings result.\n\"Everyone thought it was going bankrupt,\" says the Australian Eagle Asset Management chief investment officer \nand portfolio manager. But Sequeira saw something that many of his peers had missed: strong cash flow and \nconsistent progress in debt reduction. And all that was happening in spite of low iron ore prices, which were \nhovering at about $US39 a tonne.\n\"We thought the risks were overblown, and the opportunity was presenting itself for the potential upside on a world-\nclass asset that the market was overlooking,\" he says.\nIron ore is now trading at $US106 a tonne.\nJust as importantly, Sequeira, then deputy to chief investment officer Albert Hung, also noted the dramatic \nimprovement in Fortescue's so-called C1 unit costs, the primary measure of expenses for an iron ore producer. \nThey had fallen below that of mining giant BHP. For the investment team, this was the development they had been \nlooking for. The fund scooped up the stock at $1.60 a share and the bet paid off.\nSix years later, Fortescue stock climbed to $25. That's when Australian Eagle started to reduce its stake, and \nagain in 2023, arguably too early, as Fortescue's share price hit $29.30 a year later.\nTakeover target Altium was also a big moment in Sequeira's 30-year career. The fund had built a stake of more \nthan 5 per cent in the company, which designs printed circuit boards used in electronics. The investment manager \nfirst bought the stock in 2017 at $11, emboldened by the \"superb\" 10-year track record of Altium's management \nteam. Their new five-year business plan looked just as promising, with ambitious expansion into new markets \nplanned.\nPage 2 of 3\nIt's all about change - the good and the bad; Monday Fundie\nHappily, a bigger player recognised that potential and took Altium out. Japanese semiconductor company Renesas \nElectronics offered $9.1 billion for Altium at $68.50 a share. The stock was delisted last year.\n\"Even in our best scenarios, we didn't come out with that type of price,\" recalls Sequeira.\nAustralian Eagle, which used to be Alleron, is a boutique investment manager focused on large-cap Australian \nequities. Its team of seven oversees $1.1 billion across a long-only fund and a long-short fund, meaning it can bet \non share prices going down.\nThe fund's signature strategy is to identify signs of change in a business - good and bad - and anticipate what this \nmeans for earnings growth or quality.\n\"We want that improvement to be the thing that drives our investment returns and what will affect the company over \nthe next three or five years,\" explains Sequeira. This means Australian Eagle typically holds a stock longer than its \npeers (it has owned hearing implant company Cochlear for more than 20 years). Investments typically start as a \nsmall position - 1 per cent - and build over time.\nLikewise, when things look bad it's time to exit or even short the stock.\nAustralian Eagle will cut its losses and move fast when companies don't meet its expectations. \"We get out \nrelatively quickly because that means we don't know what's going on,\" Sequeira says.\nThe long-only strategy has a 20-year track record and returned 12 per cent before fees since inception, compared \nwith the S&P/ASX 100 Accumulation Index's 8.4 per cent. The fund is only available to wholesale investors.\nThe long-short strategy, after fees, has returned 14.6 per cent a year on average, or 4.1 percentage points above \nthe benchmark. As well as Cochlear, it owns QBE Insurance and Telix Pharmaceuticals.\nA short bet on Paladin Energy and a long position in infrastructure investment company Infratil were among the \nbiggest detractors in January.\nIn 2022, Australian Eagle partnered with Montgomery Investment Management to manage its Australian large-cap \nportfolios and distribute the Australian Eagle long-short fund to a broader set of investors.\nSequeira is bullish on property developer Dexus, and nuclear and silicon enrichment technology company Silex \nSystems. The stocks are among the portfolio's most undervalued companies, in his opinion, and a reason the fund \nincreased its stake in both last month.\nSequeira expects big returns from Dexus should management execute its strategy of growing funds under \nmanagement.\nAs for Silex, in which the fund holds a tiny position, Sequeira anticipates significant benefits should its laser \ntechnology be proven or adopted by the United States to counter Russian dominance in the sector.\nIn September last year, Sequeira sold Ramsay Healthcare shares after realising the company would not succeed \nas quickly as the fund hoped in a strategic turnaround. Australian Eagle had bought Ramsay shares on the belief \nthat the private hospital operator would rationalise its asset base by selling assets in Europe. But when Ramsay's \nmanagement team decided to keep them, the fund manager exited at $43.\n\"We started a small position that didn't work out according to our plan, and we got out at a small loss,\" says \nSequeira, who bought in at $54 in 2023.\nAs chief investment officer, he has final say in all portfolio decisions.\nGrowing up in the western Sydney suburb of Pendle Hill, Sequeira wanted to be a petroleum engineer until he got a \ntaste for financial markets working at Citibank after his year 12 exams.Page 3 of 3\nIt's all about change - the good and the bad; Monday Fundie\nCrossing over into investment management he was mentored by Hung, one of the founders of Australian Eagle and \nstill a sounding board as chairman of the investment firm. Sequeira was part of the team that started out in 2005 \nwith $15 million in seed money from St George Bank. This month, the fund celebrated its 20-year anniversary.\nOne of his biggest regrets is having sold out of software company Technology One too soon. He first bought the \nstock in 2006 at 70\u00a2 and sold it at $1 in 2010, only to watch Technology One transform into a $10 billion company. \nLast year, Australian Eagle decided to buy back in at $16.50.\nThe team is still reviewing what it missed in the first run.\nFor Sequeira, selling too early is more painful than getting a stock wrong because the missed opportunity is more \ncostly to portfolio performance than divesting at a small loss. \"That's something you learn from,\" he says.\nLoad-Date: February 26, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Sean Sequeira | Chief Investment Officer, Australian Eagle Asset Management | \"Everyone thought it was going bankrupt.\" | N.A. |\n| Sean Sequeira | Chief Investment Officer, Australian Eagle Asset Management | \"We thought the risks were overblown, and the opportunity was presenting itself for the potential upside on a world-class asset that the market was overlooking.\" | N.A. |\n| Sean Sequeira | Chief Investment Officer, Australian Eagle Asset Management | \"The dramatic improvement in Fortescue's so-called C1 unit costs, the primary measure of expenses for an iron ore producer.\" | N.A. |\n| Sean Sequeira | Chief Investment Officer, Australian Eagle Asset Management | \"We get out relatively quickly because that means we don't know what's going on.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
