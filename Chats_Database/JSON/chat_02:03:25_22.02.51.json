It operates in the Renewable energy, with a prefered focus on the Netherlands market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Orsted based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Orsted is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Orsted.\n\nIf Orsted is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nEurope: Equinor acquires 9.8% stake in offshore wind company Orsted\nEurope: Equinor acquires 9.8% stake in offshore wind company Orsted\nEnergy: Ukraine and the world\nOctober 8, 2024 Tuesday\nCopyright 2024 Business World Agency All Rights Reserved\nLength: 405 words\nBody\nNorway's Equinor has bought a 9.8 percent stake, valued at about $2.5 billion, in Danish offshore wind farm \ndeveloper Orsted as it seeks to build out its renewable energy portfolio, Reuters reports.\nOrsted shares have fallen 69% from their 2021 all-time high as the offshore wind sector has faced soaring costs \nand technical problems with turbines.\nBut Equinor said its stake acquisition was a long-term bet on the sector after the Norwegian company made slow \nprogress in achieving its ambitious renewable energy targets.\nThe deal will be factored into Equinor's renewable energy portfolio , adding 1.7GW of clean generation capacity to \nthe company's target of 12-16GW by 2030, Chief Executive Anders Opedal told Reuters .\nBy the end of 2023, the company had less than 1 GW of installed renewable capacity.\n\"We see this as a good countercyclical move at this time to get a very attractive portfolio,\" Opedahl added .\nOrsted's share price rose more than 8% on the news before paring gains to rise 5.8% at 13:00 GMT. Equinor \nshares fell 3.9%.\nEquinor said it does not plan to increase its stake by more than 10% and will not seek board representation.\nThe world's largest offshore wind developer was hit last year by costs and project delays as inflation pushed up \nprices for turbines and other equipment and services.\n\" The offshore wind industry currently faces a number of challenges, but we remain confident in the long-term \nprospects of the sector and the critical role offshore wind will play in the energy transition,\" he said.\nEquinor's ownership position has been built over time through a combination of market purchases and block trades, \nthe company said.\nPage 2 of 2\nEurope: Equinor acquires 9.8% stake in offshore wind company Orsted\nThe investment makes Equinor the second largest shareholder in Orsted after Denmark.\nIn a bid to restore investor confidence, Orsted in February cut its investment and capacity targets and suspended \ndividend payments as part of a major review.\n\"Structurally, this does not change anything for the direction in which Orsted is moving ,\" said a Sydbank analyst. \nJacob Pedersen .\nHe said the company had broad political support in Denmark and there was no sign that the state would give up its \n51% stake.\nDenmark attracts Goldman Sachs as a strategic shareholder 10 years ago when the company, formerly DONG \nEnergy , was focused on oil and gas. The Wall Street bank doubled its 8 billion crown investment just two years \nlater when Orsted went public in Copenhagen in 2016.
