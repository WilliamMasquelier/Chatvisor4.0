Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Street Talk; Pg. 16\nLength: 304 words\nByline: Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood and Emma Rapaport\nBody\nThere's never a dull moment in Australia's listed gold sector.\nStreet Talk understands the $71 million Brightstar Resources and the $24 million Alto Metals are set to merge in an \nall-scrip deal. The shares will be exchanged on a one-for-four basis, giving Brightstar a circa 66.6 per cent \nownership of the combined entity.\nAs part of the deal, Canaccord Genuity and Argonaut will seek to raise about $20 million from investors, sources \nsaid.\nAlto's Sandstone project in Western Australia has been producing gold since the 19th century and has a 17.6 \nmillion tonne mineral resource estimate at 1.5 grams per tonne. It is next door to Westgold's Big Bell mine and \nRamelius' Mount Magnet. The small-cap had long been seen as a takeover target - the now $1.2 billion Westgold \nResources held a 14 per cent stake in 2022, while China's Shandong Goldsea Group Co tabled a bid in 2020.\nMerger partner Brightstar is led by Alex Rovira, who was previously a banker at Canaccord. It is drilling at the Cork \nTree Well deposit in WA's Laverton. Sources said the company has been hunting for acquisitions.\nThe tie-up comes as ASX-listed gold stocks remain a reliable source of M&A activity for bankers and investors, at a \ntime when deals have dried up in lithium and nickel amid a slump in commodity prices. Established gold players are \nbeing driven by a need to replace ageing mines, while juniors are exploring combinations to secure their future.\nAt the bigger end of the town, Westgold has acquired Toronto-listed Karora Resources - despite attempts from \nRamelius Resources to kibosh the deal. Earlier in the year, Red5 and Silver Lake agreed to a $2.2 billion merger.\nRamelius, for its part, has been scoping out targets. Recently it raided WA explorer Spartan Resources' register \nfor a 17.94 per cent stake after an unsuccessful tilt at Karora.\nLoad-Date: August 3, 2024\nPage 2 of 2\nBrightstar, Alto Metals agree to merge; kick off $20m raise Street Talk\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**ENTITY**: [Organization Name]\n**TYPE**: [Type of organization - e.g., Company, Government Agency, NGO, etc.]\n**DESCRIPTION**: [Brief description of how the entity is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**ENTITY**: Tesla, Inc.\n**TYPE**: Company\n**DESCRIPTION**: Main subject of article, discussing Q4 earnings report\n\nOnly include entities that are meaningful to the article's content.
