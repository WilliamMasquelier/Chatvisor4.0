Expectations are that once \nthe panel examines the application, it will be thrown out. Ramelius closed down 7 per cent on Wednesday and \nWestgold up 6.5 per cent.\nLoad-Date: May 29, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Shareholders see compromise on the cards as BHP continues discussions with Anglo American - DATA ROOM\n## The Australian\n### Bridget Carter\n### May 30, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Ramelius Resources, to report.
