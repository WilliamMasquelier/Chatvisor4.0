Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"I am personally delighted Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-examination.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"The fossil-fuel industry know they are on borrowed time and that technological solutions exist to phase out fossil fuels.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"If the company I founded, Fortescue, one of Australia's biggest polluters and most successful companies can profitably cease the use of fossil fuels and go 'real zero' by 2030 - in just five years - heavy industry will be quick to follow.\" | N.A. |\n| Fortescue spokesman | Not mentioned | \"While the world was in turmoil in 2021, Fortescue seized the opportunity to meet with governments around the world to begin its green transformation and this has been pivotal to setting the company up for its future success.\" | N.A. |\n| Fortescue spokesman | Not mentioned | \"Fortescue has an industry-leading plan to stop burning fossil fuels and achieve 'real zero' across its Australian iron ore operations by the end of the decade.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
