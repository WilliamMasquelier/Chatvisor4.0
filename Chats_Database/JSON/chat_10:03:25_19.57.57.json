            "content": "Michael Woodley holds a predominantly critical stance towards Fortescue, emphasizing concerns over impartiality, environmental accountability, and fair compensation for the Yindjibarndi people. His views have remained consistent over time, advocating for stronger regulatory oversight and equitable financial recognition for traditional owners. These opinions could negatively impact Fortescue\u2019s reputation by increasing public and regulatory scrutiny, potentially leading to legal or financial consequences. While most of his statements reflect a negative sentiment, his acknowledgment of court-established royalties suggests a recognition of progress, albeit with the expectation that Fortescue must comply with these obligations.",
