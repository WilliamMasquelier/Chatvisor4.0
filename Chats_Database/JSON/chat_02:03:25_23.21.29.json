Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Rasmus Errboe | CEO of \u00d8rsted | \"We zullen moeten afwachten hoe de nieuwe minister van energie het presidentieel decreet om vergunningen in te trekken interpreteert.\" | \"We will have to wait and see how the new Minister of Energy interprets the presidential decree to revoke permits.\" |\n| Rasmus Errboe | CEO of \u00d8rsted | \"We brengen ons investeringsprogramma tot 2030 terug door strikter te kijken waar we ons kapitaal inzetten.\" | \"We are scaling back our investment program until 2030 by being stricter about where we allocate our capital.\" |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Orsted.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Orsted or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
