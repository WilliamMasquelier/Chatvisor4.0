Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Deborah Caudle | CFO of Fortescue's energy division | \"We thank Deborah Caudle for her fantastic contribution to Fortescue and wish her the very best.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Chairman of Fortescue | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Former CFO of Fortescue's clean energy division | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n| Guy Debelle | Former CFO of Fortescue's clean energy division | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n| Felicity Gooding | Former CFO of Fortescue's clean energy division | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n| Ian Wells | Former CFO of Fortescue's mining and energy divisions | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n| Christine Morris | Former CFO of Fortescue's minerals division | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
