Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's Chairman | \"If Fortescue and its talismanic leader Andrew Forrest can convince those Peruvian communities to host a copper mine, the Perth company might be on to a bargain.\" | N.A. |\n| Joanne Freeze | Alta Copper's Founder and Former CEO | \"Fortescue flexed its muscle at the Alta Copper annual meeting in June, voting four of the seven directors off the board in a bid to 'accelerate' development of the company's Canariaco copper and gold project in Peru.\" | N.A. |\n| Not mentioned | Not mentioned | \"A funny thing seems to happen to small companies once Fortescue gets on their share register: the resolutions at annual shareholder meetings become far more contested.\" | N.A. |\n| Not mentioned | Not mentioned | \"By simply spending $14 million on exploration drilling over six years, Fortescue will eventually take 75 per cent ownership of Magmatic's Myall exploration project near Narromine in NSW.\" | N.A. |\n| Not mentioned | Not mentioned | \"Fortescue may have cooled its hydrogen jets in 2024, but in December it showed it was still the world's biggest hydrogen bull, buying 39 per cent of natural hydrogen explorer Hyterra for $21.9 million.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
