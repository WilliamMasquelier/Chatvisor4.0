The sale of its final 13.3 per cent stake netted Shell about $3.5 \nbillion, but the commissioner of taxation ruled in February it had understated its profits from the sell-down.\nFederal Court filings obtained by The Australian Financial Review show the Tax Office believes the company \nshould have declared a capital gain $193.9 million higher than first flagged in the 2017 sale. It also took aim at a \n2014 share sale where it found the gain was $135.7 million higher than declared.\nShell has appealed the ruling, with a spokeswoman saying Shell \"complies with all its legal and taxation obligations \nand is committed to paying the right amount of tax in all countries in which we operate\".\n\"Shell has a co-operative relationship with the ATO, where we discuss business activity and taxation matters on a \nproactive, transparent basis,\" she said. \"It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.\"\nThe nearly $330 million in additional capital gains would, at the company tax rate of 30 per cent, mean Shell owes \nat face value $99 million to the Tax Office for the disputed years.\nThe major oil and gas producers are \"now among the largest taxpayers in Australia\", the ATO said last November.\n\"Payments from this sector have grown markedly in the 2022-23 income tax year to in excess of $11 billion,\" the \nATO said at the time. Receipts from the energy sector made up more than two-thirds of the $6.4 billion paid by \nmultinational companies in the period.\nAn ATO spokeswoman said: \"The ATO cannot comment on any current matter before the Federal Court,\" in \nresponse to Shell's appeal.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell sues ATO over disputed $99m tax bill Taxation\nThe Financial Review understands that Shell thinks its shares in Woodside should be treated at the lower amount \ndue to transitional changes to the capital gains regime that were introduced in 1997 following the acquisition of its \nstake in 1985. The matter is set for a case management hearing on July 29.\nShell is one of the world's largest oil and gas producers, and is involved in seven major domestic projects, \nincluding the Gorgon natural gas project off the coast of Western Australia.\nThe Australian outpost posted a profit of $US632.7 million ($947 million) in the 2023 calendar year, filings to the \ncorporate regulator show, less than a third of the $US2.7 billion reported only a year prior.\nThe accounts also show Shell Australia paid $US37 million in tax last year.\nLoad-Date: May 20, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Shell sues ATO over disputed $99m tax bill\n## Australian Financial Review\n### Lucas Baird\n### May 18, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Shell, to report.

Shell is contesting a $99 million tax bill from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), which claims the company understated its profits from a $3.5 billion exit from Woodside Petroleum, leading to a significant capital gains tax dispute.\n\n2. The ATO has determined that Shell should have reported a capital gain of $193.9 million more than it initially declared from the 2017 sale of its Woodside shares, as well as an additional $135.7 million from a previous share sale in 2014.\n\n3. Despite the ongoing legal battle, Shell maintains that it complies with all legal and taxation obligations, emphasizing its cooperative relationship with the ATO regarding business and taxation discussions.\n\n4. The case highlights the broader context of the oil and gas sector in Australia, which has become a significant contributor to the national tax revenue, with major producers like Shell being among the largest taxpayers, contributing over $11 billion in the 2022-23 income tax year. \n\n5. Shell's Australian operations reported a profit of $US632.7 million in 2023, a substantial decrease from the previous year's $US2.7 billion, raising concerns about the company's financial performance in the region amidst the tax dispute.",
