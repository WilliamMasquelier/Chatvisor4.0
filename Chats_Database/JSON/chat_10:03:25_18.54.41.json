Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 13\nLength: 263 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nFortescue has launched an internal investigation into a derailment that cut the supply of iron ore into its port \noperations in Western Australia.\nRail safety authorities have also been alerted to the derailment which happened between Port Hedland and the \ncompany's mines on Saturday.\nThe Fortescue rail line into Port Hedland, Australia's iron ore export epicentre, remained out of action yesterday.\nAndrew Forrest-led Fortescue said the derailment involved multiple wagons but declined to say how many or \nreveal additional details on the extent of the damage. It is understood it happened about 150 kilometres south of \nPort Hedland, but Fortescue would not comment on the location.\nA Fortescue spokeswoman said no one was injured in the incident and there was no impact on the public. \nFortescue expects to reopen the rail line today.\nIt said the derailment and four-day supply chain outage would not affect its iron ore shipments for December or the \nhalf-year to December 31. The company declined to comment on whether January shipments would be affected.\nThe Fortescue share price was at a record $29.39 yesterday, fuelled by a surge in iron ore prices and market \noptimism around the Chinese economy. Fortescue shipped 45.9 million tonnes of iron ore from Port Hedland in the \nSeptember quarter, 3 per cent lower than the same three-month period a year earlier.\nThe $89.3 billion company is targeting shipments of 192 million to 197 million tonnes in 2023-24, including about 5 \nmillion tonnes from its Iron Bridge magnetite operations connected to Port Hedland via a slurry pipeline..\nLoad-Date: January 5, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's CEO | \"Fortescue said the derailment involved multiple wagons but declined to say how many or reveal additional details on the extent of the damage.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
