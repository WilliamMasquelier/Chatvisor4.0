Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Kathy Hochul | Governor of New York | \u201cIt\u2019s great to be first, we want to make sure we\u2019re not the last. That\u2019s why we\u2019re showing other states how it can be done, why we're moving forward, on to other projects.\u201d | N.A. |\n| Mads Nipper | CEO of \u00d8rsted | \"The opening a major milestone that proves large offshore wind farms can be built, both in the United States and in other countries with little or no offshore wind energy currently.\" | N.A. |\n| David Hardy | Group Executive Vice President and CEO Americas at \u00d8rsted | \"After years of planning and development, 2024 is a year of action\u2014 building projects that will deliver sizeable amounts of clean power to the grid.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Orsted.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Orsted or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
