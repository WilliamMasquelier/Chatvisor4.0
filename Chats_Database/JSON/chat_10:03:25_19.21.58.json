The book at the bottom of the range \nwas covered on Monday night.\nThe price equates to a discount of between 8.8 per cent and 6.1 per cent to the last traded share price of $20.35.\nOn offer was about 100 million securities, or about 3.2 per cent of the shares on issue and equalled about $1.9bn in \nvalue.\nThe book build was due to close at 8pm AEST for Australian and Asia investors. Dr Forrest, the billionaire \nFortescue Metals founder, owns about 36.7 per cent of Fortescue Metals, which has a $63bn market value.\nFortescue shares are now down almost 10 per cent since the company announced a major restructure on July 17, \nwhich will see about 700 staff depart the company in a mass wave on redundancies, as Fortescue signalled a \nbackdown from the most aggressive of its green hydrogen and ammonia targets - including a plan to be producing \n15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030.\nMacquarie analysts noted last week that Fortescue's slowdown on its green energy ambitions could lead to a \nselldown by ESG-minded funds, saying that - despite widespread criticism of the lack of financial details of the \ncompany's strategy - it had helped Fortescue break free of its traditional link to iron ore prices.\nPage 2 of 2\nJPMorgan sells down $1.9bn stake in Fortescue\n\"ETFs seeking hydrogen exposure, or 'long onlys' with strong energy transition mandates may seek to reduce -\npositions on these developments and a slowing of Fortescue's -external green energy business trajectory,\" \nMacquarie analysts said in a client note.\nMacquarie said Fortescue's green energy strategy could be worth as much as $4.70 a share.\nBut the iron ore major also delivered a disappointing June quarter report last week with the company falling short of \nits annual export guidance for the year, -despite record shipments in the June period.\nWhile the export miss was relatively minor, analysts also noted that Fortescue's spending on its green projects was \nactually projected to rise for the current financial year, despite the company's announcement that it planned to cut \njobs and costs and reshape its green strategy towards green iron production and renewable energy infrastructure.\nOverseeing the block trade on Monday was JPMorgan's Jonas Troeber, who has been made the sole head of \nequity capital markets for JPMorgan in Australia.\nIt comes after his ECM co-head, Simone Haslinger, has opted to leave the bank following a period of parental \nleave.\nOther changes include Sunil Dhupelia and Peihao Huang, currently co-heads of Asia ex-Japan ECM, becoming co-\nheads of ECM for Asia Pacific. Fortescue shares have tumbled almost 30 per cent since the start of January.\nLoad-Date: July 29, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder of Fortescue Metals | \"Dr Forrest, the billionaire Fortescue Metals founder, owns about 36.7 per cent of Fortescue Metals, which has a $63bn market value.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
