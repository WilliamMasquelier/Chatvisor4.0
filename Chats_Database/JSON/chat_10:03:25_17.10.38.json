It operates in the Mining, exploration and drilling of gold, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Ramelius Resources based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Ramelius Resources is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Ramelius Resources.\n\nIf Ramelius Resources is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nTrading at near-record highs, but gold still has 'further to go' - DATA ROOM\nTrading at near-record highs, but gold still has 'further to go' - DATA ROOM\nThe Australian\nSeptember 9, 2024 Monday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 481 words\nByline: EDITED BY CAMERON ENGLAND\nBody\nPlenty of gold bugs are sitting on hefty 12-month gains across their Australian listed portfolios, but with US rates \nheading south shortly, plenty of brokers think the good times will roll on despite gold already changing hands near \nrecord prices.\nCanaccord Genuity has crunched the numbers on how gold fares as interest rates ease and says that based on \nhistorical trends there's \"more room to move\".\nOn the rates front, Canaccord says bond markets are now pricing in a 100 per cent chance the US Fed cuts in \nSeptember on weaker inflation and labour market numbers.\n\"While views are mixed on the magnitude of the cut, a pause/loosening of monetary policy will likely provide \ntailwinds for gold,\" Canaccord says. \"The last three easing cycles (i.e. tech bubble, housing bubble/GFC and \n2019/pre-Covid easing) have resulted in gold rising an average of 40 per cent (up to 73 per cent in the GFC) in the \n12 months following the last rate cut.\" Gold is already trading around record highs, but Canaccord says there's \nfurther to go, and while equities have closed on the gap on the gains to date, there's a still a disconnect based on \nhistorical ratios.\n\"Valuations remain relatively undemanding,\" they say.\n\"While all-in sustaining costs have been trending up we continue to see margin expansion across our coverage and \nwith a number of tailwinds for gold over the remainder of 2024 (rates, geopolitical risk, US debt levels, increased \nETF flows), we see further room for equities to move.\" Shaw & Partners is also bullish on gold, amusingly pointing \nout that the precious metal is trading at \"2000-year highs\", and up 30 per cent over the past year.\n\"Shaw and Partners forecast gold to hit $US3000/oz in 2025 and 2026 and we expect outperformance in ASX-listed \ngold equities to continue,\" Shaw said. Shaw is keen on Genesis Minerals in the sector and has a price target on the \nstock of $2.75 against $2.18 currently.\nPage 2 of 2\nTrading at near-record highs, but gold still has 'further to go' - DATA ROOM\nUBS has a target price of $2.25 on Genesis but that's assuming a long-term gold price of $US1950 per ounce and \nan Australian dollar exchange rate of US75c.\nCanaccord favours Evolution Mining, Northern Star Resources, Resolute Mining and Ramelius Resources among \nthe Australian gold miners. Evolution had improved balance sheet capacity and a \"unique investment offering\" given \nit also has copper exposure, with a dearth of quality copper names on the ASX.\nCashed up Northern Star also had plenty of room to move should attractive deals emerge, Canaccord said.\n\"Northern Star maintains exceptional leverage to rising gold prices, owing to the scale of its operations,\" the broker \nsaid.\n\"Its FY25 production profile is more than double the next biggest ASX gold producer ... \"Northern Star retains \n$1.5bn in available undrawn debt facilities for total liquidity of over $2.7bn. In our view, this offers the company good \noptionality around deleveraging, special dividends and potential M&A.\"\nLoad-Date: September 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Ramelius Resources.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
