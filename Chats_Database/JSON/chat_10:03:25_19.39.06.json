Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 25\nLength: 340 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nThe chief executive of Fortescue's energy division, Mark Hutchinson, has quit the board of a religious group whose \nevangelical attitudes towards sex raised concerns among employees of the mining giant last month.\nAccording to documents filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on October 29, Mr \nHutchinson is no longer a director of Alpha Australia National Office.\nAANO is the local chapter of the global religious group Alpha International, which publishes videos that tell \nteenagers Jesus wants to \"guide\" their sexuality and promotes an exclusively heterosexual, post-marital and \ngender-binary version of sex.\nRevelations that Mr Hutchinson held a leadership role at Alpha had raised concerns among some Fortescue staff, \nwho believed Alpha's preachings on sex were at odds with Fortescue's stated support for diversity.\nIn a written message to staff on October 25, Mr Hutchinson assured them that he loved diversity. He wrote another \nmessage to them on October 27 to concede that he had failed the employees by not explicitly declaring his support \nfor LGBTQIA+ people.\n\"I wish to state clearly that I am supportive of everyone in a same-sex marriage and same-sex relationships and \nvalue the LGBTQIA+ community,\" he said in the second note.\nThe documents, which were submitted to ASIC this week, said Mr Hutchinson's exit from the AANO board was \neffective from July 18, 2023.\nAt the time of publishing this article, he remained a director of the UK-registered Alpha International.\nAside from its views on sex, Alpha's video sermons also tell viewers that prayer can heal physical illnesses such as \ncancer and crossed eyes.\nFortescue chairman Andrew Forrest wrote to staff on October 27 saying that he expected the company's \nleadership to be \"resolutely\" committed to equal rights.\nPage 2 of 2\nHutchinson quits church group board Leadership\n\"If we are to stop the uncontrolled march of climate change, we need every mind at the table. Focused and free,\" he \nsaid. \"That means working relentlessly to cultivate a culture where everyone feels comfortable to bring their full self \nto work.\"\nLoad-Date: November 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Mark Hutchinson | Chief Executive of Fortescue's energy division | \"I wish to state clearly that I am supportive of everyone in a same-sex marriage and same-sex relationships and value the LGBTQIA+ community.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue Chairman | \"If we are to stop the uncontrolled march of climate change, we need every mind at the table.
