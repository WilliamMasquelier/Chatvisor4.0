Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: FEATURES; Pg. 36\nLength: 2513 words\nByline: Mark Wembridge and Tom Rabe\nBody\nIndustrial relations Changes to laws have revived the prospect of unions in 'the engine room' of the economy, write \nMark Wembridge and Tom Rabe.\nThe blazing January sun is still below the yardarm as a lingerie-clad barmaid serves $11.50 pints of icy Great \nNorthern lager to three fly in, fly out workers at the Redcliffe Tavern, a nondescript bar near Perth airport.\nShifting their gaze from the $20 notes tucked into various lacy straps, the FIFO workers turn to another burning \nissue that has been out of mind for more than three decades: unions in Western Australia's Pilbara.\nEager to down a few beers after their eight day \"swing\" at BHP's iron ore operations in Newman, Charlie, Jack and \nCody say they have been \"watching and waiting\" to see how Pilbara negotiations between unions and the big \nminers unfold.\n\"A union will mean there's a standard for everyone. No differences between what is happening on one site \ncompared to another,\" says Cody, an Indigenous man who has worked as a FIFO mine operator of excavators, \nloaders and bulldozers for more than a dozen years. \"I've got mates at FMG, at Rio [Tinto], and they're all thinking \nthe same.\"\nJack, a 25-year mining veteran with tattoos up to his chin who says FIFO work has cost him three long-term \nrelationships, nods in agreement. \"An EBA [enterprise bargaining agreement] is the big one,\" he says. \"Because \nthat's the one at the moment where a lot of companies are just walking over people. They've got no representation.\"\nChanges to industrial relations laws have revived the prospect of re-unionisation in a region dubbed \"the engine \nroom\" of Australia's economy, nearly four decades after the infamous Robe River brawl in effect eliminated \norganised labour in the Pilbara.\nMining companies, conservative politicians and corporate lobbyists say unionisation will return the Pilbara to its \nunproductive and strike-prone past, undermining tax revenue and driving investment abroad.\nPage 2 of 5\nFIFO workers mull unions' return in Pilbara\nUnions want to represent staff who work long hours on variable rosters, face workplace safety concerns and \nincidents of sexual harassment, lack widespread enterprise bargaining agreements and endure long periods away \nfrom their families.\nBut unionisation in mining is thin. Union members comprised 10 per cent of Australia's mining workforce in 2022, \ndown from 16.5 per cent in 2016, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Union membership on Australian \nmine sites was 44 per cent in 1994.\n\"In the mining industry in Australia over the past 25 years, productivity has moved sideways as wages have \ndoubled,\" says Mike Henry, chief executive of BHP, one of the Pilbara's biggest employers. \"That is not a route to \nremain competitive, and this industry has to remain competitive globally under the 'same job, same pay' policies.\"\nThe Pilbara's wealth has supercharged the fortunes of billionaires such as Gina Rinehart and Andrew Forrest, as \nwell as feathered the superannuation nests of millions of Australians.\n\"At a time when everyone recognises that we've got a cost-of-living crisis, who is making the most noise [about \nindustrial relations changes]? Companies earning $20 billion a year,\" says Paul Farrow, national secretary of the \nAustralian Workers' Union.\nThe dispute was sparked by the Albanese government's laws, part of the \"secure jobs, better pay\" workplace \nreforms introduced in 2022, that have eased union access to mine worksites.\nThe laws mean unions must no longer demonstrate that the majority of the workforce supports collective \nbargaining, as long as an existing agreement is within five years of expiration. Before those changes, unions had to \nestablish that they represented most workers before employers were obliged to negotiate.\nThis change enabled the AWU to drag BHP to the bargaining table to negotiate wages and conditions.\n\"In the Pilbara, we've got a bizarre situation whereby we're being compelled by law to bargain with the union when \nneither the company nor employees have sought that. That's the bizarreness of it,\" says Geraldine Slattery, BHP's \ncountry boss in Australia.\nThe Western Mine Workers Alliance wishlist presented to BHP includes a $10,000 annual bonus per employee, \nannual pay rises of 5 per cent or WA's consumer price index plus 1 per cent, and uniform conditions and \nentitlements across all BHP iron ore mine sites. Based on the company's 14,000-strong iron ore workforce, the \nretention bonus alone could cost BHP $140 million a year.\nThe Mining Council of Australia, the industry's peak lobbying body, says the laws \"open the door to industry-wide \n'bargaining' and industry-wide strikes - and a return to 1970s-style industrial confrontation and disruption\".\n\"There is not a single element of these measures that will either enhance productivity or co-operation in workplaces. \nThey are all doing the opposite.\"\nThe industry group says the laws give unions \"more coercive powers, including the increased right of entry powers, \nwith deliberate loopholes that facilitate their abuse; the ability to force businesses and workers into bargaining with \nno worker support; vastly expanded powers for union delegates, even in non-union workplaces.\n\"This scenario is only the beginning. Hundreds of companies, in a broad range of sectors, could soon be hit with \nsimilar claims in this race to control workforces.\"\nUnions dismiss criticism of the laws as fearmongering and cite the need to more fairly distribute the immense \nwealth generated from one of the country's most profitable industries.\n\"We've heard [miners] saying the sky is going to fall in with these laws. They have been in place for quite some time \nnow ... and nothing's changed,\" says Farrow. \"[Mining companies] are still making billions of dollars of profit, and \nworkers are still in the same situation.\"Page 3 of 5\nFIFO workers mull unions' return in Pilbara\nOne big miner says it has been forced to hire staff to chauffeur union officials between mine sites to facilitate their \nmembership drive.\nMichaelia Cash, federal opposition leader in the Senate and opposition spokeswoman on workplace relations, says \nthe Albanese government has betrayed the mining sector, after initially promising that its IR reforms would not \nextend into the Pilbara.\n\"In all the conversations I have had with miners over here, they've been clear that the industrial relations legislation \nhas been set up to lower productivity and efficiency,\" she says, adding that a union push into the region will damage \nthe economy.\nThe foundations of Australia's prosperity can arguably be traced to the 1986-87 Robe River industrial brawl. Former \nWA premier Brian Burke had a front-row seat to the now infamous row, a conflict he says escalated almost \novernight and was inflamed by obstinacy on both sides.\n\"Robe River, that was the start, the origin, the foundation of everything,\" he says. \"It was high noon with people 10 \npaces apart wearing guns.\"\nReflecting on what some describe as the Pilbara's \"reformation\", Burke says the conduct and approach of Robe \nRiver boss Charles Copeman and the unionists opposing him meant sensible negotiations were never an option.\n\"Copeman was like Tony Abbott on steroids, not just a conservative, but someone who was almost physically wired \nthat way,\" he says. \"He was completely intractable, and so the unions adopted an equal and opposite force. They \nbecame completely intractable.\"\nBurke, who fell from grace after being jailed for fraud, said Copeman's approach was \"detached from reality\", but \nhis elimination of unions from the Pilbara occurred because \"the conditions for working people in the Pilbara were \nso good that the need for unions ceased to be in the front of their mind\".\nThe bulk of iron ore royalties are generated from the largely union-free mines in the Pilbara of Rio Tinto and BHP. \nFortescue, Roy Hill and Mineral Resources also mine the steel-making ingredient in the region.\nThe industry creates enormous personal fortunes:the Forrests last year took home $2.2 billion in dividends from \nFortescue, while Rinehart pocketed $2.8 billion largely through her company Hancock Prospecting's stake in Roy \nHill.\nHowever, the industry is slowing. WA has forecast iron ore royalties to shrink by one-third, or $3.5 billion, in 2024-\n25, as prices wobble.\nWestpac warned that iron ore prices could collapse 30 per cent this year to about $US70 a tonne when Rio floods \nthe market with supply from its burgeoning Simandou mine in Guinea. Recent monsoon-like rains have also \ninundated the region and flooded infrastructure, slowing exports.\nSimon Trott, Rio Tinto's iron ore boss, says \"productivity should be the central theme of any reform\" of IR laws. \n\"Productivity drives jobs and wage growth, it encourages new investment and boosts the Australian economy. \nThese reforms will become a handbrake on the economy over the long term and put Australia on a path to lower \nliving standards and lower wage growth,\" he adds.\nThe warning of lower productivity comes as Treasurer Jim Chalmers singled out the private sector to pull Australia \nout of a tailspin, after the economy eked out a weaker-than-expected gain of 0.3 per cent last quarter.\nThe battle between the federal Labor government and industry echoes the fight over the Minerals Resource Rent \nTax imposed in 2010 and revoked three years later following a bitter campaign.\nLabor may have lost that fight, but it is digging its heels in on this battle, despite the potential for alienating voters \nahead of state and federal elections, where WA seats will play a pivotal role.Page 4 of 5\nFIFO workers mull unions' return in Pilbara\nFederal Resources Minister Madeleine King dismisses criticisms of the government's IR reforms from miners as \n\"hysteria\".\nWhile opponents to enterprise bargaining point to the high wages and low union density as a sign of a content \nPilbara workforce, FIFO workers have told The Australian Financial Review that their wish to see unions in the \nPilbara was mostly due to the desire to see equal conditions across the industry.\nUnfriendly rostering, unpaid travel time at some mines, workplace safety concerns, and variable pay and conditions \namong colleagues are all sources of contention. \"If we are talking sacrifice in mining ... I have missed a total of five \nChristmases with my family, it's just how my roster has been rolled out,\" says FIFO worker Cheryl.\nShe predicts membership will swell if unions prove they can negotiate a deal with a major miner.\n\"People fear the ramifications. There is not much fight in the mining workers lately because of the cost-of-living \ncrisis. Men and women go to work to make ends meet,\" Cheryl says.\nAfter six years working FIFO in Pilbara mines, Ryan has seen his salary grow from $80,000 as a graduate engineer \nto more than $250,000 as a construction manager. However, his hefty pay does not erase his feelings of isolation \nnor compensate for spending long periods away from his young family.\n\"People [in Perth] start to forget about you. You stop getting included in plans - not on purpose, but just because \nyou're not around. It's taxing and can be quite isolating. When I started six years ago, I was doing four weeks on, \none week off,\" he says.\nCheryl and Ryan say unions have a role to play in the Pilbara by advocating for better conditions.\nRyan agrees that organised labour could find fertile ground in the Pilbara.\n\"Unions have their place. It would be better for workers as a whole to have them [in the Pilbara], but it certainly \nwould probably make work harder for me [as a manager],\" he says. \"Unionisation is common in metro construction \nsites, but not in mining. People float between those industries all the time. I can see people definitely thinking that it \nwould be a good thing to join [a union].\"\nCheryl agrees that some FIFO colleagues struggle with the isolation. \"Where I work there is no such support for \ngetting women back into a flexible roster after she has come off maternity leave. I have seen women struggle and \nrelationships deteriorate because of it.\"\nAlthough some miners have extolled their efforts to increase female staff numbers, the likes of Macmahon - an \nASX-listed mining contractor that has nearly 10,000 staff - does not offer any paid parental leave.\nThe pressure to increase wages, conditions and benefits comes at a time of heightened global competition for iron \nore producers, with the likes of Rio's Simandou poised to take market share and siphon away investment.\n\"Our engine room, the huge contributor to our country, Australia's mining industry, faces higher regulatory burdens \nand bureaucratic risk and expense,\" says Australia's richest person, Rinehart, whose $40 billion fortune was built on \nthe Pilbara's iron ore.\n\"Australia's increasing government intervention combined with ideological and expensive or impractical policies is \nnegatively effecting new mining investment. Reduced investment will lead to lower living standards.\"\nEmployment and Workplace Relations Minister Murray Watt downplays miners' concerns about the laws, saying \n\"the facts just don't back them up\".\n\"On every measure, the WA economy is performing strongly, so I find it difficult to see how our industrial relations \nchanges have been hurting the mining industry or the WA economy,\" Watt says. \"We want mining companies to do \nwell, but we also want mining workers to do well. It's their hard work that delivers the profits for these companies.\"Page 5 of 5\nFIFO workers mull unions' return in Pilbara\nWhile the five-year expiration requirement has forced BHP to negotiate with unions, other miners have - at least so \nfar - avoided talks.\nUnlike BHP, Rio is not compelled to negotiate with unions because its enterprise agreements expired before 2019. \nFortescue has not struck a collective agreement in more than a decade. MinRes declined to comment.\nForrest says Fortescue has a \"freedom culture\" whereby staff can come directly to management to raise their \nconcerns, and that employees admire him too much to unionise.\nBran Black, Business Council of Australia chief executive, describes the Pilbara as \"the engine room of our \neconomy\" and says unionisation of the region \"will hurt all Australians\".\n\"The region's contribution is immense, providing economic prosperity and higher living standards for every \nAustralian, and we cannot allow unions to override this for their own selfish purposes,\" he adds.\nHowever, the AWU's Brad Gandy, who is WA state secretary, says the pace at which an industrial wave is \nsweeping across the Pilbara has surprised many.\nRe-unionisation of the Pilbara will not mean a return to the 1980s, he adds. \"If you look back at the tactics that the \ncompanies used in the 1980s, that wouldn't work again. I think both parties have a responsibility in either going \nback to the '80s or staying in 2024 and saying, 'How can we work together?\"'\nHowever, Burke says the high salaries, paired with a fragmented and dispersed FIFO workforce, will prove too \nmuch of a challenge for unions to overcome in the Pilbara.\n\"When people in the Pilbara are earning $190,000 a year for sitting on their backside in an airconditioned truck and \ndriving 200 metres there, then 200 metres back, they don't see the need for a union, do they?\"\n\"I think it's akin to throwing seed on stones. It won't grow.\"AFR\nNames have been changed at the\nrequest of FIFO interviewees.\nLoad-Date: February 5, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
