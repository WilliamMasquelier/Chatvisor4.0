Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 15\nLength: 611 words\nByline: Elouise Fowler and Mark Wembridge\nBody\nAndrew Forrest has launched an off-market bid to acquire Red Hawk, the owner of a key iron ore deposit near \nFortescue's existing Pilbara mines, as part of a strategy to secure longer-term growth on home soil.\nThe board of Red Hawk has agreed to sell its Blacksmith deposit, located 30 kilometres west of Fortescue's \nSolomon operations in the Pilbara, in a deal valued at up to $254 million. Fortescue requires the support of the \ntarget's shareholders to secure the deal.\nAn independent expert evaluating the offer deemed it fair and reasonable, noting that the bid of $1.05 a share will \nincrease to $1.20 a share if Fortescue secures 75 per cent or more of the Red Hawk shares by February 4.\n\"We consider the offer to be fair for shareholders because the value of the offer for consideration under both \nscenarios is greater than the entire assessed valuation range of a Red Hawk share prior to the offer,\" said advisory \nfirm BDO.\nThe offer is a 28 per cent premium to Red Hawk's closing share price of 82\u00a2 on Friday, the last day it traded before \nthe deal was announced yesterday. The higher offer represents a premium of 46 per cent.\nSteven Michael, Red Hawk chief executive, said the decision to sell to Fortescue allowed shareholders to accept a \nchunky return on their investment and avoid the risks of developing an iron ore project.\n\"For a single asset junior, such as Red Hawk, to develop a major project there is a considerable funding burden. \nThere are also question marks over the timing of development of the project - to go to first production in the next 12 \nto 18 months requires many things outside our control to happen,\" he said.\n\"Fortescue has billions of dollars invested in infrastructure only 30 kilometres from our project. For them, this is an \nattractive bolt-on transaction. They can realise value that Red Hawk could never have realised.\"\nFortescue has the backing of Red Hawk shareholders TIO (NZ) and OCJ Investment (Australia), which own 70 per \ncent of Red Hawk. These agreements grant Fortescue the right to purchase 19.99 per cent of Red Hawk's shares \nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue offers $254m for Pilbara neighbour\nat the same price offered in the takeover bid, $1.05 a share. The remaining shares will be priced at $1.20 each if \nRed Hawk shareholders agree to sell 75 per cent of the company's register to Fortescue by next Tuesday.\nRed Hawk's Blacksmith iron ore deposit is estimated at 243 million tonnes with an average iron grade of 59.3 per \ncent, slightly below the 62 per cent benchmark typical for Pilbara operations. While the lower grade poses pricing \nchallenges, the deposit reinforces Fortescue's iron ore portfolio in the Pilbara and can link with its infrastructure.\nRBC analyst Kaan Peker said Fortescue was the natural owner of the Blacksmith plot. \"[The deal] consolidates \nsome of the last available tenements resources in the region which sits outside the major miners,\" he told clients.\nIn last week's quarterly update, Fortescue said it fetched an average price of $US87 per dry metric tonne of iron \nore, lower than the average benchmark spot price of $US103 a tonne over the December quarter.\nFortescue's troubled Iron Bridge project was developed to enhance the company's product mix by blending its \nhigher-grade ore with its lower-grade output. However, even with Iron Bridge in the mix, Fortescue will still be a \nmajority low-grade producer, Morgan Stanley analysts concluded. They estimate that by the 2027 fiscal year, the \ngroup grade with the benefit of Iron Bridge will be about 59.1 per cent, below the 62 per cent benchmark.\nMr Michael, who led Vimy Resources when it was taken over by uranium miner Deep Yellow, said the quality of \nRed Hawk's deposit compared favourably Fortescue's.\nLoad-Date: January 31, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
