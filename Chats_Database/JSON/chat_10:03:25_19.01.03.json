Our population is hard- working. Our population is \nsmart. Our population is determined. We just happen to have all the resources which China doesn't,\" he said.\nThe iron ore and clean energy entrepreneur was speaking from Beijing, where he has been meeting with China's \nleaders. Over the weekend, along with BHP CEO Mike Henry and Rio Tinto's Jakob Stausholm, he was at the \nChina Development Forum, an event held in Beijing as many international businesses have been debating their \nfuture in the world's second-biggest economy.\nDr Forrest said Beijing was being \"very welcoming\" of international businesses, but the tense geopolitical \nenvironment posed challenges. \"It's becoming more difficult because of bellicose North American attitudes. And \nChina kicks an own goal through these cyber activities into democratic institutions. That is just intolerable,\" he told \nThe Australian.\nPage 2 of 3\nChalmers right on economy: Forrest\nOn Tuesday, Foreign Minister Penny Wong joined her counterparts from Britain, the US and New Zealand in calling \nout \"China state-backed actors\" that had targeted democratic institutions and parliamentarians in Britain.\nDr Forrest said that China's cyber interference \"might not be an act of war, but it's hostile\".\n\"I feel that China is such a huge and vast organisation that, generally, it's attitude is to be very friendly with the rest \nof the world. But it does trip up,\" he said.\nBeijing never interfered with supplies of iron ore during its economic coercion campaign on Australia, but the tense \nrelationship raised anxiety among all China-exposed businesses. Later this week, Beijing is expected to remove the \npunitive tariffs it imposed on the Australian wine industry in November 2020.\nDr Forrest welcomed the improvement in the relationship, which he said had gone from \"childish and politically \nmotivated\" to \"maturity\".\n\"I see a real consolidation of the relationship and trust building back into the Australia-China bilateral relationship. \nAnd that is necessary to continue the growth of the economies of both countries,\" he said.\nChina-reliant miners BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue are -Australia's three biggest taxpayers. A fall in iron ore prices \nby almost 25 per cent this year to just over $US105 a tonne ($160 a tonne) is being closely watched by the \nTreasury in Canberra.\nThe founder of Fortescue, the \"third force\" of Australia's iron ore export trade, said he remained confident about \nthe \"constant demand\" from China's steelmaking industry.\n\"Ebbs and flows, for sure, you see that. But the big mega trends are unchanged,\" he said.\nHe said a private dinner on Sunday night with Yi Gang, the former governor of the People's Bank of China, had \nreaffirmed that confidence.\nThe country's former central bank chief, who stood down last July, detailed various fiscal stimulus measures Beijing \nwas using to support housing, car ownership and the purchase of other big consumer items.\nDr Forrest said China's latest growth target of \"about 5 per cent\" announced by Premier Li Qiang earlier this month \nwould have been \"a bit of a yawn\" a decade ago. But he said growth at that rate for an economy as \"massive\" as \nChina's now would lead to \"a serious increase in goods and services \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 from around the world\".\nOn Thursday, the Fortescue founder will speak at the Boao Forum, another business forum held on China's \nHainan island.\nDr Forrest's address will focus on the clean energy transition and China's role in it.\nSince last year's Boao Forum, Beijing has built and installed 260 to 300 gigawatts of renewable energy generation, \naccording to analysts at Bloomberg.\nThat \"huge uptick\" has supported Fortescue's iron ore business, which is being used in \"all the infrastructure it \ntakes to create green energy and connect it to the grid,\" Dr Forrest said.\nLast week, industry leaders at an oil and gas conference in Houston said the huge infrastructure rollout to support \nenergy grids, along with power-hungry artificial intelligence data centres and world population increases, were \nextending the commercial viability of fossil fuels.\nDr Forrest said those comments had been useful for exposing the \"lip service\" of the fossil fuel industry only months \nafter climate scientists declared 2023 the hottest year on record.Page 3 of 3\nChalmers right on economy: Forrest\n\"The climate is going to hell in a handbag unless we turn it around,\" he told The Australian. \"The fossil fuel \nindustry's lip service to the energy transition is no more than that. It's like carbon sequestration. It's literally the \nsame old lie but waiting for the next new idiot to come along and believe it,\" he said.\nLoad-Date: March 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
