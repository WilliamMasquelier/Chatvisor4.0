Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 24\nLength: 1203 words\nByline: Alex Gluyas\nBody\nIn the eight years since Collins St Asset Management was founded, chief investment officer Vasilios Piperoglou can \nrecall only two occasions when a thematic has presented itself with enough \"significant asymmetry\" to justify a \nmajor investment.\nCollins St's value fund was an early backer of uranium, and its holdings in the sector jumped between 400 per cent \nand 500 per cent over four years. The second was offshore oil services stocks, which surged between 300 per cent \nand 350 per cent in two-and-a-half years. But Piperoglou is confident that Collins St's latest bet will produce even \nbetter returns than both those opportunities.\n\"With gold stocks, the way the asymmetry is playing out currently, I think there is a greater potential in this than the \nother two ... we're seeing the very early signs of the start of a gold bull market,\" Piperoglou says.\n\"At some stage, investors are going to get smacked in the face ... there will be a moment within months, not years, \nwhere people wake up and these quality small caps will multibag.\"\nA multibagger is every investor's dream - a stock that at least doubles in value. And while the best chance of finding \none is at the smaller end of the market, those companies also present the highest risk. But Piperoglou believes the \nlocal gold sector is filled with potential multibaggers, and it's only a matter of time before the record gold price flows \nthrough to miners.\nThat is why Collins St has spent the past 12 months undertaking its own due diligence by speaking to management \nand visiting operations to construct what Piperoglou describes as a portfolio of \"some of the best, well-run, well-\ncapitalised, pre-production plays on the ASX\".\nAmong gold sector small caps, the value fund holds Barton Gold, Brightstar Resources, Tesoro Gold, Great \nBoulder Resources, Meeka Metals and Odyssey Gold. At the larger end of the market, it holds Ramelius \nResources and West Gold Resources.\nPage 2 of 3\nTaking a shine to the gold diggers; MONDAY FUNDIE\nIndeed, Collins St's $200 million value fund has a long track record of spotting winners, and regularly appears \namong the best performers in Mercer's investment survey. It was the top-ranked Australian long-only strategy in the \nfive years to December, returning 24 per cent per annum, and also boasted a podium finish on a three-year time \nhorizon. Its strong run of form has continued over the past nine months, with the fund returning 18.6 per cent, net of \nfees, in the financial year to date, beating the S&P/ASX 200's 7.6 per cent gain over the same period.\nCollins St has also reopened its special situation fund, which is targeting the local and international small-cap gold \nsector following strong demand from clients. The firm believes that miners in North America are also looking cheap, \nparticularly small- and mid-cap companies in Canada and the US.\nMuch of the value fund's recent performance has been fuelled by an 11 per cent return in December when two of its \nkey holdings - Carnarvon Energy and Link Administration - rallied sharply. While Collins St doesn't typically engage \nin shareholder activism, the firm played a key role in rolling the board at Carnarvon in December amid frustrations \nover its handling of its major offshore gas project majority-owned by Santos.\nCollins St teamed up with Nero Resources Fund to raid Carnarvon's share register and force the company to \npledge it would not acquire new assets, would cut administrative costs and work with Santos to speed up drilling at \nthe Dorado field in which Carnarvon is a minority owner. The stock rallied nearly 44 per cent in December.\n\"Usually when we buy a new position, we have no intention of being activist because it's a lot easier to make money \nbeing passive,\" Piperoglou says.\n\"We were willing on that occasion to throw down the gauntlet of having a pretty public fight, but thankfully it was the \nquickest coup - within 24 hours they basically resigned.\"\nThe value fund also benefited from a 60 per cent surge in Link shares in December following a $1.2 billion buyout \noffer from Japanese financial services company Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. The bid ended a rollercoaster ride \nfor shareholders over the past three years, when four other suitors attempted takeovers.\nThe disastrous acquisition of a British company in 2017 also dragged Link into the messy collapse of the $7 billion \nWoodford investment fund, which triggered heavy losses and a complex exit involving the financial regulator. \"At \ntimes when we do have a significant amount of cash because we don't see much opportunity on the long end, we \nplayed what we thought at the time was a low-risk takeover arbitrage,\" Piperoglou says, referring to its initial \ninvestment in Link.\n\"But that literally blew up in our face, and we were holding a position that halved in value, so we would argue that \nwe got Link's takeover wrong.\"\nPiperoglou admits that Collins St has still lost money on that investment, adding that if the fund hadn't bought \nshares in Link, its two-year return would be at least 5 per cent higher.\nCollins St is also bullish on energy, particularly oil and gas, and believes they will be crucial for decades to come as \nthe world transitions towards renewable energy.\nWhile financial institutions and governments have increasingly shied away from investing in the sector, Piperoglou \nsays that demand for oil and gas remains robust while there is little incentive for new supply.\n\"It's one of those weird disconnects, with underlying demand still going up every year, but you're not seeing enough \ncapital expenditure on the supply side,\" he says. \"Those that are willing to participate and just be passive should \nearn some pretty good double-digit returns.\"\nThe value fund holds Beach Energy, but last month trimmed its position in the stock and reallocated that capital to \nits investment in Carnarvon.\nPiperoglou's first exposure to the sharemarket was at the ripe age of 12 years old when his father, a psychiatrist, \nraided his piggy bank and bought him about $1200 of CSR shares due to its high dividend yield.Page 3 of 3\nTaking a shine to the gold diggers; MONDAY FUNDIE\nEvery six months, Piperoglou would study the company's dividend statement while also reading everything he could \nabout Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway, which cemented in his mind that he wanted to run an investment \nfund.\nPiperoglou started investing in year 12, mainly in resources stocks, but admits he had no idea what he was doing \nand made plenty of mistakes. His biggest winner was copper and gold miner Oxiana Resources, which he bought \nat 8\u00a2 and sold at $3.50.\nFrom there, Piperoglou continued to follow financial markets and completed commerce and law degrees at Monash \nUniversity. With few contacts in the financial services industry, he joined boutique firm Leyland Private Asset \nManagement.\nIt was there he met Michael Goldberg, a like-minded value investor who also believed in fundamental stock \nanalysis. Over many lunches, the two came to the conclusion that the most efficient way to run a value-style \ninvestment house was through a fund structure that was a standalone entity.\nAfter five years at Leyland for Piperoglou and seven years for Goldberg, they established Collins St Asset \nManagement in 2015 and have put their own money into the value fund.\n\"We live and die by our stock picking ability,\" Piperoglou says.\nLoad-Date: April 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Taking a shine to the gold diggers; MONDAY FUNDIE\n## Australian Financial Review\n### Alex Gluyas\n### April 22, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Ramelius Resources, to report.
