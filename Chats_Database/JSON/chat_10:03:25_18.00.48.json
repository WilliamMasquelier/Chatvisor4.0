It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nFortescue to roll out more electrolyser plants after Gladstone\nFortescue to roll out more electrolyser plants after Gladstone\nThe Australian\nApril 9, 2024 Tuesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 709 words\nByline: Matt Bell\nBody\nAndrew Forrest-backed mining giant Fortescue plans to ramp up its green ambitions and roll out hydrogen \nelectrolyser manufacturing facilities into more locations after launching its first in Queensland.\nThe 15,000sq m advanced manufacturing facility in Gladstone, which was officially opened on Monday, has the \ncapacity to produce more than 2GW of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser stacks annually.\nThe company, which counts billionaire Mr Forrest as its largest shareholder, expects the first electrolyser stacks to \nbe rolled out commercially from 2025 and is in talks with interested parties globally as it looks to build its order \nbooks.\nFortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson told The Australian that the company would look to roll out \nmore electrolyser manufacturing facilities but not in Australia, adding that the US was at the top of its wish list.\n\"We'll definitely do one in the US because the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) incentives to do this in America are \nenormous. And then other countries that also have the ambition to do exactly the same,\" he said.\nMr Hutchinson said the technology behind the manufacturing process for electrolysers made it easy to roll out in \nany country that wanted to work with Fortescue.\n\"The beautiful thing about (this facility) is it's fully automated. We can do it anywhere,\" he said.\n\"You don't have to think about labour or train people, so you just build a fully automated facility and off we go.\" \nFortescue will now test the technology as it looks to slowly ramp up the facility to reach its peak capacity of more \nthan 2GW and did not expect customers to receive orders until 2025.\n\"We're building a test facility which will hopefully be in production, which will make hydrogen from about September, \nOctober this year.\nAnd then we've actually got to do it at an industrial scale,\" Mr Hutchinson said.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue to roll out more electrolyser plants after Gladstone\n\"Realistically, it's going to be 2025 (until the product is rolled out commercially) by the time we get the testing done \nand the sales and we make them,\" he said.\nThe Queensland government, which held its cabinet meeting on the factory floor on Monday, signed off on the next \nstage, PEM50.\nIt will use the locally made PEM electrolysers to produce green hydrogen for local and export markets.\nOnce operational it will be the first commercial-scale green hydrogen facility for Fortescue.\nFederal Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic told The Australian that the Fortescue site would play a pivotal role \nin Australia's transition to net zero and opened the door for more businesses locally and internationally to invest in \nthe space.\n\"It shows regional Australia has a role to play in the transition to net zero in manufacturing. And that's the big thing \nfor me, is to see that opportunity spread out. We want everyone to pitch in from all corners of the country,\" he said.\n\"The (Fortescue sites) are important examples that businesses and other sections of industry can see what can be \ndone. It is a signal to send about the capacity for regional Australia and to get the job done.\" Mr Hutchinson said all \noptions were on the table as Fortescue looked for further opportunities in the energy transition space.\n\"Fundamentally, our view is that with the green molecule coming, everything gets disrupted. So theoretically, you \nlook at any industry, and it's going to be disruptive,\" he said.\n\"We're going to be the shift business and we're going to be in the cable business, and we're going to be in maybe a \nlot of other business.\n\"We are looking at everything.\" It's a busy time for Fortescue as it continues to pivot away from its reliance on iron \nore.\nGreen hydrogen hopeful Sparc Technologies and its joint venture partners, including Fortescue Future Industries, \nare also progressing plans to begin construction of a multimillion-dollar pilot plant in the coming months. FFI paid an \ninitial $1.8m for a 20 per cent stake in 2022.\nASX-listed Sparc's hydrogen subsidiary aims to commercialise its photocatalytic water splitting technology which \ncan convert water into hydrogen and oxygen using the sun and a photocatalyst.\nThe plant is expected to take six months to build.\nShares in Fortescue rose 0.3 per cent, or 8c, to close at $24.86 on Monday. The reporter travelled to Gladstone as \na guest of Fortescue.\nLoad-Date: April 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
