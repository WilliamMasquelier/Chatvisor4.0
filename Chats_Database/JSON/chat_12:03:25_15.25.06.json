The \ncompany's Australian chief technology officer, Carl Solder, said Cisco's index found about half of the companies \nsurveyed found help from AI with processes and operations did not hit the mark.\nAbout 44 per cent saw either no or not enough improvement in the technology automating their business.\n\"I think the reality is that they started to appreciate the work and effort involved in getting all those building blocks \nsquared away, and the strategy, infrastructure data governance, talent and culture,\" Mr Solder said. \"The reality is \nthat maybe there is a little bit more work that we have to do to be fully prepared.\" Cisco's Index measured the \nresponses of 3660 senior business leaders from companies with 500 or more staff across 14 countries in the Asia \nPacific.\nThe index found just 4 per cent of the country was in a position to leverage AI, a figure that dropped from 5 per cent \nthe previous year. Mr Solder said 92 per cent of companies were facing increasing pressure to adopt AI, despite \nmuch of it not showing a return on investment over the past year.\nMost of that pressure came from company chief executives and boards and it was found to have risen again over \nthe past six months. \"Fifty-six per cent of those organisations said that the pressure has increased significantly on \nthat number,\" Mr Solder said.\nThat pressure has led to more than one-fifth - 21 per cent - of companies planning to allocate 40 per cent of their IT \nbudget to AI over the next four to five years.\nMeanwhile, some Bain data found investors believed generative AI would not add much value in 2025, instead \nbelieving it would take up to three years to see the full benefit. That view is influenced by a number of investors \nPage 2 of 2\nAI not hitting mark for Aussies\nconfirming just 20 per cent of their portfolio companies having Gen AI uses that are \"delivering value\". About 30 per \ncent of portfolio companies are still testing or developing AI use cases.\nSimilarly to Cisco, Bain found AI investments were four times more likely to disappoint investors than they were to \nexceed expectations. Over the past 12 months, AI agents - chatbots that leverage large language models to \nundertake tasks such as reading and responding to emails - have been framed as one of the first major use cases \nof the technology. But Australian workers disagree, with an EY report finding just 37 per cent of employees were \ncomfortable with their companies introducing AI assistants.\nLoad-Date: December 31, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
