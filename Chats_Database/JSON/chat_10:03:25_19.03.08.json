Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 15\nLength: 653 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nFortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest arranged private talks with Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation boss \nMichael Woodley in a Perth park as part of attempts to settle a billion-dollar case unfolding in the Federal Court.\nTwo of three meetings between the billionaire iron ore miner and the Indigenous leader occurred at Kings Park at \nDr Forrest's request, despite the pair falling out in a fiery clash in 2011.\nA third meeting was held in Karratha, about 35 kilometres from the town of Roebourne where Fortescue is accused \nof dividing the Yindjibarndi community.\nThe talks failed as the warring parties remain hundreds of millions of dollars apart on what represents an \nappropriate financial compromise.\nFortescue said yesterday that it was ready to settle and make an offer of compensation to the Yindjibarndi \nAboriginal Corporation.\n\"We would like this matter with the Yindjibarndi people resolved. We are committed to seeing this matter settled so \nthe Yindjibarndi people can receive the benefits they deserve,\" a Fortescue spokeswoman said.\n\"Fortescue has offered compensation to the Yindjibarndi people in the past, and we continue to be ready to settle \nthis by paying compensation.\"\nThe company refused to answer questions about why Dr Forrest opted to meet Mr Woodley in a public park, and \nwould not discuss whether it had put forward a settlement offer that varied from its standard compensation \nagreements with other traditional owner groups in the Pilbara.\nFortescue, valued at $79 billion, also declined to comment on whether its settlement offer diverged from its legal \narguments made in the Federal Court.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest's meetings in park with YAC over $1b claim\nFortescue has argued any compensation should be funded by the State of Western Australia because it granted \nthe mining tenements covering the traditional lands of the Yindjibarndi. The WA government maintains Fortescue \nshould pay.\nThe Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation is arguing it is entitled to compensation for economic losses estimated by \none expert witness at more than $500 million, and more because it alleges Fortescue destroyed more than 240 \nculturally significant sites - including rock shelters - for which it is also seeking around $500 million.\nIt is also arguing Fortescue divided the community by backing a breakaway group known as the Wirlu-Murra \nYindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation in a novel third element to its legal fight.\nThe scope of potential damages is $1 billion.\nFortescue was left exposed to the compensation claim in 2020 after the High Court denied the company special \nleave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings that in effect meant a large part of its Solomon iron ore mining hub was \nbuilt without permission of traditional owners.\nThe Federal Court had granted exclusive native title over 2700 square kilometres in the iron ore-rich Pilbara. This in \neffect recognises the Yindjibarndi as private owners of the highest legal standing with a spiritual connection that \nallows them to decide who mines the land.\nYindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation previously rejected Fortescue's offer of a $4 million annual payment over the \nanticipated life of the Solomon project, worth around $120 million.\nFortescue pays capped compensation as part of seven native title agreements with other traditional owner groups.\nIn court yesterday, lawyers for WA questioned mining economist Murray Meaton about his assertion that exclusive \npossession under native title entitled the claimant to a 1 per cent annual royalty on iron ore mined at Solomon, \nwhich would be double the royalty paid to some traditional owners with non-exclusive possession.\nMr Meaton estimated last year that the economic loss suffered by YAC from not having an agreement with \nFortescue was $502 million. The court has asked him to update his figures based on the latest Fortescue \nproduction forecasts. A ruling in the case is expected next year, with the parties not due to deliver closing \narguments until around October.\nLoad-Date: April 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"We would like this matter with the Yindjibarndi people resolved.
