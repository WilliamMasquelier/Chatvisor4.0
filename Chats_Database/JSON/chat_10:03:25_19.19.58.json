Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Robert Lancaster | Private Investigator hired by Fortescue | \"In the 80s when you were on the team you were either an assaulter or a sniper. I did both jobs. The weapon of choice was the L96A1.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"Fortescue sensationally alleged Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen stole the would-be green energy giant's intellectual property to launch their own start-up, Element Zero.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Long-term lieutenant of Andrew Forrest | \"Along with long term lieutenant of Dr Forrest, Michael Masterman, Fortescue has claimed that after the three men left the company's green iron project between 2021 and 2022, the only way they could have rapidly developed their own way to process iron ore into metallic iron without burning fossil fuels is by stealing Fortescue's secrets.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
