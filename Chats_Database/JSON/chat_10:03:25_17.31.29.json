However, he ruled out any further M&A with Ramelius or any other player.\nPage 2 of 2\nBattle for relevance a key driver for more gold mining deals - DATA ROOM\n\"We have to just focus on what we have now,\" he said.\n\"This is a big jump for us, and we have doubled the size of the business overnight and so the expectation on the \nbusiness is very high.\" Westgold mines in the Murchison and Southern Goldfields regions of WA has a tenure of \nmore than 3200sq km, operating six underground mines and five processing plants.\nLoad-Date: August 6, 2024\nEnd of Document\n            ",
