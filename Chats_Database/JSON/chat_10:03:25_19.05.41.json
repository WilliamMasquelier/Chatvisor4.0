Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 895 words\nHighlight: What happens when an immovable former premier meets an unstoppable billionaire?\nBody\nWe all knew that the cat would soon be out of the bag on the next chapter in the career of former Victorian premier \nDan Andrews. After all, the bloke couldn't spend the rest of his life playing golf, partying with rich lister Lindsay \nFox and triggering media personality Steve Price.\nSo today we can reveal that Andrews has teamed up with WA mining billionaire Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest and his \niron-ore giant Fortescue to help make Twiggy's dream - of selling 100 million tonnes of \"green\" iron to China - \ncome true.\nIt's not clear exactly how this thing came to pass, but sources close to the action tell us that Andrews, who is taking \non the Fortescue work through his consultancy Forty Eight and Partners, gave a presentation at the Boao Forum \nfor Asia in Hainan Province in March.\nForrest, a major sponsor of the event, was also present and the two men appear to have clicked.\nThe green steel plan hopes to deliver vast quantities of the refined metal to market after stripping the carbon \nemissions out of the entire extraction, processing and supply chain operations using - and this could be the tricky bit \n- 8 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen each year.\nSo, Forrest is thinking big. But then Andrews never saw a large project he didn't like - if we overlook Melbourne's \nuncontroversial East-West Link or the Commonwealth Games - so this thing makes sense on that level.\nIt's also been a winning approach for Forrest in the past. The Fortescue chairman hired another former long-\nserving Labor premier, South Australia's Jay Weatherill, in 2019 to lead the Thrive by Five early childhood \neducation campaign Forrest established with his then-wife Nicola Forrest.\nNeither Forrest nor Andrews were available on Sunday to chat, leaving CBD to ponder alone all the quotations \nraised by the news of the team up.\nWho gets to call themselves chairman would be the first one, with Andrews never quite able to shake that \n\"Chairman Dan\" moniker used by unkind souls over his hard line on public health during the COVID pandemic and \nthe Labor man's enthusiasm for closer trade links with China.\nPage 2 of 3\nMan of green steel: Dan Andrews takes the billionaire career path\nThere's this too; with both the former premier and the mining boss well-known for having a certain, well, let's call it a \nsingle-minded management style, what happens if differences emerge on strategy or tactics?\nOh, and you'd think that Andrews' new gig would mean spending a lot of time away from his beloved Mulgrave, in \nChina and of course at Fortescue's HQ way out west.\nIt'd be a shame if someone closed the borders.\nTAYLOR MADE\nLooks like Taylor Auerbach, the former producer with Seven's Spotlight program, whose jaw-dropping star turn in \nthe witness box at Bruce Lehrmann's recent high-profile case matter took some processing, is not yet ready to put \nthe matter of Lehrmann and Brittany Higgins behind him.\nAuerbach announced on the weekend that he's been \"writing a book!\"\nWell, \"just having a crack, to see if I can do it. It might never be read by anybody but me. And I'm only an each-way \nbet.\"\nTwitter link\nNow, Tay-Tay the second reckons it'd be \"crass\", at this stage, to reveal if the tome will be fiction or non-fiction - \nand we'll defer in matters of crassness to the expertise of anybody who's worked a few shifts at Spotlight.\nBut what of the book's subject matter? Well, it says here that the plot revolves around a group of people working in \nmedia and politics and features an accusation of rape against a controversial figure, so maybe we shouldn't be \nholding our breath for a powerful work of the imagination.\nThe initial signs are promising, with Auerbach running his first chapter past an artificial intelligence program - you \ncan do that these days - which gave the former print journalist's literary efforts as warm a review as you could \nexpect from a machine.\nBut litigation-obsessed CBD worries that Taylor might be entering legally fraught territory, what with all the defo \ncases launched in the wake of Higgins' allegation - sustained on the balance of probabilities by the Federal Court \nlast month - that Lehrmann raped her in Parliament House in 2019.\nMaybe Taylor enjoyed his days in court so much that he fancies another go.\nWORLD SECORD\nFormer state Labor MP Walt Secord, who quit politics in 2022 after bullying allegations were made against him, \nseems to be living his best life in comfortable semi-retirement.\nCBD reported last year that Secord, who converted to Judaism in 2020, took on a new gig as director of public \naffairs for the Australia-Israel & Jewish Affairs Council. Secord left that job last December, and is now doing the \nmore relaxing work of a full-time book promoter for his wife Julia Levitina, who released her debut novel, The Girl \nFrom Moscow earlier this year.\nMoscow-born Levitina's novel, which is partially set in the Soviet Union of the 1980s, has garnered some positive \nreviews locally, and the manuscript for her next book, Beyond The Pale was recently shortlisted for the UK \nHistorical Novel Society's First Chapters Competition.\nStill, Walt hasn't completely left the world of Macquarie Street behind, and his old party connections have come in \nhandy on the promotional front. NSW Premier Chris Minns even stepped in to launch Levitina's first novel at a \nBondi Beach bookshop in March.Page 3 of 3\nMan of green steel: Dan Andrews takes the billionaire career path\nStart the day with a summary of the day's most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. \nSign up for our Morning Edition newsletter. \nLoad-Date: May 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Dan Andrews | Consultant for Fortescue | \"Andrews has teamed up with WA mining billionaire Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest and his iron-ore giant Fortescue to help make Twiggy's dream - of selling 100 million tonnes of 'green' iron to China - come true.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest | Billionaire and Fortescue's Chairman | \"Forrest is thinking big.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
