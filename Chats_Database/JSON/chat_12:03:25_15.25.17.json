Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 456 words\nHighlight: Shell has dragged resources giants Woodside and Paladin Resources to court after being lumped with \nan $86.5 million clean-up bill for the Northern Endeavour oil platform, claiming the bill should never have been its to \npay.\nBody\nShell has dragged resources giants Woodside and Paladin Resources to court after being lumped with an $86.5 \nmillion clean-up bill for the Northern Endeavour oil platform, claiming the bill should never have been its to pay.\nAccording to a writ lodged in the WA Supreme Court, Shell claims it was forced to pay assessment notices issued \nby the Australian Taxation Office in 2023 and 2024 totalling $86.5 million in February 2024.\nThe payment demand was made under an offshore petroleum levy enacted by the federal government in 2022 in \ndirect response to the costs associated with the unmanned vessel.\nBut Shell claims it should never have been saddled with that clean-up bill, pointing to a clause allegedly buried in \nthe share purchase deal it inked with Woodside and Paladin more than a decade ago it argues rendered the two \ncompanies liable.\nShell claims both Woodside and Paladin were to reimburse Shell for any claims arising from or in connection with \nthe venture.\nWoodside, Shell and BHP established a joint venture in the late 1990s after being granted exploration and \npetroleum production licenses over the Corallina and Laminaria oil fields in the Timor Sea, about 550 kilometres \nwest north-west of Darwin.\nUnder the joint venture, led by Woodside as majority owner and operator, the trio built the Northern Endeavour \nfloating production vessel, which was permanently moored to the seabed.\nWoodside and Paladin bought Shell out before handing the floating rig to Perth-based company Northern Oil and \nGas Australia (NOGA) in 2015.\nBut within four years that rig was shut down amid saftey warnings from the regulator, National Offshore Petroleum \nSafety and Environmental Management Authority, and NOGA collapsed just months later.\nThe collapse coupled with environmental concerns prompted the federal government to take the decommissioning \nof the vessel into its own hands - an exercise which has cost hundreds of millions of dollars since 2020.\nPage 2 of 2\nResources giants headed to court over $86 million clean-up bill\nThat eye-watering clean-up bill is now at the centre of a Supreme Court battle between Shell, Woodside and \nPaladin Resources.\nIn the writ, Shell claims it penned two letters between February 2023 and March 2024 demanding payment from \nWoodside and Paladin Resources, but that the pair both denied liability.\nNow Shell wants the Supreme Court to intervene by forcing Woodside and Paladin to reimburse it to the tune of \n$86.5 million.\nIt also wants a declaration that Woodside and Paladin Resources are to compensate it for all future costs it may \nincur as part of the decommissioning, which is only in the first of three stages.\nWoodside has been contacted for comment.\nThe Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day's most important and interesting stories, analysis \nand insights.
