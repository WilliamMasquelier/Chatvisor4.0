Your output should only consist of that one sentence.\nThis one sentence should highlight the main topic or theme of the article from the perspective of Shell. We are interested about what is said on Shell in the article.\n\nHere is the article: Page 1 of 2\nShell takes earnings hit of up to $7.7bn in quarter\nShell takes earnings hit of up to $7.7bn in quarter\nThe Australian\nJanuary 9, 2024 Tuesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKETWATCH; Pg. 20\nLength: 459 words\nByline: CHRISTIAN MOESS LAURSEN\nBody\nShell said its fourth-quarter earnings took a hit of between $US2.5bn and $US4.5bn ($7.7bn) in impairments, offset \nby significantly higher gas trading, while its overall production volumes are on track to meet targets.\nThe London-based energy giant said the impairments were primarily driven by macro developments as well as \nportfolio choices, including its Singapore chemicals and products assets, which it has been trying to sell.\nThe FTSE 100 leader by market capitalisation also said it expected cash flow from operations to take a hit from a \n$US900m charge related to timing of payments of emissions.\nShell expects to report integrated gas production between 880,000 and 920,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day for the \nfourth quarter, which would be in line with its guided range of 870,000-930,000 BOE a day, and compares with \nthird-quarter production of 900,000 BOE a day.\nFourth-quarter volumes of liquefied natural gas are expected to be between 6.9 million and 7.3 million tonnes \ncompared with 6.9 million tonnes in the preceding quarter. Shell previously expected LNG volumes of 6.7 million-\n7.3 million tonnes.\nGains from integrated gas trading are expected to be significantly higher quarter-on-quarter, while the trading result \nfrom chemicals and crude oil refineries is seen to be significantly lower. The former segment was expected to make \nan adjusted earnings loss, the company said.\nHowever, the expected uptick in fourth-quarter gas trading comes despite declining oil and gas prices throughout \nthe period, with oil hitting a five-month low in early December, reflecting supply and demand concerns despite \nsupport from geopolitical uncertainty.\nUpstream production - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - is expected to meet the guided range of 1.75 \nmillion to 1.95 million BOE a day at 1.83 million to 1.93 million a day. It reported 1.75 million BOE a day in the third \nquarter.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell takes earnings hit of up to $7.7bn in quarter\nElsewhere, Saudi Aramco said it would cut crude prices to all regions, including its largest market in Asia - a move \nthat comes amid weaker global oil prices and increased production by producers outside the Organisation of the \nPetroleum Exporting Countries.\nAfter a summer rally attributed in large part to Saudi Arabia's decision to implement a production cut of one million \nbarrels a day on top of existing cuts by other members of OPEC and its allies, including Russia, crude fell sharply in \nthe fourth quarter. Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ have extended cuts into 2023.\nWest Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, fell more than 21 per cent in the fourth quarter of the calendar \nyear to post a 2023 decline of 10.7 per cent. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell around 19 per cent in the fourth \nquarter to lose 10.3 per cent in 2023. Dow Jones newswires\nLoad-Date: January 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n            ",
