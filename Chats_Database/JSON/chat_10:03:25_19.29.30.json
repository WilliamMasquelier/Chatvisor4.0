Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's founder | \"I am not aware of any reason why it was necessary to conduct surveillance on Mr Master-man, given Mr Masterman was not a recipient of a search order.\" | N.A. |\n| Bart Kolodziejczyk | Former Fortescue executive | \"Based on my review of the surveillance reports, I believe additional surveillance was carried out on Mr Masterman that has not been disclosed by Fortescue.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Former Fortescue lieutenant | \"The surveillance reports indicate that surveillance was conducted on Mr Masterman's residential premises in Sydney and Perth, as well as surveillance on Mr Masterman personally.\" | N.A. |\n| Bjorn Winther-Jensen | Former Fortescue executive | \"Surveillance operatives followed Dr Kolodziejczyk closely including to his son's daycare \u2026 and Dr Winther-Jensen to parks, shopping centres and to a cancer awareness charity event.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
