Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue chairman | \"We invite all companies in the mining, heavy industry and haulage sectors to join us.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue chairman | \"The time of others persuading you that greenwashing is a better return to shareholders and your community is over.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue chairman | \"It really does point the way for the future of the mining industry going zero emissions, and it points the way for heavy industry running out of excuses.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue Metals chief executive | \"A year ago, nobody would have even thought about a 6MW charger.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue Metals chief executive | \"As it stands, the first-generation charger and power system combination is already a better offering than its diesel equivalent in the market.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
