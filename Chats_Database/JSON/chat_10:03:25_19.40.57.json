You've \nseen just the edge of it,\" Mr Forrest said after Fortescue annual general meeting in Perth.\n\"I know that they (China) have so much ready to roll that, whichever way it goes, Australia is going to be all right.\n\"The biggest trading partner the US has ever and will ever have is China. Let's not forget that they butter each \nother's bread.\" Most commentators expect Mr Trump to take an axe to green energy incentives with ramifications \nfor Fortescue's $US550m ($841m) hydrogen project in Arizona.\nMr Forrest said Fortescue was already unhappy about some of the rules around the Arizona and needed more \ncertainty on the future direction of the IRA.\n\"If you have a look at the IRA, it might get adjusted ... we need clarity,\" he said.\n\"The reason why we're not hammering into it is because we need clarity around some of the rules, which has been \nput off to after the election.\" The Fortescue founder described Mr Trump as a \"pragmatic economic guy\" who might \nsee the sense in pursuing investment in green energy.\nPage 2 of 2\nTWIGGY BACKING CHINA\n\"He's toed the election line. He's been really positive about green energy. He's been really possible positive about \nfossil fuels. Will he lean forward as much (into green energy)? I don't know. But remember, he's an economic \npragmatist, so he's going to follow the money.\" Mr Forrest was speaking after Fortescue comfortably avoided a \nsecond strike on its remuneration report.\nThe company had moved to quell shareholder unease over ad hoc payment made to departing executives in 2022-\n23.\nIndigenous leader Noel Pearson and infrastructure investment expert Rao-Monari were elected to the board. \nShareholders received no update on when Fortescue might make final investment decisions on the Holmaneset \nhydrogen project in Norway and the Pec\u00c3\u00a9m project in Brazil.\nLoad-Date: November 6, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"The amount of horsepower in the tank of China's economy and the ability to self-stimulate is phenomenal.
