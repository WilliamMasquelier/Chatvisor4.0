Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| John Kerry | U.S. Special Climate Envoy | \"Sans les profits tir\u00e9s du p\u00e9trole et du gaz, rien n\u2019est possible.\" | \"Without the profits from oil and gas, nothing is possible.\" |\n| Not mentioned | Not mentioned | \"Que le p\u00e9trolier norv\u00e9gien Equinor se soit port\u00e9 au secours \u00add\u2019Orsted en prenant 9,8 % de son capital illustre ce paradoxe et la difficult\u00e9 d\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer la d\u00e9carbonation \u2013 pourtant vitale \u2013 de l\u2019\u00e9nergie.\" | \"That the Norwegian oil company Equinor came to the rescue of Orsted by taking 9.8% of its capital illustrates this paradox and the difficulty of accelerating the decarbonization \u2013 which is vital \u2013 of energy.\" |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Orsted.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Orsted or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
