Ordell is chaired by Tommy \nMcKeith, who stepped down as Genesis chair in 2022.\nAnd Ordell's main exploration project, Barimaia, also comes from Genesis, which will emerge with a 9 per cent \nstake in the explorer after the float as part of an agreement to sell the tenements.\nBarimaia sits a stone's throw from Ramelius Resources' Mt Magnet operations, and in a district that's seen a fair \nbit of corporate interest in recent times as Ramelius and Westgold jostle for position.\nThe project was previously drilled by both IGO and Genesis, and Ordell's prospectus shows pretty solid historical \nintercepts, including 15m at 11.4 grams a tonne gold, 17m at 3.4 grams a tonne, and 70m at 0.68 grams a tonne.\nBut the company now reckons the work conducted by Ramelius at its nearby deposit offers a better geological \ninterpretation for Barimaia and hopes to have better luck hanging a resource off previous drilling by targeting the \nnext round a bit better.\nOrdell also plans to spend a bit of its exploration cash at its Goodia Project, 15km southwest of Norseman - an area \nonce best known for gold, but now the subject of lithium interest. The Goodia tenements were previously held by \nGalileo Mining, last seen selling 30 per cent of the lithium rights at its own Norseman tenements to Mineral \nResources for $7.5m.\nPage 2 of 2\nGold price offers hope for Argonaut Securities' new ASX float - DATA ROOM\nLoad-Date: June 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**ENTITY**: [Organization Name]\n**TYPE**: [Type of organization - e.g., Company, Government Agency, NGO, etc.]\n**DESCRIPTION**: [Brief description of how the entity is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**ENTITY**: Tesla, Inc.\n**TYPE**: Company\n**DESCRIPTION**: Main subject of article, discussing Q4 earnings report\n\nOnly include entities that are meaningful to the article's content.
