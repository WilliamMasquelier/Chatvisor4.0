Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Robert Tichio | Fortescue Capital executive | \"No one will unmoor the chairman, he's an extraordinary visionary. I wouldn\u2019t have come to do this if I didn\u2019t believe in the way that he sets out a vision, particularly in categories that are unmarked, that are uncharted.\" | N.A. |\n| Robert Tichio | Fortescue Capital executive | \"He has an extraordinary ability to see long-term vision and make decisions that oftentimes really require the education of the market versus the other way around. And we're not going to change that.\" | N.A. |\n| Robert Tichio | Fortescue Capital executive | \"Those are conversations we're having now daily. And I think it has been a really remarkable early series of exchanges, robust exchanges, on this.\" | N.A. |\n| Robert Tichio | Fortescue Capital executive | \"This has been a ramp period for us to work with the industrial teams, particularly on the energy side, to ensure that decisions that are getting made around how these projects are being framed, sized, de-risked ... [are made] with third-party equity investors in mind.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
