About 44 per cent see no improvement or not enough in \nautomating their businesses.\n\"I think the reality is that they started to appreciate the work and effort involved in getting all those building blocks \nsquared away, and the strategy, infrastructure data governance, talent and culture,\" he said.\n\"The reality is that maybe there is a little bit more work that we have to do to be fully -prepared.\" Cisco's index \nmeasured the responses of 3660 senior business leaders from companies with 500 or more staff across 14 \ncountries in the Asia-Pacific.\nThe index found just 4 per cent of the country are in a position to leverage AI, down from 5 per cent the previous \nyear.\nMr Solder said 92 per cent of companies were facing increasing pressure to adopt AI.\nMost of that pressure comes from chief executives and boards and it has risen over the past six months.\n\"Fifty-six per cent of those organisations said that the pressure has increased significantly,\" Mr Solder said.\nMore than one fifth of companies plan to allocate 40 per cent of their IT budget to AI over the next four to five years.\nPage 2 of 2\nSecond thoughts on AI as results fall short\nMeanwhile, Bain has found that investors believe generative artificial intelligence will not add much value in 2025, \nbelieving it will take up to three years to see the full benefit.\nA number of investors said that just 20 per cent of their portfolio companies had Generative AI use cases that were \n\"delivering value\". About 30 per cent of portfolio companies are still testing or developing AI use cases.\nSimilarly to Cisco, Bain found that AI investments are four times more likely to disappoint investors than they are to \nexceed -expectations.\nOver the past 12 months, AI agents - chatbots that use \"large language models\" to undertake tasks such as reading \nand responding to emails - have been cited as one of the first major uses of the technology.\nBut Australian workers disagree, with a recent EY report finding that just 37 per cent of employees are comfortable \nwith their companies introducing AI assistants and just 31 per cent thinking AI chatbots are helpful for customer \nservice.\nThat report says the integration of AI in the workplace has been met with mixed responses.\nMore than half of those surveyed are deeply concerned that AI could result in job losses. That fear is greater for \nwomen: 59 per cent are concerned about job losses, compared to 51 per cent of men.\nMeanwhile, 40 per cent are \"deeply uncomfortable\" with AI being used to monitor their behaviour and 46 per cent \ndon't want AI to provide efficiency -recommendations.\nAlmost half of respondents are uncomfortable with AI taking on employee performance reviews and 52 per cent \ndon't wish to be interviewed by a chatbot when going for a new role.\nAlmost two thirds of respondents - 62 per cent - are worried that employees will attempt to manipulate the way they \nthink with AI applications.\nEY chief technology officer Katherine Boiciuc said there were real \"innovation versus insecurity\" and \"progress \nversus privacy\" issues.\n\"On the one hand, there's recognition of the benefits AI can bring to business and people, suggesting an openness \nto the potential for it to enhance productivity and improve work-life balance,\" she said.\n\"On the other hand, there is a level of discomfort and concern among Australians about the broader implications AI \nmight have on their employment, workplace culture and privacy.\" It was clear AI used in a supervisor-type role \"has \nalso struck a nerve\" and the technology was fuelling \"insecurities\" in the workplace, especially \"among those in \nmanual labour/skilled trades and among women\".\nLoad-Date: December 30, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Second thoughts on AI as results fall short\n## The Australian\n### Joseph Lam\n### December 31, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Cisco, to report.

Cisco's AI readiness index reveals that only 4% of Australian companies are currently positioned to effectively leverage AI, a slight decline from 5% the previous year, indicating a stagnation in AI adoption despite increased investment.\n\n2. The index shows that 58% of Australian companies investing in AI report that the technology has not met their expectations, highlighting a significant gap between investment and actual performance in AI applications.\n\n3. Cisco's Australian CTO, Carl Solder, noted that 92% of companies are under pressure to adopt AI, with 56% of organizations experiencing a significant increase in this pressure from executives and boards over the past six months.\n\n4. Despite the challenges, over 20% of companies plan to allocate 40% of their IT budgets to AI in the next four to five years, suggesting a continued commitment to AI investment despite current disappointments. \n\n5. The mixed reception of AI in the workplace, with concerns about job losses and privacy, reflects broader societal apprehensions that could impact Cisco's AI initiatives and the overall digital communications landscape in Australia.",
