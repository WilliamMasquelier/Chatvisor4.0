Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Billionaire, Founder of Fortescue | \"We fully support the federal government's green energy ambitions for Australia.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Billionaire, Founder of Fortescue | \"The government's $2 a kilogram subsidy for green hydrogen was absolutely imperative to get our country into a leading position to produce a replacement for oil and gas.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Billionaire, Founder of Fortescue | \"At the very least Fortescue's green iron plans will rely on green hydrogen.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Billionaire, Founder of Fortescue | \"Only delinquent irresponsible leaders will advocate for the continued use of extremely damaging energy sources.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Billionaire, Founder of Fortescue | \"Green electricity is the only source of rapid to develop, inexpensive new sources of energy.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Billionaire, Founder of Fortescue | \"Fortescue's green energy expansion would be done in years.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
