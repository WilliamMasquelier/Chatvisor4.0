The time of others persuading you that greenwashing is a better \nreturn to shareholders and your community is over.\" Dr Forrest said the size of the deal was \"jaw-dropping\".\n\"It really does point the way for the future of the mining industry going zero emissions, and it points the way for \nheavy industry running out of excuses,\" he said. \"If these two companies are issuing their largest agreements ever, \nand it's 100 per cent zero emissions, then that tells you which way heavy industry, particularly the mining industry, \nis going.\n\"This is where the smart end of town is going. This is where we're leading, and we're doing it for shareholders.\" \nUnder the deal with Liebherr, Fortescue will purchase 360 autonomous, battery-electric trucks, 55 electric \nexcavators and 60 battery-powered dozers.\nThe deal is an expansion of an original agreement struck between the two companies in 2022, for 120 haul trucks.\nFortescue developed the battery technology to be used in the haul trucks and jointly developed the Automated \nHaulage Solution, with the trucks employing a robotic charging system that will avoid issues such as having to \nqueue machines for charging, Fortescue said.\nPage 2 of 2\nTruck loads of green\n\"All of the trucks in this fleet will ultimately be equipped with a zero-emission battery power system developed by \nFortescue Zero and the jointly developed Autonomous Haulage Solution - both of which were built to be scalable \nso they can be retrofitted onto existing Liebherr haul trucks,\" Fortescue said.\nThe new T 264 trucks will begin onsite validation at Fortescue's Pilbara operations at the end of 2025, the \ncompany said.\n\"The approximately 360-strong T 264 truck fleet has already begun arriving to Fortescue's Western Australian \noperations, with the first trucks delivered to Fortescue's Eliwana mine in October 2023,\" the company said. \"The \ninitial 240-tonne capacity trucks will be converted to zero-emission powertrains before 2030.\"\nLoad-Date: September 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
