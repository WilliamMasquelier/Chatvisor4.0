Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 15\nLength: 623 words\nByline: James Thomson\nBody\nThe stunning 9000-word profile of Andrew Forrest by The Australian Financial Review associate editor Primrose \nRiordan is a portrait of one of our great entrepreneurs in all his glory - passionate, driven, visionary, pugilistic and, \nby his own admission, imperfect.\nBut alongside the in-depth exploration of Forrest's fascinating character is the story of a great Australian business \napproaching a pivotal moment - maybe the most pivotal since Forrest willed the company into existence through \nsheer force of personality.\nIn the coming years, Forrest must bring investors along on a great juggling act, as he manages growing pressure \non his flagship iron ore business, a capital-hungry, but earnings-accretive decarbonisation program, and a new \npush into green iron. It's a puzzle worth tens of billions of dollars.\nFortescue has rightly earned a reputation as a dividend machine in the past five years, but the 31 per cent fall in \nthe company's share price this year speaks to the pressure on its revenue and earnings from a sagging iron ore \nprice.\nThe long-term outlook for prices isn't good. Citi, for example, has a long-term target of $US85 for iron ore in 2026; it \nestimates about 200 million tonnes of new supply is scheduled to come into the market and Chinese steel demand \nhas peaked and will gently decline, even with the economic stimulus that is widely predicted for next year. \nFortescue's revenue is expected to fall from $US18.2 billion ($28.6 billion) in the 2024 financial year to $US16.3 \nbillion in 2025 and $US14.1 billion in 2026 and $US13.9 billion in 2027, according to projections from RBC Capital.\nTotal annual dividends are tipped to fall from $1.97 in 2024 to 67\u00a2 in 2027, as free cash flow before dividends and \ndebt drops from $US5.1 billion to $US2.9 billion.\nAs a falling iron ore price squeezes the sustainability of the dividend from one end, investors are worried about \nanother squeeze coming from Fortescue's capital expenditure bill.\nPage 2 of 2\nMercurial Forrest approaches a pivotal moment for Fortescue Comment\nForrest's grand plan to decarbonise Fortescue's mining operations by retooling its heavy mining equipment by as \nearly as 2030 will need at least $US6.2 billion on the company's estimates, although analysts believe the cost is \nmore like $US7 billion to $US8 billion.\nThere is value to be extracted from this decarbonisation push, which Jarden analyst Jon Bishop puts at $1.87 a \nshare if Fortescue hits its target of zero carbon emission (without the help of offsets) by a conservative 2040, or \n$2.25 a share if the target is achieved by the company's stated aim of 2030.\nBut Bishop remains frustrated at the lack of detail from Fortescue about the size of the capex bill over the next five \nyears - which he believes the market is underestimating - and the potential savings that could be generated by a \ndecarbonised mining operation.\n\"The capex numbers assumed in our estimates are anchored to guidance that, beyond FY25, lacks significant \ngranularity and is therefore prone to significant changes in due course. However, in our view, whatever the final \nnumbers are, they are large,\" he says of the capex task ahead.\nThere are other questions too. The green hydrogen dream is off the table for now, but the market is still struggling \nto get its head around the cost of Fortescue's green ammonia projects.\nThen there's Forrest's nascent plan to value-add to iron ore by turning it into green iron, which is where low-carbon \nsolutions such as green hydrogen and solar energy are used to remove waste elements from iron ore (such as \nsilica and alumina), leaving behind a product that is almost pure iron. What this project looks like, and what it costs, \nisn't quite clear.\nForrest has plenty of credits in the bank with investors. But they're looking for meat on the bones of his grand \nvision.\nLoad-Date: December 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"Forrest's grand plan to decarbonise Fortescue's mining operations by retooling its heavy mining equipment by as early as 2030 will need at least $US6.2 billion on the company's estimates, although analysts believe the cost is more like $US7 billion to $US8 billion.\" | N.A. |\n| Jon Bishop | Analyst at Jarden | \"The capex numbers assumed in our estimates are anchored to guidance that, beyond FY25, lacks significant granularity and is therefore prone to significant changes in due course.
