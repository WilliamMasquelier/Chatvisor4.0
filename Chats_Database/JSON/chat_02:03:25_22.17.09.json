The company had been consistently increasing shareholder payouts since 2016, but due to financial struggles, it has decided to halt these payments to focus on investments without raising additional capital. This move could negatively impact investor confidence and stock performance, as dividends are a key attraction for shareholders. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company has suffered a major financial setback, reporting an EBITDA of 18.7 billion Danish kroner (\u20ac2.5 billion) for 2023, which is below its projected range of 20-23 billion kroner. A significant portion of this shortfall is attributed to a 9.6 billion kroner provision for cancellation costs related to the termination of the Ocean Wind 1 project in the U.S. This financial underperformance highlights the challenges \u00d8rsted faces in managing its offshore wind projects profitably. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has decided to cut its renewable energy project targets by at least 24%, reducing its planned capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This reduction signals a retreat from its previous ambitious expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The company is also exiting several emerging offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, limiting its future growth opportunities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company is implementing significant job cuts, with up to 800 positions being eliminated globally. The first phase will see 250 layoffs in the coming months. These job losses reflect the financial strain \u00d8rsted is under and could have negative social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s market capitalization has plummeted by more than 70% since its peak in early 2021, when it was valued at over \u20ac76.5 billion. The company, once the third-largest utility in Europe, now ranks 14th in the sector, with a market value of just \u20ac16 billion. This dramatic decline underscores the financial instability and investor concerns surrounding the company. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has incurred massive financial losses, posting around \u00a32.2 billion in losses for 2023. The company has also written off \u00a33.3 billion from its wind farm business, reflecting the severe financial difficulties it faces. These losses are largely due to the abandonment of several offshore wind projects in the U.S., which resulted in billions in impairments. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s financial struggles have forced it to scale back offshore wind projects, which could result in the construction of 1,500 fewer wind turbines than originally planned. This reduction in capacity could slow the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure and impact global climate goals. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, is stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company\u2019s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company has faced significant challenges in the U.S. market, particularly in securing tax credits for its offshore wind projects. Last year, \u00d8rsted canceled two major offshore wind projects, Ocean Wind I and II, due to rising costs, resulting in a financial hit of 28.4 billion Danish kroner (\u00a33.3 billion). These cancellations highlight the financial and regulatory difficulties of expanding renewable energy in the U.S. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for the company to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s financial troubles have led analysts to speculate that it may need to seek additional funding from investors. However, instead of raising capital, \u00d8rsted has opted for cost-cutting measures, which could prolong financial uncertainty and increase risks for the company\u2019s future stability. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to implement a drastic austerity plan, including a comprehensive review of its project portfolio. The company is prioritizing projects with the highest potential returns while reducing risks in development and execution. This shift in strategy indicates a retreat from aggressive expansion and a more cautious approach to investment. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s decision to exit key offshore wind markets, including Spain, Portugal, and Norway, as well as to deprioritize certain activities in Japan, represents a significant contraction of its global footprint. This retreat could weaken its competitive position in the rapidly growing offshore wind sector. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024] - \u00d8rsted has suffered a massive financial loss, reporting a net loss of 2.7 billion euros for 2023. This marks a significant downturn from the previous year when the company had recorded a profit of approximately 2 billion euros. The losses stem largely from the cancellation of major offshore wind projects in the U.S., including Ocean Wind 1 and 2, which resulted in impairments of 3.8 billion euros. Additionally, the company has set aside 1.5 billion euros in provisions for potential compensation payments related to these canceled projects. This financial instability raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to sustain its aggressive expansion strategy in the renewable energy sector. [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to implement drastic cost-cutting measures, including the elimination of 600 to 800 jobs worldwide. This decision is part of a broader austerity plan aimed at reducing fixed costs by 130 million euros by 2026. The job cuts will have significant social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities, further highlighting the financial strain the company is under. [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]\n\n- The company has announced a suspension of dividend payments until at least 2025, a move that could negatively impact investor confidence. \u00d8rsted had previously been a reliable dividend payer, making this decision a major shift in its financial strategy. The suspension reflects the company\u2019s urgent need to preserve capital amid mounting financial losses, but it may also deter investors who rely on dividends for returns. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s market value has plummeted by 70% over the past three years, reflecting a severe loss of investor confidence. The company, once a leader in the offshore wind sector, has seen its stock price decline sharply due to financial struggles, project cancellations, and rising costs. This decline in market capitalization raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s long-term viability and its ability to attract new investments. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]\n\n- The company has been forced to scale back its renewable energy ambitions, reducing its planned offshore wind capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This represents a significant retreat from its previous expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The reduction in capacity means fewer wind turbines will be built, potentially impacting the broader offshore wind industry. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has exited several key offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, as part of its cost-cutting strategy. This retreat limits the company\u2019s future growth opportunities and weakens its competitive position in the rapidly expanding offshore wind sector. The decision to withdraw from these markets reflects the financial pressures \u00d8rsted is facing and its need to focus on more profitable projects. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024]\n\n- The company has incurred significant financial losses due to the cancellation of major offshore wind projects in the U.S. The abandonment of Ocean Wind 1 and 2 alone resulted in a financial hit of 3.7 billion euros. These cancellations were driven by rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and higher interest rates, which made the projects financially unviable. The failure to complete these projects raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. [de Volkskrant, Marc van Den Eerenbeemt, February 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles have forced it to sell off assets worth 15 billion euros in an effort to stabilize its balance sheet. This asset divestment strategy indicates the severity of the company\u2019s financial difficulties and its need to generate liquidity. However, selling off key assets could weaken \u00d8rsted\u2019s long-term growth potential and reduce its influence in the offshore wind sector. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]\n\n- The company has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have significantly increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for \u00d8rsted to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. The combination of these factors has contributed to the company\u2019s financial downturn and forced it to reassess its investment strategy. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s leadership has been in turmoil, with its chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company\u2019s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning, further complicating \u00d8rsted\u2019s efforts to recover from its financial difficulties. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024] - \u00d8rsted experienced a leadership crisis in late 2023, with the abrupt dismissal of its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Daniel Lerup and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Richard Hunter following a disastrous financial year. The company suffered a massive loss of \u20ac2.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to high write-offs from abandoned offshore wind projects on the U.S. East Coast. This leadership shake-up reflects the severity of \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles and raises concerns about stability at the top levels of management. Frequent executive turnover can disrupt strategic planning and investor confidence. [Energie & Management, Volker Stephan, February 27, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to divest a significant stake in its U.S. onshore wind farms, selling off equity ownership in four wind farms with a total capacity of 957 MW for approximately $300 million. This marks the company\u2019s second major asset divestment in the U.S., highlighting its need to generate liquidity amid financial difficulties. While \u00d8rsted retains operational control, the sale indicates that the company is struggling to maintain its ambitious renewable energy expansion without offloading assets. Such divestments could weaken its long-term market position in the U.S. renewable energy sector. [Nordic Business Report, Anonymous, March 13, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted and other offshore wind developers faced significant financial challenges in 2023, leading to the cancellation of multiple projects in the U.S. Northeast. High inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising costs of capital and building materials made these projects financially unviable. These cancellations represent a major setback for \u00d8rsted\u2019s U.S. expansion strategy and could slow the overall growth of offshore wind energy in the country. The inability to complete these projects raises concerns about the company\u2019s financial resilience and its capacity to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. [The Independent, Jennifer McDermott, March 14, 2024] There are no negative issues found related to \u00d8rsted in the provided articles. - \u00d8rsted has decided to exit the French renewable energy market by selling its wind and solar assets to Engie. This move is part of a broader strategy to scale back its ambitions and focus on markets where it sees higher value potential. However, this retreat from France signals financial distress and a lack of confidence in its ability to compete in the region. The company had already suffered a significant financial loss of 2.7 billion euros in 2023, largely due to setbacks in the U.S. market. This withdrawal could weaken \u00d8rsted\u2019s position in the European renewable energy sector and limit its future growth opportunities.

[El Economista, Rub\u00e9n Esteller, April 29, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s stock price has plummeted by more than 50% since late 2021, reflecting a severe loss of investor confidence. The company, once a leader in the offshore wind sector, has seen its market value decline sharply due to financial struggles, project cancellations, and rising costs. This decline in market capitalization raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s long-term viability and its ability to attract new investments. The company\u2019s financial troubles have made it a less attractive option for institutional investors, further exacerbating its difficulties. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, June 01, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted was forced to cancel two major offshore wind projects in New Jersey in October 2023, citing financial infeasibility. These cancellations represent a major setback for the company\u2019s U.S. expansion strategy and could slow the overall growth of offshore wind energy in the country. The failure to complete these projects raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial resilience and its capacity to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. The company had been far along in the approval process before abruptly scrapping the projects, which may damage its reputation with regulators and investors. [The Independent, Wayne Parry, July 17, 2024] - \u00d8rsted has been forced to cancel its flagship green fuel factory, the FlagshipONE project in Sweden, due to a lack of demand for e-methanol. The project was intended to supply container ships with 55,000 tonnes of methanol annually, contributing to the global transition away from fossil fuels. However, the company was unable to secure long-term contracts at viable prices, leading to a financial impairment of 1.5 billion Danish kroner (\u00a3172 million). This cancellation highlights the challenges \u00d8rsted faces in diversifying beyond offshore wind and raises concerns about the viability of large-scale green fuel projects. The decision also reflects broader struggles in the renewable energy sector, as other energy majors have similarly scaled back ambitious projects. [Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 15, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has suffered another financial setback with a 2.1 billion Danish kroner impairment at its Revolution Wind project near Martha\u2019s Vineyard, off the U.S. East Coast. The delay in constructing the onshore substation has pushed the commercial operation date from 2025 to 2026, leading to additional financial losses. This delay follows the company\u2019s earlier cancellations of two major offshore wind projects in New Jersey, Ocean Wind I and II, which had already resulted in significant financial impairments. The repeated project delays and cancellations raise concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments efficiently and profitably.

This delay contributes to an impairment cost of 3.2 billion Danish kroner ($472 million) in its second-quarter financial results. The postponement follows the company\u2019s earlier decision to cancel two major wind farms off the New Jersey coast, Ocean Wind I and II, due to surging costs. These setbacks, combined with \u00d8rsted\u2019s broader financial struggles, including job cuts and market withdrawals, indicate significant instability in its offshore wind expansion strategy. [The Guardian, Jillian Ambrose, August 15, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial troubles have led to a major restructuring effort, including the elimination of up to 800 jobs and a retreat from key offshore wind markets such as Spain, Portugal, and Norway. The company has also suspended dividend payments for the 2023-2025 financial years in an attempt to stabilize its finances. These drastic measures reflect the severe financial strain \u00d8rsted is under, as it struggles with rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and higher interest rates. The job cuts and market withdrawals could weaken \u00d8rsted\u2019s competitive position in the offshore wind sector and slow the global transition to renewable energy.

Version:5\nLength: 1120 words\nByline: By Jonathan Leake\nHighlight: Profits from record-breaking green expansion will go to foreign energy firms\nBody\nBill payers are to spend as much as \u00a3150 per household on new wind turbines as Ed Miliband oversees a record-\nbreaking expansion of green energy. \nThe money \u2013 a total of \u00a33bn, which will ultimately come from consumers \u2013 is to fund the construction or expansion \nof nine offshore wind sites between 2027 and 2031, most of them owned by foreign energy companies, plus other \ngreen technologies such as onshore wind and solar.\nDenmark\u2019s state-controlled energy company Orsted is among the biggest winners, along with ScottishPower, which \nis owned by Spanish utility Iberdrola.\nThe money for wind turbines has been agreed as part of a government auction for renewable energy contracts \nknown as the Allocation Round 6 (AR6). Under this system, the Government encourages companies to build low-\ncarbon energy plants such as solar and wind farms by offering a minimum price for the electricity generated. The \nmoney for such subsidies is eventually added to bills.\nThe UK\u2019s power grid operator, National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO), calculates \u201cbudget impact\u201d of the \nsubsidies for offshore wind and other renewables at \u00a34bn from 2026 to 2031, in today\u2019s money. \nThe costs given exclude the additional expense of transmission lines and the expansion of the national grid to \nhandle the extra power. \nIt means more than five gigawatts (GW) of new offshore wind is now set for construction \u2013 a stark contrast to last \nyear\u2019s botched auction round when there were no bids.  The Tories offered subsidies so low \u2013 at \u00a340 per megawatt \nhour (MWh) \u2013 that no offshore wind developers came forward. Subsidies under Mr Miliband will be more than \ndoubled to more than \u00a382 per MWh.\nPage 2 of 3\nEd Miliband adds \u00a3150 to household bills with wind turbine building spree\nSolar farms will get \u00a370/Mwh, with newer technologies like floating wind handed \u00a3195/Mwh and tidal stream \nprojects given \u00a3239/Mwh.\nA total of 131 clean energy projects have won state subsidies in this year\u2019s auction, including 115 solar projects \nacross England and onshore wind projects mainly in Scotland and Wales. \nMany of the onshore projects are likely to prove highly controversial, with homeowners and environmentalists \nobjecting to the industrialisation of landscapes with panels and turbines. \nHowever, Mr Miliband hailed the auction results as a triumph. The Energy Secretary said: \u201cWe inherited a broken \nenergy policy ... Today we have a record-setting round for enough renewable power for 11m homes, essential to \ngive energy security to families across the country. \n\u201cIt is another significant step forward in our mission for clean power by 2030 \u2013 bringing Britain energy independence \nand lower bills for good.\u201d \nHowever, much will depend on the market value of electricity in coming years. If the market value rises above the \nvalues offered under the contracts for difference (CfDs), the energy companies could end up refunding part of the \nextra money.\nOrsted  is one of the biggest winners. It has been allowed to shunt much of its Hornsea 3 project out of contracts \nsigned under previous allocation rounds, where lower subsidies were offered, into this year\u2019s auction.\nA spokesman for Mr Miliband said the move had been permitted because otherwise Hornsea 3 \u2013 potentially the \nworld\u2019s largest wind farm at 3GW  \u2013 might never have been built.\nCritics will argue that such contracts become meaningless if companies can simply move them from one auction \nround if a subsequent one offers better terms. \nOrsted was also awarded a 2.4GW CfD for Hornsea 4. Rasmus Errboe, of Orsted, said: \u201cWe look forward to \ndelivering these landmark projects, which will supply renewable power at a large scale to UK consumers and \nbusinesses and help the UK Government achieve its target of quadrupling offshore wind capacity to 60GW by \n2030.\u201d\nScottishPower, owned by Spanish utility giant Iberdrola, has been offered contracts for another two large wind \nfarms, East Anglia Two and East Anglia Three. As with Orsted, it was allowed to move its East Anglia Three project \nout of the contracts signed under a previous and less lucrative auction into this year\u2019s round. \nKeith Anderson, the chief executive of ScottishPower, said: \u201cOffshore wind is back on track after last year\u2019s misstep.\n\u201cThis auction\u2019s success shows this tried and tested investment mechanism, replicated globally, delivers exactly the \nscale of action needed, with billions of pounds to be pumped into the British economy replacing ageing, polluting \ninfrastructure.\u201d\nHowever profits from ScottishPower\u2019s projects will go to Iberdrola\u2019s shareholders \u2013 largely in Spain.\nResponding to today\u2019s CfD auction AR6 results, Emma Pinchbeck, Energy UK\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAR6 \nrepresents a crucial step in the journey to clean power by 2030. As we recover from an energy crisis caused by our \nexposure to international fossil fuel prices, it\u2019s more important than ever that we build a clean energy system that \ncan ensure our energy security and protect homes and businesses across the country from unaffordable energy \nbills.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThis is by far the cheapest way to power the UK.\u201d\nClaire Coutinho, the shadow energy secretary, said: \u201cI welcome the 5GW of offshore wind contracted in the latest \nrenewable auction which I started last year. Page 3 of 3\nEd Miliband adds \u00a3150 to household bills with wind turbine building spree\n\u201cUnder the Conservatives, Britain built more offshore wind than any other country bar China, thanks to the \ncompetition enabled by CfDs \u2013 which the Conservatives introduced in 2014.\u201d\nJohn Constable, director of Renewable Energy Foundation, a UK charity publishing data on the renewables sector, \nsaid: \u201cEd Miliband is spending consumer funds on a scale that is as reckless as it will be eye-wateringly painful. \nBillions in new subsidies on an offshore wind industry that was only recently claiming to have slashed costs, billions \nto make nuclear viable in markets distorted by wind and solar, and yet more in charges to pay for grid and \nconstraint payments.\u201d\nHe concluded: \u201cThis cannot end well.\u201d\nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesman said it did not recognise the costs per household, but \nrenewable energy remained essential to boost UK energy security. \n\u201cInvesting in renewables is crucial to reverse the legacy of a broken energy policy, so we are no longer reliant on \nvolatile fossil fuel prices which left us vulnerable to a cost of living crisis. These projects will help protect bill payers \npermanently.\u201d\nIndustry experts said the 3.4GW of generation capacity delivered by the auction was far short of what the \nGovernment needed \u2013 leaving a gap of 28GW to be filled by 2026. \nSam Hollister, of energy consultancy LCP Delta said: \u201cThis auction only delivered 3.4GW of new offshore wind \nprojects, with another 1.5GW already in the pipeline. This is well below the levels that were needed in this auction \nfor the UK to reach its target of 55GW of offshore wind by 2030.\u201d\nLoad-Date: September 3, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Telegraph\nAuthor: Jonathan Leake\nDate: September 03, 2024\nTitle: Ed Miliband adds \u00a3150 to household bills with wind turbine building spree\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Londres annonce des accords pour 10 gigawatts d'\u00e9nergie renouvelable\n## Media outlet: Les Echos\n### Author: Nicolas Madelaine\n### Date: September 03, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nLondres annonce des accords pour 10 gigawatts d'\u00e9nergie renouvelable\nLondres annonce des accords pour 10 gigawatts d'\u00e9nergie renouvelable\nLesEchos.fr\nmardi 3 septembre 2024\nCopyright 2024 Les Echos tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s\nSection: ARTICLE; Prix en hausse\nLength: 494 words\nByline: NICOLAS MADELAINE\nHighlight: Le gouvernement dirig\u00e9 par le Labour a relev\u00e9 le prix garanti de revente de l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 produite.

            "content": "- \u00d8rsted has been forced to cancel its flagship green fuel factory, the FlagshipONE project in Sweden, due to a lack of demand for e-methanol. The project was intended to supply container ships with 55,000 tonnes of methanol annually, contributing to the global transition away from fossil fuels. However, the company was unable to secure long-term contracts at viable prices, leading to a financial impairment of 1.5 billion Danish kroner (\u00a3172 million). This cancellation highlights the challenges \u00d8rsted faces in diversifying beyond offshore wind and raises concerns about the viability of large-scale green fuel projects. The decision also reflects broader struggles in the renewable energy sector, as other energy majors have similarly scaled back ambitious projects. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 16, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has suffered another financial impairment of 2.1 billion Danish kroner due to delays at its Revolution Wind project near Martha\u2019s Vineyard, off the U.S. East Coast. The delay in constructing the onshore substation has pushed the commercial operation date from 2025 to 2026, leading to additional financial losses. This setback follows the company\u2019s earlier cancellations of two major offshore wind projects in New Jersey, Ocean Wind I and II, which had already resulted in significant financial impairments. The repeated project delays and cancellations raise concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments efficiently and profitably. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 16, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s stock price has plummeted by more than 7% following the announcement of impairment losses totaling 3.2 billion Danish kroner (\u00a3370 million) in the second quarter due to project delays in the U.S. The company has faced setbacks with its Revolution Wind project off the coasts of Connecticut and Rhode Island, as well as impairments related to its canceled Ocean Wind project and the abandoned FlagshipONE green e-methanol project in Sweden. These financial hits indicate ongoing difficulties in executing large-scale renewable energy projects profitably, further eroding investor confidence. [Proactive Investors (UK), Josh Lamb, August 15, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s withdrawal from the FlagshipONE project in Sweden underscores the broader challenges facing the synthetic fuel market. The company had planned to invest over 500 million euros in the facility, which was expected to produce 55,000 tonnes of e-methanol annually. However, the high costs of production and the reluctance of shipping companies to pay a premium for sustainable methanol led to the project\u2019s cancellation. This failure highlights the economic and regulatory uncertainties surrounding synthetic fuels and raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to successfully diversify its renewable energy portfolio. [Les Echos, Nicolas Rauline, August 23, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been allowed to shift parts of its Hornsea 3 offshore wind project into a more recent and lucrative government auction round, raising concerns about the fairness of the UK\u2019s renewable energy subsidy system. Critics argue that such contract adjustments undermine the credibility of the auction process, as companies can move projects to rounds with higher subsidies, potentially inflating costs for consumers. This move has sparked debate over whether the government\u2019s renewable energy policies are being manipulated to benefit large energy firms at the expense of billpayers.
