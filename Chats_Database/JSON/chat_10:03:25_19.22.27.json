Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 28\nLength: 631 words\nByline: Anthony Macdonald\nBody\nFortescue could use a new friend. And quickly. The stock dropped like a stone yesterday, taking the benchmark \nS&P/ASX 200 down with it.\nWhy? Because it lost one of its two big long-term backers; the sort of shareholder that picks and sticks and helps \nsomeone like Andrew Forrest have the certainty and platform to create a $63 billion miner.\nThat shareholder was US fund manager Capital Group, a rusted-on Fortescue bull that backed Forrest's growth \nstory in the early years and collected its substantial dividends later.\nIt was a great trade for both sides; Fortescue got a steady and loyal institutional shareholder (not as common as \nyou might think), while Capital got a substantial stake in a stunningly strong cash machine. This time last year, \nCapital was Fortescue's third-biggest shareholder with a 7.94 per cent stake.\nBut managers and their views change, and now Capital is on hard retreat. There have been two block trades worth \na combined $3 billion in the past six weeks via JPMorgan's equities desk, and they can only have come from \nCapital Group. Fortescue stock was down 10 per cent yesterday, dragging the ASX 200 down with it.\nWhat sparked it? We're told it is internal changes at Capital. What matters for Fortescue - and indeed its other \nshareholders now getting washed around in the swell - is where the stock went.\nWhoever bought it, it is unlikely that Fortescue has found another Capital Group. Such high-conviction and deep-\npocketed investors are rare; they pretty much do not exist anywhere else.\nThere are no active managers with substantial stakes at BHP or Rio Tinto, for example, or any of the big four \nbanks. Offshore miner Glencore has a good, sticky institutional shareholder with an 8 per cent stake - but once \nagain, it is Capital.\nSo, Fortescue needs to find a way to get a dozen or more smaller institutions - the sort that don't have $5 billion \ntied up in a stock like Capital did at Fortescue this time last year - to invest, or invest more. It needs more \nwidespread support than it has had.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue plunge reveals huge shoes to fill\nThe steady grind lower in China's bond yields is evidence that investors are betting more rate cuts will be needed to \nstimulate the economy.\nCapital did stunningly well on its Fortescue investment. When the investor first disclosed its stake in February \n2015, it had just picked up 67.6 million Fortescue shares at an average $2.34 each.\nThe stock's now above $18, nearly hit $30 in February, and has paid $11.26 a share in dividends since, which puts \nit in 10-bagger-plus territory.\nFortescue shares yesterday closed at $18.32. The stock traded weakly all day, which suggests some of those \nCapital shares are yet to find a medium-term home. Until they do, it could be a choppy ride.\nCapital's big sell orders leave Fortescue holding on to its one long-term backer (two if you count the Forrests' \nTattarang), China's Hunan Valin Iron and Steel Group, which doubles as a customer.\nHunan Valin bought its initial 260 million shares, still the bulk of its holding, in the 2009 financial year, which means \nits interest predates Capital's. And like Capital, it has also done very well. It paid $US452 million ($645 million) for \nthose shares 15 years ago. If it thought about it in Australian dollars, that's an entry price at less than $2.50 a share \nin return for stock now worth more than $18 and having paid $11.71 in dividends. The difference is that it is a \nstrategic investor and is yet to head for an exit.\nIt comes as investors and analysts are still trying to work out what's going on with Fortescue's energy arm. The \ncompany jettisoned its 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 production target a fortnight ago, although \nmanagement made it pretty clear on last week's quarterly production call that the push was more delayed rather \nthan abandoned.\nANTHONY MACDONALD\nLoad-Date: August 2, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's founder | \"Fortescue could use a new friend.
