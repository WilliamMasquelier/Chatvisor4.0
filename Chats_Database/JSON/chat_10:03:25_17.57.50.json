Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: FEATURES; Pg. 36\nLength: 2084 words\nByline: Jennifer Hewett\nBody\nBusiness acumen Mark Barnaba has an uncanny ability to forge close relationships that turn into long-term \nopportunities, writes Jennifer Hewett.\nMark Barnaba met a brash, young New York property developer in 1988. Donald Trump had sold the iconic St \nMoritz hotel in Manhattan to Alan Bond for $US180 million. Barnaba was Bond's young executive assistant.\n\"Even then, Trump was just extraordinarily firm in his own views regardless of what others thought,\" Barnaba says. \n\"He's not easily persuaded.\"\nIt's one more adventure in a now crowded corporate history that features Barnaba's close relationships with some \nof Australia's most famous - or infamous - business leaders.\nBarnaba promised to work for an almost equally brash and persuasive West Australian entrepreneur for two years \nin exchange for Bond's help in funding his degree from Harvard Business School.\nThis was after Bond had read an article about the ambitions of a bright, young university medallist in The West \nAustralian newspaper and immediately called him in for a chat.\nThe Bond empire collapsed before Barnaba's two years was up. Barnaba jokes he was \"green as a cabbage\" while \nBond was ditching assets - from Chilean phone businesses, to Heileman Brewing, to private aircraft - in a desperate \nattempt to stay afloat.\nBut he describes the ability to listen and observe as key to an \"incredible education\", leading to many more \nencounters with more billionaire entrepreneurs.\nThat list includes Andrew Forrest and Robin Khuda. Barnaba has been on the board of Fortescue Metals Group \nsince 2010. He will step down as lead independent director next month but remains as deputy chairman.\nHe is also independent chairman of Australia's latest global success story, AirTrunk, the big data centre developer \nbought by Blackstone last month for a staggering $24 billion.\nPage 2 of 5\nA director with a golden touch for connecting\nThe evening the sale was announced, Khuda celebrated over dinner at Barnaba's spectacular riverside home in \nPerth's Mosman Park. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was another guest.\nChalk it up as another remarkable day and night in the life of one of the country's most well-connected directors - \nbut in almost the mirror image of the stereotypical Melbourne club directors who once dominated corporate \nAustralia. It's the triumph of new money and new opportunities over old - always with the lure of more to come, new \nrecords to beat.\nBarnaba, for example, is also chairman of Greatland Gold, which is in the news after paying $US475 million ($709 \nmillion) for Newmont Mining's gold and copper assets in Western Australia. This was the largest capital raising in \nmining in the UK in seven years. Next step is an ASX listing in 2025.\nBarnaba, 61, is the son of immigrant Italians and credits his own supportive family for his rise.\nBut he has also always forged other tight personal connections, helping him become a major player in corporate \nconsultancy work in WA before an array of senior executive roles and directorships.\nOver those decades, this has involved stints with McKinsey and his own boutique advisory firms, executive roles at \nMacquarie Bank and board positions on prominent corporate, sporting and not-for-profit businesses, including the \nReserve Bank board.\nHis enthusiasm for what has been achieved - and by whom - is undimmed.\nHe happily describes his old friend Forrest and his new mate Khuda as \"incredible Australians\" he's been fortunate \nto work alongside.\n\"It's a privilege working with companies like Fortescue, AirTrunk, Greatland, even in a prior life the RBA and \nMacquarie,\" he says.\n\"Think about how many companies there are that have really exported themselves out of Australia.\"\nIt translates into Barnaba's belief in the success of founder-led companies or those that are still greatly influenced \nby the original DNA in shaping the culture.\n\"At the end of the day, what separates those companies is culture,\" he says. \"They are all different cultures, but \nthey are distinctive and they are world-class.\n\"It's difficult to argue that the organisations aren't materially better off still having their founders there.\"\nAccording to Barnaba, Blackstone is a strong, very supportive and natural owner of AirTrunk and will \"bring a lot to \nthe party\".\n\"Both Blackstone and Robin asked me to stay because if it wasn't for Robin, I wouldn't want to be there,\" he says.\n\"Often you have to ask: do you make a decision based on the naked nature of the opportunity or on the quality of \nthe individuals involved? Ideally, you want all of one - the people - and some of the other - the opportunity.\"\nSo he probably wouldn't have gone to work at Macquarie in 2011, he insists, had it not been for people he greatly \nadmires, such as former chief executive Nicholas Moore and ex head of Macquarie Capital Robin Bishop, doing the \nasking.\nBut Barnaba also fosters an instinctive ability to translate personal attachments into long-term business \nopportunities. When Barnaba became chairman of AirTrunk in October last year, an enthusiastic Khuda cited his \nextensive background in scaling fast-growing businesses, his entrepreneurial acumen and deep understanding of \ncapital markets.\nYet the major link, personal and professional, was Macquarie and its original investment in AirTrunk.Page 3 of 5\nA director with a golden touch for connecting\nAs the business prepared itself for an IPO or sale, Barnaba replaced Ani Satchcroft, Macquarie Asset \nManagement's head of infrastructure, as chair. She happened to be married to Alex Satchcroft, an ex-Macquarie \nbanker, who had worked with the current head of risk, Andrew Cassidy, when Ben Brazil was one of the investment \nbank's key deal makers.\nNaturally, Barnaba and Brazil have been friends since their 20s. Naturally, Alex Satchcroft and Cassidy also knew \nBarnaba well from their overlapping time at Macquarie. Naturally, Cassidy asked Barnaba if he would take a call \nfrom Ani Satchcroft.\nThose sorts of intricate relationships are liberally sprinkled over Barnaba's corporate record. But are they a little too \nclose for claims to independence? The top echelons in Australia's business community can seem incestuous in \ntheir circles within circles, the WA business community even more so.\nBarnaba has been close friends with Forrest for decades, for example, as well as being Fortescue's deputy \nchairman since 2017 and lead independent director since 2014. Forrest's private company Wyloo Metals has \nbecome a cornerstone investor in Greatland.\nBarnaba will only step down as lead independent director after proxy advisers last year questioned the \nremuneration packages and the sudden exits of a relatively new CEO, Fiona Hicks, along with other key executives.\nFortescue said at the time that Barnaba's replacement would \"be a key component of the board's renewal strategy\" \neven though Barnaba will stay as deputy chairman.\nForrest has, of course, made an art form of defying the traditional corporate rules and restraints to build a massive \nbusiness.\n\"If anything, I feel more independent than I have during my whole tenure because independence is a state of mind \nand not an outcome dedicated by length of service on a board,\" Barnaba argues.\n\"If you spend enough time on a board with colleagues, you get to know them well and end up sharing aspects of \nyour lives together.\n\"But it doesn't have to - and shouldn't - impair independence. It never has for me. It's just not in my nature. I wear a \nbadge of objective and independent thinking.\"\nTake that, corporate governance specialists.\nWhat is never in question is Barnaba's admiration for Forrest.\n\"The man is one of the country's greatest ever industrialists,\" he says.\n\"There's no other way to frame that. He has got stamina and energy and vision like no one I have ever known.\"\nAnd Barnaba has known Forrest a long time.\nAfter several years operating out of London with McKinsey, his initial foray into the boutique advisory world in Perth \nin the mid-1990s soon included work for someone he had first encountered while still at the University of Western \nAustralia.\n\"He doesn't remember that, but I remember it, because Andrew always made an impression.\" Barnaba says drily.\nBy the time of their renewed acquaintance, Forrest was trying to develop Anaconda Nickel before being forced out \nin 2001 by investors dismayed at their losses.\nThe relationship survived and thrived - unlike Forrest's standing with many Australian investors and US \nbondholders.Page 4 of 5\nA director with a golden touch for connecting\nBarnaba has been along for most of the wild ride since the indefatigable Forrest began to build again with \nFortescue.\nThis included another near-death corporate experience after the iron ore price collapsed against a heavily indebted \nbusiness, requiring radical new debt restructuring to be set up at hyper-speed.\nFortescue's perilous dance with survival is in the past. Despite delays or missteps in Forrest's more recent forays \ninto areas such as green hydrogen and nickel, the company is securely enough grounded in the iron ore wealth of \nthe Pilbara to accommodate his ambitions to help lead the energy revolution.\n\"Andrew's mantra, which we all believe, is to show you can do real zero - not net zero, real zero - profitably and \nFortescue is in the process of showing that,\" Barnaba says firmly.\nThat may prove an even bigger test than creating a new iron ore business.\nNor does Barnaba see any conflict in holding his view on renewables while chairing a massive data centre operator \ngrappling with the extreme, unresolved energy demands of data centres in an artificial intelligence world.\nAirTrunk, he says, is one of the most sustainably aware and advanced companies globally, with a policy of net zero \nby 2030.\n\"The ones that do it best are the ones that do it from within,\" he says. \"If it's forced on you, you never get as far as \nquickly.\"\nAll such challenges were beyond any board's thinking in the distant era when Barnaba started his corporate \nconsulting career.\nIn 2001, the WA consulting business he started with two mates and veteran deal maker John Poynton was sold for \n$44 million.\n\"You wake up and think: 'I've got balance sheet'. I never expected that to occur in my 30s,\" he says, calling it \nanother \"life-changing experience\".\nHe went deeper into boutique investment banking, co-founding Azure Capital with Poynton, before selling out of \nthat in 2010 and taking up the role with Macquarie.\nUnusually for the perpetually smooth Barnaba, the break with Poynton was personal as well as professional.\nNone of his activities stopped him holding an extensive variety of WA board roles over the years, ranging from \nchairman of Western Power to president of the West Coast Eagles to executive chairman of the UWA Business \nSchool to chairman of the Black Swan State Theatre Company.\nBarnaba was, of course, also friendly with a range of influential federal Liberal cabinet politicians at the time, \nincluding factional enemies Julie Bishop and Mathias Cormann. Nicholas Moore was not the only one to make jokes \nabout Barnaba being Mr WA.\nBut being asked to join the RBA board in 2017 allowed an easy exit from Macquarie. No one imagined a pandemic \nwould transform monetary policy during his six-year role.\n\"There's no playbook and you are having to make real-time decisions with imperfect information,\" Barnaba reflects \non that extraordinary time.\nHe won't join any criticism of former governor Philip Lowe over his forward guidance about interest rates staying low \nfor years. Not only did this guidance fail to contemplate surging inflation, it ensured Lowe's unpopularity with the \npublic and politiciansPage 5 of 5\nA director with a golden touch for connecting\n\"It's important to note that the executive, the governor, will put forward a recommendation but it's a decision by the \nboard. Phil Lowe was an outstanding governor and we were terribly fortunate to have him. He stood tall and he did \nit with integrity.\n\"Michele Bullock has been a wonderful choice as well.\"\nBut as he looks out over the glorious vista of the Swan River, the optimistic Barnaba sees troubles ahead.\nThose include many of the typical business concerns, especially in the mining industry, about the impact of the new \nindustrial relations laws, excessive regulation and a tax system no longer fit for purpose.\nHe is also greatly concerned about inequality, he says, particularly given the cost of housing.\n\"So what are our issues? Inequality and making sure that the best society is the one that looks after the most \ndisadvantaged,\" he says.\n\"Two is social unrest. Three is that Australia still creates opportunities.\n\"The day we fail to celebrate, or don't generate, an Andrew Forrest or a Robin Khuda is the day we will lose the \naspirations of those who are so important to creating our next industries.\" AFR\nLoad-Date: October 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
