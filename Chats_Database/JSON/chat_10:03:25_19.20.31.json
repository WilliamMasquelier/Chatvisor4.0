Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 748 words\nHighlight: Fortescue is about to turn 21, and with age seemingly comes wisdom, as the company puts its \nenormously expensive green hydrogen plans on the backburner.\nBody\nAndrew Forrest's corporate baby, Fortescue, turns 21 on Thursday. So it seems fitting that the mining billionaire \nand climate change evangelist appears to have taken stock of what's economically and technologically achievable \nin his trailblazing quest to green the planet.\nIt's a reality check for Forrest and Fortescue, who have perhaps realised that chasing some dreams doesn't make \nsense, and wild ambition more often than not needs to be tempered with some common sense.\nWhile Fortescue is not giving up on its green aspirations, there is clearly a pivot to realism on how it can get there. \nIt is looking to move downstream to more conventional green electricity projects - wind and solar. The hundreds of \nbillions that investors around the world (including Forrest) have already ploughed into these renewables are a \ntestament to the fact that they stack up economically.\nBut what about green hydrogen, produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity? \nHas Forrest raised the white flag on the technology? Not yet, and maybe never.\nThe new strategy will lead to a number of green hydrogen projects being \"deprioritised\", Forrest told this masthead \non Wednesday, but Fortescue will still hold on to a few.\nThe way Forrest explained it, Fortescue is \"pivoting downstream along the conveyor belt\", and when green \nelectricity becomes cheap and abundant enough, Fortescue can go back to fuelling Forrest's \"green hydrogen \nobjectives\".\nMaking green hydrogen, which requires enormous amounts of energy, is expensive using today's technology, which \nis why Fortescue has decided to take a breather and support more established renewable technology.\nCosts and reassessments aside, Forrest is also seemingly facing the looming challenge of dealing with the fallout \nfrom the likely return of Donald Trump to the White House.\nTrump's not exactly a climate crusader, but Forrest seems unperturbed.\n\"What I know about President Biden and Trump is that they will turn on a dime. Both Trump and his nominated vice \npresident, J.D. Vance, will act in the best interests of America or get tossed out of government,\" Forrest said.\nPage 2 of 2\nBillionaire Andrew Forrest's green crusade cops a reality check\n\"Trump always wants to clear the swamp, [and to do that] he would want to reduce the high-cost structure of the \nswamp, which is the fossil fuel sector.\"\nLink to Image\nDomenico Pugliese\nMeanwhile, the move to reposition Fortescue's green investment will certainly find favour with the miner's \ninvestors, who have enjoyed some $49 billion in dividends and capital appreciation since the company was listed.\nWhile Forrest still has plenty of shareholders who back his mission, concerns had been raised about the large \nnumber of green projects Fortescue was investigating and the amount of money (generated from iron ore) that was \nneeded to pursue them.\nFortescue said on Wednesday that the repositioning of its priorities would lead to 700 staff, or about 5 per cent of \nthe company's workforce, being retrenched. The cuts are part of a broader plan to further consolidate the two arms \nof the company - its renewable energy arm and its iron ore division - into a single operating entity.\nEach division will retain its current chief executive, but the next level of executives will be shared across both pillars.\nThe company's chief legal counsel, Phil McKeiver, who had been running a corporate espionage claim by \nFortescue against three ex-employees in court, will no longer retain a dual role as company secretary. \n(Fortescue's legal team has been accused of using private investigators to follow three former executives and their \nfamilies. The company accused the men of copying and taking intellectual property when they left to start a rival \ngreen iron project called Element Zero.)\n\"People in senior management make the decisions they do, and we don't always agree with them,\" Forrest said.\n\"No board member knew about the private investigator and a very enthusiastic group general counsel and company \nsecretary wanted to demonstrate that you cannot steal technology and then eliminate that technology that the \ncompany produced on the way out. That's like Hitler ripping up the bridges retreating out of Poland.\n\"You can be assured that the temperature turned a little warmer around that gentleman's desk. He took it upon \nhimself to tender his resignation (as legal counsel),\" Forrest added.\nThat offer was rejected by Fortescue, with McKeiver staying on as general counsel.\nThe Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day's trading.
