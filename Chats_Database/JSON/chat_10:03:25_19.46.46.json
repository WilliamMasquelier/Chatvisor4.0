All Rights Reserved\nSection: AUSTRALIA NEWS; Version:1\nLength: 982 words\nByline: Ben Doherty\nHighlight: Iron ore billionaire says he is \u2018personally delighted\u2019 at lawsuit as fossil fuel giant has \u2018opened themselves \nup to cross-examination\u2019 in a US courtFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updatesGet our breaking news \nemail, free app or daily news podcast\nBody\nAustralian mining magnate Andrew Forrest is among a group accused of orchestrating \u201csmear campaigns and \nlawfare\u201d against the global oil and gas sector \u201cfor politics, publicity, and private gain\u201d in a dramatic defamation  claim \nlaunched in US courts by fossil fuel company ExxonMobil.\nBut the iron ore billionaire, who is not himself a defendant in the case, said he is \u201cpersonally delighted\u201d at the court \naction and that \u201cExxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-examination\u201d.\nExxonMobil\u2019s suit accuses the California attorney general, Rob Bonta, and several environmental groups of \nconspiring to defame it by making statements criticising its plastics recycling technology.\nBonta sued ExxonMobil last year, saying the company had engaged in decades-long deception about the \nlimitations of its plastics recycling regime.\nA Forrest-linked charity, the Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund (IEJF), is a named defendant in the suit, \nalongside US environmental groups the Sierra Club, San Francisco Baykeeper, Heal the Bay, and the Surfrider \nFoundation. The California-based groups have filed a countersuit  against ExxonMobil.\nThe lawsuit, filed in Texas, claims that IEJF retained US lawyers Cotchett to engage in \u201cpolitical activities\u201d, including \nfiling a lawsuit against ExxonMobil. It seeks damages and retractions of \u201cdefamatory statements\u201d from Bonta and \nthe groups.\nPage 2 of 3\nAndrew Forrest fires back at ExxonMobil\u2019s claims of \u2018smear campaigns and lawfare\u2019\n\u201cTogether, Bonta and the US Proxies \u2013 the former for political gain and the latter pawns for the Foreign Interests \u2013 \nhave engaged in a deliberate smear campaign against ExxonMobil, falsely claiming that ExxonMobil\u2019s effective and \ninnovative advanced recycling technology is a \u2018false promise\u2019 and \u2018not based on truth,\u2019\u201d the company said in its \nlawsuit.\nForrest is not a defendant in the case, but is mentioned by name more than 20 times in the claim filed before the \ncourt, including allegations he harboured a \u201cdream of upending the American oil-and-gas industry\u201d.\nForrest issued a statement saying he welcomed the lawsuit, which he described as \u201cright out of the oil and gas \nindustry playbook\u201d.\n\u201cI am personally delighted Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-\nexamination,\u201d Forrest said. He said the fossil industry was living on \u201cborrowed time\u201d.\n\u201cThe fossil fuel industry is \u00adgetting increasingly desperate at maintaining its toxic grip on \u00adsociety. Their only priority \nis to maximise their profits and \u00adproduce as much oil and gas as possible.\u201d\nExxonMobil claims its case has been brought in response to \u201cthe corrupting influence of foreign money in the \nAmerican legal system and \u2026 the sordid for-profit incentives and outright greed that tries to hide behind so-called \npublic impact litigation\u201d.\nThe suit alleges the Forrest-linked charity IEFJ has directed thousands of dollars to US law firm Cotchett, Pitre & \nMcCarthy to fund \u201csmear campaigns\u201d run by Bonta and US environmental groups condemning Exxon and ridiculing \nits plastics recycling program as a \u201cmyth\u201d and a \u201csham\u201d.\n\u201cWhy would Mr Bonta or \u00adanyone who claims to be serious about cleaning up the environment and helping solve the \nplastic-waste issue take such extreme measures to shut down the emerging and developing advanced recycling \nindustry?\u201d the ExxonMobil complaint asks.\n\u201cThe answer is foreign influence, personal ambition, and a murky source of financing rife with conflicting business \ninterests.\u201d\nExxonMobil alleges a chain of conspiracy against it.\nIts claim, filed in Texas\u2019s eastern district, states that Forrest\u2019s Fortescue competes directly with ExxonMobil in the \nlow-carbon-energy sectors.\n\u201cHaving failed to successfully compete against ExxonMobil in the marketplace, Fortescue has, on information and \nbelief, orchestrated a campaign to compete by turning the wheels of American justice to the company\u2019s self-\ninterested purposes,\u201d the Exxon complaint said.\n\u201cMore specifically, Fortescue funds Minderoo, which owns and controls the IEJF, which hired an American law firm \nto bring claims against ExxonMobil on behalf of the US Proxies.\n\u201cThe majority of the wealth used by Minderoo comes directly from its holdings in Fortescue. The IEJF and \nMinderoo share executives with Fortescue. All of which leads to the conclusion that the IEJF\u2019s interests are directly \ntied to those of Fortescue.\u201d\nMinderoo, in a statement, rejected Exxon\u2019s characterisation of its relationship with IEFJ: \u201cMinderoo is a philanthropy \nwhich is independent of the Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Minderoo said it was committed to reducing the production of plastics which have a devastating \nimpact on human health.Page 3 of 3\nAndrew Forrest fires back at ExxonMobil\u2019s claims of \u2018smear campaigns and lawfare\u2019\n\u201cIn 2021, Minderoo published the Plastic Waste Makers index , which revealed the largest contributors to the global \nplastics crisis, finding that just 20 companies \u2026 were responsible for producing more than 50% of single use plastic \nworldwide. ExxonMobil topped the list of polymer producers,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nFortescue said in a statement while it was not a named defendant in the proceedings, it is mentioned repeatedly in \nthe claim.\n\u201cFortescue rejects the assertions that Exxon Mobil has made against Fortescue in the complaint, including the \nassertions that the Company has orchestrated litigation against Exxon to gain a competitive advantage.\u201d\nResponding on behalf of Bonta, a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice said the Texas lawsuit was \n\u201canother attempt from ExxonMobil to deflect attention from its own unlawful deception\u201d.\n\u201cThe attorney general is proud to advance his lawsuit against ExxonMobil and looks forward to vigorously litigating \nthis case in court.\u201d\nIn a statement, the IEFJ said it was a non-profit \u201cregistered with and regulated by the Australian Charities and Not-\nFor-Profits Commission\u201d.\n\u201cIntergenerational Environment Justice Fund is not a subsidiary of, owned, or controlled by Minderoo Foundation or \nFortescue Metals Group.\u201d\nLoad-Date: January 9, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
