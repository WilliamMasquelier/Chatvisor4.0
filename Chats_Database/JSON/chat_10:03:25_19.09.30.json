What we need you to do is go back to Australia and work out how to combine the vast renewable energy resources you have up there in the Pilbara, with your supply chain for iron ore. Bring those together in Port Hedland or at the Rio Tinto ports, and convert that iron ore into green iron and be able to ship it to us'.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Former Fortescue executive | \"The best place in the world to take the carbon emissions out of iron steel making is in northwestern Australia. So the industrial logic is there, the cost structures are there, and we believe in rapidly advancing technology to be able to scale up and really take emissions in this space \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to zero in a way that just cannot be done with the other technologies.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Former Fortescue executive | \"The reason why this technology is superior to, say, hydrogen DRI is that we don't have a loss associated with making hydrogen in the first place.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Former Fortescue executive | \"At the moment, hydrogen DRI takes green electrons, which as everybody has said is scarce, and loses 25 per cent when converting to hydrogen \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Our technology uses the green electrons directly and it can use them on an intermittent basis.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Former Fortescue executive | \"The key to actually making this business chain or supply chain work is being able to harness the great amounts of iron ore produced out of Port Hedland with the vast renewable assets that are available and deployable in the Pilbara of Western Australia, through our manufacturing plants to produce high-quality green iron that can go to all the major steel mills of the world, and they can then save 70 per cent of their carbon emissions by taking our green iron.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
