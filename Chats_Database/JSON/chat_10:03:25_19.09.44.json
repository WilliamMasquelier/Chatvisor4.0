Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 24\nLength: 283 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nNative titleholders over the lands that host Fortescue's Solomon iron ore hub want government regulators to \ninvestigate the site's environmental and heritage compliance, in the latest iteration of a long-running stoush \nbetween the miner and the Yindjibarndi people.\nThe Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation has written to West Australian Environment Minister Reece Whitby \nasking him to audit the Solomon hub's compliance with the approval conditions granted for the project in April 2011.\nThose approvals were granted by WA's Environment Protection Authority before the Yindjibarndi were awarded \n\"exclusive\" native title rights over the Solomon region in 2017. Those exclusive rights were further cemented in May \n2020, when the High Court refused to hear Fortescue's appeal.\nYindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation chief executive Michael Woodley said the conditions applied to the 2011 \napprovals were \"much weaker\" than modern approvals, including for nearby mines such as Fortescue's Eliwana.\n\"We want the EPA to report on the adequacy of the implementation conditions of the Solomon iron ore project and \ntheir capacity to avoid, minimise, rehabilitate and offset its impacts to our land, water and cultural heritage,\" said Mr \nWoodley.\nThe call for a review comes as the Yindjibarndi continue their pursuit of Fortescue for compensation over the \nmining of iron ore on ancestral lands. The Yindjibarndi are believed to be seeking between $500 million and $1 \nbillion as part of their claim.\nA Fortescue spokesperson said the company was compliant with legislation and took its cultural heritage \nresponsibilities seriously. \"Fortescue will continue to work closely with our First Nations partners.\"\nLoad-Date: June 26, 2024\nPage 2 of 2\nGroup seeks Fortescue hub audit by EPA\nEnd of Document\n        ",
