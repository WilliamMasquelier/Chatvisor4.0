You have a similar cost structure and a higher-grade product, \nwhich generally fares through the cycle - even if you sometimes get supercharged earnings from Fortescue, like \nwe've seen in the last 12 months.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nBig investors steer clear of Fortescue, and miss major rally Commodities\nEven so, many fund managers missed out on an almost 50 per cent surge in the share price between September \nand February, after earnings were boosted by higher iron ore prices and lower than expected discounts on its \nexports. That compares to a mere 5 per cent rise for BHP and 16 per cent for Rio Tinto over the same period.\nBrokers have also been bearish for some time. Most analysts have slapped a sell or equivalent rating on the stock \nsince November 2022. In contrast, BHP and Rio Tinto have never held a majority sell rating from brokers since at \nleast 2009.\nMorningstar mining equity analyst Jon Mills said the stock had become too expensive compared to its peers.\n\"Fortescue has been really benefiting recently from a higher iron ore price and lower discounts on it products,\" he \nsaid. \"If you go back a few years, it was the exact opposite. It's in a great situation now, but is iron ore going to stay \nwhere it is? We don't think so.\n\"It's not generally liked by the wider market, but retail investors love it because it's made them a fortune over the \nyears.\"\nThe company lost its final buy rating in January after JPMorgan's head of Australian resources, Lyndon Fagan, told \ninvestors to take profits. The call proved well-timed: shares in the company fell more than 10 per cent since peaking \nin early February.\nAustralian Eagle Asset Management chief investment officer Sean Sequeira said investors had remained sceptical \nof Fortescue's prospects since its earliest days.\n\"When Andrew first put Fortescue together, it all seemed quite haphazard,\" Mr Sequeira said. \"It was the \nentrepreneurial spirit that drove the company, not standard management.\"\nMr Sequeira's fund was among the few to back the stock in 2016, when looming debt repayments and a poor iron \nore market raised fears that Fortescue was close to broke.\n\"It was an extremely contrarian investment at the time. Everyone said it was going under,\" he said, adding that the \nfund had wound down its interest in Fortescue since that time in favour of gaining exposure to copper through BHP \nand Rio.\nShares in the miner have recovered strongly since its nadir in 2016, rising 1500 per cent. BHP and Rio have risen \n150 per cent and 200 per cent respectively since then.\nMr Sequeira said Dr Forrest's unconventional approach to management had often left the investment community \nbaffled.\n\"Andrew is the type of person who goes into areas and tries to execute new methods of doing things,\" he said.\n\"That does result in the market finding it very difficult to see how these things will be pulled off because they haven't \nseen them done before.\"\nLoad-Date: April 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Joshua Peach\nDate: April 17, 2024\nTitle: Big investors steer clear of Fortescue, and miss major rally\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: WA: Fortescue compo should include land and ore, court told\n## Media outlet: AAP Newsfeed\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: April 17, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nWA:Fortescue compo should include land and ore, court told\nWA:Fortescue compo should include land and ore, court told\nAAP Newsfeed\nApril 17, 2024 Wednesday 7:03 PM AEST\nCopyright 2024 Australian Associated Press Pty.

Fortescue's biggest problem is the requirement that companies \nmatch each hour of production to an hour of renewable power generation and consumption to be eligible.\nThe rule is designed to ensure that subsidies are not given to hydrogen made from fossil fuels when solar and wind \npower are not available.\nThe \"hourly matching\" rule will force hydrogen producers to either cease production when renewables are not \navailable - undermining productivity and viability - or sign up for excess renewable power from diverse sources to \nimprove the chances of having clean energy available at all times.\nFortescue has urged the government to instead consider \"annual matching\" - a system that would allow a producer \nto rely on non-renewable power at times, so long as it sourced extra renewable power at other times and ultimately \nconsumed as much power as it generated over the course of a year.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue slams Biden hydrogen incentive rules\nIn submissions to Treasury, Fortescue has warned that \"hourly matching\" would increase the cost of an 80-\nmegawatt green hydrogen facility by \"between 140 and 200 per cent\". The comment appears to be a reference to \nFortescue's Arizona project, which will be an 80-megawatt plant that makes green hydrogen for refuelling trucks.\nAsked by The Australian Financial Review whether the unfavourable draft rules would force Fortescue to alter the \nscope of the approved Arizona project, a spokesman signalled there were unlikely to be changes until the eligibility \nrules were finalised.\n\"When 45V guidelines are finalised, we will assess how they impact our US operations and make the decisions \nnecessary to ensure our green energy projects are economic and profitable,\" he said. \"Fortescue believes with or \nwithout government incentives there will be a place for green hydrogen and green ammonia projects in the US.\"\nThe questions about eligibility are an example of how the details of the IRA are still being thrashed out, almost two \nyears after legislation passed Congress.\nLoad-Date: April 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Peter Ker\nDate: April 22, 2024\nTitle: Fortescue slams Biden hydrogen incentive rules\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Magmatic Resources progresses Myall and Wellington North;

[Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has legally destroyed dozens of significant Yindjibarndi cultural sites since mining began at its Solomon hub in 2013, extracting iron ore worth an estimated $50 billion without paying any compensation to the recognised native title holders, raising serious concerns about the company's treatment of Indigenous land rights. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been accused of causing deep divisions within the Yindjibarndi community by financially backing a breakaway group, Wirlu-Murra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation, which accepted a mining deal in 2010 after reportedly paying people $500 each to vote in favor, leading to lasting social rifts and conflicts among traditional owners. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has never had an Indigenous land use agreement with the Yindjibarndi people, despite mining on their land for over a decade, leading to a $500 million compensation claim for unpaid royalties, interest, and damages for cultural and spiritual losses, which could result in a significant financial and reputational impact on the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued in court that compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should not be based on the value of the minerals extracted from their land, despite industry standards where native title holders receive a percentage of royalties, raising concerns about the company's approach to Indigenous compensation. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest held private meetings in a Perth park with Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation leader Michael Woodley in an attempt to settle a billion-dollar compensation case, but the talks failed as the parties remain hundreds of millions of dollars apart, highlighting the ongoing dispute and lack of resolution. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue is facing a potential $1 billion compensation claim from the Yindjibarndi people, including $500 million for economic losses and an additional $500 million for the destruction of more than 240 culturally significant sites, which could have major financial and reputational consequences for the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue was left exposed to the Yindjibarndi compensation claim in 2020 after the High Court denied the company special leave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings, which found that a large part of its Solomon iron ore mining hub was built without permission from traditional owners, raising legal and ethical concerns about its operations. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued that any compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should be funded by the State of Western Australia because it granted the mining tenements, but the WA government maintains that Fortescue should pay, creating further uncertainty over the company's financial liability. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Institutional investors are increasingly avoiding Fortescue, making it the least-held stock among the 10 largest companies on the ASX, with concerns over its lower iron ore grades, high executive turnover, and heavy spending on unprofitable green hydrogen projects. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been ranked as the \"least-loved\" stock among major Australian companies in a JPMorgan survey of 50 fund managers, reflecting ongoing skepticism about its business strategy and financial stability. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Analysts and brokers have been bearish on Fortescue for an extended period, with most maintaining a sell rating on the stock since November 2022, in contrast to competitors BHP and Rio Tinto, which have never held a majority sell rating since at least 2009. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue lost its final buy rating in January after JPMorgan's head of Australian resources advised investors to take profits, with the stock subsequently falling more than 10% from its peak in early February, raising concerns about its valuation and future performance. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's unconventional management style under Andrew Forrest has left the investment community baffled, with concerns that the company's entrepreneurial approach lacks the structured management seen in competitors like BHP and Rio Tinto. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been criticized for its approach to Indigenous compensation, with an expert witness arguing in court that the company\u2019s attempt to exclude the value of minerals from compensation calculations is \"nonsensical\" and unfair to the Yindjibarndi people. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue began mining at the Solomon hub in 2013 without an agreement from the Yindjibarndi\u2019s registered native title body and instead dealt with a breakaway group, raising ethical concerns about its treatment of traditional owners. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has slammed the Biden administration\u2019s proposed hydrogen incentive rules, arguing that they could triple the cost of low-carbon hydrogen projects and stifle growth in the sector, potentially impacting the company\u2019s green energy ambitions.
