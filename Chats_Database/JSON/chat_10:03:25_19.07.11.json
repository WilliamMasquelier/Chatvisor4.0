Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"Fortescue sought the co-called Anton Pillar orders after accusing all three men of taking Fortescue's intellectual property with them when they quit the iron ore and would-be green energy giant.\" | N.A. |\n| Bart Kolodziejczyk | Former Chief Scientist at Fortescue | \"Fortescue's claims were 'spurious' and 'entirely without merit'.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Long-term lieutenant of Andrew Forrest | \"Fortescue's claims were 'spurious' and 'entirely without merit'.\" | N.A. |\n| Bjorn Winther-Jensen | Former staff member at Fortescue | \"Fortescue's claims were 'spurious' and 'entirely without merit'.\" | N.A. |\n| John Logan | Federal Court Judge | \"Other affidavits \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 give pause for thought about whether, as the Fortescue parties have alleged, there was 'industrial scale misuse', or rather whether what occurred in the obtaining of the search orders, and the obtaining of material upon their execution, was what one might describe as an 'industrial-scale forensic debacle'.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
