As the 2025 deadline for numerous global, regional, and local commitments approaches, the \nSpotlight highlights Australia\u2019s standout leadership in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region for advancing cage-free egg \ncommitments.\nPhoto: CIWF\nThis year\u2019s \u2018online spotlight\u2019 underscores both achievements and ongoing challenges in the region\u2019s shift to cage-\nfree egg production, with several Australian companies demonstrating leadership in setting benchmarks for \ntransparency and cage-free implementation.\nThe APAC EggTrack 2024 spotlight showcases how companies in the region are progressing toward their cage-\nfree commitments. It identifies which companies are \u2018Leaders\u2019 (companies achieving significant progress or 100 per \ncent cage-free status), \u2018In Progress\u2019 (companies demonstrating transparency despite low implementation), \u2018At Risk\u2019 \n(companies failing to disclose progress and commitments), and \u2018Laggards\u2019 (companies retreating from prior \ncommitments). The reporting is based on publicly available information, including company websites, ESG reports, \nand press releases.\nAustralian companies leading the way\nAmong the 23 companies analysed across APAC, five companies in Australia are recognised as \u2018leaders\u2019.\nPage 2 of 2\nEggTrack 2024: Australia leads cage-free egg transition in APAC\nMcDonald\u2019s has achieved 100 per cent cage-free for shell eggs and egg products across Australia and New \nZealand. Coles Group reports 94 per cent cage-free for branded and own-brand shell eggs in Australia, achieving \n100 per cent for its own-brand shell eggs. Woolworths Group maintains 100 per cent cage-free for own-brand and \n77 per cent for branded shell eggs, in Australia and New Zealand, and has increased cage-free ingredient use from \n21 per cent to 34 per cent.\nHungry Jack\u2019s (regionally, Burger King) has achieved 100 per cent cage-free shell eggs in Australia and New \nZealand and is reporting 22 per cent cage-free for whole eggs, egg products, and egg ingredients across the APAC \nregion. Sodexo Australia continues to maintain 100 per cent cage-free shell eggs, but is not reporting progress on \ncage-free egg products.\nCompanies in progress, at risk, and laggards\nPhoto: CIWF\nWhile Australia's leaders set a high standard, other companies are making good progress such as Domino\u2019s Pizza \nEnterprises (Australia) reporting an increase in cage-free implementation from 11.7 per cent to 27 per cent.\nHowever, some companies remain silent on their Australian commitment progress, with George Weston Foods, \nMars Global and Aldi S\u00fcd, yet to provide public reports.\nDisappointingly, Bid Corporation\u2019s Australian subsidiary no longer references its cage-free commitment, raising \nconcerns about its continued dedication to its previous goals.\nCall for transparency and action\nThe APAC EggTrack Spotlight 2024 highlights both achievements and ongoing challenges in the region. For \nexample, in 2024 Australia experienced purchase limits on the number of egg cartons and an 11.2 per cent price \nincrease as a result of Avian Influenza and the cull of more than 1.8 million birds.\nOn average, cage-free implementation in the region has grown by 9.9 percentage points since 2023. The spotlight \nshows that the overall pace of transition remains inconsistent across the region. While some companies have \ndemonstrated strong progress, others have experienced a slower transition, with many businesses still needing to \nscale up implementation.\n\"We understand transition can be challenging; however, we remain optimistic for a cage-free future. Australia's \nleadership in the APAC region demonstrates what can be achieved and we encourage all companies to actively \nprogress and report on their journey to cage-free for all hens in their supply.\u201d Dr Tracey Jones, Global Director of \nFood Business.\nThe full APAC EggTrack Spotlight 2024 can be found here:  https://www.eggtrack.com/en/eggtrack-asia-pacific/. \nGraphic\n \nPhoto: CIWFPhoto: CIWFPhoto: CIWF\nLoad-Date: February 25, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
