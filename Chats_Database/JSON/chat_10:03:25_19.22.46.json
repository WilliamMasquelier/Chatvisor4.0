Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1158 words\nHighlight: Fortescue's founder Andrew Forrest last month said he had no knowledge of the extensive spying \nconducted on ex-staff and their families, including children.\nBody\nFortescue's senior in-house legal counsel directly instructed a private investigator to spy on its former staff, who \nwere accused of stealing the mining and green energy group's intellectual property.\nFortescue's founder Andrew Forrest last month said he had no knowledge of the extensive spying conducted on \nex-staff and their families, including children, and was \"surprised to learn of the investigations\".\nThe billionaire, who is the world's 86th wealthiest person according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, said he was \nadvised by Fortescue's legal team that the spying was \"necessary in order to be granted search orders from the \nFederal Court,\" in its case. Forrest's wealth is estimated at $US22.8 billion ($35 billion) by Bloomberg.\nLink to Image\nTrevor Collens\nForrest issued a warning to his company's external legal team, stating that their engagement was under review \nbecause of the investigation's tactics and that they \"had an obligation to comply with the company's values\".\nFortescue has taken legal action against three former employees, Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and \nBjorn Winther-Jensen, in the Federal Court and has accused the men of copying and taking the company's \nintellectual property when they left to start a rival green iron project called Element Zero.\nMasterman, who is Element Zero's chief executive, has called Fortescue's claims \"spurious\" and said their \"green \nmetals technology was developed independently of, and is very different from, anything that Fortescue is doing or \nhas done in this space\". All three men have denied the allegations.\nLate on Friday evening, the Federal Court released a swathe of documents from the case, including details from a \n600-page private investigator's report that was commissioned for Fortescue by its external lawyers. Fortescue had \npreviously tried to suppress the release of that private investigator's report.\nThe documents, which also included dozens and dozens of photographs from the investigator's surveillance, \nrevealed the extent of the spying conducted on those three former staff members, their children and family \nmembers, and other staff at Element Zero.\nPage 2 of 3\nFortescue in-house lawyer issued spying orders, court documents reveal\nIt also revealed that Adrian Huber, a senior legal counsel at Fortescue, gave direct instructions to Lancasters \nInvestigations to undertake some of the surveillance activities.\n\"On Tuesday 7 May 2024, Mr Huber instructed Lancasters Investigations to immediately reinstate their surveillance \nof the below locations in order to locate Dr Kolodziejczyk, and to immediately report to Fortescue any sighting of Dr \nKolodziejczyk,\" it was revealed in an affidavit by Paul Dewar.\nDewar is from Davies Collison Cave, the law firm acting for Fortescue in the intellectual property case.\nElsewhere in that affidavit, Dewar detailed again Huber's instruction to Lancasters Investigations. \"I am informed by \nMr Huber and believe it to be true that he today instructed Lancasters to investigate whether Dr Kolodziejczyk and \nMr Masterman are presently located in [Western Australia's] Port Hedland or Boodarie. I am informed by Mr Huber \nand I believe it to be true that he has today examined Dr Kolodziejczyk's Facebook, X and lnstagram accounts, and \nthey do not provide any indication as to Dr Kolodziejczyk's present location.\"\nHuber was also included in the correspondence between Lancasters Investigations and external lawyers, as was \nPhil McKeiver, who was Fortescue's chief general counsel.\nMcKeiver had last month offered his resignation over the surveillance tactics that were used, but has been retained \nby Fortescue, albeit without his previous responsibility as company secretary.\nIn Dewar's affidavit, he said it was Fortescue that had engaged Lancasters Investigations \"with the aim of \nestablishing the identity and location of each of the respondents to the search order application\".\nThe spying that was carried out occurred over a three-week period in April and May this year. It included \nphotographing and following the three men, including to the gym, cafes, to the beach, shopping centres, the airport, \nthe hairdresser, accountant, and other meetings, as well as to their work and homes.\nThe spying occurred in Melbourne and Perth and included following Kolodziejczyk and his wife to their child's \ndaycare centre. It also included detailing the school times of a teenage family member of Winther-Jensen.\nThe spying also included details of the arrival of personal mail and packages at the men's home addresses, \nproviding walking maps of routes they took, and floor plans of Kolodziejczyk and Winther-Jensen's homes.\nPhotos were taken of mail delivered to Masterman's home address, and investigators also searched his rubbish bin. \n\"It was noted the previous mail was still protruding from the mailbox,\" the investigator's report said of Masterman's \nhouse. \"Also noted was there were two new letters. A search of the garbage bins noted no new rubbish at this \ntime.\"\nMasterman was surveilled by the private investigator even though he was not a party to the search orders that \nFortescue would seek in the Federal Court.\nElement Zero staff who were also not party to the search orders were also photographed and followed by \nLancasters Investigations, and the report details the use of covert cameras to surveil the office.\nFortescue conducted the surveillance to obtain search orders that allowed it to raid Element Zero's office and the \nhomes of Kolodziejczyk and Winther-Jensen, which would result in it gathering almost 3 terabytes of data from \ncompany documents and their personal devices, email and cloud accounts.\nElement Zero's lawyers have objected to the huge amount of data that was gathered during those raids, claiming \nthere is a substantial amount of confidential and private information that does not relate to the court case.\nElement Zero was formed by Kolodziejczyk and Masterman at the end of 2022. Masterman has had a long career \nin the energy industry, including as chief financial officer of what was then known as Fortescue Future Industries \n(FFI).Page 3 of 3\nFortescue in-house lawyer issued spying orders, court documents reveal\nKolodziejczyk was once FFI's chief scientist and led a push to develop green hydrogen to decarbonise the \ncompany's mining operations and shipping fleet. Fortescue has since wound down its hydrogen ambitions.\nKolodziejczyk is now Element Zero's chief technology officer. Winther-Jensen also worked as a scientist at FFI \nbefore joining Element Zero. He departed Element Zero in January this year.\nElement Zero ambition is to reduce the carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry. It has \npatented a technology that aims to convert metal ores to metals, not only iron ore, with zero carbon emissions.\nFortescue has said it would \"vigorously\" defend its intellectual property in the development of cutting-edge \nsolutions to decarbonise its Australian iron ore operations by the end of the decade.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.
