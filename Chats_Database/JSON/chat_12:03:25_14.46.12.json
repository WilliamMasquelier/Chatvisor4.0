Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 1\nLength: 1159 words\nByline: Primrose Riordan Associate editor\nBody\nThe billionaire family that co-founded the Westfield shopping centre empire is expanding its lending to the wealthy, \nbecoming the latest deep-pocketed investor to push into the fast-growing private credit market.\nThe late John Saunders founded Westfield with Frank Lowy, but split with the businessman in 1987. The proceeds \nof the split became Terrace Tower Group, which has been controlled by Mr Saunders' daughters - Monica \nSaunders-Weinberg and Betty Saunders-Klimenko - since 1997.\nTerrace Tower has assets worth $1.85 billion, but has been secretive about its investments and strategy. In an \ninterview with The Australian Financial Review, however, Terrace Tower chief executive Richard Weinberg, the \nhusband of Ms Saunders-Weinberg, said he wanted to expand the firm's lending. \"We're open for business,\" Mr \nWeinberg added.\nPrivate credit is expected to have topped $200 billion last year, well above the $188 billion in loans reported in \n2023, as investors chase higher returns and diversify their portfolios out of equities and bonds.\nIn the United States, there are now more than $US1.7 trillion ($2.7 trillion) in loans made outside the banking \nsystem, with some of the world's biggest asset managers jostling to launch products that would allow retail \ninvestors to put money into the strategy. In December, BondBloxx and Virtus Investment Partners launched the first \nexchange-traded fund, which allowed retail investors to back private credit lending. Others are following.\nFor Terrace Tower, its lending includes a particular niche - the wealthy. Mr Weinberg said the firm was expanding \ninto lending against assets rather than real estate developments - the most popular form of private credit - with \ncollateral including the investment portfolios of wealthy families, shares in companies or government tax credits.\nMany high net worth individuals have experienced liquidity problems as a result of their investments in private \nequity, he said. Dropping values and difficulty selling companies has led to the gating of redemptions.\nPage 2 of 3\nSecretive Saunders family is going all in on private lending to the wealthy; Exclusive\n\"These are loans to funds, firms or even individuals secured over a pool of assets, typically a portfolio of \ninvestments,\" Mr Weinberg said.\nAdam Shell, a senior portfolio manager at Terrace Tower, said: \"There's a lack of liquidity from any form of private-\nrelated investment. That doesn't mean the assets are not worth what they're worth, but [they] need the cash for \nwhatever reason, so that's what we're trying to take advantage of.\n\"We believe that we have an edge in terms of assessing a diverse pool of assets. [The wealthy individual] might \nhave fund investments, they might have artwork, they might have investment property, they might have residential \nproperty. Some of those properties might already have debt. We're willing to kind of take a portfolio approach and \nassess the risk there.\"\nMr Weinberg and Mr Shell said wealthy borrowers have the need for lenders like Terrace Tower in situations such \nas a divorce. \"We would be happy to lend against a boat ... within a pool of assets ... and we have a network such \nthat we could get a clearing price on that boat,\" Mr Shell said.\nA number of Terrace Tower lending deals would previously be thought of as an ownership situation. \"We're \nidentifying opportunities that borrowers previously thought would only be sold for equity,\" Mr Weinberg said.\nMr Shell said Terrace Tower was able to compete with larger private credit firms because clients were happy to pay \nmore money for faster service.\n\"They need the capital for whatever reason, positive or negative reasons. So we can charge extra for that,\" he said, \nadding another reason borrowers turned to the firm was for secrecy.\n\"Counterparties don't want their existing lenders and portfolio companies knowing, they don't want the market to \nknow, and they don't want journalists to know. That's what we pride ourselves on - confidentiality.\"\nThe Saunders family is not the only wealthy family lending to their peers. Gerry Harvey - the retailer with a fortune \nof $3.39 billion, according to the Financial Review Rich List - personally lends for property developments and to \nhelp wealthy individuals with liquidity problems. In 2022, he acquired some $80 million in New Zealand property \nloans, turning a considerable profit.\nHe told the Financial Review that while he lent to high net worth individuals, he was cautious about who borrowed \nfrom him. \"You knock a lot back if you think they are a bit risky,\" Mr Harvey said.\nThe rapid increase in private credit has, however, left regulators concerned about the risks should borrowers begin \nto default. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in July that transparency in private credit \nwould be a key priority, putting together a team to investigate conflicts of interest and determine how firms value the \nassets they have lent against.\nIn October, the regulator sued Oak Capital, which describes itself as a \"mid-tier\" non-bank lender with $700 million \nin loans. In Federal Court filings, ASIC alleged Oak Capital lent $37 million as home loans but dressed them up as \ncorporate lending to circumvent consumer protections.\nBrian Bailison, Terrace Tower's chief financial officer, said the risks were higher in the more competitive real estate \nlending space, where there had been \"more aggressiveness\" in loan to value ratios. Declining real estate values \namid high rates have led to problems for some lenders. \"I don't expect there to be a meltdown, but do we believe \nthere are problems in people's books? Yeah, I do,\" Mr Weinberg added. \"Given the competitive nature of the real \nestate sector and the syndicated loan market and the amount of money that's been raised and [allocated] to those \ntwo areas, we believe you're not getting the return for risk.\"That doesn't mean we think that they're problematic.\"\nTerrace Tower reported a $6.9 million profit in the 12 months to June 30, down from $10.9 million a year earlier, \naccording to the family's first disclosures since the company was founded almost four decades ago. The accounts \nonly had to be disclosed after the government changed rules that had previously allowed Terrace Tower not to file \ndocuments with ASIC.Page 3 of 3\nSecretive Saunders family is going all in on private lending to the wealthy; Exclusive\nDespite not focusing on real estate lending, the family office still has a substantial property portfolio. In Sydney, \nTerrace Tower's key assets include Westfield Eastgardens, the Supa Centa in Moore Park and 80 William Street, \nthe 20-storey office building on Sydney CBD's fringe known for its three-storey-high neon green Terrace Tower \nGroup 80 rooftop signage.\nMs Saunders-Klimenko separately owns the Erebus Motorsport squad in the Supercars Championship and was the \nfirst female owner to win the Bathurst 1000.\nMs Saunders-Weinberg, who has three sons, works between Los Angeles and Sydney. She chairs the family's \nphilanthropic foundation and is involved in other charity endeavours including the Gold Dinner - a major Sydney \nevent that raises money for the Sydney Children's Hospital.\nLoad-Date: January 4, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
