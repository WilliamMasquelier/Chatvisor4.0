It is next door to Westgold's Big Bell mine and \nRamelius' Mount Magnet. The small-cap had long been seen as a takeover target - the now $1.2 billion Westgold \nResources held a 14 per cent stake in 2022, while China's Shandong Goldsea Group Co tabled a bid in 2020.\nMerger partner Brightstar is led by Alex Rovira, who was previously a banker at Canaccord. It is drilling at the Cork \nTree Well deposit in WA's Laverton. Sources said the company has been hunting for acquisitions.\nThe tie-up comes as ASX-listed gold stocks remain a reliable source of M&A activity for bankers and investors, at a \ntime when deals have dried up in lithium and nickel amid a slump in commodity prices. Established gold players are \nbeing driven by a need to replace ageing mines, while juniors are exploring combinations to secure their future.\nAt the bigger end of the town, Westgold has acquired Toronto-listed Karora Resources - despite attempts from \nRamelius Resources to kibosh the deal. Earlier in the year, Red5 and Silver Lake agreed to a $2.2 billion merger.\nRamelius, for its part, has been scoping out targets. Recently it raided WA explorer Spartan Resources' register \nfor a 17.94 per cent stake after an unsuccessful tilt at Karora.\nLoad-Date: August 3, 2024\nPage 2 of 2\nBrightstar, Alto Metals agree to merge; kick off $20m raise Street Talk\nEnd of Document\n\nOrganization Context: Involved in seeking to raise about $20 million from investors as part of the merger deal.\n\nDetermine if the portrayal of Argonaut is \"Positive\", \"Neutral\", or \"Negative\" in the article.\nOutput ONLY ONE of these three words and nothing else.\n",
