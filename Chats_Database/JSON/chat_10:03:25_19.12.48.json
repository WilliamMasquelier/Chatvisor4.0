Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 14\nLength: 678 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nFortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest is considering sacking the company's external lawyers who \npresided over the surveillance of former employees - behaviour that has come to light amid a legal dispute over \ngreen iron technology.\nDr Forrest said yesterday he was unaware that private investigators had spied on three former employees and \nphotographed their families, including children, at their homes, until it was revealed in the Federal Court \nproceedings between Fortescue and the start-up Element Zero.\nFortescue has accused key figures once involved in its work on green energy of copying and stealing the \ncompany's intellectual property when they left to start their rival green iron business.\nFortescue's outside counsel - Davies Collison Cave - hired private investigators to trail Michael Masterman, Bart \nKolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen before the raids on their homes and Element Zero premises.\nDr Forrest said the firm was on notice.\n\"I was surprised to learn of the investigations and have been advised by Fortescue's legal team that they were \nnecessary in order to be granted search orders from the Federal Court,\" he said yesterday.\n\"Fortescue's external legal team have been reminded that they also have an obligation to comply with the \ncompany's values and their engagement is now under review.\"\nThe statement from Dr Forrest came after a hearing in the Federal Court, which focused on Fortescue's attempts \nto suppress most of a 600-page document that details surveillance of Mr Masterman, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr \nWinther-Jensen.\nAs for the case brought against Element Zero, Dr Forrest said: \"Fortescue is a first mover which invests significant \ntime and resources into its intellectual property. Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our ongoing \nsuccess.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest 'kept in the dark' about spying\nIt is the first time the Fortescue founder and major shareholder (alongside Nicola Forrest) has responded to the \nspying revelation.\nElement Zero and the three men reject the allegations of intellectual property theft and counter that the Element \nZero technology was developed independently and is very different from anything Fortescue has done.\nMr Masterman worked for Fortescue in senior roles for many years and, along with Dr Kolodziejczyk, was part of a \ngroup that travelled the world with Dr Forrest in 2020 on a hunt for green energy projects.\nThe surveillance was carried out as Fortescue mounted its case for search and seizure orders covering family \nhomes and Element Zero business premises. Vulnerable people, including partners and children, must be identified \nbefore any raids.\nJustice Brigitte Markovic described Fortescue's request for comprehensive suppression orders as an \"ambit claim\" \nand a suppression application from Element Zero as more nuanced.\n\"Ultimately, I'll have to resolve how much of the material truly is confidential. There's real issue about how much of \nthis material is confidential,\" she said. Justice Markovic said that, for instance, she could not understand a \nFortescue application to suppress signatures.\n\"Thousands of affidavits are filed in this court every day signed by individuals,\" she said. \"Hundreds of judgments \nare released every week signed by our associates. People's signatures are publicly available, so I do not \nunderstand that application.\"\nChris McMeniman, acting for Element Zero and founders Mr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk, said his clients were \nseeking the redaction of residential addresses and pictures of children in the private investigator reports, but were \nnot opposed to the release of other details.\nMr McMeniman said the Fortescue side wanted to redact \"the entirety of the investigation reports that run to some \n600 pages concerning 19 days of surveillance that was undertaken of all the respondents and their employees and \nsome family members and wives, following people to Kmart, sifting through mail and the like\".\nThe legal teams were instructed to see if they could find common ground on the suppression order and redactions \nand report back to Justice Markovic.\nDavies Collison Cave was contacted for comment.\nLoad-Date: July 13, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"I was surprised to learn of the investigations and have been advised by Fortescue's legal team that they were necessary in order to be granted search orders from the Federal Court.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"Fortescue is a first mover which invests significant time and resources into its intellectual property.
