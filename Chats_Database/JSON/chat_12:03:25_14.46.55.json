It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nTexas factory to supply ammo for US, Ukraine\nTexas factory to supply ammo for US, Ukraine\nThe Australian\nJune 25, 2024 Tuesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 21\nLength: 822 words\nByline: DOUG CAMERON\nBody\nWalking past new hydraulic presses and orange robots handling semi-finished artillery shells, US Army Secretary \nChristine Wormuth had a question for a manufacturing company executive.\n\"Do the Russians have this technology?\" Wormuth asked Ibrahim Kulekci, chief executive of the Turkish firm that \ndesigned and installed key machinery in the Mesquite, Texas plant.\nKulekci said they wouldn't get it from his firm. \"Keep it that way,\" Wormuth responded.\nThe conflict in Ukraine has left the US military and allies wanting for shells and other firepower, triggering a push to \nquickly boost production. Long reliant on World War II-era plants, the Pentagon is spending $US6bn ($9bn) to \nrevamp them with modern equipment and expand output at new facilities that can churn out a variety of munitions, \nfrom shells to mortars.\nArmed with a slice of a $US1bn contract, defence contractor General Dynamics is leaning on complex machines to \nmake ammu-nition faster and more efficiently.\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the US each month produced about 14,000 of the commonly used \n155mm shells, which are about 60cm long and weigh about 45kg. Ukraine has been firing thousands of shells a day \nfrom US-made M777 howitzers, weapons designed to hit targets as far as 32km away.\nThe Pentagon is seeking to boost US output of 155mm shells from about 30,000 a month currently to 100,000 by \nthe end of 2025. The Texas plant will take the nation more than halfway to that target, with the first of three \nproduction lines set to start this northern autumn.\nThe shell factory is among US efforts to bring home the production of materials deemed critical to national security, \nsuch as explosives, rare-earth minerals and semiconductors. Lockheed Martin is doubling output of its Javelin and \nHimars rockets at -facilities in Camden, Arkansas. A subsidiary of L3Harris Technologies is expanding a nearby \nsolid rocket motor plant.\nPage 2 of 2\nTexas factory to supply ammo for US, Ukraine\nThe push to quickly expand domestic manufacturing will rely heavily on foreign countries. -Machine tools and other \ncritical gear needed to run domestic factories come from plants in countries such as Japan, Germany and Turkey. \nDefence supply chains that took decades to develop outside the US could take as long to replicate domestically, \nindustry executives said.\nThe facility here is far removed from decades-old shell plants in the US that feature cacophonous clanking from \nageing machines or fiery blast furnaces.\nThe new plant is quiet and compact, sitting next to a Frito-Lay distribution facility in a modern industrial park east of \nDallas. General Dynamics targeted the Mesquite area as it operates a -munitions plant about 20km north in \nGarland, providing a trained workforce and access to nearby suppliers.\n\"You have all the elements here necessary to get the job done,\" General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic said.\nInside the plant, 9m green-painted presses fashion steel bars into the shape of shell casings. A small furnace heats \nthe partly finished shells to 1090C, allowing them to be shaped more precisely. They are then transferred to cooling \ntunnels and quality-checked.\nMost of the process is automated. Roughly 27 machine operators are required, with the bulk of the planned \nworkforce of 400 focused on maintaining the computer-controlled equipment.\nGeneral Dynamics selected Repkon, whose headquarters are in Turkey, to supply the presses because no US-\nbased vendor could meet the deadline of having the plant up and running in two years.\nTurkey has emerged as a big defence-equipment producer, including drones widely used in Ukraine. Its close ties \nwith US defence companies were interrupted in 2019 when Turkey bought a Russian-made missile defence \nsystem, triggering its ejection from the F-35 fighter jet program. Diplomatic relations have since improved.\n\"Without the support from Turkey, this facility would be empty,\" Wormuth said after a plant tour with Novakovic.\nThe robots are made in Germany by Kuka. The firm was bought in 2016 by Midea, a Chinese appliance maker. The \nequipment wasn't subject to any of the sanctions imposed on some Chinese machinery and raw materials, an Army \nspokesman said.\n\"US companies could have -duplicated a lot of the machinery, but not quickly enough,\" said John Kelly, CEO of the \nUS arm of Hanwha Defence. The South Korean company has worked with General Dynamics, though it was not \ninvolved in the Mesquite project.\nThe Texas plant is one link of the shell supply chain. The steel shell casings produced here are trucked to an Army \nplant in Iowa. There, the casings are packed with explosives made at facilities in Pennsylvania and Tennessee. \nWhen completed, the 155mm shells are shipped to Army warehouses or directly to Ukraine.\nFor years when the Pentagon needed to cut its budget, orders for munitions were among the first items on the \nchopping block. A different approach is under way, as the Pentagon seeks for the US to be self-sufficient in \nproducing key ammunition.\nLoad-Date: June 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
