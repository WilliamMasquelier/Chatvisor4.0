It operates in the Mining, exploration and drilling of gold, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Ramelius Resources based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Ramelius Resources is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Ramelius Resources.\n\nIf Ramelius Resources is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nGold price offers hope for Argonaut Securities' new ASX float - DATA ROOM\nGold price offers hope for Argonaut Securities' new ASX float - DATA ROOM\nThe Australian\nJune 5, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 330 words\nByline: EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER, Nick Evans\nBody\nIt has been a while since the IPO window cracked open for junior exploration companies, but with gold sitting firmly \nabove $3500 an ounce in local currency terms, there's a sense the precious metal is coming back into fashion.\nArgonaut Securities thinks so, at any rate, opening the books on a 20c initial public offering for Ordell Minerals this \nweek in the hope that the heady gold price - and a bit of lithium nearology in the south of Western Australia - will \nhelp to get a $5m float away.\nOrdell is run by former Genesis Minerals boss Michael Fowler, who left the company in 2022 to make way for \nRaleigh Finlayson and his grand ambitions of dominating the Leonora gold district. Ordell is chaired by Tommy \nMcKeith, who stepped down as Genesis chair in 2022.\nAnd Ordell's main exploration project, Barimaia, also comes from Genesis, which will emerge with a 9 per cent \nstake in the explorer after the float as part of an agreement to sell the tenements.\nBarimaia sits a stone's throw from Ramelius Resources' Mt Magnet operations, and in a district that's seen a fair \nbit of corporate interest in recent times as Ramelius and Westgold jostle for position.\nThe project was previously drilled by both IGO and Genesis, and Ordell's prospectus shows pretty solid historical \nintercepts, including 15m at 11.4 grams a tonne gold, 17m at 3.4 grams a tonne, and 70m at 0.68 grams a tonne.\nBut the company now reckons the work conducted by Ramelius at its nearby deposit offers a better geological \ninterpretation for Barimaia and hopes to have better luck hanging a resource off previous drilling by targeting the \nnext round a bit better.\nOrdell also plans to spend a bit of its exploration cash at its Goodia Project, 15km southwest of Norseman - an area \nonce best known for gold, but now the subject of lithium interest. The Goodia tenements were previously held by \nGalileo Mining, last seen selling 30 per cent of the lithium rights at its own Norseman tenements to Mineral \nResources for $7.5m.\nPage 2 of 2\nGold price offers hope for Argonaut Securities' new ASX float - DATA ROOM\nLoad-Date: June 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Ramelius Resources.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
