Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1707 words\nByline: Doug Bright\nHighlight: In this edition of Bulls N' Bears Big Hits, we examine notable drill intercepts revealed on the ASX, \nincluding Ordell Minerals' 22.70m at 4.09g/t gold from 71.3m.\nBody\nIn this edition of Bulls N' Bears Big Hits, we examine some notable drill intercepts revealed on the ASX, including \nOrdell Minerals' 22.70m at 4.09g/t gold intercept from 71.3m from its Barimaia project in WA's Murchison region.\nWe also take a close look at other interesting drill hits from around the globe last week as reported by Sierra \nNevada Gold and Asian Battery Metals' in Mongolia.\nSo, let's dive in.\nOrdell Minerals (ASX:ORD)\nHit: 22.7m at 4.09g/t gold from 71.3m, including 1m at 36g/t gold from 76m.\nOrdell Minerals' recently completed diamond drilling program at its McNabs East prospect within its Barimaia gold \nproject near Mt Magnet in WA has jagged an encouraging 22.7m going 4.09g/t gold from 71.3m, including 1m at a \nsolid 36g/t gold from 76m.\nThe hit is supported by encouraging gold intercepts in four other holes, with one 12m intersection going 1.85g/t gold \nfrom 152m, including 5.78m at 3.36g/t gold from 158.2m.\nThe gold mineralisation has been confirmed by the company's drilling to be associated with a felsic intrusive and to \nstrike east/north-east and plunge at a flat angle to the east. The drill intercepts reveal the possibility of an extensive \nzone of shallow gold mineralisation on the western side of McNabs East, which at this stage remains open at depth \nand along strike.\nThe company completed the five hole, 426m diamond drilling program last December as part of an ongoing \nprogram to systematically test the currently defined 2.5km strike extent of shallow gold mineralisation at Barimaia.\nResults from the program confirm the existence of a shallow, coherent zone of potentially open-pittable gold \nmineralisation on the western side of McNabs East, within an extensive gold system that remains untested at depth \nand open along strike.\nPage 2 of 4\nOrdell locks onto new gold zone in Mt Magnet\nOrdell's flagship Barimaia gold project is an advanced exploration project with significant historical drilling results. \nOrdell acquired an 80.3 per cent interest in Barimaia from Genesis Minerals, which is now a major shareholder of \nOrdell with an 8 per cent interest.\nHowever, Barimaia was never fully explored by Genesis due to its other commitments, although the company \nsuccessfully identified an extensive gold system at the project, supported by historical RC drilling results pointing to \ngood shallow open pit potential.\nThe project is strategically located within a stone's throw of at least three gold processing plants, including the \nadjacent Ramelius Resources' Mt Magnet mill, 70km from Spartan Resources' Dalgaranga mill and 80km from \nWestgold Resources' Tuckabianna mill.\nThe company is planning to launch a more extensive program of about 5000m of reverse circulation drilling at \nBarimaia in February. The upcoming program will include infill drilling at McNabs East to close up the current 100m \ndrill section spacing and will also include first-pass extensional drilling in areas where previous air-core (AC) drilling \nwas undertaken in 2019 and 2021.\nAdditionally, the new program will test depths between 100m and 200m in selected areas and will also include \nadditional AC drilling east and north of the currently defined mineralisation at McNabs.\nOrdell says drilling of the McNabs East western zone will comprise a significant part of the company's big drilling \nprogram slated for February.\n------------------\nSierra Nevada Gold (ASX:SNX)\nHit: 4.88m at 481g/t silver, 0.61g/t gold, 0.6 per cent copper and 0.4 per cent antimony from 87.78m.\nSierra Nevada Gold's Phase 1 reverse-circulation (RC) drilling at its Endowment Mine within the overall Blackhawk \nepithermal project area pulled up a big silver hit while targeting a remnant ore position between the 3rd and 4th \nmine levels on the historic Endowment Vein.\nThe headline drill hit from the latest campaign is 4.88m at 481g/t silver, 0.61g/t gold, 0.6 per cent copper and 0.4 \nper cent antimony from 87.78m\nThe vein was targeted based on indications from historic mine records pointing to part of the vein not having been \nmined, with drilling successfully spearing through an inter-stope zone to jag the vein which remains open down-\nplunge to the east.\nThe Endowment Mine is the biggest of the historic mines in the locality and was initially mined in the 1860s, with \nmost mining completed by the 1880s and a total production being reported of 70,000 ounces of gold equivalent.\nThe operation's inability to process sulphide ores and prevailing depressed economic conditions led to the \ncessation of mining in the 1920s, although mineralisation remains within reach of current infrastructure.\nNotably, the area has seen little modern-day exploration before Sierra Nevada Gold acquired the ground, with the \nlatest prior exploration in the area being undertaken in the mid to late 1980s by American Gold Resources.\nThe focus of recent exploration has been on defining shallow oxide gold and silver deposits, with two shallow oxide \nresources being estimated by AGR at Silver Gulch and Morning Star, which also lie within the overall Blackhawk \nproject\nImportantly, before Sierra Nevada Gold's presence, no exploration drilling was recorded within 600m of the \nEndowment Mine due to previous ownership issues.Page 3 of 4\nOrdell locks onto new gold zone in Mt Magnet\nThe company's other drilling at the adjacent near-surface South Vein turned up additional silver hits, including 6.1m \ngoing 66.04g/t silver in one hole and 1.22m at 82.80g/t silver in a second hole.\nGeochemically the South Vein is like the Endowment Vein, characterised by high silver, antimony, ore-grade lead, \nzinc and elevated copper and manganese.\nInterestingly, apart from its big hit in the Endowment Vein, the headline hole also punched through a 1.22m section \nof the South Vein which assayed a serious 275g/t silver, 3.65 per cent lead, 6.47 per cent zinc, 0.40 per cent \ncopper, and 0.21 per cent antimony from 37.79m.\nSierra Nevada has identified a big high-grade intermediate sulphidation epithermal (ISE) silver-gold-lead-zinc vein \nfield which is related to the adjacent big Blackhawk porphyry system just south of the epithermal field.\nThe ISE vein system covers about 5 sq. km and is open under cover both to the north and north-east, with about \n22.5 line kilometres of veins recorded so far. Sierra Nevada is continuing its mapping and sampling and has \nidentified additional veins within the ISE vein field.\n------------------\nAsian Battery Metals (ASX:AZ9)\nHit: 6.1m of 4.16 per cent copper, 3.51 per cent nickel, 0.93g/t 3E and 0.13 per cent cobalt from 98.2m.\nLast week Asian Battery Minerals landed a 6.1m hit grading 4.16 per cent copper, 3.51 per cent nickel, 0.93g/t 3E \nand 0.13 per cent cobalt from 98.2m.\nA 3E value refers typically to the combined value of assays for gold, platinum and palladium.\nThe result, from one of the last four holes analysed in its 2024 Phase 2 drilling program, was designed to confirm \nthe extent of high-grade mineralisation in the company's Oval gabbroic intrusion.\nThe intercept is book-ended by two broad, lower grade mineralised zones, the first of which is a dense, \ndisseminated intercept of 26.2m at 0.44 per cent copper, 0.52 per cent nickel, 0.12g/t 3E and 0.03 per cent cobalt \nfrom 78.2m. The second zone comprises a net-textured 15.3m assaying 1.15 per cent copper, 0.79 per cent nickel, \n0.35g/t 3E and 0.04 per cent cobalt from 104.3m.\nThree of the last four drillholes analysed targeted electromagnetic (EM) conductors identified from downhole \n(DHEM) responses, which the company believes could represent base metal mineralised targets.\nThe headline hole probed a strongly conductive DHEM plate in the northern half of the Oval body, which is strongly \nexpressed in high-resolution magnetics as a 500m long, 125m wide ovoid body oriented to the north-northwest.\nThe hole successfully encountered low to highly mineralised gabbroic rock from 16m depth to 142.2m, including the \nforegoing intercepts.\nA second hole in the final suite of four was collared 35m east of and on an opposing azimuth to the headline hole.\nIt targeted a separate DHEM conductor for which the source turned out to be a broad high-grade intersection in the \nnorthern third of the Oval area that includes a massive sulphide intercept of 1.8m at 3.21 per cent copper, 3.32 per \ncent nickel, 0.69g/t E3, and 0.14 per cent cobalt from 105m.\nThe 1.8m at 3.21 copper intercept lies within a broader mineralised zone comprising 19.8m at 1.23 per cent copper, \n0.98 per cent nickel, 0.36g/t 3E and 0.05 per cent cobalt from 91.2m.\nThe 19.8m zone also includes three other significant intercepts of disseminated, semi-massive and massive \nmineralisation in gabbro, the best of which are 6.6m going 1.56 per cent copper from 96.0m and 2.4m at 1.52 per \ncent copper and 1.39 per cent nickel from 102.6m.Page 4 of 4\nOrdell locks onto new gold zone in Mt Magnet\nThe third drillhole targeted an off-hole conductor plate that had been determined by DHEM surveying of a nearby \nprevious hole. It intercepted 18.5m of lower grade mineralised gabbro from 13.5m to 32m, although it includes 3.2m \nrunning 0.50 per cent copper, 0.38 per cent nickel, 0.30g/t 3E and 0.02 per cent cobalt from 25m.\nFurther support was lent to the intriguing possibilities presented by the Oval body, with the fourth drillhole testing \nthe southern extremity of the Oval gabbroic intrusive and the zone of contact with its enclosing sediments.\nThat hole was also intended to provide a vector for a subsequent DHEM survey to sniff out any new useful \nconductors within range. It intercepted disseminated mineralised gabbro with 5m going 0.17 per cent copper, 0.17 \nper cent nickel, 0.03g/t 3E and 0.01 per cent cobalt from 126m.\nThe company's recent drilling has focused mainly on identifying high-grade mineralisation in the gabbro at the Oval \nproject. It views the multiple intercepts of massive sulphide mineralisation with their varying ratios of metal \nthroughout the Oval intrusion as encouraging for the possibility of finding one or more deeper sources of high-grade \ncopper-nickel-platinum group mineralisation.\nFor its follow-up 2025 exploration program, Asian Battery Metals plans to focus on scoping out the overall scale of \nthe Oval mineralisation and to target possible deeper magmatic sources at the prospect. It also plans additional \nexploration for potential extensions of Oval and nearby look-alike prospects.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Ramelius Resources' Mt Magnet mill is strategically located near Ordell Minerals' Barimaia gold project, which has recently reported promising drill results, indicating potential competition for gold processing in the region.\n\n2. The Barimaia project, now under Ordell Minerals, was previously owned by Genesis Minerals, which had not fully explored the site due to other commitments, suggesting that Ramelius Resources may face increased exploration activity and potential resource competition in the Mt Magnet area.\n\n3. The upcoming extensive drilling program by Ordell Minerals at Barimaia, which includes infill and extensional drilling, could lead to significant discoveries that may impact the operational landscape for Ramelius Resources and its nearby processing facilities.\n\n4. The historical context of the Barimaia project, with its significant drilling results and proximity to Ramelius Resources' operations, highlights the potential for increased exploration and development pressures in the gold mining sector in Western Australia.",
