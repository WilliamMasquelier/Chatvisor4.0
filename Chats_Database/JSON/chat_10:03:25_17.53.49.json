Inflation, recessions and stifled economic growth have dominated \ninvestment fundamentals, but given the swift increase of interest rates last year, Bosio reckons investors have been \nable to take advantage of cash as a genuine, no-risk investment class paying more than 5 per cent in some \ninstances.\nBut now there's a whiff of lower rates in the air, we may see investors adjust their asset allocation into higher \nrisk/return sectors.\nBeneficiaries? Bosio likes real estate investment trust funds (REITs) and listed investment companies (LICs) that \nmay have a funding cost (debt profile) that will improve in an environment where rates decline.\nAnd because he's dedicated gold bull, Bosio says the gold sector looks perfectly positioned for strength.\nHere are his three picks for the great unwind: Ramelius Resources: \"Strong balance sheet, new projects being \ndeveloped to drive production and acquisitive team/management who have executed a consistent strategy to \nacquire targets whereby they can leverage discovery success and production ounces.\" WAM Capital: WAM is a \nlisted investment company with a focus on small to medium-sized businesses and a large, diversified portfolio.\n\"Weak performance in the current environment has resulted in a lower share price. However, the yield has been \nhistorically high and a significant attraction to income-focused investors,\" Bosio says.\nCenturia Capital: An REIT with various listed alternatives including office and industrial companies. For Bosio, \nCenturia is a quality small-cap property company with a strong track record of acquiring and managing assets.\nBroker upgrades Ord Minnett likes the look of Dropsuite.

Its products are distributed via a network of about 4000 IT reseller partners globally.\nAt the Inspire Conference 2023 in August, it copped a bit of a hit when Microsoft provided a first look at its 365 \nBackup and Archive solution. Dropsuite's price fell 22 per cent on the day and has not recovered since.\nOrd Minnett was not convinced. \"Based on our work and discussions with industry participants, we conclude that \nfears of any existential risk to DSE's business are overblown.
