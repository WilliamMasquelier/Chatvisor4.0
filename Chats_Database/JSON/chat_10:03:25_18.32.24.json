One featuring Prime Minister \nAnthony Albanese, another starring Communications Minister Michelle Rowland.\nHow both parties run their business forums is a galling exercise in regulatory runaround. Annual disclosures \nreleased this week plainly show the individuals like billionaire Anthony Pratt who stump up large party donations.\nBut business donations through annual subscriptions to the forums are kept fuzzy. Millions of dollars in cash \ndumped into a washing machine. It's up to journalists to piece together exactly who is forking over the suitcases \nthat give them privileged access to the country's elected officials.\nRWA is a paid subscriber of Labor's forum. Those subscribers usually pay something like $60,000 annually, and in \nreturn get a wad of tickets to budget night and passes to other talkfests. That's a fair wedge, to not be getting \nanything for it.\nOne possible reason for its exclusion is that, given the government is apparently at the pointy end of developing its \nbookmaker ad ban policy, it would be inappropriate for RWA to be in the room.\nPage 2 of 3\nREAR WINDOW Chalmers, Labor leave bookmaking giant in cold\nAnd that sounds well and nice, but what of all the other blue-chip companies whose commercial futures are \ninfluenced by any pending government policy? Do you reckon Resources Minister Madeleine King is being shielded \nfrom BHP and Rio's lobbyist operations? Does Chalmers have the discipline to screen late-night calls from CBA's \nMatt Comyn? Of course not.\nPerhaps they have wised up to the not-a-good-look factor of going off-record with bookmakers.\nIn 2023, this masthead revealed the RWA (then on behalf of Sportsbet and Entain) picked up the tab for a private \nsteak dinner for Rowland the year prior. This was later excused as a \"policy briefing\", which coincidentally fell on \nher birthday. She faced calls to resign.\nIn 2022, Sportsbet also footed a $8960 bill for a dinner to support Rowland's election campaign at Rockpool. She \nwas then the shadow minister in charge of online betting. The Minister for Sportsbet tag has stuck.\nAny wonder Labor is running around blacklisting the bookmakers. If it is serious, it can give the subscription money \nback.\nTech visa lobby foots bill for Bragg's bash\nLiberal senator Andrew Bragg's 2023 Christmas party was a glitzy affair, sponsored by Sydney's billionaire party \nking Justin Hemmes. It had the venue (not disclosed), drinks and canapes you'd expect of a Merivale shindig.\nHis 2024 Christmas bash was a less glamorous affair, according to Bragg. The venue (not disclosed, again) was \nsomewhere in Barangaroo and the senator's parliamentary disclosures show the sponsor was the Australian \nComputer Society.\nWho doesn't want to talk about IT over an eggnog margarita?\nGiven the ACS's financial stake in several policies that could become key election issues, footing the bill for a \nChristmas party for Liberal Party operatives may prove a smart investment.\nThe organisation pitches itself as a \"leading professional association representing Australia's technology \ncommunity, across industry, government and education\". It has nearly 50,000 members and releases reports on \nprofessional skills and trends.\nBut it is also an accredited provider of skilled migrant assessments for IT professionals hoping to move to Australia.\nAnother revenue stream is its \"ACS Professional Year\", which it pitches as \"a job-readiness program that bridges \nthe gap between full-time study and employment in Australia's tech sector\". Graduates can claim an additional five \npoints towards visa applications.\nIf only there was an event where the ACS could speak to politicians about the important issues of skilled migration \nand international student caps in the lead-up to Christmas ...\nOn the ACS front, a spokesman says the party was \"part of our regular government relations outreach program\". It \nspreads its Christmas cheer without partisanship too: \"We do it with politicians from all parties and the \nindependents as well,\" he says.\nFrom Bragg's end, he says he was just keen to celebrate Christmas in Sydney as, in his view, the city's Lord Mayor \nClover Moore had tried to shut it down. \"Clover Moore hates Christmas, I love Christmas,\" he says. \"I think it's good \nto celebrate, and I'm grateful to the ACS for putting on a nice event where I can thank my long-suffering \nsupporters.\"\nAt Fortescue, you really can ask anythingPage 3 of 3\nREAR WINDOW Chalmers, Labor leave bookmaking giant in cold\nAll-staff meetings are fertile ground for workplace drama, especially when the floor is opened for questions to \nmanagement. Never one to back down from a fight, Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has instituted a permanent \"Ask \nUs Anything\" portal.\nRank-and-file staff post anonymous questions to management, which are then posted in a public forum. They can \nbe \"liked\", with the most popular then answered in a weekly meeting. It also includes any written responses from \nthe bosses.\nUnsurprisingly, some silliness has ensued. In one post, an employee asks for an in-house lottery; 81 staffers back \nthe request, which bears a striking resemblance to Gina Rinehart's in-house loyalty program. \"For each year with \nFMG, can we be given a token that is placed into a barrel and have ten tokens drawn out yearly with the winners \nget [sic] 100k prize,\" the Fortescue workers asked.\nGiven Twiggy is convinced Rinehart has spent her life copying his ideas, we don't reckon there is much chance he \nwill return the favour by replicating her annual Christmas cash giveaway, in which random staff members are gifted \n$100,000.\nOther requests included table tennis and a pool for FMG's new corporate digs on St Georges Terrace in Perth. \n\"Would be lovely to have a quick dip during breaks or after a hard day's work,\" one staffer said.\n\"Can males wear formal shorts to the office on hot summer days please?\" was another plea. Some decorum, \nplease!\nThe raffle may not be flying, but other FMG \"troops\", as Twiggy calls them, have had more luck in getting action \nfrom managers. Some correspondents used it to complain that FMG's recent austerity drive had robbed them of \nbiscuits and fruit in staff kitchenettes, and tampons in the toilets. The tampon question was especially popular, with \n184 likes.\nA Fortescue spokesman assured us that those essentials were on the way back, with an alternating roster between \nfruit and biscuits. Tampon dispensers are also in the works.\nSome of the questions have a lot more edge. A common theme in many submissions has been frustration at \nFortescue's diversity policies. The company has been an industry leader in improving diversity within its workforce \nand is one of the few ASX20 companies to publicly stand by its approach since Donald Trump's anti-inclusion push.\nYet many of the questions posed on the Ask Us Anything portal suggested that women and ethnic minorities were \nwinning promotions undeservedly. Those questions have upset some staff.\nLoad-Date: February 7, 2025\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Mark Di Stefano, Hannah Wootton\nDate: February 05, 2025\nTitle: REAR WINDOW; Chalmers, Labor leave bookmaking giant in cold\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Some home truths for Fortescue\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Yoni Bashan & Nick Evans\n### Date: February 05, 2025\n\nPage 1 of 3\nSome home truths for Fortescue\nSome home truths for Fortescue\nThe Australian\nFebruary 5, 2025 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 13\nLength: 1202 words\nByline: YONI BASHAN & NICK EVANS, MARGIN CALL\nBody\nFortescue asked, and boy did its executives receive.\nThe mining group led by Andrew Forrest has engaged in a cute little exercise with its workforce that it's calling \"Ask \nUs Anything\", in which employees can post anonymous questions to the leadership while even more employees - \nor even leaders themselves - can submit nameless replies. Well, actually, not all of them are nameless; the bland \nresponses, the most banal and corporate, come with a name. But rest assured, this lark is completely consuming \neveryone at the organisation.\nIt's Frank Costanza's airing of grievances but on an enormous scale, a Festivus ritual open to more than 20,000 \nparticipants across the Forrest empire.\nThere's snark, there's banter. There's outrage over a tampon and sanitary pad dispenser that's gone missing from a \nbathroom.\nThere's righteous indignation over women who can swish around the office in skirts during the summer while poor, \nsuffering dudes have to wilt in their neckties and suit jackets.\n\"Biscuits \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. We want biscuits in all kitchens \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Nothing better than a cuppa and a biccy,\" said one employee, \nreceiving 37 upvotes from their peers. Meanwhile, someone's idea for a masala chai machine in the kitchenette \nreceived only four upvotes. Philistines.\nWhat better window into a company's culture?\nFortescue CEO Dino Otranto addressed the most pressing questions at a recent \"team huddle\", although it's hard \nto tell whether he took this all seriously. Otranto prefaced one response by saying, \"this is probably the politically \ncorrect answer I need to give\", and then he told everyone that he likes to sit back and brace himself for the \nquestions \"with a nice bottle of scotch\".\nNo shade on knocking back a dram of whisky, which Dino can happily afford with his $1.75m salary (not including \nperformance rights, themselves worth a few dinero) but what of the Fortescue underclass? They're getting punted \nPage 2 of 3\nSome home truths for Fortescue\nbecause of Forrest's failing green energy vision. Remember the secret membrane, or the magic beans of green \nhydrogen? So much heat, yet so little light. Pretty soon we'll get an announcement of major advancements out of \nFortescue HQ. Their newest secret weapon? Eye of newt.\nSome 700 employees were let go in July, supposedly to lean up the business and not at all because of this flunking, \nexpensive project that's subsidised by the long-suffering shareholders of Fortescue's actual rainmaking business: \nmining. \"Most of us can't afford a nice bottle of scotch,\" one staffer said.\nOtranto's \"huddle\" mustn't have gone down a treat, which explains why chief operating officer Shelley Robertson, \npoached from the dum-dums at MinRes, fronted the second town hall instead to answer questions, one of which \nconcerned Fortescue's very cluttered organisational chart.\n\"Can someone explain the org structure? We have CEOs reporting to CEOs, directors to directors, and varying \ntitles, despite being told it would be 'flattened'.\" Now who might have asked that except for someone clearly trying to \nMarie Kondo the place? Looking at you, Otranto.\nSome insight, as well, into the workforce hardships that have followed the screw-tightening of July.\n\"Why is the budget so tight at the minute? Are we expected to deliver world class service on a shoestring budget? \nRecruitment restrictions are leaving departments short and the people picking up the slack are getting burned out,\" \nsaid one aggrieved Fortescue worker. Another sarcastically wrote: \"Is there an opportunity in the future to expand \non the CEO for a day initiative and participate if you are not a First Nations -employee?\" And then this from a \nperson who clearly hasn't kept an eye on iron ore prices: \"Instead of a Christmas party, can you give each \ndepartment $150 per person to hold their own team party?\" A popular idea with 211 upvotes, but hopelessly \nunrealistic, to be sure. Reminder: it's Fortescue, people, not Hancock. Don't hold your breath for a cash giveaway.\nA spokeswoman said the whole point of the exercise was to promote transparent communication within the \norganisation.\n\"This is just one avenue we are using to ensure our staff can continue to engage and interact with the leadership \nteam, getting answers to the topics that matter the most to our people,\" which apparently doesn't go much higher \nthan biscuits and air conditioning.\nDonations dry up Good retail politics, or a fundraising own goal?\nThe outrage over PwC's tax leaks scandal generated plenty of headlines for both major parties but their backroom \noperators might be ruing the point scoring as they tally up their respective election war chests. Not that many \npeople outside of the party backrooms will be crying, but those inside the tent might be another victim of the PwC \nscandal.\nThe Australian Electoral Commission's annual release of political donation data suggests the major parties' coffers \nhave been left with a $700,000 black hole after the \"big four\" firms - PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY - dramatically \npulled back their support last financial year.\nThey collectively donated almost $1m to both major parties in 2022-23 before revelations emerged that PwC used \nits position inside the tax office tent to enrich itself and its clients, at the (probable) expense of taxpayers.\nHowever, after politicians turned the screws on the bastardry, most of the firms shied away from making political \ndonations.\nPwC coughed up $369,973 to the major political parties in 2022-23, but didn't make any political donations in 2023-\n24 after banning them entirely. KPMG donated just $22,631, which was down 83 per cent on the previous year, \nwhile Deloitte donated $47,497 - down 73 per cent.\nOnly EY is an outlier, seemingly unaffected by the scandal. EY donated $180,172 in 2023-24, which was slightly \ndown on the $227,853 it donated the previous year.Page 3 of 3\nSome home truths for Fortescue\nAll up, donations to the major parties from the big four in 2023-24 were down more than 73 per cent, which was a \nbit of a blow to the coffers of the major parties.\nAnother oddity stands out among the financial services sector, after banking major ANZ pulled its donations to the \nmajor parties. The bank kicked in $90,000 to the major parties in 2022-23 but made only a single donation of $5500 \nthis current disclosure round.\nCuriously enough, that was to the Nationals, traditionally the party of bashing the banks.\nThe donation appears to have been made just a few months after the bank appeared at a hearing as part of \nNationals senator Matt Canavan's inquiry into branch closures in regional Australia. Purely a coincidence, no doubt.\nOf course, the AEC disclosures don't tell the whole story; notoriously so. Only direct donations are recorded under \nthe giver's name. Left off the disclosures are the names behind the millions of dollars raked in through business \nforums run by the major parties, which have annual membership rates of $30,000 to $120,000 and run dozens and \ndozens of breakfasts, lunches, dinners (and even the odd afternoon tea) to give access to ministers and their \nshadow counterparts for those able and prepared to pay. Margin Call would be shocked if the big four (banks or \naccounting firms) weren't booking in for the odd spot of lunch with a minister or three during the year, but you won't \nknow it from the AEC disclosure list.\nLoad-Date: February 4, 2025\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Yoni Bashan & Nick Evans\nDate: February 05, 2025\nTitle: Some home truths for Fortescue\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Forrest blasts executives over 'most stupid' deal\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Peter Ker\n### Date: February 07, 2025\n\nPage 1 of 2\nForrest blasts executives over 'most stupid' deal\nForrest blasts executives over 'most stupid' deal\nAustralian Financial Review\nFebruary 7, 2025 Friday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2025 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 15\nLength: 567 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue's billionaire chairman Andrew Forrest blasted his executives about their plans to acquire a coal-to-\nhydrogen project, describing it as \"the most stupid\" deal he had seen in a long time in private messages that have \ncome to light through litigation in the United States.\nIn 2022, Fortescue worked with Kid Shelleen, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' flagship investment vehicle, on a joint \nbid for gas-fired power stations in Texas and coal plants in Ohio and West Virginia. The companies wanted to \nconvert the plans to produce clean-burning hydrogen fuel. The relationship soured late in the year, with Fortescue \nlodging an unsuccessful unilateral takeover bid for the assets, refusing to pay due diligence costs accrued by Kid \nShelleen and its advisors.\nMr Tudor Jones' company is now suing Fortescue for $US6.25 million ($9.95 million) compensation. Fortescue, \nwhich has dramatically scaled back its intentions to become a hydrogen giant, has been forced to hand over \ninternal documents, emails and messages during the litigation process.\nAmong those messages is a July 2022 missive from Dr Forrest to Fortescue executives in which he describes the \nplans to buy the assets in Ohio and West Virginia as \"at least the most stupid deal I have seen for a long while.\"\nThe bid with Kid Shelleen had been devised and led by Fortescue's then-chief commercial officer David Hunt, and \nthe then-president of Fortescue's North American clean energy unit, Paul Browning. In another message sent on \nWhatsApp, Dr Forrest said the proposal \"in itself makes me wonder deeply about the commercial nous of Paul \nBrowning\".\nThe comments were made near the peak of Fortescue's interest in green hydrogen, when the company was \npromising to produce 15 million tonnes of the commodity by 2030. Fortescue has since acknowledged it will not \nachieve that goal given the slow adoption of hydrogen around the world, but continues to develop a hydrogen \nproject in Arizona and much smaller trial-scale hydrogen projects in Western Australia and Queensland. Kid \nShelleen told the court that Fortescue's attitude towards the bid appeared to change around July 2022, the same \nmonth as Dr Forrest's messages.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest blasts executives over 'most stupid' deal\nMr Browning and Mr Hunt exited Fortescue in August 2022.\nKid Shelleen claims it was told by Mr Hunt in late August that Fortescue would make a solo bid for the assets, \nrather than continue with the joint bid.\nKid Shelleen claims that Mr Hunt offered to pay for the due diligence costs. Fortescue disputes that such a verbal \npromise was made, and says it would not be legally binding even if it were made.\nMr Browning was replaced as Fortescue's top clean energy executive in North America by former AGL Energy \nchief executive Andy Vesey, who also gave testimony to the court shortly before Christmas.\nMost of Mr Vesey's testimony is inaccessible to the public. However, a snippet made available by the Connecticut \ncourt shows Mr Vesey carried a second phone with him in case he lost his primary device.\nFortescue has declined to submit messages from that second phone to the court, arguing instead that they are \nidentical to those on his primary device.\nKid Shelleen has disputed that claim, saying that while messages may be mirrored, the two phones have different \nWhatsApp messaging accounts.\nKid Shelleen has asked for Dr Forrest and Fortescue energy boss Mark Hutchinson to also give testimony, \nalthough this has not yet occurred.",
