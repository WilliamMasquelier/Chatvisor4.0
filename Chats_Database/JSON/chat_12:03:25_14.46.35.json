Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 550 words\nHighlight: The team behind glamorous CBD venue Shell House will start work immediately on The International at \nthe entrance to the new Martin Place station.\nBody\nThe sprawling Martin Place site left empty by the recent closure of the failed Botswana Butchery restaurant will be \nreborn as a multi-level mega hospitality hub - complete with wine bar, upmarket restaurant and rooftop bar - from \nthe team behind Shell House, the glamour venue on Wynyard Lane.\nBuilding work will commence as early as next week at The InternationalMartin Place. The timing is serendipitous, \ngiven that the new Martin Place underground metro will open soon.\n\"The new metro is a game changer,\" says Brett Robinson, group chief executive of The Point, the hospitality group \nbehind Shell House and the incoming International project. \"Train lines from all over Sydney feed into it. It'll activate \nthat top end of town, which we think is under-serviced.\"\nWith plans to open for the Melbourne Cup on Tuesday, November 5, The International will be close to the metro's \nMartin Place entrance. A number of seasoned hospitality players have also spotted its potential, with Melbourne \npastry mecca Lune Croissanterie opening and Etymon Projects (the team behind The Charles Grand Brasserie in \nthe city and Loulou Bistro in Lavender Bay) launching a Mediterranean restaurant called Martin 21, with a cafe \nsidekick, Marty's, nearby.\nRobinson says he was approached by Dexus, the investment trust property that owns 25 Martin Place, where \nBotswana Butchery traded, because of The Point's success operating a similarly scaled site at Shell House, where \nit juggles a two-hat restaurant, cocktail bar and bistro.\nIt was announced in April that Botswana Butchery restaurants in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra had entered \nvoluntary administration, along with sibling Sydney Asian-inspired restaurant White + Wong's, in one of the biggest \nhospitality shake-outs of 2024.\nLink to Image\nJennifer Soo\nPage 2 of 2\nFailed Botswana Butchery site in Martin Place to be reborn as huge hospitality hub\nLicensed for 878 patrons, the site's revamp - led by designer Anna Robinson with local studio Woods Baggot - will \nnod to Harry Seidler, the architect of the building that used to be known as the MLC Centre. Guests at The \nInternational will be able to choose between a wine bar with small plates from a wood-fired oven, a \"high-level \ndining room\" on the middle level and a rooftop bar and kitchen.\n\"It'll be snack culture up there, skewers,\" Robinson says of the rooftop offering. \"We like the word international; it \ngives us a bit of culinary freedom.\" Group culinary director Joel Bickford will oversee the venue's food offering.\nWhile Robinson concedes the industry is going through a \"difficult time\" and construction costs are skyrocketing \n(The International is fortunate in that it will be able to repurpose Botswana's two-year-old kitchen), The Point is \ntaking a long-term position. And with one of the group's other projects, Fort Denison, delayed until late 2025, The \nPoint had a match-fit opening team to call on.\nRobinson's bullish outlook about the upper slopes of Martin Place is centred on its mix of luxury international retail \nbrands, nearby attractions such as the Theatre Royal and businesses including Macquarie Group.\nSebastien Lutaud, from the incoming Martin 21 restaurant and Marty's cafe, spent years living in France, observing \nthe impact of train movements on the ebb and flow of the restaurant businesses. \"I feel like it will put that part of the \ncity on the map,\" Lutaud told the Herald in May.\nGraphic\n \nShell House Dining Room and Terrace will soon have a new sibling.\nLoad-Date: October 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
