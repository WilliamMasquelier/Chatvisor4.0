Forrest has made the difficult decision to scale back his green hydrogen initiatives, citing difficulties \nwith the commercial viability of the project.\nThis prudent business decision raises an important question: if green hydrogen projects are not currently viable for \nprivate investors such as Forrest, why should Australian taxpayers be expected to shoulder the financial risk? The \ndiscrepancy between Forrest's public advocacy and private actions signals the need for a thorough reassessment \nof taxpayer investments in green hydrogen.\nPublic funds should be allocated prudently, ensuring that investments are both economically viable and beneficial \nfor the broader community, not for billionaires' business interests.\nDon McMillan, Paddington, Qld\nFriday's editorial (\"Hydrogen rush is hitting reality\", 19/7) clearly sets out what the federal government should be in \nrelation to Australia's ongoing energy supply. Opposition energy spokesman Ted O'Brien says: \"Hydrogen was a \ngood example of why governments should avoid trying to pick winners and instead diversify the risk for taxpayers.\" \nThe current Coalition stance is effectively that we must leave our options open.\nWe know from our own and overseas experience that energy technology is developing rapidly. In practical terms, \nwe are increasingly seeing new energy supply opportunities revealed. I would like to think we are a fairly pragmatic \ncountry when it comes to the uptake of new technologies.\nAs your editorial says, \"The responsible thing to do is to safeguard electricity supplies using known technologies \nwhile alternatives are properly evaluated.\" We certainly have the skills and political nous to make long-term \ndecisions for the benefit of all Australians.\nJohn Houghton, The Gap, Qld\nPage 2 of 2\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nBrilliant letter by Mark Scanlan (\"Bowen EV policy driving us into dystopian future\", 19/7) on the future for green \nhydrogen and the advent of the zero-emissions Twigster! I hope he has sent copies to the Prime Minister, Energy \nMinister and rent-seekers of government energy investment schemes.\nKerry MacDermott, Binalong, NSW\nThe chooks have come home to roost. To sustain a renewable energy pipe dream takes a lot of money. Even \nAndrew Forrest, who seems to have lots of it, and government largesse aren't enough to overcome the reality of \nsupply and demand. There simply isn't sufficient renewable electricity currently or in the pipeline to service \nFortescue's proposed production of 15 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2030. Given supply-side issues, the cost of \nrenewable energy for the purpose of green hydrogen production is exorbitantly high. The Fortescue pullback has \npunched a mammoth hole in the government's renewable ambitions. It raises serious questions about the reliability \nof the government's forecasts and its promises in the energy space more generally. It's a wake-up call that to wed \nthis country's energy security to technologies that are yet to be proven at scale is not only fraught but also \nirresponsible.\nKim Keogh, Claremont, WA\nIt is hilariously strange to witness the evolution of the views of energy analysts and even Australia's Chief Scientist \non the outlook for green hydrogen in our energy mix since Fortescue's pirouette on its future application. I wonder \nif our next chief scientist might have a better grasp of the second law of thermodynamics.\nThere has been so much ignorant, greenwashing bunkum delivered to potential investors around projects to deliver \nhydrogen as a fuel. In fact, the manufacturing process itself consumes about three times as much energy as it \ndelivers in use. I've seen wild projects touted as environmentally friendly taking hydrogen from brown coal or \nmethane, coupled with carbon capture, while every second element of the periodic table has suddenly become \n\"critical\". Carpetbaggers and lifestyle company directors have had a field day.\nThe sad and concerning aspect of this madness is how poorly our government has been advised and the many \ntens of millions of taxpayer dollars that have been splashed around on harebrained projects of dubious merit.
