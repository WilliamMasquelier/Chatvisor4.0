Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 21\nLength: 748 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue will use debt, government grants and equity sell-downs to minimise the toll on its balance sheet from the \nestimated $US4 billion ($5.9 billion) cost of its next two hydrogen projects.\nInsights into the potential capital required of the next wave of hydrogen projects came as Fortescue raised its \ndividend by 16 per cent and reported a $US5.7 billion annual underlying profit yesterday.\nTotal dividends for the year of $1.97 a share translate into $2.2 billion for Andrew and Nicola Forrest, who \ncollectively control 36.7 per cent of Fortescue.\nThe iron ore miner announced in July that it would slow its push into hydrogen as part of an austerity campaign that \nwould involve 700 job cuts. The belt-tightening comes at a time when analysts believe weak iron ore prices will \ndrive a 15 per cent slide in revenue in the year ahead.\nBut Fortescue has not fully abandoned the nascent hydrogen sector, and plans to bring projects in Norway and \nBrazil to the board for an investment decision over the next 12 months.\nFortescue energy chief Mark Hutchinson said both projects would, in fact, make green ammonia, a compound of \nhydrogen and nitrogen that was easier to transport than hydrogen.\nHe said a plan to build an ammonia project at Holmaneset in the Norwegian fjords would cost in the \"low $US1 \nbillion\" range, with construction expected to start in 2025 and first production by 2027.\nBut Mr Hutchinson stressed that Fortescue did not plan to cover the full $US1 billion price tag, with the European \nCommission already pledging (EURO)204 million ($335 million) towards the project.\n\"We would get going on the project, we would bring bank debt in at some stage, probably at financial close, of 50 to \n60 per cent, and then we would sell down some of the equity,\" he said of the project's funding.\nMr Hutchinson did not provide an exact cost estimate for Brazil's Pecem ammonia project, but said it would be \n\"three times the size\" of the Norwegian project.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue plan to split bill on mega hydrogen build\nFortescue has made similar remarks about the funding structure for its energy projects in past years, but has so far \nfully funded its hydrogen projects in Arizona and Gladstone.\nThe company had $US4.9 billion of cash on hand and net debt of $US500 million at June 30.\nCredit rating agency Moody's Investor Services said those metrics left Fortescue well-placed to invest in projects \neven though the outlook for iron ore prices was soft.\n\"This leaves Fortescue with significant capacity as the company steps up its decarbonisation efforts and capital \nexpenditure for Fortescue Energy in fiscal 2025, while considering further green energy projects,\" said Moody's \nanalyst Sean Williams.\nFortescue's total capital spending in the next year will be between $US3.7 billion and $US4.3 billion, with only \n$US500 million going to energy projects, while up to $US900 million of the spend will be on decarbonising its iron \nore mines.\nFortescue vowed to continue returning between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of earnings to shareholders as \ndividends. The $1.97-a-share dividend total for 2023-24 equated to a 70 per cent payout ratio; an improvement on \nlast year's 65 per cent.\nThe stronger dividend was made possible by an 8 per cent rise in revenue on the back of stronger iron ore prices, \nand came despite a rare decline in annual export volumes.\nIt was also made possible by an austerity campaign that saw Fortescue announce 700 job cuts last month, on top \nof hundreds of job cuts in the previous 15 months.\nAnalyst consensus measured by Bloomberg had pointed to a $US6.09 billion underlying profit.\nMorgans analyst Adrian Prendergast said higher than expected depreciation and amortisation charges were the \nmajor reason why Fortescue's profit result was lower than expected.\nFortescue shares have lost 36.5 per cent of their value since January 1, and Mr Prendergast believed the stock \nwas offering good value at current levels.\n\"The stock had become oversold following two discounted block trades in two months and fears around China \ngrowth [where we expect much more stable iron ore fundamentals],\" he said.\nBenchmark ore with 62 per cent iron was fetching $US101.10 a tonne on Tuesday, according to S&P Global Platts.\nYesterday's Fortescue accounts also revealed that former chief executive Fiona Hick was paid $2.4 million for \nworking eight months in 2023-24.\nHer resignation was announced in August last year, but she remained employed until February 28. Her pay was \ndescribed as $327,205 of fixed remuneration, plus a $2.08 million \"termination payment\".\nLoad-Date: August 31, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Major shareholder | \"Total dividends for the year of $1.97 a share translate into $2.2 billion for Andrew and Nicola Forrest, who collectively control 36.7 per cent of Fortescue.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue energy chief | \"We would get going on the project, we would bring bank debt in at some stage, probably at financial close, of 50 to 60 per cent, and then we would sell down some of the equity.\" | N.A. |\n| Sean Williams | Moody's analyst | \"This leaves Fortescue with significant capacity as the company steps up its decarbonisation efforts and capital expenditure for Fortescue Energy in fiscal 2025, while considering further green energy projects.\" | N.A. |\n| Adrian Prendergast | Morgans analyst | \"The stock had become oversold following two discounted block trades in two months and fears around China growth [where we expect much more stable iron ore fundamentals].\" | N.A. |\n| Fiona Hick | Former chief executive | \"Her pay was described as $327,205 of fixed remuneration, plus a $2.08 million 'termination payment'.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
