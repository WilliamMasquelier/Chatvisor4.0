Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 28\nLength: 473 words\nByline: Cecile Lefort\nBody\nAustralian shares suffered heavy losses yesterday, tracking a slump on Wall Street after upbeat US retail sales \ndata further dented hopes of interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia.\nHeightened geopolitical tensions also kept sentiment for risk assets in check. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index \nended the session down 1.8 per cent in one of the worst sell-offs this year. The All Ordinaries shed 1.8 per cent. \nConsumer discretionary, utilities and mining were the biggest casualties, all falling more than 2 per cent.\nMuch of the damage came after US retail sales defied expectations and rose more than forecast last month despite \nhigh borrowing costs, stoking fears the Federal Reserve will keep rates high.\n\"The carnage is the result of a perfect storm,\" said Tony Sycamore, a market analyst at IG. \"Stretched positioning \nacross global equity indices, a third successive month of firm US inflation data contributing to unease within a \ndeeply troubled bond market, against the rising risk of miscalculation and escalation in the Middle East.\"\nThere's now a strong likelihood the Fed will keep its policy rate between 5.25 per cent and 5.5 per cent at least until \nSeptember, according to market pricing. The Australian dollar, which is highly sensitive to US interest rates, hit a \nfive-month low of US64.06\u00a2.\nSuch was the mood that investors shrugged off better than expected data from China, Australia's biggest iron ore \ncustomer. The world's second-largest economy expanded 5.3 per cent in the 12 months to last month, well above \nforecasts of 4.6 per cent.\nYet, shares in the mining giants slumped, tracking a sell-off in the iron ore price, which slipped 2 per cent in \nSingapore. Rio Tinto dropped 2.9 per cent to $128.70 and BHP slipped 1.8 per cent to $44.97.\nEven gold explorers suffered despite the precious metal nearing record highs as fears of a region-wide war in the \nMiddle East sent investors rushing to safe-haven assets. Gold Road Resources tumbled 6.2 per cent to $1.595 \nand St Barbara shed 7 per cent to 26.5\u00a2. Ramelius, up 0.7 per cent to $1.975, was among the rare winners.\nPage 2 of 2\nASX slumps 1.8pc as miners, banks drop Equities\nThe big banks also had a painful session. ASX heavyweight Commonwealth Bank was down 2.1 per cent to \n$112.44, erasing nearly all of 2024's gains. Westpac slumped 2.3 per cent to $24.55, NAB retreated 1.7 per cent to \n$33.36 and ANZ fell 2.2 per cent to $28.36, though all three lenders held on to their healthy annual gains.\nSuncorp fell 1.3 per cent to $15.83 after filing a prudential breach with banking regulators.\nStar Entertainment Group tumbled 14.4 per cent to 41.5\u00a2 as an inquiry into the casino operator continues.\nShares in Woolworths shed 1.2 per cent to $31.88 after CEO Brad Banducci was threatened with prison time for \ncontempt at a Senate hearing about supermarket pricing. Coles fell 1.2 per cent to $16.01.\nLoad-Date: April 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Ramelius Resources.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
