Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Saul Kavonic | Energy analyst | \"If they can prove horizontal wells work in this tight coal seam gas play, it could open up several more tcf [trillion cubic feet] of gas for the east coast.\" | N.A. |\n| Rick Wilkinson | CEO of EnergyQuest | \"The flare reported at the Shell site seems to indicate more gas is flowing than the vertical well tested recently by Elixir.\" | N.A. |\n| Trevor Brown | CEO of Omega | \"If we're successful here this could be the next big wave of development post the coal seam gas wave.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Shell.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Shell or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
