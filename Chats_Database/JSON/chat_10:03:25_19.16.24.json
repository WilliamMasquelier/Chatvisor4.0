Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: CHANTICLEER; Pg. 40\nLength: 1194 words\nByline: James Thomson\nBody\nAndrew Forrest insists his green hydrogen dream is not over. Far from it.\nBut in the biggest shake-up of Fortescue's structure and strategy in several years, Forrest has put Fortescue's \nlong-held target of 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 on the backburner, and \"de-prioritised\" several \ngreen hydrogen projects in the $70 billion giant's pipeline.\nIn a series of moves that will be welcomed by investors, but provide more evidence of how the global energy \ntransition is spluttering, Fortescue will also slash 700 jobs by bringing its mining and energy divisions under one \nroof, eliminating duplication of corporate functions, and some layers of management.\nForrest will not countenance the idea that this is some sort of retreat or even a pivot; his determination to turn \nFortescue into what he calls the world's go-to company for green solutions - green metals, green energy and green \ntechnology - remains as strong as ever.\nBut the changes announced yesterday speak to both the reality of an energy transition that has been stalled by \ncost-of-living worries and rising energy prices caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle \nEast, and caution among some Fortescue investors about the prospective returns from the company's green \nenergy strategy.\nIn June, US fund manager Capital Group sold more than $1.4 billion of Fortescue shares, ceasing to be a \nsubstantial shareholder in a move some read as a reaction to Fortescue's strategic shift.\nForrest insists that the 15 million-tonne green hydrogen target remains a big part of Fortescue's ultimate plan, and \nhe's personally disappointed that the rest of the world - particularly the \"weenies\" in the traditional energy sector - \nare \"not seeing as clearly what I am seeing, which is that the world must turn away from fossil fuels\".\nBut in what will be music to the ears of the market, Forrest says the company is determined to maintain financial \ndiscipline.\nPage 2 of 3\nReality bites for Forrest's dream\n\"We are not going to swim against the tide,\" he says. \"The tide is the Australian government, every government, \nevery leader, every president, every energy minister I've met around the world in the last three years saying 'we've \ngot to get energy prices down'.\n\"Now, in that environment, you're not going to bring on major sources of green hydrogen, which relies on cheap \nenergy prices.\n\"We're going to stay where we know we can win, and that's green electricity. We'll be producing 15 million tonnes \n[of green hydrogen] and more. But to get there, we're going to make sure that the supply chain's right.\"\nThe pressure on the global green hydrogen sector is building. On Tuesday night, the European Court of Auditors \nreleased a report that found despite the European Union pumping (EURO)18.8 billion ($30.45 billion) into the \nsector, its target of importing 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 was unrealistic and \"not really founded \nupon the capacity at hand\".\nForrest remains a believer in the ability of green hydrogen to replace fossil fuel, but says Fortescue will not \"put the \nhorse behind the cart\" by pushing ahead with green hydrogen projects where the economics don't stack up due to \npersistently high electricity prices.\nGreen hydrogen projects on Fortescue's books, including in the US, Canada, the Democratic Republic of Congo \nand South Australia, will now be put on hold while the company pushes ahead with five key projects. Three of these \n- a $US550 million ($817 billion) liquefied green hydrogen facility in Arizona; its $US150 million Queensland plant at \nGladstone, which is aiming to produce green hydrogen next year; and its $US50 million green iron project at \nChristmas Creek in the Pilbara, which seeks to produce 1500 tonnes of green iron from green hydrogen - have \nalready been approved by the board and are under way.\nTwo more - a green hydrogen project in Norway and another in Brazil - are in the feasibility phase, but have now \nbeen prioritised because both countries have access to abundant, cheap, renewable energy.\nNo changes to Fortescue's capital expenditure forecasts were announced yesterday.\nThe announcement of 700 jobs cuts will not make for a very happy birthday for some at the company, which \ncelebrates the 21st anniversary of its founding today.\nBut Forrest, who says no management team ever likes announcing job losses, is adamant the redundancies do not \nreflect pressure on iron ore prices or the spluttering energy transition, but are instead part of an evolution of the \ngroup.\nIt was necessary, he says, to originally set Fortescue Energy up as a sort of internal start-up, with its own \ninfrastructure and teams. This was, in part, because the miner was \"fat and happy\" and some inside the company \ncould not see the need to shake up its highly successful mining business.\nBut with the two sides of the business now working closely together - particularly on the push to decarbonise \nFortescue's existing iron ore operations by 2030, a target Forrest clearly hopes to beat - he says the need for two \nsilos is gone.\n\"This is not to jam operating costs down, it's to streamline this organisation and keep the genius of simplicity,\" he \nsays.\nDespite the embrace of a \"one Fortescue\" model, Forrest will continue with two chief executives: metals boss Dino \nOtranto, and energy boss Mark Hutchinson.\nForrest says the leaders will be able to access resources as needed from a reshuffled corporate team led by chief \nfinancial officer Apple Paget (who moves into the role permanently after acting in the position since last August); \nchief operating officer Shelley Robertson (who has been promoted from chief corporate officer); and Mona Gill, who \nassumes the role of company secretary from Phil McKeiver.Page 3 of 3\nReality bites for Forrest's dream\nMcKeiver will retain the role of general counsel, but only after offering to resign following revelations that a law firm \nemployed by Fortescue had hired private investigators to follow former Fortescue executives and their families as \npart of an ugly legal spat with a rival start-up called Element Zero.\nForrest says the Fortescue board was not aware of the tactic and had struggled to see how it aligned with the \ncompany's values, but he is proud of McKeiver for taking responsibility. Forrest says Fortescue will continue to \npursue the legal action.\nThe Fortescue restructure takes place against the backdrop of pressure on iron ore prices, which have fallen more \nthan 30 per cent since the start of the year as China's economy continues to struggle.\nBut Forrest says Fortescue is struggling to keep up with what he says are full order books. And while the industry \nfrets about the arrival of new iron ore production from the Simandou mine in the African nation of Guinea, Forrest \nremains sanguine, arguing that Fortescue's prospective project in Gabon gives it the ability to tap a deposit of \nbetter quality and scale.\nBut the company's ultimate trump card could be green iron; this is where low-carbon solutions such as green \nhydrogen and solar energy are used to remove waste elements from iron ore, leaving behind a product that is \nalmost pure iron.\nIndeed, Forrest is so bullish on the plan that he declares he's getting out of iron ore and into green iron.\nJAMES THOMSON\nj.thomson@afr.com\nLoad-Date: July 20, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"We are not going to swim against the tide.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"This is not to jam operating costs down, it's to streamline this organisation and keep the genius of simplicity.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"The tide is the Australian government, every government, every leader, every president, every energy minister I've met around the world in the last three years saying 'we've got to get energy prices down'.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"I'm personally disappointed that the rest of the world - particularly the 'weenies' in the traditional energy sector - are 'not seeing as clearly what I am seeing, which is that the world must turn away from fossil fuels'.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"But to get there, we're going to make sure that the supply chain's right.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"Fortescue will not 'put the horse behind the cart' by pushing ahead with green hydrogen projects where the economics don't stack up due to persistently high electricity prices.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
