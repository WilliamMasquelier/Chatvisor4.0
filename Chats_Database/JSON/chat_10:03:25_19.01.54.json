court testimony\nABC Premium News (Australia)\nApril 9, 2024 Tuesday\nCopyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved\nLength: 489 words\nHighlight: As hearings in a $500-plus million compensation case against Fortescue Metals Group resume, a \nclinical psychologist says traditional owners report significant trauma associated with mining in their community.\nBody\nA clinical psychologist has compared the impact of alcohol abuse in a West Australian remote community with the \neffects of mining on culture and heritage.\nThe landmark legal battle between the Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation (YAC) and Andrew Forrest's mining giant \nFortescue Metals Group (FMG) resumed in the Federal Court this week.\nTraditional owners are seeking more than $500 million in unpaid royalties and interest as well as damages for \ncultural and spiritual losses allegedly caused by mining.\nThe Fortescue operation at the centre of the issue is the highly profitable Solomon hub, which is in the state's north \nand has reportedly produced about $50 billion in iron ore since 2013.\nBut the miner has never had an Indigenous land use agreement with Yindjibarndi people, who have held native title \nover much of the area since 2017, meaning the miner was essentially digging without permission.\nYAC has claimed some of these cultural losses were caused by FMG's decision to back a splinter group known as \nthe Wirlu-murra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation to help progress its mining ambitions.\nMiner's impact comparable to alcohol: psychologist\nDuring a hearing on Tuesday, clinical psychologist Jeff Nelson, an Aboriginal man from Cairns, told the court the \nimpact of mining on Yindjibarndi people could be compared to the social impacts of heavy drinking.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue Metals Group's Pilbara mining activity compared to alcohol abuse in court testimony\nMany Yindjibarndi people live in the small town of Roebourne, which had a long history of social issues and alcohol \nabuse connected to the local Victoria Hotel, now closed.\nThe building has since been reclaimed by the Yindjibarndi community and used as a cultural centre.\n\"The Yindjibarndi closed down the Vic Hotel \u2026 which definitely slowed down the intake of alcohol, [but] they can't \njust say no to the ongoing mining that's happening at Solomon Hub,\" Dr Nelson said.\n\"They undertook the step, even if the outcome wasn't as successful as they would have liked, they were proactive.\"\nDr Nelson's full evidence was tendered as a written document and only elements of his evidence were talked about \nin open court, with his full evidence to be made public at a later date.\nAs part of his written evidence, Dr Nelson interviewed Yindjibarndi people, and he said in court they all described \nsignificant individual trauma, which many connected to \"the FMG experience\".\nLawyers representing the WA government, which is also a respondent, questioned whether Dr Nelson could \nrealistically gauge community views based on a relatively small number of interviews.\nIn response, Dr Nelson said many of the interviewees were community leaders and Yindjibarndi elders who could \nspeak on behalf of the broader group.\nLast year the Federal Court heard evidence on-country in the remote Pilbara from traditional owners about the toll \nthe saga had taken on the community.\nThe trial is expected to hear more evidence in the coming weeks from a range of anthropological, environmental \nand economic experts.\nLoad-Date: April 9, 2024\nEnd of
