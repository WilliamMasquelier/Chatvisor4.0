Compelling gold-copper drill targets identified at \nCoogee Gold Project\nENP Newswire\nAugust 19, 2024 Monday\nCopyright 2024 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1721 words\nBody\nJavelin Minerals Limited (ASX: JAV) ('Javelin') is pleased to announce that numerous compelling drill targets have \nbeen identified at its Coogee Gold Project in WA's Eastern Goldfields.\nJavelin engaged Core Geophysics ('Core Geo') to compile all historical open file geophysical activity (includes \ngravity, magnetics, EM, IP and DHEM surveys) related directly to the Coogee Gold Project.\nThe new targets were identified as part of an extensive review of the geophysical data commissioned by Javelin's \nnew Board and undertaken by independent geological consultants and the Javelin technical management team. \nFollowing these initial findings, the Company will prioritise the key exploration targets for drilling based on the \nmagnetic/gravity geophysics and the known identification of historic geochemical and drilling data, and generate \nnew targets. The Company has engaged OmniGeoX Pty Ltd, led by Peter Langworthy, as independent technical \nconsultant to review all the existing project drilling and geophysical data and plan an exploration drilling program to \ncommence shortly on the priority targets\nJavelin Executive Chairman Brett Mitchell said: 'We know Coogee hosts a gold system in a world-class address on \nthe edge of the famous St Ives goldfield. But despite these outstanding credentials, there has been little or no \ndrilling on so much of the tenure. These geophysical results highlight the huge upside at Coogee, with numerous \ncompelling targets identified below and around the Coogee deposit. With the new Board and Management team in \nplace and the recent fund raising completed, we are on track to start drilling these targets in the next quarter. 'At the \nsame time, we are completing an independent review and update of the existing Coogee resource, which will give \nus a solid foundation as we seek to build a substantial gold inventory within one of the world's great gold mining \nprovinces\nIntroduction\nPage 2 of 4\n-Javelin Minerals Limited - Compelling gold-copper drill targets identified at Coogee Gold Project\nThe region is considered prospective for gold mineralisation and contains a number of historical mines and mineral \noccurrences. The project is situated in a highly fertile greenstone belt with numerous gold deposits and abundant \ngold occurrences nearby. The Coogee, Salt Creek, Daisy-Milano and Lucky Bay gold deposits, plus the major St \nIves gold camp are specifically relevant to exploration of the project. The project tenements have undergone \nvarying levels of exploration with the discovery of gold in the 1800's at Hogans Find. Modern exploration \ncommenced in the 1900's by BHP who discovered the Carnilya Hill Nickel deposit. The Coogee gold deposit \nlocated within the project tenements was discovered in the mid-1990's by Sovereign Resources and was \nsubsequently mined by Ramelius Resources (ASX : RMS) in 2013. Ramelius mined an open cut pit \n(approximately 70m deep) at Coogee in 2013, with reported production of 147,400 tonnes at 4.7 g/t Au for a \nrecovered 20,400 ounces of gold. Processing was at the Burbanks Mill (conventional carbon-in-leach processing \nfacility), south of Coolgardie with metallurgical recovery of 96.4%\nGeology and Prospectivity\nThe project is located in the southern part of the Norseman - Wiluna Greenstone Belt within the Parker Domain of \nthe Kalgoorlie Terrane (Griffin and Hickman, 1988a). The project is situated in a highly fertile greenstone belt with \nnumerous gold deposits and abundant gold occurrences nearby. The Coogee, Salt Creek, Daisy-Milano and Lucky \nBay gold deposits, plus the major St Ives gold camp are specifically relevant to exploration of the project. The \nCoogee Deposit is hosted within a package of intermediate to felsic volcanics and volcaniclastics, comprising \ndacite, andesite and rhyolite lithologies. The primary mineralised zone comprises a moderately southwest dipping \nshear zone at the contact between the dacitic crystal tuff unit and a locally porphyritic andesite flow. Gold is directly \nassociated with pyrite, which is frequently intergrown with magnetite and high gold values coincide with increased \npercentages of pyrite and magnetite. Magnetite rich zones have also been intersected, but without pyrite, they do \nnot host gold mineralisation.\nCOOGEE WEST E26/177 GEOPHYSICS RESULTS AND TARGETS\nLocated immediately west of M26/477 the southern half of this tenement covers Lake Lefroy with the northern half \ncontaining widows of weathered outcrop and Cenozoic cover. Historically the Exploration Licence has been \nsporadically explored with wide spaced reconnaissance aircore drilling across the salt lake completed by Ramelius \nwith and RC and diamond drilling completed in the north by Terrain Minerals. The tenement is covered by 50m line \nspaced aeromagnetic data and variable gravity on 100m to 400m spaced lines with 100m stations. The magnetic \nimagery highlights variably magnetic northwest trending mafic and ultramafic units which are intruded by granitic \nintrusions and surrounded by sediments and intermediate to felsic tuffs. Filtered gravity provides complimentary \ninformation to the magnetics, displaying local gravity highs over ultramafic and mafic units and gravity lows over \nsediments and granitic intrusions. CG-04 Target Zone discrete untested circular magnetic anomaly of approximately \n700nT approx. 1.5km west of the Coogee Pit. This represents a higher priority drill target based on the stronger \nmagnetic response compared to the CG-01 (400nT) target zone which is known to hosts gold-copper mineralisation \nnorth of the Coogee Pit. The top of the anomaly starts from 300 vertical metres extending down to 1km in depth - no \ndrilling has tested this anomaly and represents a high-order drill Au-Cu target.\nContact:\nBrett Mitchell Paul Armstrong\nExecutive Chairman Investor Relations\nJavelin Minerals Limited Read Corporate\nEmail: info@javelinminerals.com.auPage 3 of 4\n-Javelin Minerals Limited - Compelling gold-copper drill targets identified at Coogee Gold Project\nCompetent Persons Statement\nThe information in this report that relates to Exploration Targets and Exploration Results is based on information \ncompiled by Pedro Kastellorizos.
