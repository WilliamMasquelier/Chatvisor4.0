The business, which is controlled by the Danish \ngovernment, has become one of the UK's leading developers of offshore wind, with 12 wind farms in UK waters.\nThey include Hornsea 1 and 2 off the Yorkshire coast - together comprising one of the world's largest wind farms.\nThe company produces 7pc of the UK's power and is planning further expansion including two more wind farms \nnear Hornsea and a massive floating one off Scotland. However, its ventures into new technologies and regions \nhave hit the company hard this year, with Mads Nipper, group president and chief executive of \u00d8rsted, announcing \na total of 3.9bn kroner of impairments.\nThe FlagshipONE project would have used renewable electricity to produce hydrogen that could then be combined \nwith CO2 to produce methanol.\nThe aim was to produce 55,000 tons of methanol a year, enough for one large container vessel, making it a large-\nscale pilot project.\nPage 2 of 2\nGreen fuel factory axed in net zero blow\nMr Nipper said the company had been unable to secure long-term contracts to buy its e-methanol at a viable price. \nHe said: \"The liquid e-fuel market in Europe is developing slower than expected, and we have taken the strategic \ndecision to deprioritise our efforts within the market and cease the development of FlagshipONE.\n\"We will continue our focus and development efforts within renewable hydrogen, which is essential for \ndecarbonising key industries in Europe and closer to our core business.\"\n\u00d8rsted suffered a second impairment totalling 2.1bn kroner at its Revolution wind farm project near Martha's \nVineyard, off the US east coast. Construction delays at its onshore substation are the key cause. Mr Nipper said: \n\"Despite encouraging progress on our US offshore wind project, Revolution Wind, the construction of the onshore \nsubstation for the project has been delayed.\n\"This means that we have pushed the commercial operation date from 2025 into 2026, which led to an impairment.\n\"This is, of course, unsatisfactory.\"\nThe company reported a pre-tax profit of 3.9bn kroner, up from 2.4bn kroner in the same period last year, and net \nprofits of 931m kroner.\nTancrede Fulop, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said \u00d8rsted had outperformed expectations especially in \noffshore wind, but the impairments \"underscore the impact of project delays\".\n\u00a3172m The cost of \u00d8rsted's decision to scrap the FLAGSHIPONE project in Sweden amid a lack of demand from \ncustomers\nLoad-Date: August 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Mads Nipper | Group president and chief executive of \u00d8rsted | \"The liquid e-fuel market in Europe is developing slower than expected, and we have taken the strategic decision to deprioritise our efforts within the market and cease the development of FlagshipONE.\" | N.A. |\n| Mads Nipper | Group president and chief executive of \u00d8rsted | \"Despite encouraging progress on our US offshore wind project, Revolution Wind, the construction of the onshore substation for the project has been delayed.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
