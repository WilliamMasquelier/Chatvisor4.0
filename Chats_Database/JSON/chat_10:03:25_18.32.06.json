Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Hayden Bairstow | Analyst at Argonaut | \"The upgrades for the mid-cap producers are mixed. Lower cost producers Capricorn and Ramelius see modest upgrades of 13 per cent and 15 per cent for FY25, while Bellevue's earnings forecast rises 19 per cent.\" | N.A. |\n| Patrick Streater | Analyst at Argonaut | \"Our bullish outlook for the yellow metal and material upgrades to our earnings outlook underpins our shift to a positive view across all stocks in the sector.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Ramelius Resources.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Ramelius Resources or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
