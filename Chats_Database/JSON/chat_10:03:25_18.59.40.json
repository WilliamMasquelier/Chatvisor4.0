The energy division now includes UK technology business WAE, which booked revenue of \nabout $US26m for the year.\nFortescue's policy is to pay out 50 to 80 per cent of its net profit in dividends, and the mid-range payment comes \nas the company looks to ramp up spending on its Pilbara iron ore mines and its green energy projects.\nThe iron ore giant spent $US1.52bn on capital projects in the first half, with about $US1bn of that on sustaining \ncapital for its existing Pilbara mines. Another $US165m was spent on Fortescue Energy projects, and $US104m on \ndecarbonising the company's iron ore operations. Fortescue says it expects to spend $US3.3bn to $US3.7bn in \ncapital for the full financial year. Its shares closed 2.1 per cent higher at $27.83.\nLoad-Date: February 22, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
