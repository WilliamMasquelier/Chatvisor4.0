It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nGreen iron battle: Fortescue raided former staff to investigate 'IP theft'\nGreen iron battle: Fortescue raided former staff to investigate 'IP theft'\n \nProactive Investors (AU)\nAugust 8, 2024 Thursday 05:15 AM EST\nCopyright 2024 Proactive UK Ltd All Rights Reserved\nLength: 434 words\nByline: Meagan Evans\nBody\nFortescue Ltd (ASX:FMG) claims it would be impossible for rival green iron venture, Element Zero, to deliver an \noperational green iron prototype without the mining giant's proprietary technology.\nThe Andrew Forrest-led mining giant has accused former employees, CFO Michael Masterman and scientists Bart \nKolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen, of intellectual property theft, arguing the defendants relied on its \nproprietary technology to advance Element Zero.\nIn May, Fortescue obtained secret court orders to raid the scientists' homes and Element Zero's office and factory \nunits. \nFollowing a suppression order battle, the Federal Court last week released documents that include affidavits filed by \nFortescue as the company prepared for the surprise raids.\nThose affidavits include two from Paul Dewar, the principal lawyer at Fortescue's representatives, Davies Collison \nCave Law. Dewar disclosed that Fortescue had instructed Lancasters Investigations to conduct surveillance on \nKolodziejczyk, Winther-Jensen and a third individual to establish their identities and locations.\nThe surveillance included detailed observations, such as Winther-Jensen watering his garden and following a \nwoman into a shopping centre. Despite a search order granted by Justice Melissa Perry permitting raids on \nKolodziejczyk's home, Dewar's affidavit revealed that the investigators also spied on properties owned by Michael \nMasterman, who was not targeted by the search orders.\nPage 2 of 2\nGreen iron battle: Fortescue raided former staff to investigate 'IP theft'\nAn affidavit from a solicitor for Element Zero, Kolodziejczyk and Masterman, highlighted concerns over the invasive \nnature of the surveillance and the extensive data capture during the search orders. Williams said around three \nterabytes of data were seized, containing confidential and privileged information that was unrelated to the case.\nUpon discovering the surveillance, Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest expressed his surprise and warned the FMG \nlegal team. \nA new affidavit, from mining and engineering consultant Wayne McFaull, asserts that Element Zero's rapid progress \ncould only be attributed to having access to Fortescue's design documents from January 2023. \nMcFaull claims that Element Zero's $5 million research fund was not enough for the level of research and \ndevelopment they achieved. He said, \"Projects in the nature and complexity of the Fortescue project and the \nElement Zero project take a great deal of trial and error.\"\nElement Zero has denied Fortescue's claims and is challenging the private search and seizure orders. A \npreliminary hearing in the Federal Court was set for today, with the full hearing scheduled from August 18.\nLoad-Date: August 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
