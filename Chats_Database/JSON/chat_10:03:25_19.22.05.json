The index has lost 0.26% for the last five days, but \nsits 1.65% below its 52-week high.\nBottom-performing stocks in this index are Fortescue Ltd (ASX:FMG) and Arcadium Lithium Plc, down \n9.88% and 5.87% respectively. \nLooking at the sectors, Consumer Discretionary was in the green today gaining 0.15%. Consumer Staples gained \n0.11%.\nThe worst-performed sector was Materials down 1.93%. Energy which lost 0.71%.\nOver in small caps, the S&P/ASX Small Ordinaries dropped 0.63% to 3,002.90. Over the past five days, it is 1.07% \nlower.\nFortescue shares plunge\nFortescue took a hammering today as major institutional investors exit the stock, with a major $1.85 billion block \ntrade occurring at $18.55 per share. The company lost $5 billion in market capitalisation. Over the past six months, \nthe stock has decreased by 37%.\nPage 2 of 3\nFIVE at FIVE AU: ASX trims losses as Fortescue takes a hammering\nThe Financial Review indicated that fund managers were searching for buyers in the range of $18.55 to $19.10 per \nshare, reflecting an 8.8% to 6.1% discount compared to Monday's closing price.\nFortescue is currently grappling with various issues, including lower-than-expected guidance, increased capital \nexpenditures and potential pressure on its dividend policy due to weaker earnings forecasts.\nAnalysts are pessimistic about the stock, expecting its valuation premium over BHP and Rio Tinto to diminish. They \nalso highlight ongoing execution risks and concerns over low-grade iron ore.\nImpact of US earnings season\nSaira Malik, chief investment officer of Nuveen, has shared her perspectives on the impact of the US earnings \nseason on markets and portfolio strategies for investors seeking solid fundamentals and exposure to major themes \nand trends.\nMalik highlights the ongoing volatility in the US political and economic landscape, which may steady slightly as Vice \nPresident Kamala Harris has secured the Democratic presidential nomination and is now selecting potential running \nmates.\nThe second quarter earnings results have been mixed, with Tesla and Alphabet underperforming, signalling that the \nbenefits of artificial intelligence (AI) may already be factored into technology stocks. Additionally, there is ongoing \ndebate over whether the recent shift from momentum and growth stocks to small caps will continue.\nIn terms of portfolio considerations, Malik suggests that publicly listed global infrastructure is a valuable asset class, \nparticularly given the potential for increased market volatility in the second half of 2024. Infrastructure offers solid \nfundamentals and an opportunity to engage with significant themes such as the growth of generative AI and the \ntrend towards onshoring and nearshoring manufacturing operations.\nInvesting in data centres and electric power-generating developers is crucial to support the growing demand for \ngenerative AI, requiring significant investment in new power-generating capacities globally, especially favouring \nrenewable technologies.\nElectric distribution utilities are expected to benefit from an expanding customer base, spreading fixed costs over \nmore users, which allows for further investment and reduced costs for end-users. Utilities also trade at a \nconsiderable discount to the S&P 500 Index, offering additional investment opportunities.\nFive at five\nStrickland Metals sees Warmblood emerge as substantial system with 1.4-kilometre gold trend unlocked\nA significant high-grade gold intercept at the Warmblood prospect of Strickland Metals Ltd (ASX:STK) within the \n100%-owned Horse Well Project in Western Australia's Yandal Greenstone belt has unlocked a 1.4-kilometre gold \ntrend.\nRead more\nTamboran Resources raises additional US$7.4 million from NYSE IPO in partial exercise of over-allotment \noption\nTamboran Resources Corporation (NYSE:TBN, ASX:TBN) has added an additional US$7.4 million to the war chest \nafter the underwriters of its initial public offering (IPO) to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) exercised an over-\nallotment option to purchase 308,750 shares at US$24.00 per share.\nRead more\nPoseidon Nickel gold exploration highlights greenfields potential for multiple commoditiesPage 3 of 3\nFIVE at FIVE AU: ASX trims losses as Fortescue takes a hammering\nPoseidon Nickel Ltd (ASX:POS, OTC:PSDNF) continues to demonstrate the greenfields potential of its Windarra, \nLake Johnston and Black Swan projects in Western Australia outside of their nickel resources with ongoing \nexploration highlighting gold prospectivity.\nRead more\nRace Oncology RC110 bisantrene treatment meets efficacy goals in Phase 2 acute myeloid leukaemia trial\nRace Oncology Ltd (ASX:RAC, OTC:RAONF) welcomes results from an investigator-sponsored Phase 1b/2 trial of \nRC110 bisantrene for the treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), which exceeded the predetermined efficacy \nthreshold with a 40% response rate.\nRead more\nBrookside Energy at \"pivotal moment\" with FMDP completion underway; production within three months\nBrookside Energy Ltd (ASX:BRK, OTC:RDFEF) has reached a \"pivotal moment\" in its history with multi-well \ncompletion operations underway at the Flames-Maroons Development Plan (FMDP) in the southern SCOOP Play \nin Oklahoma's Anadarko Basin and production within three months.\nRead more\nOn your six\nPerseus Mining produces more than 120,000 ounces of gold in June quarter; almost 510,000 ounces in FY \n2024\nPerseus Mining Ltd (ASX:PRU, TSX:PRU, OTC:PMNXF) recorded another strong quarter at its West African \noperations with 120,929 ounces of gold produced in the June quarter at an All-in-Site Cost (AISC) of US$1,173 per \nounce.\nRead more\nThe one to watch\nIondrive confirms DES technology viability in large-scale trials\nIondrive Ltd (ASX:ION) CEO Ebbe Dommisse joins Jonathan Jackson in the Proactive studio to discuss the \nsuccessful completion of large-scale bench trials at the University of Adelaide, marking a significant milestone for its \ndeep-eutectic solvent (DES) battery recycling technology.\nWatch\nLoad-Date: July 30, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\nNone\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
