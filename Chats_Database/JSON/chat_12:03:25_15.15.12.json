Of them, 77 per cent were worried corporate information entered into AI apps could be shared \npublicly or with competitors, while 69 per cent were concerned it could hurt their legal or intellectual property rights.\n\"As we do security awareness training, we now need to focus on that narrative on AI as well,\" Ms Vermaak said.\n\"Where organisations are unsure, they've banned it. What that tells me is a lot of organisations are looking to put \nthe controls in place, are looking to educate, message and see where they can improve their processes before \nallowing it. My sense would be over the next few years we will see that decreasing.\" While bigger companies have \nsigned up to tailored enterprise AI products, like Microsoft's Copilot, which has guardrails built in to protect \ncorporate data, others do not have a clear strategy, with employees at some using publicly available AI platforms, \nsometimes without their managers' knowledge.\n\"One of the examples in our framework is that when an employee uses any generative AI tool, they have to actually \ndisclose it. And, and that's a really important thing, because it changes the perception of the receiver of that work,\" \nMs Vermaak said.\nPage 2 of 2\nCompanies ban AI over privacy concerns: Cisco\n\"There's two things that organisations and companies need to start with. That is the education part, which is \ncritically important. And then putting in policies and frameworks to put guardrails up for when is it OK to use it.\n\" 'Can I use ChatGPT? Yes, you can use it for private things on your work device, but you can't use it for any work-\nrelated matters' if that is what the company's risk acceptance is.\" The Productivity Commission also found that low \nlevels of public trust in AI technologies could pose a \"significant barrier\" to uptake. But, it said governments should \nact as \"exemplars\" to demonstrate the safe and effective uses of AI in service delivery. Collete Stallbaumer, general \nmanager of Microsoft 365, said it was still early days and companies were moving at different speeds.\nLoad-Date: February 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**PERSON**: [Full Name]\n**ROLE**: [Person's role or position]\n**CONTEXT**: [Brief description of how the person is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**PERSON**: Elon Musk\n**ROLE**: CEO of Tesla and SpaceX\n**CONTEXT**: Primary subject of article, discussing company strategy\n\nOnly include people who play a meaningful role in the article's content.
