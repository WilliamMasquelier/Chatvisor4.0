They're busy restoring Australia's native oyster and mussel reefs. \nAlongside the high-profile national Reef Builder campaign, community groups have become inspired to do their bit, \nin their own backyards. \nFortunately there's more than one way to rebuild a reef. And you don't have to think small. \nFrom humble beginnings, a community-driven project in Queensland's Moreton Bay has grown into an ambitious \nplan to restore 100 hectares of oyster reef over the next ten years. This would make it the largest oyster reef \nrestoration project in the Southern Hemisphere. \nWhy are we bringing back shellfish reefs?\nJust 200 years ago, Australia's coastline was home to billions upon billions of oysters and mussels, forming reefs \nthat stretched thousands of kilometres. They filled the sheltered waters of bays and estuaries from the southern \nGreat Barrier Reef to Tasmania and all the way around to Perth. These thriving marine ecosystems provided food, \nshelter and water filtration, as well as coastline protection from stormy seas. \nBut today, our shellfish reefs are near extinct. Oyster dredges scraped reef after reef from the seafloor throughout \nthe 19th century. Oysters and mussels were harvested for food. Their shells were ground up to make roads and \ncement. Now only degraded remnants and individual oysters remain from what was once a continent-wide marine \nempire. \nPage 2 of 3\nHow a filmmaker, a pile of old shells and a bunch of amateurs are bringing our oyster reefs back\nFortunately, Australia's shellfish ecosystems were rediscovered this century. Researchers used historical records \nincluding newspaper clippings to work out how many oysters were taken and where from. \nCommunity interest grew as the scale of the loss became clear. Coastal communities could see the benefits of \nshellfish and wanted to bring them back. \nIt turns out the baby oysters are still there, bobbing around in the ocean, just looking for a place to live. \nHow do you build a shellfish reef?\nThere's more than one way to rebuild shellfish reefs. \nIf you have earth-moving equipment and lots of money, you can start from the ground up. \nLimestone rubble can provide the firm foundation for baby oysters to settle and grow. \nThat's how Australia's largest oyster reef restorations are built. Construction began in 2015.\nWindara Reef now spans 20 hectares in the coastal waters of Gulf St Vincent, near Ardrossan on the Yorke \nPeninsula in South Australia. \nThrough a national campaign led by The Nature Conservancy, reefs have been built at 23 locations this way. They \nplan to hit a target of 60 reef ecosystems by 2030. \nBut if you don't have cranes, trucks and the money it costs to build reefs from stone, there is another way. Baby \noysters can simply settle and grow on the shells of old oysters, if they're clumped together. \nFishing filmmaker's bright idea\nWhen former filmmaker Robbie Porter of Wynnum in Queensland heard about a small reef restoration project in the \nNoosa River, he wanted to do something closer to home. He approached fish conservation non-profit OzFish \nUnlimited with an idea for a smaller-scale, hands-on approach to reef building.\nHe devised a structure people could use to build their own reefs - one that's light enough to be carried to a boat and \ndropped over the side. \nThese wire mesh cages, called \"robust oyster baskets\", are filled with sterile, recycled oyster shells. The structure \nensures the shell to be held together for a few years, until the reef is established. \nOnce the baby oysters find a good place to settle, they cement themselves to it. As they grow, they fuse with other \noysters. After two or three years, the wire cage rusts away and you're left with an \"oyster bommie\", which looks like \nsome of the few remaining reefs that still exist in undeveloped areas. \nThe Moreton Bay project established a major recycling facility to collect used oyster shells from local restaurants \nand oyster shucking facilities. The shells are then sterilised in the sun, washed and sorted before being placed into \nthe baskets. \nAs knowledge and support has grown, so has the ambition of these projects. Now reconstruction is taking place on \nan industrial scale. And Porter is now employed full time as OzFish Shellfish Revolution Senior Special Projects \nOfficer. \nAfter six years, the project has amassed more than 23,000 volunteer hours, collected more than 800,000kg of shell \nfor processing and placed more than 7,000 oyster bommies into Moreton Bay. These can be found mainly around \nthe Port of Brisbane but also at 11 other locations in Southeast Queensland. Page 3 of 3\nHow a filmmaker, a pile of old shells and a bunch of amateurs are bringing our oyster reefs back\nThe idea has caught on. Community and OzFish groups in Queensland, South Australia and Victoria have all \nstarted their own projects growing oysters in baskets. Two projects are also planned for New South Wales.\nA test bed for research\nAcademics and research students from various Australian universities have also been involved along the way. They \nhave established scientific monitoring programs and laboratory experiments to examine progress. This knowledge \nhelps validate restoration activities while allowing researchers to make new discoveries. \nResearchers are monitoring shellfish health, dissecting the biodiversity of the baskets, studying how fish use these \nreefs, and working towards understanding the reef's capacity to filter water.  \nResearch in Victoria has also shown shell recycling is an effective way not only to collect material for restoring \nshellfish reefs, but also to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill - and even published a step-by-step guide to \nestablishing shell recycling.\nShellfish restoration at scale\nAustralians love the coast and millions of people fish along it every year. This is a potential army of conservation \nvolunteers. But many people don't know these projects exist, or how to get involved. \nThe Moreton Bay Shellfish Reef Restoration project has enabled more than 600 people to engage in nature repair, \nwhile building a sense of community. This was a first of its type in the world and it won't be the last. Projects are \npopping up all around Australia. \nThe model replicates the success of the Landcare movement, with local groups delivering local outcomes \nsupported by expert advisers and academic researchers. \nBringing people together around a shared vision for a healthier future also has welcome side effects. Many of our \nvolunteers have discovered a new sense of purpose and optimism. \nBy recreating our long-lost and almost forgotten shellfish reefs, we have rediscovered ourselves.\nThis story is part of Making a Difference, a new series on community efforts to restore nature.
