Fortescue executives presented the \ncompany's quarterly production report to investors yesterday.\nThe Forrest family owns 36.74 per cent of Fortescue, which has pivoted to clean energy in the past five years.\nSquadron bought 75 per cent of wind power developer Windlab in 2020, under a deal that meant Federation Asset \nManagement owned the remaining 25 per cent. Windlab has been developing wind farms, including the \nundeveloped Prairie and Wongalee wind projects in Queensland.\nA Windlab subsidiary - Wongalee Renewable Energy Farm - applied to federal environment regulators last year for \npermission to install 175 wind turbine generators across 48,000 hectares of land near Hughenden.\nWindlab's shareholding in the Wongalee subsidiary was transferred to Australian Fortescue Future Industries on \nFebruary 23 - the day after Fortescue's half-year financial results were released. Fortescue has not mentioned the \nacquisition of the Wongalee project in any market filings.\nOwnership of the Prairie wind farm has followed a similar path.\nA Windlab subsidiary - Prairie Renewable Energy Farm - applied to regulators in 2022 for permission to build 116 \nwind turbines near Hughenden. But documents lodged with the corporate regulator show that, on February 23, \nWindlab's ownership of the subsidiary was transferred to Australian Fortescue Future Industries.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrests' wind farms sold to Fortescue after blow to hydrogen plan\nThe closest Fortescue has come to disclosing its connection to the Prairie and Wongalee projects was in \nNovember 2022, when the company issued a press release - but not a market filing - that said Fortescue would \n\"partner\" with Windlab on a renewables \"super hub\" that included the two projects.\nThat statement did not say that Fortescue would take ownership of the two wind farms, or whether the company \nwould help fund construction.\nThe Wongalee and Prairie wind projects have not been mentioned in Fortescue's annual report, financial results or \ncapital spending schedules in the 20 months since the November 2022 press release.\nAsked about the wind farms yesterday, Fortescue energy boss Mark Hutchinson said the company had originally \nthought they could supply clean energy to its proposed green hydrogen projects in Queensland.\nFortescue will not build any large-scale green hydrogen projects in Queensland any time soon and its small \nhydrogen project at Gladstone will purchase power from the grid.\nMr Hutchinson said the wind farms could be \"repurposed\" to supply power into the national electricity grid, but that \nwould probably require the Queensland government to build the CopperString electricity transmission project \nbetween Townsville and Mt Isa.\nMr Hutchinson said Fortescue would not incur any significant spending on Wongalee nor Prairie \"for a few years\" \nat least.\nASIC filings suggest Australian Fortescue Future Industries acquired Wongalee and Prairie for an initial \npeppercorn price of $1 each. It is understood the agreement between Windlab and Fortescue would see further \npayments made to Windlab if certain construction and energy generation milestones are achieved.\nWindlab has said construction on the wind farms could begin as soon as 2025, with first power as early as 2027. \nHowever, Mr Hutchinson hosed down those expectations, saying yesterday that it was \"very early days\".\nLoad-Date: July 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Peter Ker, Brad Thompson\nDate: July 26, 2024\nTitle: Forrests' wind farms sold to Fortescue after blow to hydrogen plan\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Surging iron ore mining costs plague Fortescue's year ahead\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Peter Ker\n### Date: July 26, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nSurging iron ore mining costs plague Fortescue's year ahead\nSurging iron ore mining costs plague Fortescue's year ahead\nAustralian Financial Review\nJuly 26, 2024 Friday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Further cost pressures are expected; the amount of waste rock Fortescue digs up to access \nsaleable iron ore - known as the \"strip ratio\" - is expected to be higher over the next four years.\nFortescue mining boss Dino Otranto said the need to move more waste rock was a factor driving costs higher. \n\"Strip ratios are increasing over the mid term,\" he told investors yesterday.\nResources companies are also being hit with requests for higher wages and escalating energy costs.\nAsked about the job cuts, Mr Otranto said Fortescue had \"always maintained the leanest structure possible to \nmake sure we are competitive and the leading [unit cost] player in the market\".\nFortescue chief financial officer Apple Paget said the miner would also use technology and innovation to mitigate \nrising costs at the mines.

It shipped 192 million tonnes in the previous financial year.\nThe decline in volumes was caused by the derailment of an ore car in December. Fortescue tried to make up for \nthat outage with a fast finish to the financial year; the export rate over the past three months was higher than ever.\nAnalyst consensus, measured by Bloomberg, suggests Fortescue is on track to post a $US6.11 billion ($9.3 billion) \nunderlying profit next month, up from $US5.5 billion last year.\nThe promise to ship up to 200 million tonnes in the next year includes a target for the struggling Iron Bridge \nmagnetite project in WA of between 5 million and 9 million tonnes.

To sustain the dividend policy, we believe \nFMG may need to increase gearing,\" Macquarie said in a client note on Friday.\nGoldman Sachs analyst Paul Young noted the company's capital spending was increasing to maintain production at \nsome of its older mines, and it may need to ramp up spending again if new green hydrogen projects in Norway and \nBrazil - now going through feasibility studies - are given the green light by the company's board.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue's green expenditure could put pressure on dividends\n\"We continue to think Fortescue is at an inflection point on capital allocation, and to fund the ambitious strategy, we \nassume the company reduces the dividend payout ratio from the current 65 per cent in the second half of FY24 to \nabout 50 per cent from FY25 onwards - the bottom end of the 50 to 80 per cent guidance,\" he said.\nFortescue narrowly missed its annual export targets, shipping 191.6 million tonnes for the year, below the bottom \nend of its 192 to 197 million tonne guidance range.\nBut after Fortescue's troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project again missed expected export rates, the company only \ncame close to its overall export target after shipping far higher quantities of a lower-grade product known as super \nspecial fines, which made up more than half of its record June quarter exports.\nThe iron ore major says it expects Iron Bridge to ramp up production rates of 5 to 9 million tonnes this financial \nyear, after shipments of only 1.2 million -tonnes in the year ending June 30.\nBut Fortescue has also wi-dened its overall export guidance target, flagging shipments of 190 to 200 million \ntonnes.\nThat suggests shipments from some of its hematite mines could taper off this year, according to Morgans analyst \nAdrian Prendergast. \"Management denied this view, commenting that changes in FY25 will only be minor, but the \nfacts are hard to dismiss,\" he said.\n\"The lack of commentary makes it hard to identify the drivers of the change, but it is clear that FMG has been \npushing some of its ageing mines hard with strip ratios rising and the need for increased mine replacement \ninvariably -increasing.\" While Mr Prendergast said he still expects Fortescue to maintain dividend yields above \nthose of its competitors, softening iron ore prices could put pressure on shareholder payouts. \"Fortescue maintains \na healthy balance sheet, but its capex-heavy mine replacement, decarbonisation, and sustainability investments are \nplacing an increasing load on its base iron ore business in terms of capital requirements,\" he said.
