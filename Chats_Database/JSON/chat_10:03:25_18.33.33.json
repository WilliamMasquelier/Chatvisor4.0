It's just the latest in a string of takeover plays in the sector both in \nAustralia and abroad as companies look to size up on the back of record high gold prices.\nIn Australia last week two of the biggest gold companies, Northern Star Resources announced a scrip-only merger \nwith De Grey Mining - which is yet to produce a bar of gold - in a proposed deal to create a $5bn miner.\nJust today, West Australian gold explorer Spartan Resources announced a $220m capital raising, which it said was \nfor exploration and mine development. The company is building up a war chest after itself being the target of fellow \nminer Ramelius Resources, which grabbed 17.9 per cent of its shares in a surprise raid in July.\nOne of the nation's biggest market makers said there \"probably\" will be more consolidation to take place in the short \nterm. He would not be named for the article.\n\"We think it makes sense,\" the unnamed fund manager said. \"There's a big premium for size. Larger companies \ntrade at higher multiples.\" Companies such as Remelius, Genesis Minerals, and Westgold Resources are potential \nbidders of targets such as Spartan, as well as Vault Minerals and Pantoro, which his firm holds shares in.\nSharing his prediction of takeovers aplenty in the gold industry is funds firm Capital Outcomes.\n\"We anticipate further consolidation is likely to occur in the Australian gold market,\" said Capital Outcomes chief \ninvestment officer Emanuel Datt \"We expect most of the consolidation to occur amongst the Australian mid-tier gold \nplayers.\" Mr Datt predicts the hunters will be Ramelius, Westgold and Perseus Mining and their targets could be \nSpartan Resources, Bellevue Gold and Predictive Discovery.\nGold is hot right now (as a pop starlet might say) because the global markets believe risks are rising. Gold is viewed \nas an investment safe haven in a world where the conflict in the Middle East has never looked further from ending, \nPage 2 of 2\nPOPSTAR DIGGING FOR BIG BULLIONS\nthe war in Ukraine continues, and as markets try to predict which countries US president-elect Donald Trump may \nchoose to either punish or praise.\nIn addition, many central banks, like the People's Bank of China have been buying gold to diversify their holdings \naway from US bond markets.\nPredicted interest rate cuts in Australia and globally may lead to a further hike in the gold prices as investors look to \nescape falling yields from bonds.\n\"Gold prices remain high with a strong fundamental outlook,\" said Mr Datt. The price of gold hit new record highs \nseveral times this year - reaching US$2,790 in October. Although it's eased since then, the price is still significantly \nhigher than its usual trading range for the previous few years.\nFor gold companies looking for the scale they need to attract the attention of large investors - this bullish outlook \ngives them the confidence to make capital plays that might otherwise seem too risky.\n\"We have observed an increase in risk appetite amongst the acquirers, case in point being Northern Star acquiring \nDe Greys, which holds a large orebody with a complex processing flowsheet,\" said Mr Datt.\nThe fact that even exploration-only miners are starting to attract greater attention also reflects the increased \ndifficulty of starting new mines. Four months ago, West Australian gold miner Regis Resources, had a $1bn project \nin NSW blocked by Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek in a surprise Indigenous heritage ruling.\nGoldman Sachs Australia Head of Metals & Mining Gavi Friedland, believes the balance is shifting toward \ncompanies that already have mines or project approvals in place.\n\"We may now see this materialise in an environment where Capital Outcomes chief investment officer says it is \ngenerally cheaper to 'buy vs. build',\" said Goldman Sachs Australia Head of Metals & Mining Gavi Friedland.\nIt augers well for former Melbounian Ms Valance. The firm she part owns with hubby Mr Candy -- Metals \nExploration - expects to produce 80,000 ounces of gold from its mines in the Philippines this year and its target \ncompany Condor owns gold mines in Nicaragua. The former actress and singer seems to have a great track record \nwith timing, starring in Neighbours in its prime, sticking to just one very well timed pop album, marrying a property \nmogul and backing Donad Trump.\nLoad-Date: December 20, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Emanuel Datt | Chief Investment Officer, Capital Outcomes | \"We anticipate further consolidation is likely to occur in the Australian gold market.\" | N.A. |\n| Emanuel Datt | Chief Investment Officer, Capital Outcomes | \"We expect most of the consolidation to occur amongst the Australian mid-tier gold players.\" | N.A. |\n| Emanuel Datt | Chief Investment Officer, Capital Outcomes | \"Mr Datt predicts the hunters will be Ramelius, Westgold and Perseus Mining and their targets could be Spartan Resources, Bellevue Gold and Predictive Discovery.\" | N.A. |\n| Gavi Friedland | Head of Metals & Mining, Goldman Sachs Australia | \"We may now see this materialise in an environment where Capital Outcomes chief investment officer says it is generally cheaper to 'buy vs. build'.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
