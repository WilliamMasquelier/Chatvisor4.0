But Dr Forrest said on \nThursday he was confident its efforts in winning access to global energy projects, and technology investments such \nas its acquisition of Williams Advanced Engineering (now Fortescue Zero), would still deliver returns to Fortescue \nshareholders.\n\"If I could spend the amount of capital you're speculating about, to create a future for this company that will multiply \nits share price, I would do it every day of the week. There's no way we could have got that out of just doing more of \nthe same,\" he said.\nFortescue Zero delivers a small revenue stream to the ASX-listed company, but not one of its other energy \ninvestments has delivered a commercial return. But Dr Forrest said Fortescue's forays into designing ammonia-\npowered ships, battery-operated trains and future green hydrogen and ammonia production would eventually \ndeliver returns to shareholders.\n\"You can see the business we're now starting in shipping, in trucking, in rail, in green iron, in shipping green \nelectrons into western Europe. These businesses are all available to us because of that investment,\" he said.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue's dream alive despite losses\nFortescue's green dream foundered on energy costs, with the global surge in pricing after Russia's invasion of \nUkraine - and the massive post-pandemic cost inflation for major projects - effectively ending the cheap electricity \nneeded to make hydrogen a viable energy source.\nDr Forrest rejects suggestions that Fortescue has forever abandoned its ambition of turning hydrogen into a global \nseaborne commodity equivalent to LNG, but says in the short term Fortescue will instead look to build solar and \nwind projects that will help drive down energy costs to eventually make hydrogen and green ammonia viable.\nThat would start with powering Fortescue's Pilbara iron ore operations, he said, but would eventually extend to \ngrid-scale renewable energy projects - potentially putting Fortescue in competition with Dr Forrest's private \nrenewables company, Squadron Energy.\n\"First of all you've got to look at the home base. We need gigawatts of our own (renewable -energy) first, and \nFortescue will be now looking at opportunities across Western Australia, across the eastern states, to generate \nelectricity,\" he said.\n\"Our purpose is always to value-add. So if we can go to carbon-free iron ore, and carbon-free metals, we will make \nmuch, much better returns on this sunk capital we already have than just selling into the National Electricity Market \non the east coast - but if those opportunities arise, we're going to take them.\" Building solar and wind to power the \ncompany's Pilbara iron ore operations is a key part of Fortescue's goal of achieving \"real zero\" emissions by 2030 - \na goal Dr Forrest says the company is \"absolutely\" committed to.\nBut even that will require substantial capital spending and, while Fortescue's retreat from its hydrogen ambitions \nwas welcomed by market analysts on Thursday, MST Marquee analyst Saul Kavonic said the company might also \nbe forced to accept its 2030 zero-emissions target is unrealistic.\n\"This signals Fortescue Future Industries has failed. Despite the overwhelming evidence it would be unviable from \nthe get-go, Fortescue persisted with its green hydrogen ambitions, spending hundreds of millions and lambasting \ncritics, until only now finally admitting defeat,\" Mr Kavonic said.\n\"Fortescue's 2030 zero-emissions target should prove to be the next stubborn ambition they wind back, as it also \nappears im-possible.\" Fortescue executives who raised concerns about the mogul's green hydrogen ambitions \ndeserved an apology, Mr Kavonic added.\n\"Fortescue Future Industries has become the Fortescue Future Failure. Its failure was seen as inevitable by most \nfolks in the energy industry from the start, given how uncompetitive green hydrogen economics are. It's remarkable \nthat Fortescue took so long to figure it out themselves,\" Mr -Kavonic said. \"All the Fortescue leaders and staff who \nwere pushed out for telling the truth about Fortescue's green hydrogen ambitions deserve an apology.\" UBS \nanalyst Lachlan Shaw said in a client note that Fortescue's hydrogen retreat was welcome, given expectations the \nhydrogen strategy would suck up cash as the iron ore price retreated later this decade.\n\"We had long been cautious about green hydrogen on better alternatives,\" he said. \"\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The capital discipline \nimplied in the narrowing and slowing of Fortescue's push into green hydrogen is welcome.\" Fortescue shares \nclosed down 32c to $22.04 on Thursday.\nLoad-Date: July 18, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
