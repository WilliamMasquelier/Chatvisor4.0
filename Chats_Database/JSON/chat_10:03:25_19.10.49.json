Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 688 words\nHighlight: The billionaire mining magnate's company hired private investigators amid allegations of stolen \nintellectual property.\nBody\nBillionaire Andrew Forrest's company Fortescue hired private investigators to spy on former staff and their family \nmembers, including children, for weeks before raids took place on their homes and offices, amid allegations of \nstolen intellectual property.\nFortescue has taken legal action in the Federal Court against three former employees: Michael Masterman, Bart \nKolodziejczyk and also Bjorn Winther-Jensen. It has accused the men of copying and taking the company's \nintellectual property when they left to start a rival green iron project, called Element Zero.\nLink to Image\nAlex Ellinghausen\nThe men have denied the allegations. Masterman, who is Element Zero's chief executive, has called Fortescue's \nclaims \"spurious\" and said that their \"green metals technology was developed independently of and is very different \nfrom anything that Fortescue is doing or has done in this space\".\nFortescue secured court orders to raid the offices and homes of the men from mid-May. An independent lawyer \nwas present, and a computer expert was allowed to search and copy any electronic devices, including family \nmembers' computers, while also being required to hand over all passwords and passcodes.\nDocuments released by the Federal Court late on Wednesday, which were previously suppressed, revealed that a \npsychologist was required to attend if a child was present during the raids.\nIn the weeks before those raids, which stretched from Victoria to Western Australia, private investigators were hired \nto spy on and trail Kolodziejczyk and also Winther-Jensen, and provide a report to independent lawyers. The \nlawyers required that report before a search warrant from the Federal Court could be obtained.\nThe extent of that spying in the investigator's report included photographs and Google Maps images of both men's \nprivate residences, floor plans, and also photographs of their wives and children.\nKolodziejczyk, a former hydrogen specialist at Fortescue Future Industries, who lives in Melbourne with his wife \nand five-year-old child, travels frequently to Perth, where Element Zero is headquartered.\nPage 2 of 2\nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue spied on former staff and their families\nPrivate investigators reported observing him at home with his family, noting where his home office was, and \nfollowed him on one occasion to Melbourne airport when he departed on a business trip.\nThe investigators, unable to ascertain Kolodziejczyk's destination, deployed a team to pick up the trail at Perth \nairport, expecting that was where Kolodziejczyk was headed. They were wrong.\nWhile Kolodziejczyk was away on that trip the investigators continued to spy on his family. \"In the meantime, \nsurveillance continues at the Hadfield, Victoria residence, where Dr Kolodziejczyk's wife and child are permanently \nresiding,\" investigators noted.\nKolodziejczyk is a co-founder and chief technology officer of Element Zero.\nWinther-Jensen, who ceased being a director at Element Zero in January, was observed by investigators going to \nthe gym, shopping and watering plants. There were also photographs of his wife and 16-year-old daughter in the \ninvestigator's reports, as well as records of when his daughter left and arrived home from school.\nWinther-Jensen continues to work with Kolodziejczyk and Masterman at another company.\nElement Zero was formed by Kolodziejczyk and Masterman at the end of 2022. Masterman has had a long career \nin the energy industry, including as Fortescue Future Industries' chief financial officer.\nElement Zero said it wants to reduce the carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry. It \nhas patented a technology that aims to convert metal ores to metals, not only iron ore, with zero carbon emissions.\nFortescue said it would \"vigorously\" defend its intellectual property in the development of cutting-edge solutions to \ndecarbonise its Australian iron ore operations by the end of the decade.\n\"As a first mover, our intellectual property is critical to our ongoing success in this pursuit and must be protected at \nall times,\" a Fortescue spokesperson said.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.
