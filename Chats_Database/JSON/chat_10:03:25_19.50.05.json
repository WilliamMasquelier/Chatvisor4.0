On Monday the Greens \nsenator called for a \"full and frank inquiry\" into Creative Australia's decision to withdraw its selection of Khaled \nSabsabi as Australia's artist representative to the Venice Biennale 2026.\nMany of you will never have heard of Sabsabi, or the Venice Biennale, or Creative Australia, an agency rat-holed in \nthe nether reaches of government and armed with wheelbarrows of taxpayer slush. Yes, some of you might even \nhave thrown your iPads across the room at the temerity of our suggestion that a Greens senator might actually be \nright about something. Because they never are.\nBut it's true, there really should be an inquiry into Sabsabi's humiliating board retraction and it should also probe the \nideological capture that's hijacked decision-making at Creative Australia.\nThe agency's CEO, Adrian Collette, will appear before a Senate Estimates hearing next week to talk more about \nthat.\nIn the meantime, the fallout from this affair keeps expanding. Staff have walked out of Creative Australia offices. \nArtists have huffed and torn their smocks and signed petitions in protest (which never, ever happens). Lindy Lee \nresigned from the Creative Australia board despite reiterating her support for Sabsabi to be nixxed in her exit letter - \na decision in which she participated, after all.\nAnd then there's Simon Mordant, co-chairman of Luminis Partners, who resigned as a biennale ambassador and \ntold The Guardian that he'd pulled a \"significant\" funding pledge for the project. We hear it was $40,000, roughly \nwhat Simon spends on Cohiba's and Brunello each month at his villa in Italy. His business partner Ron Malek spent \nthe weekend shaking his head in embarrassment at Mordant's unalloyed sanctimony.\n\"It's outrageous,\" Mordant wrote of the Sabsabi decision on Instagram. \"I have resigned as an Ambassador to the \nnow cancelled project and withdrawn my financial support - this situation is unacceptable. Maybe the Pavilion \nshould remain empty in solidarity with Khaled. A very dark day for Australia and the Arts.\" Mordant, who is Jewish, \nhasn't posted any messages of solidarity for Jewish artists who've been doxxed, abandoned and relentlessly \nPage 2 of 3\nFallout over CA decision continues\nexcluded since the October 7 massacres. Not a word from Mordant until Monday when he suddenly sought to \nclarify his support for Sabsabi - an artist who boycotted the 2022 Sydney Festival because the organisers received \n$20,000 of Israeli funding to stage an Israeli choreography display - and posted a whimpering statement saying he \nwould never support an artist \"that glorifies terrorism, racism or antisemitism\".\n\"I think everybody has to be very careful about the insidious rise of racism and anti-Semitism which has become \nparticularly prevalent in Australia,\" Mordant said. Well Simon, when even Sophie McNeill is lavishing you with \npraise and thanking you for your \"leadership\", as she did online, it might be time for a walk through the hall of \nmirrors.\nMikala Tai was the other prominent figure to walk out of Creative Australia \"in support of Sabsabi and curator \nMichael Dagostino\", as she wrote on Instagram.\nSabsabi is friendly with Tai. When Creative Australia announced his selection as the Venice Biennale \nrepresentative, Tai posted a video of them celebrating.\nJoining them in that video was Creative Australia program manager Tahmina Maskinyar, who resigned alongside \nTai, and whose posts online have included calls for the eradication of Israel (\"From the river to the sea ...\") and \n\"intifada until victory\", which Liberal senator Sarah Henderson called \"grossly offensive anti-Semitic content\".\nCreative Australia said these sentiments didn't breach the agency's code of conduct.\nNothing wrong with a bit of dancing, and nothing wrong with members of Sabsabi's artist group, Eleven Collective, \nbeing friendly with Tai. It is a fact, however, that some of these people have sat on Creative Australia panels that \nadjudicated the provision of taxpayer-funded grants, or been grant recipients themselves.\nLike Shireen Taweel, who we mentioned last week - she's affiliated with Tai and received Creative Australia grants \nof $45,200 in 2023 and $32,500 in 2022; Anna Louise Richardson, the wife of artist Abdul-Rahman Abdullah, a \npanel assessor, received $31,729 in March 2021; Amrita Hepi received $35,715 in 2023; and Sabsabi was awarded \nthree grants of $8500, $5000 and $7680 between March 2022 and October 2023 (he also received much larger \ngrants in 2018, 2019 and 2020, prior to Tai taking up work at Creative Australia).\nWe're not suggesting any of this is evidence of a conflict, nor that Tai had any involvement in furnishing these \ngrants; plus, within Australia's shallow artist pool, decision-making will inevitably involve people who wind up \nknowing each other.\nBut wrinkles remain. In the video of Sabsabi dancing, Abdullah left behind a comment that drew our attention: \"I \nlove everything about today's announcement. Thank you MT!!!!\" It would be telling to discover what role, if any, Tai \nmight have played in the backing of Sabsabi during discussions of the Biennale. One for next week's senate \nestimates hearing to tease out.\nOngoing process It's been six months since Andrew Forrest's Fortescue bowed to the inevitable and wound back \nthe exponential growth of its green energy hiring, sacking as many as 700 staff in the process. But Margin Call \nhears Fortescue staff have been attending a fresh round of leaving parties, as the company again hacks away at \nits management ranks.\nThe latest to go is general manager of community and government engagement, Sasha Pendal - a well known \nfigure in Perth business circles, not least for her role on the board of the hapless Fremantle Dockers football club.\nPendal's departure is said to be amicable, but appears part of another round of redundancies among senior \nmanagers.\nUnder the turmoil caused by Fortescue's pivot to green energy, the company somehow managed to insert an \nentire new level of management - the number of general managers at Fortescue blew out from 30-odd a few years \nago to as many as 130 in 2024.Page 3 of 3\nFallout over CA decision continues\nThe massive cull last year, when Fortescue announced it would lay off 700 staff, was supposed to reduce that total \nto around 40. The process is clearly still ongoing, with a few more departing in recent months, Pendal among them. \n(Not that all of last year's round of 700 came from Fortescue Energy, of course, as the company has been at pains \nto tell anyone that dares suggest it.) Also departing Fortescue this year is the former commercial manager for \nFortescue's hydrogen systems unit, Samantha Buchanan, who took a promotion to become a Shell Australia vice-\npresident in January.\nFortescue will deliver its first-half financial results on Thursday, and the company is (again) on a promise to update \nshareholders on the progress of its energy projects - primarily its Holmaneset green ammonia project in Norway \nand the Pecem green hydrogen development in Brazil.\nFair to say the going has been getting tougher in Europe, where Fortescue's plans are facing growing public \nopposition - not least because Holmaneset will draw down about 2 per cent of the total power produced in the \ncountry, at a promise of only a small number of jobs.\nAnd as for Fortescue's plans in the US, where it wants to build a hydrogen production plant to fuel trucks? That, \nlike every other renewable energy project in the country, is now prisoner to the new priorities of Donald Trump's \n\"drill, baby drill\" administration.\nBut also in need of a market update is the progress of Forrest's green fundraising arm, Fortescue Capital, which, \nsince its 2023 launch under the guidance of Robert Tichio, has built up a leadership group of no less than eight \nmanaging directors - all lured away from well-paid gigs at investment banks.\nFortescue Capital was launched with a mandate to attract external investment into the company's green energy \narm.\nOnly Fortescue's board really knows what the gang has been up to since, but Margin Call's quick math suggests \nFortescue is currently paying 2.7 managing directors for each green energy project that it still hasn't decided to \nbuild.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL The big changes continue at Andrew Forrest's Fortescue\nLoad-Date: February 17, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | CEO of Fortescue | \"Ongoing process It's been six months since Andrew Forrest's Fortescue bowed to the inevitable and wound back the exponential growth of its green energy hiring, sacking as many as 700 staff in the process.\" | N.A. |\n| Sasha Pendal | General Manager of Community and Government Engagement at Fortescue | \"Pendal's departure is said to be amicable, but appears part of another round of redundancies among senior managers.\" | N.A. |\n| Samantha Buchanan | Former Commercial Manager for Fortescue's Hydrogen Systems Unit | \"Also departing Fortescue this year is the former commercial manager for Fortescue's hydrogen systems unit, Samantha Buchanan, who took a promotion to become a Shell Australia vice-president in January.\" | N.A. |\n| Robert Tichio | Leader of Fortescue Capital | \"But also in need of a market update is the progress of Forrest's green fundraising arm, Fortescue Capital, which, since its 2023 launch under the guidance of Robert Tichio, has built up a leadership group of no less than eight managing directors - all lured away from well-paid gigs at investment banks.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
