Among the \nRamelius Resources assets are its Mt Magnet Gold and Edna May production hubs, and its plan has been to add \n100,000 ounces of gold a year.\nLoad-Date: March 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\nNone\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
