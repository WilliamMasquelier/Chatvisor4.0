The broader All Ordinaries was down 105.7 points, or 1.3 per cent, to 8,041.1.\n   Oil prices have jumped to a five-month high following Israel's assassination of Iranian military leaders in Syria and \nUkraine's attack on a Russian oil refinery and a munitions factory deep in Russian territory.\n   The rise in cost of oil is typically signals a risk of rising inflation rates.\n   Of the ASX's 11 sectors, energy and utilities were the only ones showing growth at midday, with the two up at \n0.43 and 0.41 per cent, respectively.\n   Australian uranium miners have continued to do well with Paladin up 1.57 per cent and Boss Energy up 1.31 per \ncent.
