Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Street Talk; Pg. 16\nLength: 527 words\nByline: Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood and Emma Rapaport\nBody\nWest Australian gold miner Westgold Resources is ready to get cracking on the synergies it promised shareholders \nlast year when it agreed to a $2.5 billion merger with Toronto-listed Karora Resources.\nStreet Talk understands Westgold is running a sale process for the Lakewood Mill gold processing facility near \nKalgoorlie, which Karora bought in July 2022 for $80 million.\nThe sale is in the advanced stages, with a new owner expected to be announced next month, sources said.\nThe auction, which is being run in-house, is understood to have fielded interest from several ASX-listed gold juniors \nincluding the $174 million Astral Resources, which is in the process of acquiring Maximus Resources; Horizon \nMinerals, which has just merged with Poseidon Nickel; and Chinese-backed Norton Gold Fields and Black Cats \nSyndicate. The $20 billion Northern Star owns the nearby land.\nSources said a deal could see Lakewood valued at between $70 million and $95 million, and would be welcomed \nby investors who've watched the shares fall almost 16 per cent this year. Unlike plenty of its listed peers, Westgold \nhasn't benefited from higher gold prices given issues around digesting the Karora acquisition.\nWestgold CEO Wayne Bramwell plans to use sale proceeds to increase capacity at its Higginsville mill from 1.6 \nmillion tonnes a year to well above the 2 million mark. A spokesperson declined to comment.\nThe up-for-grabs Lakewood was acquired by Karora to add an extra million tonnes in capacity for its flagship Beta \nHunt gold mine, on top of the 1.6 million tonnes capacity at its existing Higginsville mill, amid a production ramp-up.\nSources said since the merger, Westgold has narrowed its focus on fewer but bigger mills, which are fed by fewer \nbut bigger mines - in a bid to finetune its cost base against movements in gold pricing. This strategy, at its Beta \nHunt mine, means processing the ore via the lower-cost and larger Higginsville mill.\nProcessing a tonne of ore via the Lakewood mill costs $50, while Higginsville can handle the same amount for $30 \nor more. Should Westgold expand Higginsville as expected, this cost could be brought down to the $20 range, the \nsources said.\nPage 2 of 2\nWestgold shops gold mill acquired in $2.5b Karora merger; Street Talk\nThe mooted deal comes after Westgold and rival Ramelius Resources locked horns last year over Karora, as \nrevealed by Street Talk. The stoush ended when the $3 billion Ramelius decided to walk away, while Westgold \nprogressed and took the keys to Karora in August. But the proceedings also outed the fact that Ramelius had \napproached Westgold with a merger proposal but was knocked back.\nA fortnight ago, Westgold shares tanked after the miner cut its 2025 production guidance by as much as one-fifth \nand warned of higher costs after paying big for Karora. It said it would produce between 330,000 ounces and \n350,000 ounces this financial year, down from its previous forecast of between 400,000 ounces and 420,000 \nounces. Costs were also expected to be higher, up from a range of $2000 to $2300 per ounce to $2400 to $2600. \nThe miner attributed the production cuts to teething problems in production at its two main mines Beta Hunt near \nKambalda, and Bluebird-South Junction near Meekatharra.\nLoad-Date: February 21, 2025\nEnd of Document\n            ",
