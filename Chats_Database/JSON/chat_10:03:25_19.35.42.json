In my view, on balance, it \nwas.\n\"The fact of the ongoing relationship, and the issues raised and discussions with Element Zero in the latter part of \n2023 and early 2024, were facts which should have been brought to the court's attention on the application for the \nsearch orders.\nPage 2 of 2\nJudge backs Fortescue in IP stoush\n\"Those facts were relevant to the question of whether there was a real risk of destruction given past co-operation, \nalbeit about different issues.\" Element Zero had also asked the court to set aside the search orders because it \nclaimed surveillance conducted in the lead-up to obtaining them was excessive.\nIt emerged that Fortescue employed former SAS soldier Robert Lancaster to spy on Element Zero staff and its \nfamilies for up to 17 hours per day. The surveillance included following family members to Kmart, rummaging \nthrough mail and taking pictures of their children leaving school.\nElement Zero argued the surveillance reports produced presented a misleading picture to the court, which coloured \nit as \"nefarious\" and \"dishonest\".\nBut Justice Markovic accepted surveillance conducted by private investigators was necessary.\n\"As I have already observed, the private investigator's reports are lengthy and detailed,\" she said.\n\"However, on their face they do not disclose any collateral purpose. Rather, they attempt to provide information \nnecessary for an application for search orders and as required by the court's search orders practice note.\n\"One way of obtaining that information is to instruct qualified persons to attend at and observe premises. In this \ncase, Fortescue chose to do so by instructing a private investigator firm.\n\"Finally, that the surveillance reports were lengthy, to a degree repetitious and perhaps inelegantly expressed, \ncannot justify setting aside the search orders.\" A spokesman for Element Zero said it wanted the search orders set \naside primarily based on Fortescue's \"failure to disclose the ongoing commercial relationship\" with Fortescue.\n\"Although Element Zero believes that the orders should have been set aside, and is still considering challenging \nthat result, it is pleased that the court varied the search orders to quarantine all of the materials seized during the \nraids,\" he said.\n\"This means that Fortescue cannot access any of the 12 million documents and must now follow standard \ndiscovery processes.\" A Fortescue spokesman said it would continue to \"rigorously protect its intellectual property \nin every part of its green energy, technology and metals business\".\n\"With Justice Markovic's decision, two Federal Court judges have now found a strong prima facie case that the \nElement Zero parties misused Fortescue's confidential information and breached its rights, and have determined \nthat there was a real risk of destruction of crucial evidence if the search orders were not granted,\" he said.\n\"The Element Zero parties sought to set aside the search orders on five grounds, all of which failed. To obtain the \nsearch orders, Fortescue was required to satisfy the Federal Court that it had a strong 'prima facie' case against \nthe Element Zero parties, that those parties possessed important evidence, and that there was a real possibility that \nthey might destroy or hide that evidence.\" As well, the spokesman said: \"In rejecting the ... attempt to set aside the \nsearch orders on the ground of 'material nondisclosure', Justice Markovic found that while certain matters relating to \nprior meetings were not disclosed, this was unintentional and would not have changed Justice Perry's decision to \ngrant the search orders given the conclusions reached from Fortescue's substantial body of evidence.\"\nLoad-Date: October 11, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's CEO | \"With Justice Markovic's decision, two Federal Court judges have now found a strong prima facie case that the Element Zero parties misused Fortescue's confidential information and breached its rights, and have determined that there was a real risk of destruction of crucial evidence if the search orders were not granted.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
