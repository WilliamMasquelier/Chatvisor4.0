It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nForrest backdown raises fears for reputation\nForrest backdown raises fears for reputation\nThe Australian\nJuly 18, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian2 Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKETWATCH; Pg. 24\nLength: 524 words\nByline: Nick Evans comment\nBody\nHowever Fortescue may try to spin it, the announcement it will slash 700 roles from its global headcount is more \nthan just an attempt to remain \"lean, impactful and agile\".\nThe last time Fortescue made cuts this deep into its workforce was when it sacked 1000 people in a single day in \n2012, when the tumbling iron ore price combined with Fortescue's massive debts to create an existential crisis for \nthe iron ore producer.\nFor Fortescue to abandon its ambitions to produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030, and make \nsimilarly deep cuts to its workforce, represents a humiliating backdown.\nNot because the company has abandoned the goal in the face of reality. But because Andrew Forrest and his \nleadership team spent the past three years waving away genuine concerns about the plans that were being \nexpressed by investors, market analysts, hydrogen and energy experts, and even the company's own staff - many \nof whom left in frustration well ahead of Wednesday's announcement.\nIn that time Fortescue has become increasingly erratic in its strategy and less tolerant of criticism - both internally \nand from the media and the investment community, as the company embraced the new vision of its founder and the \n\"creative chaos\" that came with it.\nYou cannot fault Forrest for his ambition, his commitment to innovation, and his attempt to try to drive a shift to \ngreen energy by bringing the scale of Fortescue's resources to bear on a problem others have found too difficult to \ngrapple with.\nHopefully some good will eventually come of all that frenzied work. But belief alone cannot defy reality, and it has \nbeen clear for some time that Fortescue took on more than it could ever handle - perhaps to the detriment of \nprojects that could have been achieved.\nPlenty of voices inside Fortescue have been saying that along the journey, but have been told to get with the \nprogram or leave the company.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest backdown raises fears for reputation\nThe reputational damage brought about by the retreat from this green foray is enormous, both to Fortescue and to \nother Australian companies operating overseas.\nForrest has spent the past four years touring developing nations making big promises about the jobs that green \nhydrogen will bring, and the economic transformation his company could help deliver to some of the poorest \ncountries in the world, if they give Fortescue access to their resources.\nFew, if any, of those promises will now be delivered - and that will not be easily forgotten the next time an Australian \ncompany rolls into town looking for support for a mining or energy project.\nMany investors will welcome Wednesday's backdown as offering hope the company will return its focus to the \nmining arm where it makes its money.\nBut real questions still need to be asked about how the rest of the Fortescue board did not reign in Forrest's green \nambitions well before now.\nFortescue changes   700 jobs to go across global operations   Redundancies to be finalised this month   \nStreamlined executive team, comprising nearly 50% women   Apple Paget is the new chief financial officer   Shelley \nRobertson is the new chief operating officer   Navdeep Gill is the new company secretary\nLoad-Date: July 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
