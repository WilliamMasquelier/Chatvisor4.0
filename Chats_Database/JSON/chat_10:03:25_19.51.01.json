There's uncertainty globally for them too and until we have a project \nwhich is economically viable, we won't take those to the board.\" Fortescue announced last July that it was \nshedding 700 jobs and pulling back on green hydrogen. The company has never disclosed how many of the job \nlosses were in green energy and Mr Hutchinson again refused to discuss staff numbers when questioned on the \nissue on Thursday.\nMr Hutchinson said the Trump administration was instructing federal agencies to pause grant payments under the \nInflation Reduction Act and that had implications for its $US550m Arizona project.\n\"While we do remain confident in the long-term viability of green energy, we must be realistic about the current \nchallenges the industry faces. Right now the world is in an uncertain place,\" he said.\n\"This does include looking at timelines on the FID (final investment decision) projects we have previously \nannounced. These changes are what happens when you have an unstable government policy which creates \nuncertainty for investors.\" The Fortescue share price plunged more than 6.2 per cent to $18.24 on Thursday on the \nback of weaker than expected results and dividends.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue raises doubts over ambitious green energy projects\nAlthough the interim dividend of 50c is down from $1.08 last year and lower than forecasts, Andrew and Nicola \nForrest will still share in about $558.4m.\nThe separated couple control about 36.7 per cent of Fortescue stock. The dividend dip came as Fortescue \nforeshadowed more delays to the $US3.9bn Iron Bridge mine in the Pilbara reaching nameplate capacity of 22 \nmillion tonnes a year.\nIron Bridge had been scheduled to hit that milestone in September, but Fortescue said that timetable was under \nreview as it looked to make changes to the processing plant.\nIt is now almost two years since Dr Forrest, Fortescue's executive chairman, declared first production at Iron \nBridge and described it as the biggest relief of his career.\nPerth-headquartered Fortescue's first half profit fell 53 per cent to $US1.55bn, below consensus estimates of a \n$US1.8bn. Revenue fell 20 per cent to $US7.64bn and underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and \namortisation tumbled from $5.9bn to $3.64bn. Fortescue shipped a company record of 97.1 million tonnes of iron \nore in the first half, but the average price for its hematite product fell 21 per cent year-on-year to $US85 a tonne and \nproduction costs increased slightly.\nThe company maintained full-year shipment guidance of 190-200 million tonnes, including 5-9 million tonnes from \nIron Bridge, despite recent cyclone activity in the Pilbara that has also hit bigger rivals BHP and Rio Tinto.\nFortescue metals chief executive Dino Otranto backed Iron Bridge to eventually hit its straps after various setbacks \nin the past two years, including WorkSafe issuing improvement notices related to the management of dust with high \nlevels of crystalline -silica. Analysts at Jarden highlighted possible \"dividend stream pressures\", including costs \naround replacement of heavy mining equipment, decarbonisation and an increasing need to step up resource and \nreserve replacement drilling against the backdrop of the weak outlook on iron ore prices. Guidance for FY25 energy \ncapital expenditure was revised to $US400m (previously $US500m) reflecting reduced spend.\nLoad-Date: February 20, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue Energy boss | \"While we do remain confident in the long-term viability of green energy, we must be realistic about the current challenges the industry faces.
