Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 695 words\nByline: This content is brought to you by BULLS N' BEARS\nHighlight: Javelin Minerals has completed a 2921m maiden reverse circulation drill program at its Coogee copper-\ngold project near Kambalda, WA, with assay results pending.\nBody\nJavelin Minerals has completed phase one of a maiden drilling program for 2921m at its Coogee copper-gold \nproject near Kambalda in Western Australia, discovering key gold indicators along a 950m-long strike trend.\nThe 18-hole reverse circulation (RC) program recovered 1698 samples sent for assay and identified a copper-gold \nmineralised trend extending from about 270m south of the southern open pit rim to about 450m north of the \nnorthern rim of the pit.\nThe program was designed to identify possible extensions to mineralisation below the current open pit floor- about \n70m depth - at the partly flooded Coogee open pit.\nAdditionally, the program sought to explore the possibility of mineralisation extending south of the original Coogee \nresource, last mined by Ramelius Resources in 2013, which pulled out a reported 147,000 tonnes of ore for \n20,400 ounces of gold.\nJavelin's new drilling program represents the first systematic drilling campaign since Ramelius Resources wound \nup its operations in 2014.\n'We are pleased with the rapid completion of the first phase of drilling over our Coogee project. We have identified \nkey gold indicators along the 950m strike from drill hole CORC154 south of the pit to CORC166 about 450m north \nof the current pit.'\nJavelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell\nThe previous exploration by Ramelius resulted in a shallow, JORC-compliant resource estimated at 126,685 \nounces of gold - with about 4133t of copper - which Javelin is confident additional drilling will add to.\nJavelin intends to scout-out possible north and north-west continuity and extensions of the Coogee pit \nmineralisation inferred from a pronounced \"bullseye\" magnetic anomaly - referred to as \"CG-01\u2033 - about 300m north \nof the old Coogee open pit.\nPage 2 of 2\nAssays pending from Javelin Coogee copper-gold drilling in WA\nThe company believes the extensions could reveal the deeper down-dip potential of Coogee North. Notably, a \nsecond new magnetic target \"CG-02\" exists about 400m west of CG-01 and is interpreted to be an additional \nmineralisation diving under the Coogee North zone.\nThe program also served to follow-up anomalous gold mineralisation identified by previous air core (AC) and RC \ndrilling at various pattern densities along the trend.\nThe planned drill depths for the phase one program varied between 70m and 275m.\nJavelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell said: \"We are pleased with the rapid completion of the first phase \nof drilling over our Coogee project. We have identified key gold indicators along the 950m strike from drill hole \nCORC154 south of the pit to CORC166 about 450m north of the current pit. Once we receive the assays, which we \nexpect to start coming in over the coming weeks, we will plan phase two of the program. This means we will have \nongoing drilling activity and news flow from both Coogee and Eureka during the first half of 2025\".\nThe phase two drilling campaign is expected to start in late January/early February when results from the phase \none RC program are in hand and will continue to increase the mineralised footprint between the Coogee open pit \nand Coogee North.\nThe latter contains an estimated 2.95 million tonnes with more than 96,000 ounces of gold and more than 4000t of \ncopper.\nIt will also define additional gold extensions below the current pit, where modelling has identified about 360,000t at \na grade of 1.29g/t gold for a further 15,000 ounces of gold.\nDrilling will also probe the new targets of the north-west trend, exploring the magnetic signatures and the north-west \ntrending shear that parallels the Coogee Shear hosting the original high-grade gold mined by Ramelius.\nIt's tempting to say Javelin is hunting in a target-rich environment, but it seems appropriate to the company's name \nand where it finds itself in this early phase of exploration.\nIndications to date show the company is identifying gold-copper potential everywhere it looks along the explored \ntrend and has a solid footing based on structure and magnetics.\nNo doubt it will be looking forward to rolling on with the phase one results and the up-coming phase two drilling \nkicking-off early in the New Year.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?
