It operates in the Mining, exploration and drilling of gold, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Ramelius Resources based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Ramelius Resources is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Ramelius Resources.\n\nIf Ramelius Resources is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nWestgold acquires Karora for $1.1bn\nWestgold acquires Karora for $1.1bn\nThe Australian\nApril 9, 2024 Tuesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 707 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nAustralia's mid-tier gold consolidation has taken another step forward, with Westgold Resources agreeing to a \n$1.1bn deal to acquire Karora Resources, after West Australian rival Ramelius walked away from talks with the \nCanadian-listed gold producer.\nThe latest mid-tier merger comes with the gold price hovering around record levels of $US2338 ($3550) an ounce \nat the close of trading on the Australian Securities Exchange on Monday, amid a search for scale in the Australian \ngold sector.\nThe deal will add Karora's Beta Hunt and Higginsville gold operations to Westgold's stable of producing assets, in a \nmove aimed at pushing the company's annual output to more than 400,000 -ounces.\nIf the deal is consummated, Westgold will issue 2.52 of its shares for each Karora share, plus pay 68c in cash.\nKarora holders will also get a share in a new company that will hold its 22 per cent stake in lithium hopeful Kali \nMetals.\nThe Westgold deal comes only weeks after Westgold rival Ramelius Resources walked away from talks with \nKarora, saying that no agreement on valuation could be reached. Ramelius Resources was said to be considering \nan all-scrip deal that valued Karora at $700m to $1bn.\nWestgold boss Wayne Bramwell said the company had been monitoring Karora's position for some time, and had \nagreed to a deal as a play on the future of the company's Beta Hunt mine.\nWestgold sold the Higginsville mine and processing plant to Karora (then known as RNC Minerals) in 2019 for \n$50m in cash and shares, but Mr Bramwell said the growth potential at Beta Hunt was the key to the transaction.\n\"We've been underground at Beta Hunt and we see that there is a massive opportunity. There is the bolt-on cash \nflow - once we complete this transaction the combined business will produce 400,000 ounces a year, unhedged,\" \nhe said.\nPage 2 of 2\nWestgold acquires Karora for $1.1bn\n\"And we're absolutely confident that Beta Hunt can be bigger and higher grade, because we think it's under-drilled.\" \nWestgold has said it expects its operations to produce about 225,000 ounces in the current financial year.\nWestgold shareholders will control 50.1 per cent of the combined company if the transaction goes ahead.\nMr Bramwell said he was confident that Westgold had not paid too much for Karora, despite Ramelius having \nwalked away from its own talks with the Canadian-listed company.\n\"We can see what this thing can deliver. It's immediately cash flow accretive in terms of the production,\" he said.\n\"There is always a risk in these things, but we've shown that we won't overpay for these things. And our view is that \nthe upside at Beta Hunt is enormous.\n\"The mills are key, and now you've got a large mill connected with a large mine - that's quite different to what \nWestgold sold. And having been to Higginsville recently as well, it struck me that this is what we also found in the \nMurchison - these mines have got a perception of being old and tired, but that perception has really been driven by \na lack of investment in drilling.\" Karora shareholders will vote on the agreement in June, with a 67 per cent majority \nneeded to seal the merger.\nThe disappearance of Newcrest Mining, swallowed by Newmont in a blockbuster deal last year, has left a gulf at the \ntop of Australia's gold producers.\nAmid a scramble for scale, the Westgold deal with Karora is the second significant merger deal in Australia's mid-\ntier gold sector this year, after Silver Lake Resources and Red 5 agreed to a merger in February. That deal will \nalso go to a shareholder vote in June.\nThe merger between Westgold and Karora would leave the combined company as the fifth-largest gold producer on \nthe ASX, just behind the Red 5 and Silver Lake combination.\nWestgold would emerge with five processing plants and seven operating mines, the company says, spread across \nthe company's existing presence in the Mid West of Western Australia, and Karora's assets near Kambalda. Mr \nBramwell said the company expected to keep a significant number of Karora's North American shareholders on its \nregister, with the company planning a dual-listing on the Toronto stock exchange after the close of the transaction. \nWestgold shares, which were trading as high as $2.77 at the start of the month, closed down 1c to $2.27 on \nMonday, while Ramelius added 2c to $1.97.\nLoad-Date: April 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Ramelius Resources.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
