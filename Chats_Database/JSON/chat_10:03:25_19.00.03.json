Fortescue has promised to end its use of fossil fuels by the end of the decade and \nbecome a \"real zero\" emitter of carbon. But to do that the company has said it needs 2 to 3 gigawatt of renewable \nenergy generation, along with battery firming.\nSo far Fortescue has only committed to a 100 megawatt solar farm at its Iron Bridge magnetite operation and a \n60MW solar farm at its Chichester iron ore mine. But last year, as part of an investor tour of its operations, \nFortescue flagged plans to build a gigawatt of both solar and wind generation around its mines, as well as up to \n4GWh of battery storage.\nSpeaking to analysts on Thursday, however, Mr Hutchinson said the company had held discussions with the \nproponents of AREH, as well as other potential renewable energy providers in the region.\nAREH is 48 per cent owned by fossil fuel giant BP, and includes Macquarie, CWP Global and Intercontinental \nEnergy as joint venture partners. The consortium plans to build a giant 26GW of combined solar and wind power on \na 6500 sq km site north east of the Port Hedland iron ore export hub.\n\"We are talking to many parties including the BP and Intercontinental Energy team and will continue to do so,\" Mr \nHutchinson said. \"This is one ecosystem which we want to make sure gets developed in Australia. And we want to \nmake sure we also have the most efficient energy for our own use. So we'll continue to have discussions with a \nnumber of different parties.\" Last year Rio Tinto also switched its Pilbara renewable energy strategy to include third \nparty energy providers, partly citing tight supply chains and intense competition for solar and wind energy \ngeneration equipment.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue in talks over power deal\nMr Hutchinson's comments came after Fortescue declared another bumper dividend on the back of last year's \nsurge in the iron ore price, delivering holders a $1.08 a share interim dividend after declaring a $US3.3bn net profit \nfor the half.\nThe dividend represents a payout of 65 per cent of the company's first-half profit, and comes after Fortescue \nbooked earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $US5.9bn, up 36 per cent on the \nfirst half of the previous financial year. Fortescue's energy division booked a $US320m EBITDA loss for the half, \nup from a $US302m loss in the first half of the previous financial year.\nThe energy division now includes UK technology business WAE, which booked revenue of about $US26m for the \nyear.\nFortescue's policy is to pay out 50 to 80 per cent of its net profit in dividends, and the mid-range payment - the \nsame as its total payout ratio across last financial year - comes as the company looks to ramp up spending on its \nPilbara iron ore mines and its green energy projects. The iron ore giant spent $US1.52bn on capital projects in the \nfirst half of the financial year, with about $US1bn of that on sustaining capital for its existing Pilbara miners.\nAnother $US165m was spent on Fortescue Energy projects across the globe, and another $US104m on \ndecarbonising the company's iron ore operations.\nFortescue says it expects to spend $US3.3bn to $US3.7bn in capital for the full financial year, with about $US500m \nof that to go towards green energy projects and $US300m to $US500m on decarbonisation.\nFortescue's first-half result comes after the company received an average $US108 a dry tonne for its iron ore \nshipments in the half, up from $US87 a tonne in the prior corresponding period, with the group booking $US9.5bn in \nrevenue, up 21 per cent.\nCash production costs lifted 2 per cent to $US17.77 a wet tonne for the period as Fortescue kept inflationary \npressures in the Pilbara largely under control.\nCiti analyst Paul McTaggart said the results had beaten analyst consensus estimates of a $US5.6bn EBITDA and a \n$1.04 dividend. Fortescue shares closed up 58c to $27.83 on Thursday.\nLoad-Date: February 22, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue Energy boss | \"We are talking to many parties including the BP and Intercontinental Energy team and will continue to do so.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
