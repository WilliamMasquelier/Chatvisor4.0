Pg. 20\nLength: 497 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nFortescue says it has begun -negotiations with Chinese authorities for the supply of 100 million tonnes of green \niron from its Pilbara operations, but has flagged the need for a huge amount of hydrogen to make the plan a reality.\nFortescue chairman Andrew Forrest flagged the plan in a presentation on Thursday to the Scottsdale Action Forum \nin Arizona that is hosted by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.\nDr Forrest's presentation to the forum, hosted on the Fortescue website, did not give details of whether the \nnegotiations were with China Mineral Resources Group, established in 2022 as the country's central iron ore buyer, \nor with another Chinese government agency.\nIn June last year, Fortescue also announced an agreement with China's Baowu steel group over the development \nof green iron technology.\nThe presentation did not put a timeframe on the discussions, other than to say that they had begun this year.\nFortescue only ticked off on a $50m pilot plant for its green iron production plant at its Christmas Creek mine late \nlast year, saying the plant would be producing 1500 tonnes of iron ore a year by 2025.\nThe company did not give an update on its progress in building the plant in its March quarter production report, \ndelivered last week.\nBut Thursday's presentation suggests Fortescue will need to produce enormous quantities of green hydrogen to \nmake its -vision come true, reiterating Dr Forrest's previous ambition of producing 200 million tonnes a year of \ncarbon-free iron ore for export to its customers.\nFortescue has said its pilot plant will use renewable energy and green hydrogen reduction technology, together \nwith an electric smelting furnace, to produce high-grade iron for use in the steel industry.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue in China talks on green iron\nDr Forrest's presentation suggests Fortescue will need about 8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year to reach its goal \nof producing 200 million tonnes a year of green iron, potentially eliminating 220 million tonnes a year of carbon \nemissions compared with current iron ore production.\nFortescue Energy CEO Mark Hutchinson confirmed in February that the company had held discussions with the \nBP-led Australian Renewable Energy Hub over potential power deals for the mining giant's Pilbara iron ore \noperations, which could also have the capacity to supply energy for hydrogen production.\nThe AREH consortium - 48 per cent-owned by fossil fuel giant BP, and with Macquarie, CWP Global and \nIntercontinental Energy as joint venture partners - plans to build 26GW combined solar and wind power plant on a \n6500sq km site northeast of the Port Hedland iron ore export hub.\nBut Fortescue has otherwise outlined few options to build hydrogen production hubs close to its Pilbara iron ore \noperations.\nThe Scottsdale Action Forum is in its second year. It hosted more than 130 industry chief executives, directors, \nbankers and government officials, according to Fortescue. Dr Forrest was the keynote \"how to\" speaker at the \nforum, Fortescue said. Fortescue shares rose 1 per cent to $25.57.\nLoad-Date: May 2, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue Chairman | \"Fortescue will need to produce enormous quantities of green hydrogen to make its vision come true.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue Energy CEO | \"The company had held discussions with the BP-led Australian Renewable Energy Hub over potential power deals for the mining giant's Pilbara iron ore operations.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
