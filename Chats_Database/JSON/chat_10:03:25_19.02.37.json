Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Michael Masterman | Chief Executive of Element Zero | \"The entire industry has enormous commercial pressures, shareholder pressures and goodwill to find technology solutions that can reduce the carbon emissions from converting iron ore into iron.\" | N.A. |\n| Bart Kolodziejczyk | Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Element Zero | \"There is so much interest in what we do both in Australia and globally, in particular in the US, that we believe that we can make it.\" | N.A. |\n| Bart Kolodziejczyk | Co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Element Zero | \"We believe that some of those majors will come and invest in us.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Chief Executive of Element Zero | \"If we're able to take literally sand and convert it into silicon metal, with very little carbon emissions, that makes a major difference to the supply source of silicon metal and the carbon emissions that come from producing it.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
