Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 17\nLength: 640 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue chairman Andrew Forrest has defended the company's legal pursuit of three former executives over an \nalleged intellectual property breach, saying anyone attempting to snatch the company's technology will face the full \nweight of the law.\nFortescue launched Federal Court action in June against Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn \nWinther-Jensen after alleging they had taken intellectual property from Fortescue's work into \"green iron\" and \nattempted to commercialise it through their start-up Element Zero.\nThe Element Zero team has vigorously denied the claims. The lawsuit made headlines when it was revealed \nFortescue had hired private investigators to follow and photograph the Element Zero executives and their families.\nThe stakes are high for Fortescue, which even after this week's austerity drive and 700 job cuts, has a bevy of \ntrials and projects under way into various embryonic clean energy technologies.\nDr Forrest has denied prior knowledge of the plan to use private investigators, and said Fortescue directors had \nstruggled to align the surveillance tactics with the company's values.\nGeneral counsel Phil McKeiver offered his resignation over the incident, but has been retained by Fortescue, albeit \nwithout his previous responsibility as company secretary.\nBut despite distancing himself from the private investigation tactics, Dr Forrest endorsed the decision to pursue \nElement Zero through the courts.\n\"There is an overarching message here: you're not going to be paid to develop technology with a whole heap of \nother people, at really serious risk and cost to the entire company and your workmates ... and then send that \ntechnology to another email address and think that's OK,\" he said.\n\"That's not OK.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nElement Zero execs burnt bridges: Forrest\nDr Forrest appeared to reference evidence tendered to the Federal Court in Fortescue's June 17 claim, where it \naccused Dr Winther-Jensen of sending technical documents about green iron research from his Fortescue email to \na personal email account.\nDr Forrest said the Element Zero team had burned the bridges behind them \"like the Nazis pulling out of Poland\".\n\"You want to send emails full of our data over there then eliminate it, you'll be held to the full responsibility of the \nlaw,\" he said.\nDr Kolodziejczyk was born in the Polish city of Rzeszow, according to Australian Securities and Investments \nCommission filings.\nA spokesman for Element Zero declined to comment on Dr Forrest's warning.\n\"We are not going to be drawn into responding to these comments. We look forward to these matters being \ndetermined through the court process,\" he said.\nMr Masterman has been one of Dr Forrest's closest allies over the past quarter of a century, working for both \nFortescue and some private entities linked to the Forrest family.\nMr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk were among the inner circle of trusted executives who travelled around the \nworld with Dr Forrest in 2020 collecting rights to clean energy projects.\nThe fight with Element Zero over \"green iron\" technology is timely, given Dr Forrest's latest long-term vision for \nFortescue is to eventually cease selling hematite iron ore, and instead use green hydrogen and other techniques to \nstrip out impurities and sell only the pure \"green iron\" left behind.\n\"We're getting out of iron ore, which is very interesting because we're going, as soon as we can ... to green metal,\" \nDr Forrest said on Wednesday, when Fortescue conceded it would not achieve his previous goal of producing 15 \nmillion tonnes of hydrogen a year by 2030.\nFortescue will start construction this year on a $US50 million ($74.2 million) green iron facility at its Christmas \nCreek iron ore hub in the Pilbara.\nDr Forrest said such projects would consume green hydrogen in the future, even if demand for the commodity as a \nfuel source from other companies was not as strong as Fortescue had hoped.\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
