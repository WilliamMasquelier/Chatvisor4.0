Fortescue Zero brings together all the green technologies to accelerate commercial \ndecarbonisation rapidly, profitably and globally. This includes haul trucks, batteries, electrolysers, power \nconversion, intelligence software, trains, green shipping and green iron,\" he said.\n\"While Western Australia remains Fortescue's home, Perth is not the centre of gravity for our energy business. \nFortescue Energy's executive team reflects the global nature of the company.\" In addition to the fresh upheaval \nwithin Fortescue's energy division, the company is still to announce the appointment of a permanent chief financial \nofficer, 10 months after the sudden departure of Christine Morris from the role. Ms Morris quit after only two months \nin the job, following the exit of metals boss Fiona Hick, who herself lasted only a few months at the company.\nPage 2 of 3\nFortescue in reshuffle of green team\nThe latest restructure within Fortescue's energy division was partly triggered by the recent departure from \nFortescue Zero of Judith Judson, appointed only 10 months ago. Ms Judson remains a Fortescue employee but is \nunderstood to have elected to return to live and work in the US for family reasons.\nFortescue Europe president Bruh Terfie has also just handed in his notice. Mr Terfie previously ran the company's \nAfrican section and was made the acting president for Europe in February, when Carlos Lange quit the job after \nonly 10 months.\nMr Hutchinson will now replace Ms Judson as the interim CEO of Fortescue Zero, the former technology company \nfounded to back the Williams Formula One racing car team.\nMr Hutchinson joined Fortescue only two years ago, tasked with turning the results of Dr Forrest's grand green \nenergy ambitions into reality.\nBut from the hundreds of billions of dollars in green energy projects earmarked by the iron ore billionaire's whirlwind \nglobal tour in 2020 and 2021, Fortescue's energy division has only managed to advance three relatively minor \nprojects to the point of a final investment decision.\nThe restructure positions Mr Pichot as the clear heir to the top job within Fortescue's Energy division should Mr \nHutchinson, who has just turned 64, part ways with the iron ore and energy giant.\nThe executive reshuffle may only be the tip of more sweeping changes at Fortescue Energy, sources say, with \nstaff on edge over talk the company is drafting plans to \"reset\" its ambitions as major planned projects fall by the \nwayside and Fortescue factors in a lower iron ore price outlook.\nFortescue recently lost out to a Nigerian company in the race to be nominated to lead the development of the giant \nGrand Inga hydro power project in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nAnd sources say the company is also cooling on other planned African projects, including a geothermal and green \nhydrogen play in Kenya once slated as a key project for the company that failed to make the cut in the round of final \ninvestment decisions in late 2023.\nThe shift comes amid a wave of other senior executive departures. Long-serving executive Julie Shuttleworth, Mr \nHutchinson's predecessor as Fortescue Energy CEO, called time on her 11 years with Fortescue this week.\nMs Shuttleworth's most recent role was leading the development of the company's Belinga iron ore project in \nGabon. Fortescue's president of African operations, Ed Kalajzic, will now take charge in Gabon.\nThe past year has also seen the loss of Fortescue's global director of people, Matt Brady, along with Allard Nooy, \npresident of Asian operations, global government relations boss Todd Clewett, and Michael Gunner, the ex-\nNorthern Territory chief minister.\nDr Forrest last year said executives who had left the iron ore major had struggled to cope with the -\"boiler room\" \nconditions of the company and were not following his green vision.\nHowever, Dr Forrest said in February that a degree of turnover was expected as the company transitioned from a \npure iron ore producer to a green energy company with lofty global renewable hydrogen ambitions.\nHopes for both hydrogen and critical minerals in particular remain high given recent stimulus from the Albanese \ngovernment.\nMajor miners and investors, including Dr Forrest, in May toasted a $15bn cash splash for hydrogen production and \ncritical minerals processing, a major push the Albanese government hopes will unlock $50bn in private spending to \nfurther turbocharge the sector.Page 3 of 3\nFortescue in reshuffle of green team\nDr Forrest personally welcomed the federal government's commitment to green hydrogen in the budget, predicting \nit could drive a \"massive employment boom\" in the sector.\nHe said in May the $2 per kilo tax credit for green hydrogen would help drive a green hydrogen, green ammonia \nand green iron industry which would \"create economic opportunities of historical scale\". Mr Forrest has long been a \nsupporter of encouraging the development of a green hydrogen sector in Australia, urging the federal government \nto take action to follow the green energy incentives in the Biden Administration's Inflation Reduction Act.\nLoad-Date: June 14, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"Dr Forrest personally welcomed the federal government's commitment to green hydrogen in the budget, predicting it could drive a 'massive employment boom' in the sector.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | CEO of Fortescue Energy | \"Fortescue Energy CEO Mark Hutchinson recently took on the additional role of leading Fortescue Zero, the green technology arm of Fortescue.\" | N.A. |\n| Julie Shuttleworth | Former CEO of Fortescue Energy | \"Long-serving executive Julie Shuttleworth, Mr Hutchinson's predecessor as Fortescue Energy CEO, called time on her 11 years with Fortescue this week.\" | N.A. |\n| Dr Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"He said in May the $2 per kilo tax credit for green hydrogen would help drive a green hydrogen, green ammonia and green iron industry which would 'create economic opportunities of historical scale'.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
