The approach worked on his iron ore bet two \ndecades ago. This time with green hydrogen, the story couldn't be more different.\nAfter refusing to acknowledge any internal warning signs and critics from the energy industry, Forrest was \ndetermined to keep crashing through. Now reality has hit and his green energy ambitions have crashed \nspectacularly. There is more than a financial cost - much of which is yet to be quantified.\nFirstly, there's the emotional toll on the 700 employees from across Fortescue - including those that bought into the \ngreen energy dream - who are now set to be sacked.\nThe second is Andrew Forrest's credibility has taken a major hit. For more than two years, Fortescue has been full \nthrottle trying to turn Forrest's promise of green hydrogen into a commercial reality within years.\nHe talked a big game and travelled the world meeting governments, while handing out green MoUs like calling \ncards.\nInstead, as the economics sank in, with electricity costs surging, deadlines were pushed back and back The \nmission changed. Then there was a revolving door of executives.\nWith all the optics of a rare defeat, Forrest has finally moved away from his centrepiece promise of developing a \ncommercial green hydrogen export business by the end of the decade.\nInstead, Fortescue is again looking more like its bigger rivals BHP and Rio Tinto, with plans to switch to \nconventional renewables like wind, solar and storage and in-house development to help it meet its net zero targets \nby 2030, while building up business lines.\nRunning two Fortescues in parallel - one for mining and another for energy - will end, saving hundreds of millions in \ncosts.\nPage 2 of 3\nForrest's credibility hit by green hydrogen collapse\nEven with the much-welcomed streamlining, investors are still in the dark about financials and whether key \nexecutives in the energy adventure are staying.\nForrest on Tuesday was firmly standing by green hydrogen as a technology and promised that Fortescue would \nbring it to market as the economics became more favourable. So too with his commitment to decarbonisation, \nwhere he has already spent more than $1bn. \"I am not giving up on hydrogen at all,\" Forrest tells The Australian. \n\"The green electricity price just keeps heading north, and it's been dragged up by the fossil fuel price. We're not \npivoting away. We're going upstream to get the green electrons at the right price.\" He says the benefits of the spend \nare spread through Fortescue, which now has a product division for battery-powered trucks, with trains and ships \npowered with green energy in development. He is developing inputs for green fertilizer as well as trialling a green \niron plant in the Pilbara to make purer ore.\n\"These are each multipliers of market cap. They're not adders to market cap. They're big movers, and that's all \ncome about because the company's pushing to hydrogen, and all of those are ripe.\" Still, the sheer chaos of the \nadventure was like watching a start-up burn bright and then implode, and Fortescue's board needs to remind itself \nit is a top 10 company with thousands of workers. Whether it likes it or not it has an army of stakeholders - \ngovernments, investors and customers.\nOut of corporate failure there usually come some valuable -lessons. But the Forrest show has likely put the global \nquest for green hydrogen back years. If Forrest, with all his substantial resources and connections, couldn't pull it \noff, others will think twice about investing in the technology.\nNo customers For Forrest, the problems were multi-faceted.\nHe was trying to develop an over-the-horizon technology for product that didn't have any customers ready to go.\nAnd as he discovered, it didn't have the green energy sources at the scale needed to make the raw material.\nThe rule of thumb is that more energy goes into producing hydrogen than what hydrogen offers. That's why Forrest \nneeded to pin down an energy source, and lots of it. Surging power prices made that even harder.\nEven if Forrest had a breakthrough on the technology of producing hydrogen from water, it simply wouldn't be \neconomical at today's prices.\nEssentially Forrest was solving the answer to a riddle that belonged to a different question.\nAt the peak of Forrest's hydrogen push, energy players were casting doubts, while Australia's biggest steelmaker, \nBlueScope, loudly warned that the technology was a long way from reality.\nBlueScope boss Mark Vassella had sweated the numbers as he was embarking on his own green steel road map \nahead of his $1.1bn upgrade of its Port Kembla blast furnace.\nBlueScope was a potential customer and here Vassella couldn't find a commercial case for hydrogen to be used in \nthe blast furnace.\nVassella's No.1 problem was the extremely high energy intensity needed to run the furnace, which he \nconservatively estimated to be 15 times BlueScope's existing energy needs.\nBlueScope is now joining with BHP and Rio Tinto to develop an electric smelting furnace - a process that also relies \non vast amounts of electricity but doesn't need hydrogen.\nBig promise Hydrogen is classic Forrest play - big ambition, and promising something that changes the world.\nBut we should ask whether the business of hydrogen fits the business of Forrest. It is methodical manufacturing and \nrequires buckets of patience. The Japanese government and electricity conglomerates have been working quietly \nbut seriously for decades at solving the hydrogen puzzle.Page 3 of 3\nForrest's credibility hit by green hydrogen collapse\nAll without fanfare.\nForrest promised he could do it and be a global exporter by the end of decade. A surprising number even believed \nhim.\nNo one knows the true financial cost of the green adventure, given transparency was sorely lacking, although next \nmonth's accounts release should shed some light.\nForrest still has dozens of green plans in train, with pilot plants under way and a push to build a green energy \nexpressway from Morocco into Europe.\nHe is also ready to hit \"real net zero\" emissions (without the buy in of carbon credits) for the end of the decade.\nThe promises are still big, but who is going to buy in?\nAI hype?\nInfluential stock picker David Paradice might have some leftover change - some $500,000 - aboard the runaway \nNvidia train, but his own team are going to need more convincing about the benefits of artificial intelligence.\nWhile AI has been the power story on Wall Street, driving names like Microsoft, Amazon and even Nvidia to fresh \nrecord highs, Paradice's own managers have called out the hype behind the tech.\n\"It is not clear to us that at this juncture the monetisation or productivity improvements from AI justifies the hype and \nvery extensive rerating of AI-exposed stocks,\" Paradice's large cap manager Troy Angus has told the $14.5bn fund \nmanager's clients.\nAngus also remains cautious on Australian stocks, tipping a possible interest rate hike here next month, based on \nstrong data around consumption and inflation.\nHe believes the Reserve Bank could be underestimating the impact of strong migration, fiscal stimulus and, \nimportantly, the \"lagged effect\" of EBA agreements which is likely to sustain higher wage inflation and therefore \nspending for some time.\nParadice's Australian Equity Fund posted returns of 12.77 per cent for the year, coming in just below the \nbenchmark S&P/ASX 200 (total return). The fund continues to outperform on three and five-year horizons.\nIn recent weeks Paradice has sold off BHP on a weaker China outlook. But Paradice was not a supporter of the \nmining giant's $65bn bid for Anglo American, which it ultimately abandoned in May after its advances were rejected.\nThe fund also kept the pressure on Qantas, recently meeting new director Nora Scheinkestel who is also in charge \nof the airline's board remuneration committee. Here the issue of nearly $15m in long-term bonus payments to \nformer Qantas boss Alan Joyce was raised - and the prospect of recovery. johnstone@theaustralian.com.au\nLoad-Date: July 18, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | CEO of Fortescue | \"I am not giving up on hydrogen at all.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Vassella | CEO of BlueScope | \"I couldn't find a commercial case for hydrogen to be used in the blast furnace.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
