And the documents also show that a second law firm, Seyfarth Shaw, \nwas also involved in overseeing the investigator's work.\nSeyfarth Shaw was first hired by Fortescue in early 2023 to investigate an anonymous complaint to the company's \nboard that Dr Forrest had had an inappropriate relationship with a Fortescue staff member.\nOn Thursday Justice Brigitte Markovic rejected the orders sought by Element Zero for the instructions issued to \nLancasters, saying they were likely the subject of legal professional privilege and the concerns aired by the three \nmen about the conduct of Fortescue's investigators could be dealt with at a hearing later this month, when Element \nZero will seek to set aside the original search orders and argue for the return of their data.\nLawyers for Element Zero also lost an application to cross-examine Davies Collison Cave lawyer Paul Dewar over \nallegations the law firm's initial evidence to the court to win the secret search orders made material omissions that \nmight have damaged its -application.\nWhile arguing that the cross-examination should not be allowed, Fortescue lawyer Julian Cooke SC also flagged a \ndesire to cross-examine Mr Masterman and Element Zero lawyer Michael Williams, if the Element Zero application \nwas successful. \"I'd seek to cross-examine Mr Masterman and Mr Williams, about their so called privacy concerns,\" \nhe said.\nLoad-Date: August 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
