Traders have priced out the chance of a rate cut by the RBA this year, with \ninvestors instead expecting a 25-basis-point cut early next year.\nAmid a recent run of stronger than expected job numbers, HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham also cautioned that \nthe -labour market would probably have to loosen before the RBA would be confident it could move to cut interest \nrates. \"We've had a pick-up in wages growth, at the same time that we've had quite a weak productivity \nperformance,\" Mr Bloxham said On the local bourse, tech stocks were the top performers, rising 1.7 per cent, \nfollowing a rally on the Nasdaq. WiseTech jumped 2.7 per cent to $91.60 and Xero climbed 1.6 per cent to $121.57.\nResources stocks were mixed. Fortescue fell 0.8 per cent to $24.60 and Rio Tinto fell 0.2 per cent to $129.57, \nwhile BHP advanced 0.2 per cent to $45.50.\nPage 2 of 2\nASX up as investors look to CPI\nGold miners continued their sell-off as the appeal of the safe haven asset faded due to dissipating tensions \nbetween Israel and Iran. While still near their record highs, spot gold prices dipped 0.9 per cent to $US2305.99.\nMiners for the precious metal fell, with Northern Star off 3.5 per cent at $14.74, Ramelius Resources down 4.4 per \ncent at $1.97 and Regis Resources sliding 4.6 per cent to $2.10.\nThe big four banks finished higher, up 1.1 per cent, with CBA leading with a gain of 1.5 per cent to $114.58. \nWestpac rose 0.9 per cent to $25.97 even as it flagged the scrapping of the sale of its RAMS Home Loans \nbusiness. NAB rose 1.3 per cent to $33.84 and ANZ added 0.9 per cent to $28.47.\nEML Payments added 4.4 per cent to $1.07 after Wilson Asset Management's 6.1 per cent stake in the firm was \nannounced. Brambles shed 6.3 per cent to $14.67, its worst intraday loss in more than two years, after its latest \nquarterly update showed the company was no longer on track to hit the top-range of its guidance.\nLifeStyle Communities dived 13.5 per cent to $12.32, to be the worst index performer, after it said it expected a \nlarge reduction in the number of new home settlements this financial year.
