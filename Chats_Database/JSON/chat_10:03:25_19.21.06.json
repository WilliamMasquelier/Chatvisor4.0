Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue mining boss | \"For full year 2025 the bottleneck, as magnetite ramps up, becomes shipping and it does then give us flexibility to ramp up and down hematite and magnetite in that portfolio based on market conditions.\" | N.A. |\n| Apple Paget | Fortescue chief financial officer | \"About 60 per cent of Fortescue Energy's $US700m operating spend would support the development of new green energy projects - including feasibility studies on green hydrogen projects in Norway and Brazil - with the rest allocated to Fortescue Zero, she said.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
