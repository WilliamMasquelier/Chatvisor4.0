Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 26\nLength: 462 words\nByline: Cecile Lefort\nBody\nShares romped higher yesterday, tracking a tech-driven rally on Wall Street ahead of US corporate earnings and \nkey Australian inflation data that will provide clues on the Reserve Bank's next interest rate move.\nThe benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.5 per cent or 34.3 points to 7683.5 extending Monday's 1.1 per cent \ngain. The All Ordinaries also lifted 0.5 per cent to 7937.9.\nOut of the 11 sectors, energy, materials and industrials were in the red.\nEML Payments climbed 4.4 per cent to $1.07 after Wilson Asset Management became a substantial holder with a \n6.1 per cent stake.\nThe big four banks rose and investors overlooked a $164 million charge flagged by Westpac due to reporting \nchanges. Westpac shares rallied 0.9 per cent to $25.97.\nIndex-heavy mining giants were mixed, with Rio Tinto down 0.2 per cent to $129.57 and BHP 0.2 per cent higher to \n$45.50. Fortescue slipped 0.8 per cent to $24.60.\nGold miners suffered after the precious metal lost its safe-haven appeal on fading tensions in the Middle East. Spot \ngold prices fell 0.9 per cent to $US2305.99, away from an all-time high of $US2431.29 earlier this month. Gold has \ngained 12 per cent this year.\nGold producer St Barbara sank 5.5 per cent while Regis Resources, Ramelius and Silver Lake shaved off more \nthan 4 per cent. Meanwhile, Northern Star fell 3.5 per cent to $14.74 following mixed quarterly results due to \nweather conditions.\nTransport and logistics group Brambles was among the biggest laggards. It plunged 6.3 per cent to $14.64 in the \nworst one-day drop in two years after a trading update disappointed investors. Andre Fromyhr at UBS equity \nresearch noted that the company could find it harder to reach the top of its forecast sales guidance.\nPage 2 of 2\nBourse booms but Brambles is left behind Equities\nIn corporate news, developer Lifestyle Communities dived nearly 14 per cent after flagging lower home settlements \nthan expected for fiscal 2024.\nProducer Select Harvests fell nearly 10 per cent after lowering its crop output guidance due to wet weather amid \nsoft conditions for the prices of almonds.\nThe Australian dollar rebounded to US64.53\u00a2, pulling away from a five-month low of US63.6\u00a2 last week when the \nMiddle East conflict escalated.\nLocally, attention will swing to key inflation data today for clues on the Reserve Bank's policy settings.\nThe consumer price index for the March quarter is forecast to show an acceleration to 0.8 per cent, from 0.6 per \ncent. This would take the annual pace slowing to 3.5 per cent, from 4.1 per cent in the year to December. Even so, \nthis would still be well outside the RBA's 2 per cent to 3 per cent target.\nThe market is fully priced for the RBA to start easing, but not before 2025.\nThe central bank has lifted the cash rate 13 times to 4.35 per cent to tame inflation, which peaked close to 8 per \ncent in 2022.\nLoad-Date: April 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Ramelius Resources.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
