It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nGenex seeks new solar buyers\nGenex seeks new solar buyers\nThe Australian\nApril 3, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 813 words\nByline: NICK EVANS\nBody\nFortescue has allowed a key deadline to buy green energy for its stalled Gibson Island hydrogen plant to lapse, as \nrenewable energy company Genex says it is talking to other potential buyers for energy from its proposed Bulli \nCreek solar farm.\nThe lapse throws fresh doubt over the viability of the Gibson Island project, once the flagship of Fortescue's \nproposed hydrogen production centres in Australia, but which the company has seemingly set aside as it struggles \nto find returns at Australian power prices.\nThe failure of Fortescue to meet a twice-extended March 31 deadline to make a final investment decision on \nbuilding a hydrogen production plant at Incitec Pivot's former Queensland fertiliser plant also has Genex scrambling \nto find a replacement to anchor the generation hub's construction.\nThe Andrew Forrest-led company signed a deal with Genex for up to 337.5 megawatts of annual capacity from the \nproposed 2GW solar farm in October 2023. The deal was to underpin the first 450MW stage of the solar farm's \nconstruction, allowing Genex to look for additional contracts to upsize its construction to 775MW and target an \neventual 2GW of solar and battery capacity.\nBut, despite long having flagged plans to make a final investment decision by the end of 2023 - along with partner \nIncitec Pivot - Fortescue dropped Gibson Island from its top priority list only six weeks after signing on with Genex, \nsaying it was still working on front-end engineering and design studies \"as Australia struggles to shed its petrostate \nstatus and still suffers structurally high green electricity costs\".\nIn December, Genex extended Fortescue's deadline to make a final investment decision until the end of February, \nthen tacked on an additional month.\nThat deadline has also lapsed and, while Genex said on Tuesday a path was still open for Fortescue to buy power \nfrom the proposed 5000ha solar farm, the company also flagged talks with alternative buyers for the energy.\nPage 2 of 2\nGenex seeks new solar buyers\nGenex said Fortescue had -neither satisfied or waived the construction by the new March 31 deadline, leaving the \ndoor ajar for the iron ore and would-be renewable energy major to make good on the October power purchase \nagreement.\nIncitec declined to comment on Tuesday, but a Fortescue spokeswoman said the company was still \"progressing\" \nthe Gibson Island project, but \"we have more work to do\". She said: \"We are approaching this project with the same \nfinancial discipline Fortescue has shown for 20 years.\" But Genex said it was also involved in ongoing talks over \nadditional power contracts, and Fortescue's failure to meet the latest deadline \"has no material impact on the \nproject timeline or such discussions\" - despite confirming that it believed the agreement was on foot, and must be \nconfirmed or terminated before the company could close financing for Bulli Creek.\n\"Genex is continuing discussions with external parties for further solar offtake which would allow the initial capacity \nof the project to be increased to up to 775MW to become the largest grid-connected solar farm in Australia,\" the \ncompany said.\n\"Genex continues to expect that such discussions will conclude and the size of Bulli Creek confirmed by mid-2024, \nwhich will support the target of a final investment decision for the first-stage project in the second half of the year.\" \nHydrogen produced at Gibson Island was to have been used to produce ammonia at Incitec's mothballed fertiliser \nplant nearby.\nThe Australian understands a key factor in the decision to put the project on the backburner last year was \nFortescue's failure to find an external buyer for ammonia from the plant, with Incitec rival Orica believed to have \nturned down an offtake agreement unless Fortescue guaranteed it would then buy explosives produced using the \nplant's ammonia for use at its own mines.\nAnalysts have long doubted the viability of Gibson Island, with Goldman analysts last year tipping construction costs \nof $US1.5bn ($2.3bn) and production costs of about $US5.50-$US6 a kilogram of hydrogen.\nGenex shares closed up 1c at $25.5c on Tuesday, with Fortescue down 28c at $25.42.\nA month ago Genex received a $381m takeover bid from Japan's Electric Power Development, known as J-Power, \none of Japan's largest electricity companies, sending shares in the pure-play renewable energy developer up more \n30 per cent. Genex said on Tuesday the exclusivity period had been extended to April 8 with a view to reaching a \ndeal.\nJ-Power has also offered a back-up offer to secure Genex in the event that not enough of Genex's shareholders \nvote in favour of the bid. J-Power is offering a slightly lower amount of 27c in cash that is conditional on support \nfrom Genex shareholders owning at least 50.1 per cent of the Australian renewable energy company. The \nalternative structure comes amid concerns that a one-time suitor for Genex, Skip Capital, could block the deal.\nLoad-Date: April 2, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
