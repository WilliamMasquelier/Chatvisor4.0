Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 24\nLength: 384 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue has pumped more money into its decade-long search for copper and gold in NSW by taking a 19.9 per \ncent stake in ASX-listed minnow Magmatic Resources.\nPre-revenue Magmatic has been drilling for copper, gold and silver near Narromine, a geological district made \nfamous by big copper and gold mines such as Newmont's Cadia and Evolution Mining's Northparkes operation.\nFortescue has been trying to find the extension of Cadia's rich gold and copper geology for the best part of a \ndecade, after previously helping to fund exploration in the district through a privately held explorer called Gold and \nCopper Resources.\nThe iron ore miner will pay $3.7 million for a 19.9 per cent stake in Magmatic, which also has exploration projects \nnear Parkes and Wellington.\nFortescue will spend at least a further $3 million on drilling at Magmatic's Myall prospect near Narromine.\n\"Myall has many of the signatures of a tier 1 copper-gold deposit and Magmatic has recognised the need to partner \nwith a major to further advance the project following the maiden resource,\" Magmatic executive chairman David \nRichardson said.\nThe iron ore miner could spend a total of $17.7 million over six years on drilling Magmatic's targets and buying \nshares. Under that scenario, Fortescue would emerge with 19.9 per cent of Magmatic and 75 per cent ownership \nof the Myall project. The partnership illustrates the effort Fortescue is making to diversify into other minerals, as \nwell as its highly publicised pivot into clean energy products.\nFortescue has explored extensively across Western Australia and South America for minerals such as lithium and \ncopper and has also stated an interest in rare earth elements.\nMagmatic shares rose by more than 37 per cent after Fortescue's interest was revealed on Friday, earning it a \nmarket capitalisation of $19 million. Fortescue will pay 4.884\u00a2 for each of the shares it subscribes for.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue's NSW copper punt with Magmatic Metals\nAs long as its shareholding remains below the 20 per cent threshold, Fortescue will have the right to one Magmatic \nboard seat. If its ownership increases, Fortescue gets the right to another seat provided its grip on the register is \nsustained at 20 per cent or higher.\nMagmatic shares raced ahead of Fortescue's subscription price, fetching the highest level since December.\nMagmatic shares rose 38 per cent.\nLoad-Date: March 11, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| David Richardson | Magmatic executive chairman | \"Myall has many of the signatures of a tier 1 copper-gold deposit and Magmatic has recognised the need to partner with a major to further advance the project following the maiden resource.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
