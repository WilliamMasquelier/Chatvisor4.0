However, he ruled out any further M&A with Ramelius or any other player.\nPage 2 of 2\nBattle for relevance a key driver for more gold mining deals - DATA ROOM\n\"We have to just focus on what we have now,\" he said.\n\"This is a big jump for us, and we have doubled the size of the business overnight and so the expectation on the \nbusiness is very high.\" Westgold mines in the Murchison and Southern Goldfields regions of WA has a tenure of \nmore than 3200sq km, operating six underground mines and five processing plants.\nLoad-Date: August 6, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Wayne Bramwell | Managing Director of Westgold Resources | \"Capital markets are shrinking in certain areas, so it is not just about being profitable but relevant.\" | N.A. |\n| Wayne Bramwell | Managing Director of Westgold Resources | \"Now we have moved above that space, we are more relevant to a broader audience.\" | N.A. |\n| Wayne Bramwell | Managing Director of Westgold Resources | \"We have to just focus on what we have now.\" | N.A. |\n| Wayne Bramwell | Managing Director of Westgold Resources | \"This is a big jump for us, and we have doubled the size of the business overnight and so the expectation on the business is very high.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
