All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 69\nLength: 133 words\nByline: Emily Hawkins\nBody\nTHE world's largest offshore wind developer Orsted has ditched plans for a mega plant to develop green fuels - \nbecoming the latest company to scale back commitments to switch to cleaner energy such as hydrogen and wind.\nIt had been building a hub in Sweden for use by sectors from shipping to aviation.\nThrough combined hydrogen and carbon dioxide, the facility would have produced 55,000 tons per year of e-\nmethane.\nBut chief executive Mads Nipper said: 'The business case has deteriorated due to the inability to sign long-term \nofftake contracts at sustainable pricing and significantly higher project costs.'\nThe move to halt work has cost \u00a3172m. Orsted is a major player in the sector and is set to build an \u00a38bn offshore \nwind farm in the North Sea by the end of 2027 to power more than 3.3m UK homes.\nGraphic\n \nBlow: Orsted is the largest offshore wind developer\nLoad-Date: August 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n            ",
