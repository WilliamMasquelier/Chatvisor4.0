It is unclear what he \nmeant by the comments, which came as he reiterated that Fortescue intended to spend \"at least $US6.5bn\" to \ndecarbonise its iron ore operations.\nCiti analysts said it had been a strong quarter in the core iron ore business based on output and lower production \ncosts, but disappointing in terms of cash generation as there was only a slight reduction in net debt. Fortescue \nshares fell 2.2 per cent on Thursday to $18.62.\nLoad-Date: January 23, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
