Mr Lange was appointed as the president of \nFortescue Energy's European operations in March 2023, tasked with helping Fortescue make good on its big \npromises about the production of green energy and hydrogen across Europe.\nAt the same time long-term company secretary Cameron Wilson is set to take a step back from Fortescue, initially \nshifting to a part-time role as he hands over duties at the company. Mr Wilson's decision comes only a few months \nafter the departure of co-company secretary and Fortescue general counsel Gemma Tually, who stepped down \nfrom the role in November 2023.\n\"We are delighted that (Cameron) has agreed to continue with the company on a part-time basis to ensure a \nsmooth transition,\" a Fortescue spokesman said.\nBoth of those moves come amid a fresh wave of senior executive losses at Fortescue.\nFormer Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner quit the company earlier this month, after only 15 months \nwith Fortescue's Energy arm. Initially appointed as Fortescue Energy's Head of Northern Australia in late 2022, Mr \nGunner finished his period with Fortescue as the head of business development for Australia and New Zealand.\nThis year Fortescue Energy also lost the services of chief financial officer Deborah Caudle, less than five months \nafter she was appointed to the role, with former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also formally severing ties with the \ncompany, and external affairs boss Fiona Sugden leaving to join the office of current Prime Minister Anthony \nAlbanese.\nThe departure of Mr Lange - also once an executive director of Fortescue's WAE arm in Britain - extends the \nuncertainty around the company's progress in establishing a hydrogen and green energy production hub in Europe.\nIn 2022 Fortescue committed to delivering as much as five million tonnes of green hydrogen a year to German \ngiant E. ON, one of Europe's largest power companies, with the start of deliveries around 2030.\nThe company also bought into a German import terminal in late 2022, and has said its first European green \nhydrogen plant is likely to be in Norway.\nBut the company also missed a self-imposed deadline to make a final investment decision on up to five green \nenergy projects by the end of 2023, instead saying it had \"fast-tracked\" an investment decision on its Holmaset \nproject in Norway.\nShipping news As blockbuster names go for decisions at next week's High Court sittings, you couldn't do much \nbetter than a showdown between Indian billionaire Gautam Adani and British metals magnate Sanjeev Gupta.\nOn a first glance, the prospect of a High Court call on a gloves-off stoush in the nation's top court between the \nAdani Group's Carmichael coal mine and Gupta's Whyalla steelworks should have security guards wedging them \ninto the aisles with crowbars in Court No 1 in Canberra on Wednesday.\nSadly, the reality falls far short of Margin Call's hopes, expectations and sensationalist attempts to fool our loyal \nreaders into reading the last third of this column.\nWhile the case does indeed involve companies associated with both men - along with a shipping line - the actual \ndispute troubling the court appears to be the most pointless pile of guff to ever be billed in eight-minute increments \nby King's Counsel.\nEssentially, the dispute is this: Carmichael commissioned Gupta's South Australian steelworks to manufacture 8669 \nindividual steel rails for its railway line.\nWhyalla did so, and bunged them onto a ship in South Australia - owned by BBC Chartering Carriers GmbH - \nbound for Queensland's Galilee basin.Page 3 of 3\nNew chief executive pays price\nAs it turns out, somebody failed to tie them down properly in the ship's hold, so the rails apparently got bounced \naround a bit in transit, rendering them unfit for use as railway lines when they finally arrived in Mackay.\nAs a result Carmichael was forced to flog the lot off for scrap, fetching $656,998.51. The Adani group now, not \nunreasonably, wants someone to cough up for the difference in what it paid for the rails and what it received from \nthe scrap merchants.\nAlthough the court documents don't make it clear exactly how much is at stake, the total sum is likely to be a fair bit \nsouth of $10m, steel industry sources suggest.\nOn the face of it, a pretty simple commercial dispute, with only one likely outcome. But, no! As the matter \napproached hearings in the Federal Court over who should pay, shipping line BBC launched a bid to move the case \nto arbitration in London.\nAnd, as is known by all close followers of admiralty and maritime law (may God protect their eternal souls), the \nAustralian and British laws on the subject may read the same, but are interpreted very differently - with the British \ninterpretation likely to reduce the liability of the shipping company.\nThe issue now facing the High Court is whether to allow this type of jurisdiction shopping, or not. Lawyers of our \nacquaintance insist it could be an immensely important point of law at some other point, or the High Court wouldn't \nbother hearing it. Irrespective, Margin Call is betting the legal teams will make more money than the cargo was \nworth by the time the case is done.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Billionaires battle it out in High Court clash\nLoad-Date: February 9, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
