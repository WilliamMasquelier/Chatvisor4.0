Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Sam Berridge | Resources analyst | \"We're not even close to the end of these sorts of results.\" | N.A. |\n| Sam Berridge | Resources analyst | \"The slump in iron ore prices over the past 12 months is largely a result of weak demand from China ... we haven't even had a meaningful increase in supply yet.\" | N.A. |\n| Sam Berridge | Resources analyst | \"There's high-cost production still online today which needs to get bumped off the end of the cost curve by that incoming supply from Guinea.\" | N.A. |\n| Robert Rennie | Head of commodity strategy at Westpac | \"It's clear that exports from Australia will definitely have been impacted at the same time as heavy rainfall in Brazil has added to concerns about supply.\" | N.A. |\n| Mike Henry | BHP chief executive | \"I was seeing early signs of recovery in the Chinese economy.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
