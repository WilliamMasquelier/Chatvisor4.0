Mr Forrest flew on to the Moroccan capital Rabat on Tuesday night.\nMs Benali was part of the official reception committee who welcomed Mr Forrest to Rabat in February after they had \nboth been in the Swiss town of Davos a month earlier.\nPage 2 of 2\nTwiggy's Moroccan energiser\nMr Forrest split from his wife Nicola after 31 years of marriage last year and announced they had agreed to \"live \napart\" with no mention of a divorce. This is the first time he has been romantically linked publicly with anyone else.\nMs Benali is an energy expert who was appointed Morocco's Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable \nDevelopment in 2021 and in that role sits on the board of the state-owned OCP group that Fortescue is partnering \nwith. A Fortescue spokesman said yesterday: \"The Fortescue team is working with key stakeholders as we \ncontinue to develop our ambitious strategy with OCP, developed over more than two years, to develop green \nenergy, hydrogen and ammonia in Morocco.\nLoad-Date: May 29, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
