Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 657 words\nHighlight: Mining giant says it will lift spending on its green energy division this year despite setbacks tempering its \nambitious green hydrogen targets.\nBody\nMining giant Fortescue says it will lift spending on green energy technology over the next year and has reaffirmed \nits commitment to developing zero-emissions hydrogen despite scaling back ambitions to produce 15 million tonnes \nof the fuel a year by 2030.\nBillionaire Andrew Forrest, Fortescue's founder and executive chairman, has had to hit the brakes on the speed \nand scale of his plans to diversify the world's fourth-largest iron ore miner into a green hydrogen superpower, \nblaming the high cost and the vast amount of renewable energy required to split hydrogen from water.\nLink to Image\nDominic Lorrimer\nPerth-based Fortescue last week announced it would slash 700 jobs, put its 2030 hydrogen target on hold and \nmerge its green energy and iron ore divisions to reduce duplication and costs.\nHowever, in a briefing on Thursday, Fortescue Energy boss Mark Hutchinson reaffirmed to investors that the \ncompany was \"steadfast\" in its commitment to scale up and commercialise green hydrogen - the name for hydrogen \nmade using an electrolyser powered by renewable energy to ensure the end product is emissions-free.\nFortescue had initially allocated capital expenditure of $US300 million ($457 million) for its energy division for the \ncoming 12 months, but that figure was increased to $US500 million ($763 million) on Thursday. The division's \noperating expenditure would rise from a maximum of $500 million to $700 million, the company said.\n\"I want to make it really clear: Fortescue is steadfast in our commitment to green hydrogen,\" Hutchinson said. \n\"However, our financial discipline always comes first, and we will never do projects that are not economically \nviable.\"\nSince 2020, Forrest has toured the world promoting the virtues of green hydrogen and seeking to partner with \ngovernments that have areas suitable for producing the vast amounts of wind, solar or hydropower required.\nGreen hydrogen is considered a promising future fuel due to its potential to displace fossil fuels and help \ndecarbonise industrial processes, such as steel-making, that cannot be simply electrified. However it remains \nPage 2 of 2\nForrest's Fortescue boosts spending to keep green hydrogen dream alive\nprohibitively expensive to make and is not yet viable at scale, with most of today's hydrogen still made using fossil \nfuels.\nHutchinson on Thursday said it had become apparent that the ability to source renewable electricity at a cost of \naround $US30 ($45.80) a megawatt-hour was essential for a project to be viable.\nIn jurisdictions where power was more expensive, he added, Fortescue would invest in plans to build renewable \nenergy generators, including in Western Australia and Queensland.\n\"Where the power costs are not at this level, we will work steadfastly with those economies to help bring down the \ncost of electricity by producing electrons,\" he said.\nFortescue will initially focus on four key green hydrogen projects in Australia, the United States, Norway and Brazil. \nFurther projects in Morocco, Oman, Egypt and Jordan would follow, the company said.\n\"We totally believe green hydrogen is what the world ultimately needs, that is why we will continue to maintain a \nsignificant portfolio of projects,\" Hutchinson said.\nThe update on Fortescue's green hydrogen strategy came as the company reported record quarterly exports of the \nlucrative steel-making raw material iron ore from its mines in WA.\n\"It's been an outstanding quarter by the team who rallied together to deliver record iron ore shipments of 53.7 \nmillion tonnes, which was 10 per cent higher than the June quarter last year,\" Fortescue Metals chief executive \nDino Otranto said.\n\"This record result demonstrated the efficiencies gained through our recovery plan following the ore car derailment \nin December 2023.\"\nThe Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day's trading.
