Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: FEATURES; Pg. 5\nLength: 558 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue Energy boss Mark Hutchinson says Australia must get power prices down to about $US30 ($45.36) a \nmegawatt hour if it wants to be a hydrogen superpower, under a goal that would effectively require a halving of \npower prices across much of the eastern states.\nMr Hutchinson's power price challenge came as he warned that Fortescue and Incitec Pivot would find it \"tough\" to \nproceed with a plan to retrofit Queensland's Gibson Island fertiliser plant towards a future in hydrogen and ammonia \nunless governments helped mitigate the high cost of clean energy.\nGibson Island had traditionally consumed large volumes of methane gas - a compound of carbon and hydrogen - to \nmake ammonia, which is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen.\nBut Fortescue, Incitec and taxpayer agencies such as the Australian Renewable Energy Agency have funded \nstudies into a retrofit of Gibson Island, where an electrolyser would make green hydrogen at the site for synthesis \nwith nitrogen to make \"green ammonia\".\nGreen ammonia can be combusted as a source of energy but is also considered the easiest way to transport \nhydrogen long distances.\nFortescue was expected to take a final investment decision on Gibson Island in late 2023, but the project has not \nyet been approved and the company contracted to supply solar power to the project, Genex, has given Fortescue \nuntil March 31 to decide.\nMr Hutchinson told The Australian Financial Review Business Summit that high power prices were the main \nimpediment at Gibson Island.\n\"We've been working very, very hard on it,\" he said. \"But it's tough based on the current power prices when we're \nlooking at competing globally. It's a tough decision.\n\"So we're working very closely with the Queensland government and federal government to figure out a way to \nmake it happen because it's a bit of a litmus test for the rest of the hydrogen industry in Australia, to be honest.\nPage 2 of 2\nHydrogen's half price challenge Clean energy\n\"We're very keen to get it up.\"\n\"Green\" hydrogen can be made with zero or low carbon emissions if renewable electricity is passed through water \nto separate the fluid into its constituent parts, oxygen and hydrogen.\nFortescue has travelled the world over the past five years searching for the cheapest sources of clean power to \ngenerate affordable green hydrogen.\nThe company expects to approve a green hydrogen project in Norway this year which would be powered by carbon-\nfree hydroelectricity.\n\"If you look around the world where you can get cheap renewable power, competitive renewable power is below \n$US30 a megawatt hour,\" he said.\n\"That should really be the target and particularly when you're looking at really what will be a global market to supply \ngreen ammonia, green hydrogen. So that's kind of the goal.\"\nAverage annual power prices were above $100 per megawatt hour in NSW, Queensland and South Australia in \n2023, according to data published by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER).\nThe same AER data found average annual power prices in Tasmania were $56 per megawatt hour while Victorian \nprices averaged slightly higher than Tasmania.\nAsked about the large number of departures from Fortescue's executive ranks over the past four years, Mr \nHutchinson said new recruits needed to fit into the company's unique culture, not vice versa.\n\"Some people come in and think they [have to] fix it,\" he said. \"That's just not Fortescue. We don't need to be \nfixed.\"\nLoad-Date: March 14, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Peter Ker\nDate: March 12, 2024\nTitle: Hydrogen's half price challenge\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Australia: Fortescue Metals Group Owns Trademark for 'FORTESCUE CAPITAL'\n## Media outlet: Australian Government News\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: March 20, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nAustralia: Fortescue Metals Group Owns Trademark for ' FORTESCUE CAPITAL'\nAustralia: Fortescue Metals Group Owns Trademark for 'FORTESCUE \nCAPITAL'\nAustralian Government News\nMarch 20, 2024 Wednesday 2:16 AM  EST\nCopyright 2024 HT Media Limited.

Our population is hard- working. Our population is \nsmart. Our population is determined. We just happen to have all the resources which China doesn't,\" he said.\nThe iron ore and clean energy entrepreneur was speaking from Beijing, where he has been meeting with China's \nleaders. Over the weekend, along with BHP CEO Mike Henry and Rio Tinto's Jakob Stausholm, he was at the \nChina Development Forum, an event held in Beijing as many international businesses have been debating their \nfuture in the world's second-biggest economy.\nDr Forrest said Beijing was being \"very welcoming\" of international businesses, but the tense geopolitical \nenvironment posed challenges. \"It's becoming more difficult because of bellicose North American attitudes. And \nChina kicks an own goal through these cyber activities into democratic institutions. That is just intolerable,\" he told \nThe Australian.\nPage 2 of 3\nChalmers right on economy: Forrest\nOn Tuesday, Foreign Minister Penny Wong joined her counterparts from Britain, the US and New Zealand in calling \nout \"China state-backed actors\" that had targeted democratic institutions and parliamentarians in Britain.\nDr Forrest said that China's cyber interference \"might not be an act of war, but it's hostile\".\n\"I feel that China is such a huge and vast organisation that, generally, it's attitude is to be very friendly with the rest \nof the world. But it does trip up,\" he said.\nBeijing never interfered with supplies of iron ore during its economic coercion campaign on Australia, but the tense \nrelationship raised anxiety among all China-exposed businesses. Later this week, Beijing is expected to remove the \npunitive tariffs it imposed on the Australian wine industry in November 2020.\nDr Forrest welcomed the improvement in the relationship, which he said had gone from \"childish and politically \nmotivated\" to \"maturity\".\n\"I see a real consolidation of the relationship and trust building back into the Australia-China bilateral relationship. \nAnd that is necessary to continue the growth of the economies of both countries,\" he said.\nChina-reliant miners BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue are -Australia's three biggest taxpayers. A fall in iron ore prices \nby almost 25 per cent this year to just over $US105 a tonne ($160 a tonne) is being closely watched by the \nTreasury in Canberra.\nThe founder of Fortescue, the \"third force\" of Australia's iron ore export trade, said he remained confident about \nthe \"constant demand\" from China's steelmaking industry.\n\"Ebbs and flows, for sure, you see that. But the big mega trends are unchanged,\" he said.\nHe said a private dinner on Sunday night with Yi Gang, the former governor of the People's Bank of China, had \nreaffirmed that confidence.\nThe country's former central bank chief, who stood down last July, detailed various fiscal stimulus measures Beijing \nwas using to support housing, car ownership and the purchase of other big consumer items.\nDr Forrest said China's latest growth target of \"about 5 per cent\" announced by Premier Li Qiang earlier this month \nwould have been \"a bit of a yawn\" a decade ago. But he said growth at that rate for an economy as \"massive\" as \nChina's now would lead to \"a serious increase in goods and services \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 from around the world\".\nOn Thursday, the Fortescue founder will speak at the Boao Forum, another business forum held on China's \nHainan island.\nDr Forrest's address will focus on the clean energy transition and China's role in it.\nSince last year's Boao Forum, Beijing has built and installed 260 to 300 gigawatts of renewable energy generation, \naccording to analysts at Bloomberg.\nThat \"huge uptick\" has supported Fortescue's iron ore business, which is being used in \"all the infrastructure it \ntakes to create green energy and connect it to the grid,\" Dr Forrest said.\nLast week, industry leaders at an oil and gas conference in Houston said the huge infrastructure rollout to support \nenergy grids, along with power-hungry artificial intelligence data centres and world population increases, were \nextending the commercial viability of fossil fuels.\nDr Forrest said those comments had been useful for exposing the \"lip service\" of the fossil fuel industry only months \nafter climate scientists declared 2023 the hottest year on record.Page 3 of 3\nChalmers right on economy: Forrest\n\"The climate is going to hell in a handbag unless we turn it around,\" he told The Australian. \"The fossil fuel \nindustry's lip service to the energy transition is no more than that. It's like carbon sequestration. It's literally the \nsame old lie but waiting for the next new idiot to come along and believe it,\" he said.\nLoad-Date: March 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Will Glasgow\nDate: March 27, 2024\nTitle: Chalmers right on economy: Forrest\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Genex seeks new solar buyers\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Nick Evans\n### Date: April 03, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nGenex seeks new solar buyers\nGenex seeks new solar buyers\nThe Australian\nApril 3, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 813 words\nByline: NICK EVANS\nBody\nFortescue has allowed a key deadline to buy green energy for its stalled Gibson Island hydrogen plant to lapse, as \nrenewable energy company Genex says it is talking to other potential buyers for energy from its proposed Bulli \nCreek solar farm.\nThe lapse throws fresh doubt over the viability of the Gibson Island project, once the flagship of Fortescue's \nproposed hydrogen production centres in Australia, but which the company has seemingly set aside as it struggles \nto find returns at Australian power prices.\nThe failure of Fortescue to meet a twice-extended March 31 deadline to make a final investment decision on \nbuilding a hydrogen production plant at Incitec Pivot's former Queensland fertiliser plant also has Genex scrambling \nto find a replacement to anchor the generation hub's construction.\nThe Andrew Forrest-led company signed a deal with Genex for up to 337.5 megawatts of annual capacity from the \nproposed 2GW solar farm in October 2023.",
