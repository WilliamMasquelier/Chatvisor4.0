Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Ramelius Resources based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Ramelius Resources is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Ramelius Resources.\n\nIf Ramelius Resources is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nBellevue belted as mine fails forecast\nBellevue belted as mine fails forecast\nThe Australian\nJanuary 7, 2025 Tuesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 15\nLength: 492 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nBellevue Gold faces questions over its ability to live up to production targets after slashing guidance for financial \nyear 2025 amid teething problems at its namesake mine in Western Australia.\nPerth-headquartered Bellevue on Monday slashed gold production guidance to 150,000-165,000 ounces, down \nfrom 165,000-180,000 ounces, blaming grade and other issues for weaker-than-expected output.\nBellevue said it would update the market on its 2024-25 cost guidance in its December quarter production report \ndue before the end of the month. The company's share price closed down nearly 14 per cent at 98c.\nMoelis Australia's Paul Hissey said the Bellevue update appeared to manifest concerns about the miner's ability to \nramp up head grades and would do little to silence a growing chorus of doubters.\n\"There is also some abstruse disclosure in the result which a sceptic may choose to infer additional \nunderperformance for the quarter,\" he said.\n\"We retain our neutral investment view ...\" Bellevue said it was on track to produce 90,000 ounces from what has \nbeen touted as one of Australia's highest-grade gold mines in the six months to June 30. On an annualised basis, \nthat would equal the top range of original 2024-25 guidance of 180,000 ounces. Bellevue also said it would reach \nan annual production rate of 200,000 ounces from early in the June quarter.\nBellevue has a five-year growth plan to produce 250,000 ounces annually by 2027-28, and said in October that it \nhad completed key infrastructure upgrades and was on track to hit the original 2024-25 guidance.\nOn Monday, Bellevue said gold sales in the December quarter totalled 26,230 ounces at an average sale price of \n$3339 an ounce, and it had $81m in cash and gold on hand compared to $109m at the end of the September \nquarter.\nBellevue said it encountered lower grades and geological variability in mining of the outer edges of the main ore in \nthe December quarter. The Bellevue update coincided with updates from two other gold producers - considered \ncentral players in sector consolidation.\nPage 2 of 2\nBellevue belted as mine fails forecast\nGold Road said its Gruyere mine, owned in partnership with Gold Fields, produced a quarterly record 91,631 \nounces in the three months to December 31.\nGruyere, operated and managed by Gold Fields, produced 287,270 ounces across 2024, below annual guidance of \n290,000-305,000 ounces.\nGold Road owns 17 per cent of De Grey Mining, the target of a $5bn takeover offer from Northern Star, and is \nshaping up as a potential king maker if a rival offer emerges.\nIn its December quarter update, Ramelius Resource hailed record free cash flow of $174.5m before splashing out \n$68m to increase its stake in Spartan Resources to 19.9 per cent and dividend payments of $43.4m. Ramelius, \nled by noted deal-maker Mark Zeptner, took its investment in Spartan from 18.3 per cent to the takeover brink in \nDecember after participating in a $220m Spartan capital raising aimed at restarting mining at the Dalgaranga \nproject in WA.\nLoad-Date: January 6, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Ramelius Resources.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
