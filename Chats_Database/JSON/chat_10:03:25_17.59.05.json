It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 3\n'Foreign agent': Forrest named in Exxon lawsuit\n'Foreign agent': Forrest named in Exxon lawsuit\nThe Australian\nJanuary 9, 2025 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: THENATION; Pg. 2\nLength: 1173 words\nByline: Paul Garvey\nBody\nAndrew Forrest has been accused of being a foreign agent who is orchestrating \"smear campaigns\" against the oil \nand gas sector to further his own commercial ambitions, in a bombshell lawsuit by global giant ExxonMobil.\nDr Forrest, his mining company Fortescue and his philanthropic arm Minderoo have all been mentioned in a \nlawsuit filed in Texas this week by Exxon, in which the oil and gas company accused California Attorney-General \nRob Bonta, several US environmental groups and Dr Forrest's Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund of \ndefamation.\nThe lawsuit argues that Dr Forrest effectively enlisted US environmental organisations Sierra Club, Surfrider, Heal \nthe Bay, and San Francisco Baykeeper as his US proxies to launch lawsuits against ExxonMobil and its advanced \nplastic recycling ambitions.\nIn a statement, Dr Forrest said the lawsuit was no surprise and was \"right out of the oil & gas industry playbook\".\n\"I am personally delighted Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-\nexamination,\" Dr Forrest said.\n\"The fossil fuel industry is -getting increasingly desperate at maintaining its toxic grip on -society. Their only priority \nis to maximise their profits and -produce as much oil and gas as possible.\" Exxon's complaint said the case was \nabout \"the corrupting influence of foreign money in the American legal system and \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the sordid for-profit \nincentives and outright greed that tries to hide behind so-called public impact litigation\".\nThe case focuses on the role of IEFJ, a charity established by Dr Forrest and run out of the Mounts Bay Road \nheadquarters of Minderoo and his Tattarang -family office.\nAccording to the lawsuit, IEFJ, Exxon says, has directed hundreds of thousands of dollars to US law firm Cotchett, \nPitre & McCarthy to help \"smear campaigns\" by Mr Bonta and US not-for-profits against Exxon and its plans to \nexpand its plastic recycling operations. Mr Bonta has branded Exxon's recycling ambitions as a \"myth\" and a \n\"sham\".\nPage 2 of 3\n'Foreign agent': Forrest named in Exxon lawsuit\n\"Why would Mr Bonta or -anyone who claims to be serious about cleaning up the environment and helping solve \nthe plastic-waste issue take such extreme measures to shut down the emerging and developing advanced recycling \nindustry?\" the Exxon complaint said \"The answer is foreign influence, personal ambition, and a murky source of \nfinancing rife with conflicting business interests.\n\"With apparently no appreciation for the irony of their claim, Mr Bonta and his cohorts are now engaging in reverse \ngreen-washing; while posing under the banner of environmentalism, they do damage to genuine recycling programs \nand to meaningful innovation.\" Exxon noted in its complaint that Dr Forrest was the largest shareholder in \nFortescue, which it said was competing with Exxon in the low-carbon-solutions and energy-transition sector.\nThe company described efforts by Dr Forrest and Fortescue to transform the miner into a green-energy \npowerhouse, including its ambition to sell green hydrogen to the world in competition with American oil and gas \nproducers. Those plans have since been radically scaled back.\n\"Having failed to successfully compete against ExxonMobil in the marketplace, Fortescue has, on information and \nbelief, orchestrated a campaign to compete by turning the wheels of American justice to the company's self-\ninterested purposes,\" the Exxon complaint said. \"More specifically, Fortescue funds Minderoo, which owns and \ncontrols the IEJF, which hired an American law firm to bring claims against ExxonMobil on behalf of the US \nProxies.\" (Minderoo says Exxon's description of its relationship to IEFJ is incorrect.) Exxon said the scale and \nnature of IEFJ's engagement with US law firm Cotchett was significant enough to require the firm to register itself as \na foreign agent under the US Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\"Together, Bonta and the US Proxies - the former for political gain and the latter pawns for the Foreign Interests - \nhave engaged in a deliberate smear campaign against ExxonMobil, falsely claiming that ExxonMobil's effective and \ninnovative advanced recycling technology is a 'false promise' and 'not based on truth',\" the complaint said.\nMr Bonta has accused Exxon of simply stockpiling, rather than recycling, plastic waste it had collected and has \nlabelled Exxon's advanced recycling \"a false promise\". Those attacks, Exxon said, had had a \"chilling effect\" on its \nability to attract third-party customers and secure permits.\nExxon noted in its lawsuit that Dr Forrest himself had in a 2019 TED Talk talked up the merits of advanced plastics \nrecycling, when he called for a voluntary levy on virgin plastics to help make the economics of advanced plastics \nrecycling more competitive.\nDr Forrest's Fortescue, while named in the complaint, is not a party to the lawsuit.\nThe accusations of foreign influence driving legal activism against the oil and gas sector echo accusations levelled \nagainst Australia's Environmental Defenders Office in the wake of its failed legal challenge against Santos and its \nBarossa gas project.\nThe EDO receives a significant portion of its donations from foreign sources. Opposition resources spokeswoman \nSusan McDonald has repeatedly called for greater transparency over the origins of that offshore funding.\nDr Forrest said he was dedicated to steering the world away from a future reliant on fossil fuels, and said any \naccusation of commercial benefit was completely false. \"The fossil-fuel industry know they are on borrowed time \nand that technological solutions exist to phase out fossil fuels,\" he said. \"If the company I founded, Fortescue, one \nof Australia's biggest polluters and most successful companies can profitably cease the use of fossil fuels and go \n'real zero' by 2030 - in just five years - heavy industry will be quick to follow.\" A Fortescue spokesman said the \ncompany rejected the assertions made against it in the lawsuit, including that it had orchestrated litigation against \nExxon to gain a competitive advantage.\n\"While the world was in turmoil in 2021, Fortescue seized the opportunity to meet with governments around the \nworld to begin its green transformation and this has been pivotal to setting the company up for its future success,\" \nthe spokesman said.Page 3 of 3\n'Foreign agent': Forrest named in Exxon lawsuit\n\"Fortescue has an industry-leading plan to stop burning fossil fuels and achieve 'real zero' across its Australian iron \nore operations by the end of the decade. It is this commitment that continues to set the bar for other companies - \nincluding those in the oil and gas industry - to follow.\" A Minderoo spokesman said it was clear that recycling was \nnot an effective means to curb the environmental and human health harms of plastics. \"Minderoo Foundation is \ncommitted to reducing the production of plastics which have a devastating impact on human health, with exposure \nto chemicals found in plastics increasing risks throughout the entire human life cycle, including impacting birth \noutcomes, child neurodevelopment, reproductive health, and metabolic, endocrine and nutrition systems,\" the \nspokesman said.\nLoad-Date: January 8, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
