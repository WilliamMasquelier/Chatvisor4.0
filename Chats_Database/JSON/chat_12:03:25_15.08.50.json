The company had almost 85,000 workers at the end of fiscal 2023, which ran to July of \nthat year.\nCisco joins other tech companies in paring jobs as they cope with uneven demand. Though AI spending has \nhelped fuel growth in some areas, traditional information technology giants have not benefited as much.\nIntel announced plans this month to slash 15,000 jobs as it contends with sluggish sales. Dell Technologies is also \ncutting positions as part of a reorganisation of its sales teams.\nCisco shares fell as much as 1.3 per cent to $US45.24 in New York. They were down 9.3 per cent this year \nheading into Friday's session.\nThe latest job cuts could be announced as early as Wednesday when the company reports fourth-quarter results, \naccording to Reuters.\nThree months ago, an upbeat Cisco forecast sparked hope that IT customers had picked up spending again. But \nthe broader tech industry has been dogged by more recent concerns about the economy - and the idea that AI \nspending might not have a near-term payoff.\nA representative for Cisco declined to comment on layoff plans.\nOver the longer term, chief executive Chuck Robbins has been trying to transform Cisco into a provider of \nnetworking services and software, rather than a company focused on one-time sales of hardware.\nIt also looks to capitalise more on the AI boom that has fuelled sales for companies such as Nvidia. Last year, the \ncompany made a big move into the cybersecurity market with the $US28 billion acquisition of software firm Splunk.\nPage 2 of 2\nCisco plans thousands of jobs cuts in cyber, AI shift\nLoad-Date: October 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Cisco plans thousands of jobs cuts in cyber, AI shift\n## AFR Online\n### Anonymous\n### August 14, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Cisco, to report.

Cisco Systems is set to eliminate approximately 4,000 jobs in a second round of layoffs this year, following an initial round of cuts earlier in February, as part of a strategic shift towards cybersecurity and artificial intelligence sectors.\n\n2. The company is responding to a slowdown in corporate tech spending, which has negatively impacted its sales growth, prompting a reevaluation of its workforce and business focus.\n\n3. Despite a previous optimistic forecast suggesting a rebound in IT spending, recent economic concerns have led to a decline in Cisco's stock price, which has fallen 9.3% this year, indicating investor apprehension about the company's future performance.\n\n4. Cisco's long-term strategy under CEO Chuck Robbins involves transforming the company from a hardware-centric business to a provider of networking services and software, aiming to leverage the growing demand for AI technologies and cybersecurity solutions. \n\n5. The company's significant investment in the cybersecurity market, highlighted by the $28 billion acquisition of Splunk, underscores its commitment to pivoting towards high-growth areas, although the immediate impact of AI spending remains uncertain.",
