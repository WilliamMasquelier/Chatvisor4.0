Last October Fortescue named Plug Power as the \npreferred supplier of 550MW in electrolysers for its Gibson Island green ammonia plant in Queensland.\nPlug and Fortescue also have a deal for the Australian resources major to take up to a 40 per cent stake in Plug's \nTexas hydrogen plant and for Plug to take up to a 25 per cent stake in a plant Fortescue wants to build in -Arizona.\nIn November Plug attached a going concern warning to its quarterly accounts, warning the company was running \nout of cash after burning through more than $US860m in the first nine months of the year. Plug chief financial officer \nPaul Middleton told analysts the going concern warning was to comply with corporate accounting standards, and \nPlug was confident it could raise debt to cover its obligations. Instead the company filed a prospectus to raise up to \n$US1bn on the US market this week, in a move that could dilute existing shareholders substantially.\nLoad-Date: January 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
