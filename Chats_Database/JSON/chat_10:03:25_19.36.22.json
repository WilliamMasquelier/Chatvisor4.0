Context:\nPage 1 of 2\nAndrew, Nicola Forrest step down from Minderoo Foundation, a year after announcing separation\nAndrew, Nicola Forrest step down from Minderoo Foundation, a year after \nannouncing separation\nABC Premium News (Australia)\nOctober 17, 2024 Thursday\nCopyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved\nLength: 558 words\nHighlight: Andrew and Nicola Forrest are stepping down from the philanthropic foundation they founded together, \nwith the news coming just over a year after they announced their marriage separation.\nBody\nAndrew and Nicola Forrest have announced they will both step down from the philanthropic foundation they \nfounded together.\nThe announcement comes just over a year after they announced their marriage separation.\nThe pair will step down as co-chairs of Minderoo Foundation, which they founded together in 2001, and have \nappointed barrister Allan Myers to the role of chair.\nIn an announcement made on Thursday morning, the foundation said Nicola and Andrew Forrest would stay on as \nnon-executive directors.\n\"We couldn't be more proud of what has been achieved over the past 23 years \u2026 it is the right time for change on \nthe board,\" the pair said in a joint statement.\n'Unshakeable passion' for future\nMr Forrest, who is one of Australia's richest men, is also a non-executive director of the Perth-based iron ore miner \nhe founded, Fortescue which last year raked in a reported $US6.2 billion ($9.2 billion) net profit after tax (NPAT).\nTogether, Andrew and Nicola Forrest control 37 per cent of Fortescue. \n\"I have an unshakeable passion for steering the world away from a potentially catastrophic future, and will continue \nto steer Minderoo, Tattarang [the pair's investment company] and Fortescue in the one direction \u2014 to ensure we \nleave our planet liveable for future generations,\" Mr Forrest said in a statement.\nPage 2 of 2\nAndrew, Nicola Forrest step down from Minderoo Foundation, a year after announcing separation\nMs Forrest echoed the sentiment and said the decision to step down reflected her confidence in the foundation's \nnew leadership.\n\"Guided by its new strategy, Minderoo and its partners are in an even stronger position to face up to these \nchallenges together, and stepping aside is a confidence-call in our future trajectory and the impact we will make,\" \nshe said in a statement.\nTheir successor, Mr Myers, has served as a Minderoo board member since 2014 and is also a governor of the Ian \nPotter Foundation and chair of The Ramsay Centre.\nMinderoo has committed millions to philanthropic ventures both in Australia and overseas.\nIn 2022, Mr Forrest committed $US500 million to a multi-billion dollar fund to help rebuild Ukraine alongside the \ncountry's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nThis year he offered to build and install automated gates at border crossings in Gaza to improve the flow of aid into \nthe region.\nJobs losses\nIn April 2024, it was reported about one third of the 300 staff at Minderoo Foundation lost their jobs in a bid to cut \nadministration costs. \nThe charity's finances were bolstered a year earlier when the pair donated one-fifth of their Fortescue shares to \nMinderoo.\nFortescue also cut 700 jobs in July, which Mr Forrest said was an effort to streamline the company.\nThe cuts had raised questions about whether Fortescue was slowing its push into green hydrogen, which is \nproduced from clean energy sources, after the company also flagged it was abandoning its target to produce 15 \nmillion tonnes of green hydrogen a year.\nMr Forrest has spent the last few years selling the idea to governments around the world as a future fuel source for \nindustry as it decarbonises.\n\"We're not pulling back. This is something which I genuinely believe in,\" he said at the time.\nAndrew and Nicola Forrest announced their split in July 2023 after 31 years of marriage.\n\"Our friendship and commitment to our family remains strong,\" they said at the time.\n\"There is no impact on the operations, control or direction of Fortescue, Minderoo or Tattarang.\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Non-executive director of Fortescue | \"I have an unshakeable passion for steering the world away from a potentially catastrophic future, and will continue to steer Minderoo, Tattarang [the pair's investment company] and Fortescue in the one direction \u2014 to ensure we leave our planet liveable for future generations.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Non-executive director of Fortescue | \"We're not pulling back.
