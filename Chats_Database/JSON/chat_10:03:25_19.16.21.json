Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"We are not going to swim against the tide.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"This is not to jam operating costs down, it's to streamline this organisation and keep the genius of simplicity.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"The tide is the Australian government, every government, every leader, every president, every energy minister I've met around the world in the last three years saying 'we've got to get energy prices down'.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"I'm personally disappointed that the rest of the world - particularly the 'weenies' in the traditional energy sector - are 'not seeing as clearly what I am seeing, which is that the world must turn away from fossil fuels'.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"But to get there, we're going to make sure that the supply chain's right.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"Fortescue will not 'put the horse behind the cart' by pushing ahead with green hydrogen projects where the economics don't stack up due to persistently high electricity prices.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
