Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 16\nLength: 609 words\nByline: Primrose Riordan and Mark Wembridge\nBody\nFortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest says a culture of freedom and camaraderie at the iron ore miner \nmeans staff are unlikely to unionise, as the Albanese government's workplace reforms deal unions back into the \nnation's most lucrative export industry for the first time in decades.\nBig miners such as BHP and Rio Tinto are concerned the reforms, which allow unions to lead wage negotiations \neven if they cannot prove their members represent the majority of the workforce, will stoke industrial action in the \nPilbara iron ore region and threaten an industry that is forecast to ship $107 billion worth of ore this year.\nBut the nation's third-biggest iron ore exporter, Perth-based Fortescue, struck a confident tone.\nDr Forrest said Fortescue's structure allowed staff direct access to him or senior managers, eliminating the need \nfor union advocates. \"The troops know they can come to me directly. They do, and I love it,\" he said, when asked \nby The Australian Financial Review whether it would welcome unions onto its Pilbara mine sites.\n\"If unions want to come in, they are completely welcome. [But] is there a job for unions to come and speak to me \nabout the troops? No, they can come and speak to me directly. We stay really close because we love our people.\n\"You don't get workers running up to leaders wanting selfies and heart-to-hearts [at other mining companies], but \nthat's stock-standard here.\"\nMost Pilbara worksites became largely union-free in the 1980s, after years of militant industrial action and rolling \nstrikes provoked a stand-off with intransigent management that in effect eliminated collective bargaining.\nUnion members comprised 10 per cent of the mining workforce in 2022, down from 16.5 per cent in 2016, according \nto the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Three decades ago, union membership on mine sites was 44 per cent.\nWhile union membership remains strong at mines where the workforce lives nearby, such as Queensland's \ncoalfields, unions have struggled to get a foothold in the Pilbara, where the vast majority of workers fly in and out. \nUnder the Albanese government's \"Secure Jobs, Better Pay\" workplace reforms, unions are not required to \nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue heart-to-hearts make unionisation redundant: Forrest\ndemonstrate that the majority of the workforce supports collective bargaining, as long as an agreement is within five \nyears of expiration.\nThis has enabled unions to bring BHP to the bargaining table to negotiate wages and conditions.\nThe Western Mine Workers Alliance has presented BHP with a list of demands that include a $10,000 annual \nretention bonus per employee, annual pay rises and uniform conditions and entitlements across sites.\nOther producers in the region - Rio Tinto, Fortescue, Roy Hill and Mineral Resources - fear that unionisation will \nspread to their mines and eat into their margins.\nIron ore mining in the Pilbara has fuelled the wealth of billionaires such as Dr Forrest and Gina Rinehart, the \ncountry's richest person. Unlike BHP, Rio is not compelled to negotiate with unions because its enterprise \nagreements expired before 2019, while Fortescue has not struck a collective agreement in more than a decade.\nThe Minerals Council of Australia has warned that the laws could \"open the door to industry-wide 'bargaining' and \nindustry-wide strikes - and a return to 1970s-style industrial confrontation and disruption\".\nDr Forrest said unions were vital to some workplaces, but their services were redundant at Fortescue.\n\"Unions have a serious role when there is a breakdown between troops and managers, but there is strong \ncamaraderie here. The troops come straight to people like me. We have no issue with unions, but the troops decide \nfor themselves,\" he said.\nLoad-Date: February 5, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
