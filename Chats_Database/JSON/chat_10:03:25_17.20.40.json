Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1485 words\nHighlight: Javelin Minerals has picked up the historic Eureka open pit north of Kalgoorlie where it is seeking to \nprove up its theory that more golden riches are lurking nearby.\nBody\nJavelin Minerals has picked up the historic Eureka open pit north of Kalgoorlie from Delta Lithium where it is \nseeking to prove up a theory that more golden riches may be lurking nearby. The move follows the spectacular \nsuccess of Spectrum and Spartan Resources. Both found multi-million dollar gold deposits about 300m north of \ntheir mothballed open pits and Javelin already has some intriguing drill holes about 300m north of Eureka \nsuggesting there is more gold out there.\nPerth broker Shaw and Partners already has firm commitments for $3m at $.0025 a share (including a 1 for 2 option \nexercisable at $.004 within 2 years) to fund the deal. Under the terms of the sale Delta will pick up $1.5m in cash \nand a further $1.5m in Javelin shares at A$0.003 per share.\nIf Javelin manages to get Eureka back into production or increase the inferred resource to 200,000 ounces of gold \nDelta will pick up another $1m in Javelin shares. Notably, Eureka already comes gift-wrapped with a 112,000 ounce \n1.42 gram per tonne starter resource.\nThe initial shares issued to Delta Lithium will be subject to escrow for 12 months.\nThe old Eureka open pit sits about 50km north-west of Kalgoorlie in the prospective sequence of mafic and \nultramafic rocks which forms part of the more than 290km-long\nKalgoorlie-Menzies leg of the 700km-long Norseman to Wiluna Greenstone belt.\nImportantly it is only 20kms north-west of the Paddington gold mine that has been mined for years and is well \nknown for doing toll treating deals.\nPaddington has turned out more than four million ounces during its production history from the same prospective \nrock sequence as mapped at Eureka, which is also held to be a structural setting similar to the half-million ounce \nZoroastrian gold deposit at Bardoc Gold, only 1.4km east of the Eureka deposit.\nThe Eureka mine site was mined for the most part in the early 1990's and was subject to small scale tribute mining \nagain in 2018 by Kalgoorlie identity Graham McGarry who pulled a bit over 5000 ounces from the old pit at 3.16 g/t \ngold. However, Javelin says prior drilling was poorly targeted at the project and was not deep enough to follow the \ninterpreted structures properly.\nPage 2 of 3\nJavelin rolls dice to replicate Spectrum, Spartan success at Eureka\nJavelin has a theory that the old-timers were too focussed on the existing pit and given the ordinary gold prices at \nthe time, were not motivated to spend too much money exploring the areas around it.\nSpectrum Metals and Spartan Resources both spectacularly proved this was a mistake at their respective projects. \nSpectrum stumbled across the Penny North gold deposit just 300m north of its old mined out Penny West open pit \nin WA and subsequently sold the whole company to Ramelius Resources for $230m (which increased dramatically \non settlement day as the deal involved Ramelius shares that ran hard between the announcement of the deal and \nthe settlement of the deal). The maiden resource at Penny North was just over 300,000 ounces going a whopping \n16.8 g/t gold.\nMore recently Spartan employed the same near mine theory when it stubbed its toe on the 1.5m ounce Never \nNever discovery lurking just 300m north of its mothballed Gilbey's open pit in WA's Murchison.\nOminously, the Eureka project already has sniffs of gold 300m north of the old Eureka pit too - some of which are in \nounce to the tonne dirt like a 4m intercept going 32.6 g/t gold from 104m. Another previous 1m hit came in at an \nimpressive 14.72 g/t gold and notably, was from surface, demonstrating the potential range of mineralisation.\nAbout 600m north of the old pit, Javelin has even more impressive numbers to follow up on like 4m at 135 g/t gold \nfrom 53m and 4m grading 11 g/t gold from 42m.\nIn fact, the entire area is littered with old drill numbers that are begging to see the drill bit again. For example, \ndirectly under the old pit a 23m hit going 3.32 g/t gold from 112m and another 5m hit further up from 33m going an \nimpressive 25.6 g/t gold both need more attention.\nThere are even hints of mineralisation about 300m to the south of Eureka which include 13m at 2.22 g/t gold from \n51m and 6m at 13.88 g/t gold from 38m.\nWhilst some of the drill intersections that require follow up may seem remarkable in grade, they are perhaps not all \nthat remarkable when considering the project was first mined from 1897 up to 1940 for a total 809 tonnes averaging \na crazy 27.8 g/t gold - no doubt Javelin will be counting on some of that dirt being left behind by the old-timers.\nNotably, Eureka is not Javelin's first rodeo and is an extension of the same near mine exploration theory it is \nemploying at its Coogee gold project at the north end of Lake Lefroy, just east of Kambalda and about 55 km south-\neast of Kalgoorlie.\nThe Coogee gold deposit was discovered in the mid-1990s by Sovereign Resources next to Gold Fields' world-\nclass St Ives gold mining complex.\nJavelin acquired 100 per cent of the Coogee project in 2020 from Ramelius Resources and Serena Minerals for \nequity and both companies are now major shareholders.\nRamelius mined the Coogee open pit for gold to 70m depth until 2013, producing 20,400 ounces at a respectable \naverage head grade of 4.7g/t gold. Ramelius subsequently became a major shareholder in Javelin.\nThe Coogee mining lease has been a key focus for Javelin's since acquisition. The Coogee open pit and its \nimmediate surrounds have not been subject to any systematic exploration drilling since Ramelius ended mining at \nthe site.\nWhen Javelin acquired the project, it contained an estimated 10,600 ounce gold resource at 3.4g/t gold which, after \na 12-month drilling program, then jumped to 49,000 ounces at 1.07g/t gold in 2022.\nIn August, Javelin announced the Coogee gold project hosts a recently upgraded JORC 2012 compliant mineral \nresource amounting to 3.65 million tonnes at 1.08g/t gold for 126,685 ounces of gold and 1.01 million tonnes at \n0.41 per cent copper for 4133t tonnes of the red metal in a separate inferred \"copper domain\", north of the old pit.Page 3 of 3\nJavelin rolls dice to replicate Spectrum, Spartan success at Eureka\nOnce again, modelling shows gold mineralisation extending north along strike for 1.2km at an average width of \n350m and to more than 225m vertically under the old Coogee open pit and still open to the north and down-dip.\nJavelin upped its drilling metreage for the greater Coogee area from 2500m to 3000m for a planned reverse-\ncirculation and diamond drilling program set to be launched in mid-November.\nThe decision came after the company identified several opportunities to extend known mineralisation below the old \nopen pit and in extensions towards Coogee North and beyond to a pronounced magnetic high feature.\nThe proposed drilling was prompted by results from Javelin's extensive reviews of reprocessed geophysical and \nother data which had lifted Coogee's resource estimate to the current inventory figure of 126,685 ounces of gold.\nJavelin's recent full data review and new magnetics reinterpretations and modelling have identified eight new \ntantalising geophysical targets.\nIt will now direct its focus toward testing five of the nearest priority walk-up targets at the Coogee mine - and also \nnorth and west of the old mine - including a prominent and curious looking ovoid magnetic anomaly in the south-\neast of its exploration licence, adjacent to the mining lease.\nReview work has also identified a new 3km-long potential gold trend west of and parallel to the Coogee pit structure \nand Javelin believes there is the potential there for a \"big gold-copper system\" that could lie at depth to the north-\nwest.\nJavelin says previous drillholes at Coogee North were also not deep enough to test the nearby screaming magnetic \nanomaly which could represent a potential repetition of the historic Coogee lode and the company has earmarked \nten drillholes for 1650m to test it.\nSignificantly, once Javelin dials in the current Eureka gold mine resource and adds on its Coogee resource it will \nnow have a total resource endowment of 238,700 ounces of gold in two of the best mining addresses in Australia.\nIt is probably fair to say that Javelin has been in something of a slumber for a couple of years however since falling \nunder the control of Executive Chairman and well known West Perth corporate finance player Brett Mitchell back in \nFebruary, it has forged a new way forward and eked out a solid \"near mine exploration strategy.\"\nHalf of that strategy came from a strategic review of Coogee instigated by Mitchell that ended in some screaming \nnear mine targets that look like they are begging to be drilled. Eureka now gives Javelin a quinella of projects that \nalmost look exactly the same that will likely both benefit from exactly the same brownfields near mine exploration \nstrategy.\nAnd who knows, maybe Javelin will complete the trifecta of companies that have successfully employed this \"old \nriches left behind\" strategy if it can emulate the success of both Spartan and Spectrum.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Ramelius Resources acquired the Coogee gold project from Javelin Minerals and Serena Minerals, which has since become a significant focus for Javelin, highlighting Ramelius's role in the ongoing exploration and development of gold resources in the region.\n\n2. The successful acquisition of Spectrum Metals by Ramelius for $230 million underscores the company's strategic interest in near-mine exploration, which is now being mirrored by Javelin at the Eureka site, indicating a competitive landscape in the gold mining sector.\n\n3. Ramelius's previous mining operations at Coogee, which yielded 20,400 ounces of gold at an average grade of 4.7 g/t, set a benchmark for Javelin's current exploration efforts, emphasizing the potential for further discoveries in areas previously mined.\n\n4. The ongoing exploration strategies employed by Javelin, inspired by Ramelius's past successes, suggest a trend in the industry towards revisiting and re-evaluating historical mining sites for untapped resources, which could impact future valuations and investments in the sector.",
