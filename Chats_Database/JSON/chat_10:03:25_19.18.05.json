Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Chairman of Fortescue | \"Twiggy went way too hard, way too fast and way too hyped about hydrogen.\" | N.A. |\n| Ted O'Brien | Opposition energy spokesman | \"The collapse of this project is symptomatic of Labor's failing all-eggs-in-one-basket 'renewables only' plan which is eating away at Australia's energy future.\" | N.A. |\n| Chris Bowen | Climate Change Minister | \"Australia has more than 50 companies actively progressing renewable hydrogen project investment, making our current clean hydrogen pipeline amongst the largest globally, valued at more than $225 billion.\" | N.A. |\n| Tim Buckley | Director of Climate Energy Finance | \"Australia put out like 50 per cent of the world's press releases of hydrogen in the last five years but none of them have come to fruition.\" | N.A. |\n| Rod Sims | Leader of the Superpower Institute | \"He could be helping Australia to start a $300 billion industry.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
