The energy division now includes UK technology business WAE, which booked revenue of \nabout $US26m for the year.\nFortescue's policy is to pay out 50 to 80 per cent of its net profit in dividends, and the mid-range payment - the \nsame as its total payout ratio across last financial year - comes as the company looks to ramp up spending on its \nPilbara iron ore mines and its green energy projects.\nThe iron ore giant spent $US1.52bn on capital projects in the first half of the financial year, with about $US1bn of \nthat on sustaining capital for its existing Pilbara miners. Another $US165m was spent on Fortescue Energy \nprojects across the globe, and another $US104m on decarbonising the company's iron ore operations.\nFortescue says it expects to spend $US3.3bn to $US3.7bn in capital for the full financial year, with about $US500m \nof that to go towards green energy projects and $US300m to $US500m on decarbonisation.\nFortescue's first half result comes after the company received an average $US108 a dry metric tonne for its iron \nore shipments in the half, up from $US87 a tonne in the prior corresponding period, with the company booking \n$US9.5bn in revenue, up 21 per cent.\nCash production costs lifted 2 per cent to $US17.77 a wet metric tonne for the period, as Fortescue kept \ninflationary pressures in the Pilbara largely under control.\nPage 2 of 2\nIron awe at Fortescue\nCiti analyst Paul McTaggart said the results had beaten analyst consensus estimates of a $US5.6bn EBITDA and a \n$1.04 dividend.
