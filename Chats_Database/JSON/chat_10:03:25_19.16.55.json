But Dr Forrest said on \nThursday he was confident its efforts in winning access to global energy projects, and technology investments such \nas its acquisition of Williams Advanced Engineering (now Fortescue Zero) would still deliver returns to Fortescue \nshareholders.\n\"If I could spend the amount of capital you're speculating about, to create a future for this company that will multiply \nits share price, I would do it every day of the week. There's no way we could have got that out of just doing more of \nthe same,\" he said.\nFortescue Zero delivers a small revenue stream to the ASX-listed company, but none of its other energy \ninvestments have yet delivered a commercial return. But Dr Forrest said Fortescue's forays into designing \nammonia-power ships, battery-operated trains and future green hydrogen and ammonia production would \neventually deliver returns to shareholders.\n\"You can see the business we're now starting in shipping, in trucking, in rail, in green iron, in shipping green \nelectrons into western Europe. These businesses are all available to us because of that investment,\" he said.\nPage 2 of 2\nTWIGGY'S GREENING LIVES ON\nFortescue's green dream foundered on energy costs, with the global surge in pricing after Russia's invasion of \nUkraine - and the massive post-pandemic cost inflation for major projects - effectively killing off the cheap electricity \nneeded to make hydrogen a viable energy source.\nDr Forrest rejected suggestions that Fortescue had abandoned its ambition of turning hydrogen into a global \nseaborne commodity equivalent to LNG, but said in the short term Fortescue would instead look to build solar and \nwind projects that will help drive down energy costs to eventually make hydrogen and green ammonia viable.\nThat will start with powering Fortescue's Pilbara iron ore operations, he said, but will eventually extend to grid-\nscale renewable energy projects. Fortescue shares closed down 32c to $22.04 on Thursday.\nLoad-Date: July 18, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
