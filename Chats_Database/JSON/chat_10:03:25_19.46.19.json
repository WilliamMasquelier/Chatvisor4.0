Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 571 words\nByline: Jesinta Burton\nHighlight: Andrew Forrest has come out swinging in defence of his charity, Minderoo, after it became embroiled in \na defamation suit levelled by ExxonMobil.\nBody\nMining billionaire Andrew Forrest has come out swinging in defence of his charity, Minderoo, after it became \nembroiled in a defamation suit levelled by ExxonMobil, lambasting the oil and gas giant for a pursuit he deemed to \nbe \"right out of the industry playbook\".\nAccording to court filings, Exxon launched a defamation suit against California Attorney General Rob Bonta and \nseveral environmental groups in Texas on Monday, demanding damages and a retraction of claims about the oil \ncompany's advanced plastics recycling initiative.\nLink to Image\nAFR.\nExxon has accused Bonta of colluding with US law firm Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, LLP and a swath of \nenvironmental groups, including the Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund.\nIn the suit, the company claims the defendants made false statements about its recycling technology which have \nsince cost it contracts and damaged its future business prospects.\nWhile Forrest, his iron ore miner, Fortescue, and multibillion-dollar charity, Minderoo, are not named as a party to \nthe action, Exxon has claimed the Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund is controlled by Minderoo.\nFurther, the oil and gas company accused Fortescue of orchestrating litigation against Exxon to gain a competitive \nadvantage in the energy transition sector, an assertion the miner also flatly rejected.\nMinderoo and Fortescue have maintained they operate independently of the fund, something corroborated by the \nIEJF in a statement to this masthead.\nForrest has since launched a defence of himself and his empire, claiming he was \"delighted\" by news of the lawsuit, \nand branding the pursuit evidence that the industry was desperate to retain its \"toxic grip on society\".\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest hits back after Minderoo dragged into ExxonMobil defamation row\nThe WA billionaire reiterated his commitment to spearheading Minderoo, Fortescue and his investment vehicle, \nTattarang, in a way that would allow it to be rid of fossil fuels by 2030, and insisted any accusation of commercial \nbenefit was \"completely false\".\n\"This lawsuit is no surprise and right out of the oil and gas industry playbook,\" he said.\n\"I am personally delighted Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-\nexamination.\n\"[The oil and gas industry's] only priority is to maximise their profits and produce as much oil and gas as possible.\n\"My conflict is that I am dedicated to steering the world away from a future reliant on fossil fuels.\n\"The fossil-fuel industry know they are on borrowed time and that technological solutions exist to phase out fossil \nfuels.\"\nForrest has been vocal in his criticism of oil and gas producers, which included poring over Woodside chief \nexecutive Meg O'Neill's history as an ExxonMobil executive in an interview on Perth radio and accusing her of \n\"peddling poison\".\nA spokesperson for the California Department of Justice said the defamation action was another attempt by \nExxonMobil to deflect attention from its \"own unlawful deception\".\nThe lawsuit is the latest twist in the ongoing battle between environmental groups and the fossil-fuels industry.\nBonta launched legal action against Exxon in 2024, claiming the company had engaged in deception about the \nlimitations of recycling and called on the court to hold Exxon to account for its role in rampant plastic pollution.\nMinderoo made national headlines just last month over its backing of a Global Plastics Treaty to curb the production \nand use of polymers, touting the need for a plastics levy.\nWith Reuters\nGraphic\n \nWA billionaire Andrew Forrest launched a defence of his iron ore company, Fortescue, and his charity, Minderoo, \nin the wake of the lawsuit.\nLoad-Date: January 8, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | CEO of Fortescue | \"This lawsuit is no
