Green hydrogen, green ammonia, green iron \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.\nThe company now has two distinct arms, Fortescue Metals run by Dino Otranto, who oversees its profitable iron \nore operations, and Fortescue Energy, run by Mark Hutchison, who oversees Fortescue's array of green projects. \nPage 2 of 3\nTWIGGY'S BIG CHALLENGE\nSuch is the status of Fortescue Energy these days that the two are described as \"co-CEOs\" reporting to Forrest as \nthe globetrotting founder and executive chair.\nAfter looking at a wide array of potential green projects round the world, and facing rising energy costs globally, \nFMG has had to focus its thinking this year, scaling back its green hydrogen ambitions and announcing in July that \nFMG would be cutting 700 jobs from the total business.\nThe Energy division is expecting to spend $US1.2bn during the year - $US700m on operations and $US500m on \ncapital expenditure (a significant increase on the $US317m capex for the energy arm in the financial year just \nended).\nThe division, which had its gestation period in several trips around the world by Forrest in his jet in the depths of \nCovid, has now settled on its first energy projects.\nIt recently turned the first sod on its green hydrogen project in the US, Arizona Hydrogen, which is expected to start \nconstruction this year with production set for 2026, and started work on a 50MW green hydrogen project in \nGladstone in Queensland using FMG's own electrolyser technology. Production of green hydrogen from the \nGladstone plant is expected to begin in 2025, potentially getting to 22 tonnes of green hydrogen a day.\nNext on the horizon, but not yet given the final go ahead by the FMG board, are a 300MW green ammonia project \nin Holmaneset, Norway, and a green hydrogen project in Pecem, Brazil. These are \"progressing to feasibility \nstage\".\nThe company is expecting the Norwegian project to cost something just over $US1bn, with the Brazilian project \npotentially costing three times that - a total potential capital outlay of more than $USS4bn.\nBut Fortescue executives were at pains to point out that not all of that would be put on the FMG balance sheet, \nwith the company expecting to get some money from the EU for the Norwegian project and other investors \nexpected to come in to help finance both projects. Just how much FMG would need to spend on the projects and \nwhen they would make a profit was not clear.\nFurther down the track are potential projects in Morocco, Oman, Egypt and Jordan.\nEnergy chief Hutchison assured analysts that the company's \"financial discipline always comes first. We are only \nfocused on those projects which are economically viable.\" He said the green hydrogen market was \"still \ndeveloping\", with the cost of power needed to make green hydrogen projects in many countries economically viable \ntoo high.\n\"What we don't do is give up,\" he said. \"When power costs are prohibitive, we will work to bring those costs down.\n\"Longer term, we totally believe that green hydrogen is what the world ultimately needs which is why we continue to \nmaintain a significant portfolio of potential projects. There's plenty to be excited about and we are focused on \nmaking business decisions that make sense, economically and commercially.\" Executives also argued that FMG's \ngreen iron plans would also provide more revenue in China. Otranto said the company was \"doubling down on \ngreen iron\". He now believed the opportunity for it in China was \"much, much higher than expected\" following a visit \nto the country.\nBeijing, he said, had recently mandated that 10 per cent of all its coal-fired boiler feedstock would have to be \nammonia.\nThis, he said, would translate into demand for 300,000 tonnes of ammonia a year which would need some 50 \nmillion tonnes of hydrogen to produce.\n\"The train has definitely left the station,\" he declared.Page 3 of 3\nTWIGGY'S BIG CHALLENGE\nOnce content to sit back and watch iron ore shipments sail out of the Pilbara to China, FMG shareholders will need \nto get with the program when it comes to green technology - its potential and its green-sky economics.\nForrest is effectively asking his shareholders to back him in his green-energy vision, arguing that he has done it \nwhen it comes to iron ore and he will do it again when it comes to green-energy projects. FMG shareholders need \nto sit back, buckle up their seat belts and strap in for the ride, as they count their dividends.\nLoad-Date: August 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and Executive Chair of Fortescue | \"What we don't do is give up.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchison | Energy Chief of Fortescue | \"We are only focused on those projects which are economically viable.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | CEO of Fortescue Metals | \"We are doubling down on green iron.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
