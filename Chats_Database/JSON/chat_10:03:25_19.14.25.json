(Australia)\nJuly 17, 2024 Wednesday\nCopyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved\nLength: 495 words\nHighlight: Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest will axe 700 jobs from mining company Fortescue by the end of July to \nstreamline business.\nBody\nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue mining company has announced it is slashing 700 jobs while affirming its \"resolute\" \ncommitment to its green technology vision.\nIn a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, Fortescue (FMG) said the restructure would ensure the Perth-\nbased mining company remains \"lean, impactful and agile.\"\n\"As part of this, approximately 700 people from across Fortescue's global operations will be offered redundancies, \nwith that process to be finalised by the end of July 2024,\" the statement read.\nThe company said it remained committed to its green technology developments, and must evolve to deliver on its \nstrategy, and generate maximum value for shareholders.\nHowever, it said the company was \"grateful for the contribution of all those impacted by these changes.\"\nForrest makes no mention of cuts\nExecutive chairman Andrew Forrest issued a separate statement shortly after, but did not mention the job cuts.\nHe said the company was \"absolutely resolute\" in its commitment to achieving its decarbonisation goals by 2030 \nand that \"without change, improvement is impossible\".\n\"Being a first mover isn't easy, but as we learnt 21 years ago, risk is always worth the reward,\" he said.\n\"Part of the reason Fortescue is the highest performing company on Australia's Stock Exchange is that we do \nthings differently.\nPage 2 of 2\nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue slashing 700 jobs amid green technology commitment\n\"We do not apologise for requesting people leave their corporate culture behind when they join us \u2026 nor will we \napologise when we don't look like everyone else.\"\nFortescue has extensive iron ore operations in WA's Pilbara, and in 2022-23 exported 192 million tonnes of ore.\nHowever, in recent years it has been focusing on the development of green hydrogen and the decarbonisation of its \noperations.\n'Not seeing the full picture'\nSome analysts have said the job losses showed the mining giant was slowing its push into green hydrogen or \nabandoning its ambitions altogether.\nBut resources analyst Tim Treadgold wasn't so sure.\n\"We're not seeing the full picture outside,\" he said.\n\"Whether it's related to iron ore and a troubling outlook with China construction slowing, or whether it's related to \nhydrogen, which is not developing or being developed as quickly as we had been promised, we don't know.\n\"It could just be a nice round 700 figure to lower the overall cost base. There's a lot more yet to be revealed.\n\"You've got Macquarie Bank out there at the moment with a great big 'sell' recommendation on Fortescue and a \nshare price tip, which is close to half what the company is at the moment.\n\"That's a big call by a big bank.\"\nMr Treadgold said iron ore remained the \"engine room\" for Fortescue.\n\"China is a big problem for Fortescue, it's a big problem for Australia and hydrogen is a peculiar problem for \nFortescue because the world is just not ready for it yet,\" he said.\n\"To make a move like this and then wrap it all up in two weeks, either something serious has happened or the \ncompany is looking at the future and saying we need to pull our head in.\"\nLoad-Date: July 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"Being a first mover isn't easy, but as we learnt 21 years ago, risk is always worth the reward.\" | N.A. |\n| Tim Treadgold | Resources Analyst | \"China is a big problem for Fortescue, it's a big problem for Australia and hydrogen is a peculiar problem for Fortescue because the world is just not ready for it yet.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
