It is also the manager's first investment in the sector in the UK. The announcement of a major \ninvestment in an area critical to the UK's economic growth has been a boost for Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead \nof Wednesday's budget announcement.\nThe purchase will give Brookfield a minority stake in four operating offshore wind farms.
