Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 21\nLength: 716 words\nByline: Joanne Tran\nBody\nSimon Brown is co-portfolio manager of Tribeca's Smaller Companies Strategy in Sydney. The firm oversees \naround $3.3 billion in assets.\nWhich company disappointed you the most in the latest reporting season, and why do you still own it?\nLand and marine transport operator Kelsian was punished during results season on the back of a material bottom-\nline earnings miss versus market expectations, while reported cashflow was low and debt higher. The dreaded \ntrifecta!\nAt its essence, the company's earnings should have infrastructure-like qualities, with the majority of earnings from \noperating public and private sector transportation services which are contracted and relatively stable, while having \ninflation protection on costs.\nIt is yet to hit full operating cadence post the disruptions from the pandemic and workforce shortages, resulting in a \nshortage of drivers and uncontracted overtime payments that aren't covered by pass-through mechanisms.\nAn improvement in labour availability, as is being reported, should flow through the better margins. It would mean \nKelsian is a bargain buy at current levels in our view.\nWhich stock in the portfolio do you think is the most undervalued?\nManagement at gold producer Ramelius Resources have done a great job curating a strategy that leverages their \nexisting mill infrastructure by adding nearby deposits through bolt-on mergers and acquisitions.\nThe stock is cheap on traditional miner metrics. It has a price to net present value of 0.75 times and, with the recent \nmulti-year breakout in gold prices, it provides further tailwinds to valuation. We see material upside from current \nshare price levels.\nWhat is your take on small-cap investing in the current economic environment?\nPage 2 of 2\nBreakout in gold is making Ramelius cheap: Tribeca Fundie Q&A\nAfter two years of underperformance versus the broader S&P/ASX 200 Index, small caps have begun to outperform \nin 2024. Margins have been impacted by higher operating costs, with small companies generally less well-equipped \nto pass these through, affecting earnings.\nFurthermore, small caps have greater exposure to the cyclicality of the domestic economy, with less offshore \nearnings that benefit from currency translation.\nWith inflation moderating and the local interest-rate cycle having peaked, we feel small-cap growth should once \nagain shine, which is one of the main attractions of the asset class.\nWhat's a stock you like that (most) people haven't heard of?\nEureka Group operates a pure play, specialist strategy of providing affordable seniors rental accommodation across \nAustralia.\nEureka services the growing ageing population who are under-funded for retirement and highly reliant on the \ngovernment pension assistance that underpins their revenue.\nThis is an important segment, with 57 per cent of Australia's 4.7 million 65-plus year olds relying on the pension as \ntheir primary source of income. The opportunity for sector consolidation in this area is large, with Eureka the scaled \nplayer in a highly fragmented market and the company currently pursuing avenues to unlock ways to speed up \nmergers and acquisitions. While it trades at a 16 per cent premium to net tangible assets, our view is that the NTA \nis potentially conservative with cap rates of around 8.3 per cent moving lower over time as investors grow more \ncomfortable with the model.\nAlso of note is the recently received scrip-based takeover proposal from ASX-listed Aspen Group and the \nsubsequent acquisition of just under 20 per cent of shares by a third-party corporate entity.\nWhat piece of advice/or anecdote influenced your investing approach?\nDavid Aylward, who started the small-cap fund that I co-manage, has been a mentor and imparted to me early on \nnot to overestimate the level of analysis done by the market.\nIt is so true, particularly once you come down in size from the top 20 or 30 largest stocks.\nFor those willing to put in the time to do the meetings, collate the insights and crunch the numbers, I've found there \nare always opportunities out there to make money.\nWhat's your favourite local bar or restaurant?\nNorth Bondi RSL belies its cheap and cheerful nature with one of the best views in the world. I go for the chicken \nparmigiana.\nAny podcasts or shows you'd recommend?\nI'm a college sports fan. Swamp Kings on Netflix is a great insight into the college football fanaticism in the US.\nLoad-Date: April 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**ENTITY**: [Organization Name]\n**TYPE**: [Type of organization - e.g., Company, Government Agency, NGO, etc.]\n**DESCRIPTION**: [Brief description of how the entity is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**ENTITY**: Tesla, Inc.\n**TYPE**: Company\n**DESCRIPTION**: Main subject of article, discussing Q4 earnings report\n\nOnly include entities that are meaningful to the article's content.
