Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Vasilios Piperoglou | Chief Investment Officer, Collins St Asset Management | \"With gold stocks, the way the asymmetry is playing out currently, I think there is a greater potential in this than the other two ... we're seeing the very early signs of the start of a gold bull market.\" | N.A. |\n| Vasilios Piperoglou | Chief Investment Officer, Collins St Asset Management | \"At some stage, investors are going to get smacked in the face ... there will be a moment within months, not years, where people wake up and these quality small caps will multibag.\" | N.A. |\n| Vasilios Piperoglou | Chief Investment Officer, Collins St Asset Management | \"That is why Collins St has spent the past 12 months undertaking its own due diligence by speaking to management and visiting operations to construct what Piperoglou describes as a portfolio of 'some of the best, well-run, well-capitalised, pre-production plays on the ASX'.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Ramelius Resources.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Ramelius Resources or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
