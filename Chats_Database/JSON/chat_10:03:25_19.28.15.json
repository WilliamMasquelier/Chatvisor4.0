Ltd.\nLength: 572 words\nDateline: SYDNEY Aug 20\nBody\n  Fortescue staff who jumped ship to form their own resources startup were too scared to tackle the accusations \nagainst them and instead provided implausible explanations for their actions, a judge has been told.\n   Lawyers for the iron-ore giant on Tuesday said the case brought against Perth startup Element Zero and three of \nits directors in May was bolstered further by their response to the allegations of stolen trade secrets.\n   \"The strong prima facie case ... has become even stronger when taking into account the respondents' evidence,\" \nbarrister Julian Cooke SC said.\n   The mining giant claims Element Zero directors Bartlomiej Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn Winther-Jensen and Michael \nMasterman used confidential information gained while working at Fortescue for their new enterprise.\n   Those secrets were allegedly used to develop their own green-iron technology, to process the valuable ore \nwithout carbon emissions.\n   In May, Element Zero's offices and Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen's homes were searched under order \nof Federal Court Justice Melissa Perry.\n   The court order was granted in secret, giving the startup's directors no notice their premises were about to be \nraided.\n   Element Zero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman are trying to discharge this search order before Justice \nBrigitte Markovic.\n   On the second day of the hearing, Mr Cooke said the search order should remain and the bid to overturn it was \n\"ill-conceived\".\n   The evidence before Justice Perry revealed a strong case by Fortescue and the very real risk that documents \nwould be destroyed, hidden or squirrelled away if search orders were not granted, the barrister said.\n   Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen had admitted copying confidential material to their personal devices \nbefore they resigned.\nPage 2 of 2\nFED:'Implausible': Fortescue rival slammed in IP-theft case\n   But they have provided various reasons as to why this action was legitimate, such as being ordered to do so while \nworking from home or fearing they would lose access to Fortescue's IT systems.\n   These explanations were \"inherently improbable and implausible\", Mr Cooke said.\n   The Element Zero directors did not respond to evidence suggesting they had access to confidential information \nused to establish the startup, the court was told.\n   Those secrets included a patent proposal for iron-ore processing technology discussed while they were at \nFortescue in December 2020.\n   Dr Kolodziejczyk had been \"too scared\" to address these issues front-on because he knew that nothing he could \nsay would help him defend the lawsuit, Mr Cooke said.\n   Other evidence of the alleged use of confidential information included analysis showing Element Zero could not \nhave established a pilot plant for processing green iron - as it did so in 26 months - without significant help from \nknowledge gained at Fortescue.\n   \"The respondents feared to address the matter by direct evidence because this would have exposed facts \nunfavourable to them,? Mr Cooke said.\n   In the lawsuit, Element Zero and the executives have been accused of breach of contract, copyright infringement, \nbreach of corporations and consumer law, and breach of their fiduciary duties.\n   Fortescue is seeking damages or compensation, which could include any profits gained by Element Zero from \nthe allegedly stolen invention.\n   Fortescue is planning to produce green iron from its Christmas Creek site in the Pilbara region of Western \nAustralia by the end of 2025.\n   The hearing continues.\nLoad-Date: August 20, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Julian Cooke | Barrister for Fortescue | \"The strong prima facie case ... has become even stronger when taking into account the respondents' evidence.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke | Barrister for Fortescue | \"The search order should remain and the bid to overturn it was 'ill-conceived'.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke | Barrister for Fortescue | \"The respondents feared to address the matter by direct evidence because this would have exposed facts unfavourable to them.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke | Barrister for Fortescue | \"Those explanations were 'inherently improbable and implausible'.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke | Barrister for Fortescue | \"Other evidence of the alleged use of confidential information included analysis showing Element Zero could not have established a pilot plant for processing green iron - as it did so in 26 months - without significant help from knowledge gained at Fortescue.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
