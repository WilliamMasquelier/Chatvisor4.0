Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Chairman of Fortescue | \"The opportunity in West Virginia was important to demonstrate we could go into a heavily [coal] dependent state, take a ... coal asset that was operating, close it down, turn it into a green hydrogen facility, continue to provide the economic benefits to those employees in that community and to have the political support of the two senators and the governor at that time.\" | N.A. |\n| Paul Browning | Former North American energy president at Fortescue | \"We pursued Energy Harbor at AF's [Andrew Forrest's] request based on his Manchin relationship, but there are plenty of other retiring coal assets we can pursue in areas with better renewable resource.\" | N.A. |\n| Andy Vesey | Energy executive at Fortescue | \"Andrew [Forrest] said, 'we're not cleaning up their mess and that's their responsibility', and Joe Manchin talked to Jay Bellingham and agreed with Andrew and said 'it's not their [Fortescue's] responsibility to clean it up, it's yours', and that was fundamentally the end of the call.\" | N.A. |\n| Joe Manchin | Democratic Senator | \"I am proud of the work we did in passing the IRA to strengthen America's energy independence. Today, we are producing more fossil and renewable energy than at any point in our history. I have remained steadfast in my commitment to an all-of-the-above energy strategy - one that embraces every resource at our disposal while ensuring economic growth and national security.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
