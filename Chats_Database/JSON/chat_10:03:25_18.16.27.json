[Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued that any compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should be funded by the State of Western Australia because it granted the mining tenements, but the WA government maintains that Fortescue should pay, creating further uncertainty over the company's financial liability.

[AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue began mining at the Solomon hub in 2013 without an agreement from the Yindjibarndi\u2019s registered native title body and instead dealt with a breakaway group, raising ethical concerns about its treatment of traditional owners.

It has accused the men of copying and taking the company's \nintellectual property when they left to start a rival green iron project, called Element Zero.\nLink to Image\nAlex Ellinghausen\nThe men have denied the allegations. Masterman, who is Element Zero's chief executive, has called Fortescue's \nclaims \"spurious\" and said that their \"green metals technology was developed independently of and is very different \nfrom anything that Fortescue is doing or has done in this space\".\nFortescue secured court orders to raid the offices and homes of the men from mid-May. An independent lawyer \nwas present, and a computer expert was allowed to search and copy any electronic devices, including family \nmembers' computers, while also being required to hand over all passwords and passcodes.\nDocuments released by the Federal Court late on Wednesday, which were previously suppressed, revealed that a \npsychologist was required to attend if a child was present during the raids.\nIn the weeks before those raids, which stretched from Victoria to Western Australia, private investigators were hired \nto spy on and trail Kolodziejczyk and also Winther-Jensen, and provide a report to independent lawyers. The \nlawyers required that report before a search warrant from the Federal Court could be obtained.\nThe extent of that spying in the investigator's report included photographs and Google Maps images of both men's \nprivate residences, floor plans, and also photographs of their wives and children.\nKolodziejczyk, a former hydrogen specialist at Fortescue Future Industries, who lives in Melbourne with his wife \nand five-year-old child, travels frequently to Perth, where Element Zero is headquartered.\nPage 2 of 2\nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue spied on former staff and their families\nPrivate investigators reported observing him at home with his family, noting where his home office was, and \nfollowed him on one occasion to Melbourne airport when he departed on a business trip.\nThe investigators, unable to ascertain Kolodziejczyk's destination, deployed a team to pick up the trail at Perth \nairport, expecting that was where Kolodziejczyk was headed. They were wrong.\nWhile Kolodziejczyk was away on that trip the investigators continued to spy on his family. \"In the meantime, \nsurveillance continues at the Hadfield, Victoria residence, where Dr Kolodziejczyk's wife and child are permanently \nresiding,\" investigators noted.\nKolodziejczyk is a co-founder and chief technology officer of Element Zero.\nWinther-Jensen, who ceased being a director at Element Zero in January, was observed by investigators going to \nthe gym, shopping and watering plants. There were also photographs of his wife and 16-year-old daughter in the \ninvestigator's reports, as well as records of when his daughter left and arrived home from school.\nWinther-Jensen continues to work with Kolodziejczyk and Masterman at another company.\nElement Zero was formed by Kolodziejczyk and Masterman at the end of 2022. Masterman has had a long career \nin the energy industry, including as Fortescue Future Industries' chief financial officer.\nElement Zero said it wants to reduce the carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry. It \nhas patented a technology that aims to convert metal ores to metals, not only iron ore, with zero carbon emissions.\nFortescue said it would \"vigorously\" defend its intellectual property in the development of cutting-edge solutions to \ndecarbonise its Australian iron ore operations by the end of the decade.\n\"As a first mover, our intellectual property is critical to our ongoing success in this pursuit and must be protected at \nall times,\" a Fortescue spokesperson said.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

Other investors include American Airlines, Toyota, Airbus and General Electric.\nSpeaking to The Australian Financial Review, Mr Barrett said the start-up, led by former chief technology officer \nMark Collins - who stepped into the CEO role after Mr Eremenko left earlier this year - had been trying to raise \nfunds since last year.\n\"Last year wasn't a good time to raise money, we had a lead for a very significant round, but that lead [investor] was \nunable to fund it,\" said Mr Barrett, who was also Universal Hydrogen director.\n\"There were dynamics that had nothing to do with the market or technology. There were a number of unfortunate \ntiming coincidences ... It's a really underappreciated determinant of success for these companies.\n\"We were very close to getting through this crisis. We were less than six months of runway from being in a very \nstrong position.\"\nMr Barrett, who co-founded video game developer Rocket Science Games in the 1990s and gave Elon Musk his \nfirst job, said the US government had approached Universal Hydrogen since the news of the collapse with offers to \ninject capital into the start-up to keep it afloat, but he believed it was too late to save it. However, he backed the \nteam and the technology, saying he hoped the company would \"find another home\" for its hydrogen fuel cell tech.\nPage 2 of 2\nCash headwinds ground Fortescue, Playground-backed hydrogen plane\n\"We have test aircraft flying, certification basis, we know the economics of the hydrogen plane are favourable, but \nthere is still a two-year path for certification ... That means you have to keep the development program fed and \nthere's a very small quorum of money that's in the middle,\" Mr Barrett said.\n\"It's not the $5 million cheque, or the $500 million cheque, it's the $50 million cheque that's really hard.\"\nPlayground Global, which Street Talk reports is raising a new fund, is also an investor in federal government-\nbacked PsiQuantum, Agility Robotics, Atomic AI and Ultima Genomics. More than 20 per cent of its portfolio \ncompanies have already hit $US1 billion valuations.\nA statement from Fortescue on yesterday on the collapse of Universal Hydrogen suggested the company was \nundeterred by the the venture's demise.\n\"There remains significant interest in our green energy projects and the prospect of green hydrogen and its \nderivatives,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We are proud to have some of the first green energy projects in the world at final investment decision including our \nArizona Hydrogen project in the United States and our Gladstone PEM50 project in Queensland.",
