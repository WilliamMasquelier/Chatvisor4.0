It operates in the Mining, exploration and drilling of gold, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Ramelius Resources based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Ramelius Resources is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Ramelius Resources.\n\nIf Ramelius Resources is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nGolden chance for miners to buy out rivals amid commodity sell-off - DATA ROOM\nGolden chance for miners to buy out rivals amid commodity sell-off - DATA \nROOM\nThe Australian\nNovember 8, 2024 Friday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 435 words\nByline: EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER\nBody\nA sell-off in gold stocks on Thursday following the US election result could see a raft of groups that were looking to \nraise cash before Christmas pare back the size and price of their deals.\nRecord high gold prices have prompted Australian-listed gold miners to capitalise on their booming share prices \ntrading off the back of the strong sentiment surrounding the commodity.\nBut on Thursday, share prices of gold companies came under substantial pressure, with groups such as Northern \nStar, Spartan, Ramelius, Evolution Mining, Regis Resources and most others in the sector down by more than 5 \nper cent.\nGroups that have strong cash balance sheets may try to capitalise on the opportunity by acquiring peers at their \ncheaper prices now that stocks have weakened.\nThe obvious play is for Ramelius Resources to move on Spartan, which saw its shares fall by more than 15 per \ncent on Thursday, taking its market value to $1.7bn. Spartan's shares closed at $1.24, after they had hit a 2024 \nhigh last month above $1.60.\nRamelius, which is in a $455m net cash position, pounced on Spartan in June, buying an 8.9 per cent stake at 92c \na share, so perhaps the stock needs to fall further before it becomes interested in a deal.\nNorthern Star is also in a strong position for a buyout, with $358m of net cash. Its most logical target is De Grey \nMining, whose shares also fell more than 5 per cent on Thursday.\nPart of the reason behind a rally in the gold price in the past two months has been expectations of geopolitical \ninstability and an uncertain outcome in the US election.\nBut the sweeping victory of Donald Trump in the race for the White House has caught out some gold traders, with \nthe result creating more certainty about US policy.\nPage 2 of 2\nGolden chance for miners to buy out rivals amid commodity sell-off - DATA ROOM\nAlso sending the gold price lower on Thursday was a rally in the US dollar following the election outcome, with the \nUS economy expected to be stronger under Mr Trump.\nHowever, while gold may be volatile for about two months as the market assesses the impact of Mr Trump's \nleadership, if he introduces trading tariffs on other countries such as China, and the US dollar remains high, that \nwould lead to global inflation.\nAnd inflation usually supports a higher gold price.\nThe same would be said about more geopolitical tension, should it occur under Mr Trump.\nGroups that were also looking to raise equity may now have second thoughts over doing so before Christmas, or \nmay raise less funds and at a lower price. Another plus for gold miners wanting to do deals following the election of \nMr Trump is that it may be easier to come across financing for transactions at better rates, sources say.\nLoad-Date: November 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Ramelius Resources.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
