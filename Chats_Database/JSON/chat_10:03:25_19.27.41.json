Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 21\nLength: 880 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nBig organisations such as Fortescue, Cleanaway, Wesfarmers, Korea Zinc and the Royal Automobile Club of \nVictoria have been caught up in the collapse of the Australian division of a controversial US hydrogen vehicle \nmanufacturer.\nHyzon Motors aimed to become the Tesla of hydrogen trucks when it listed on the Nasdaq in July 2021, but has \nsince lost 99 per cent of its value and is now making a low-ball offer to acquire its failed Australian subsidiary out of \nadministration.\nThe collapse of Hyzon's Australian subsidiary was triggered when the parent refused to extend financial support in \nJuly, and comes as the struggling US company is on track to exhaust its cash reserves within seven months at the \ncurrent rate of spending.\nThe demise of Hyzon Motors Australia is the latest setback for the struggling hydrogen sector and comes after \nFortescue chairman and hydrogen enthusiast Andrew Forrest conceded in July that the sector would not grow as \nquickly as he originally hoped.\nIt also comes after Fortescue-backed hydrogen plane developer Universal Hydrogen collapsed in the US in July \nafter burning through almost $150 million of investor capital.\nHyzon had delivered 10 hydrogen buses to Fortescue and was also working on hydrogen-powered rubbish trucks \nfor Cleanaway when its Australian subsidiary was placed in administration on July 11. The subsidiary collapsed \nowing $29.9 million to its creditors, and the list of creditors included 45 local employees.\nHyzon Motors Australia had worked to retrofit hydrogen fuel cells into diesel trucks and buses from a site controlled \nby the RACV in Melbourne's south-east.\nAn Australian subsidiary of Korea Zinc, Ark Energy, was owed $2.89 million at the time of collapse, Cleanaway was \nowed $1.36 million and Wesfarmers subsidiary Coregas claimed $288,000.\nThe vast majority of Hyzon Australia's $29.9 million of debts were owed to Hyzon entities in the US and China.\nPage 2 of 3\nHydrogen collapse hits big Australian firms\nDespite vowing to cease working in Australia as part of efforts to focus more on North American markets, Hyzon's \nparent entity is now trying to acquire the Australian subsidiary under a deed of company arrangement that has been \nrecommended by the administrator, PKF partner Jason Stone.\nMr Stone told creditors they would get a better dividend if they accepted Hyzon's offer, because the US and \nChinese subsidiaries of Hyzon would not claim their full debts if the offer was accepted. But he said the Hyzon \nparent could seek repayment of its secured debts if the Australian subsidiary was instead put into liquidation.\n\"In the event the proposal is not accepted it is understood that HMI [Hyzon's US parent] and the other related party \nentities will seek to prove [reclaim debts] in the liquidation,\" Mr Stone said.\nHe said the best-case scenario under a liquidation was for creditors to receive 7\u00a2 for every dollar owed by Hyzon \nMotors Australia. But he said creditors could receive between 19\u00a2 and 60\u00a2 for each dollar owed if they accepted the \ntakeover by the US parent company.\nFortescue was named as a debtor to Hyzon Motors Australia, allegedly owing the collapsed company just over \n$55,000. Mr Stone did not explain in his report why Fortescue owed the money; however, he did say there was one \n\"after sales client\" who had been invoiced for \"spare parts and other support charges\".\nHyzon had transferred just over $1 million into an accountant's trust account in case Fortescue claimed repairs \nunder warranty on the 10 hydrogen buses it had purchased.\nMr Stone said the administrators were eligible to collect those warranty reserves, and he had ordered the third-party \naccountant to return the money.\n\"To date this has not occurred and proceedings may need to be issued to recover the funds,\" he said.\nThere is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Fortescue.\nThe 10 hydrogen coaches are used to ferry workers between their mine site accommodation and the airport at \nFortescue's Pilbara iron ore mines.\nAustralian businessman Craig Knight led Hyzon to a Nasdaq listing in July 2021 amid a wave of cheap money and \na boom in hydrogen stocks.\nBut the stock has since lost more than 99 per cent of its value on the back of a regulatory probe and the failure of \nthe company to ramp up sales as quickly as hoped.\nMr Knight stepped down in mid-2022 and is barred from being a company director for five years after the US \nSecurities and Exchange Commission accused him of making false statements about Hyzon's progress.\nHyzon shares hit a new low of US5.4\u00a2 on Friday.\nMost other hydrogen stocks have also suffered steep falls over the past three years.\nNorwegian electrolyser manufacturer Nel is down 85 per cent since January 2021, while scandal-plagued Nikola \nMotors is down 99.6 per cent since June 2020.\nElectrolyser manufacturer Plug Power has lost 96.5 per cent of its value since January 2021.\nAside from higher interest rates and slow progress on technology delivery, hydrogen stocks have suffered from the \nfact subsidies promised under the US government's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have proved far harder to access \nthan expected.\nSentiment towards hydrogen has also suffered from perceptions that Republican nominee Donald Trump may scrap \nthe hydrogen incentives in the IRA if returned as president in November.Page 3 of 3\nHydrogen collapse hits big Australian firms\nHyzon's Nasdaq-listed parent lost $US85 million in the six months to June 30.\nLoad-Date: August 22, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue chairman | \"the sector would not grow as quickly as he originally hoped.\" | N.A. |\n| Jason Stone | Administrator | \"To date this has not occurred and proceedings may need to be issued to recover the funds.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
