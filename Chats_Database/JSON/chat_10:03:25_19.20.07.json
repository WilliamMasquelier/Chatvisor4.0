Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: OPINION; Pg. 39\nLength: 777 words\nByline: Patrick Gibbons\nBody\nTransition Andrew Forrest is not alone. Many companies have suffered a similar delusion about a simple, easy and \ncheap future.\nFortescue's hydrogen dreams have come up against the hard energy reality - affordability, reliability and zero \nemissions are difficult to achieve together. But Fortescue is not alone.\nFor the past decade, many have suffered a similar energy delusion. Promises of an easy transition have given way \nto the realisation that nothing with energy or climate ambitions is simple or cheap.\nOnly this month, Google, which had claimed to be carbon-neutral since 2007, said it no longer counted offsets and \nthat it now aimed for neutrality by 2030 because the energy demand associated with AI had seen its emissions \nincrease 48 per cent between 2019 and 2023. Likewise, some Australian funds walked back climate commitments. \nOr just ask Europe.\nThe hype around green hydrogen should be a case study for those interested in the difficulties when it comes to \nenergy and climate.\nDespite green hydrogen being seen as the Swiss Army knife for difficult decarbonisation problems, buyers were \nhard to find, largely because the cost remained stubbornly high and the technical challenges more complex than \nenvisaged.\nAttempts to deliver green hydrogen at $2 a kilogram sounded great at a political level. But, like most politically \ngenerated targets, ambition is no replacement for hard analysis.\nEven with the best assumptions, analysts struggled to get it below $5 a kilogram any time soon. And as with all \nprojections, they depended on the assumptions. The rise in interest rates and equipment costs have cruelled low-\ncost scenarios.\nAs clean energy advocate Michael Liebreich noted earlier this year, when it came to hydrogen, \"expectations have \nraced far ahead of reality\".\nPage 2 of 2\nHard energy reality has mugged Fortescue's hydrogen dream\nWhile various governments and the IEA were making grandiose predictions about how much clean hydrogen would \nbe produced, they bore no relationship to the real world.\nThe Sixth Hydrogen Ministerial held last September in Japan predicted global production of renewable/low-carbon \nhydrogen by 2030 would be 90 million tonnes.\nThis would, Liebreich pointed out, require 60 times more clean hydrogen production than what's already been \nfunded. Even more risibly, he noted an annual demand of 50 million tonnes would have to be created from sectors \nthat do not use hydrogen.\nIn other words, the hydrogen story, at best, is based on wishful thinking. Less charitably, it's based on hype driven \nby subsidy chasing.\nAnd with the increasingly likely return of former president Donald Trump to the White House, the wishful thinking of \nhydrogen advocates will face even further setbacks as the new administration seeks to wind back elements of the \nBiden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. Hydrogen subsidies are on the list.\nThis isn't to say green or clean hydrogen has no future, rather its application will be more modest - green metals, \nsome transport and fertilisers.\nFortescue's about-face reflects the bigger challenge of decarbonising its Pilbara mining operations, for which it still \nclaims will be \"Real Zero by 2030\". Its mines and rail operations annually consume about\n700 million litres of diesel.\nThe push to electrify the Pilbara mines as a way of decarbonising is not straightforward.\nStarting with the diesel trucks that carry iron ore, each of these weigh more than 500 tonnes, and carry 300 tonnes \nof ore. Add in trains about 2.8 kilometres in length, all powered by diesel locomotives, there are clear challenges of \ncost-effectively electrifying what is a global logistical operation that operates 24/7.\nDoing so requires more than just the rollout of renewable energy. Realistically, the push to achieve net zero in the \nmines requires step changes in technology and its commercial deployment, all of which will take time.\nFurther, it highlights the need for a more realistic approach to the challenges of decarbonisation.\nWhether activists and some policymakers want to hear it, the world is not moving off fossil fuels any time soon. Last \nyear saw record demand for oil, coal and gas. This is not about to change.\nThe real world of energy where demand is only rising, with affordability and reliability the key criteria, is only going \nto make it harder for those companies that have overpromised.\nAnd although Fortescue has taken the hard decision to moderate its decarbonisation ambitions and in the process \nlay off 700 people, it's an open question as to who else will follow suit. There is no shortage of companies that have \nmade tough-to-meet commitments that look increasingly unrealistic.\nPatrick Gibbons is a former diplomat and partner at corporate advisory firm Orizontas.\nLoad-Date: July 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
