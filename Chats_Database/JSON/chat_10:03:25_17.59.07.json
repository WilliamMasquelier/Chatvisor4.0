It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nHydrogen credit could blow its $6.7b allocation Development\nHydrogen credit could blow its $6.7b allocation; Development\nAustralian Financial Review\nMay 16, 2024 Thursday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 8\nLength: 546 words\nByline: Ben Potter\nBody\nHydrogen projects backed by large companies like Fortescue and Woodside are set to be early beneficiaries of the \nfederal budget's $6.7 billion production tax credit, but one developer says the measure will attract a lot of \ninternational investment and could blow past its allocation.\nMichael Myer, a member of Melbourne's wealthy Myer family and chairman of Sunshine Hydro, said two projects \nthe developer is pursuing in Gladstone and northern NSW could yield enough hydrogen to earn $730 million in \nproduction tax credits at the $2 per kilogram rate.\n\"I think they've been conservative on what [it] will cost them, but I think the benefit to the national economy will far \noutweigh what might be a cost in the forward estimates ... in terms of jobs, export earnings, bringing down the \nwholesale price of energy and green fuels,\" Mr Myer said. \"It'll pay for itself many times over.\"\nThe budget also topped up the Hydrogen Headstart scheme - which targets hydrogen projects of more than 50 \nmegawatts - with $1.3 billion, making $8 billion in new funding overall.\nFortescue founder Andrew Forrest celebrated the production credit as a force multiplier that could help Australia to \nbecome \"the Saudi Arabia of energy production\" in a zero-carbon world. But he warned to beware of white-anting of \nthe production credit rules by fossil fuel companies.\n\"It will also lower the cost of energy for every single Australian by making green hydrogen competitive with fossil \nfuels, spurring massive renewable energy projects in sparsely populated regions where employment is needed \nmost,\" Mr Forrest said.\nThe iron ore billionaire, whose company has taken investment decisions on $1.15 billion of green hydrogen and \nammonia projects in Queensland, Western Australia and Arizona, said fossil fuel companies were preparing to \nundermine the production credits program to foil the development of a low-cost competitor.\n\"The government has sent a clear message - business-as-usual for the fossil fuel monopoly driving up the cost of \nliving and trashing our environment is over.\nPage 2 of 2\nHydrogen credit could blow its $6.7b allocation Development\n\"Of course, the fossil fuel sector which, relative to the rest of us in heavy industry, is not a big employer, yet are \nexpert at shifting income around so they don't pay fair taxes in Australia, will use profits to try to complicate this \nlegislation to make it unworkable.\n\"The government should be fully prepared for this lobbying effort, one which will attempt to stop a cheaper \ncompetitor for fossil fuels being made right here in Australia, taxed right here in Australia, and enjoyed by Australian \nmums and dads and jobseekers.\"\nFortescue's projects include a $US550 million ($828 million) Phoenix Hydrogen Hub where it plans to build an 80 \nmegawatt electrolyser and liquefaction plant producing up to 11,000 tonnes a year of liquid green hydrogen, a \n$US150 million ($226 million), 50 MW green hydrogen project at Gladstone in Queensland, and a $US50 million \n($75 million) green iron trial plant at Christmas Creek iron ore mine in WA.\nWoodside and Fortescue are among multinationals chasing green hydrogen projects in Australia.\nGlobal oil and gas giant BP is the operator of the proposed 26 gigawatt Asian Renewable Energy Hub in the Pilbara \nregion of WA, and Queensland's Stanwell Corp is backing a large hydrogen project.\nLoad-Date: May 18, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
