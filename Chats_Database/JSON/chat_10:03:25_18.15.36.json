[Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has never had an Indigenous land use agreement with the Yindjibarndi people, despite mining on their land for over a decade, leading to a $500 million compensation claim for unpaid royalties, interest, and damages for cultural and spiritual losses, which could result in a significant financial and reputational impact on the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued in court that compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should not be based on the value of the minerals extracted from their land, despite industry standards where native title holders receive a percentage of royalties, raising concerns about the company's approach to Indigenous compensation. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest held private meetings in a Perth park with Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation leader Michael Woodley in an attempt to settle a billion-dollar compensation case, but the talks failed as the parties remain hundreds of millions of dollars apart, highlighting the ongoing dispute and lack of resolution. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue is facing a potential $1 billion compensation claim from the Yindjibarndi people, including $500 million for economic losses and an additional $500 million for the destruction of more than 240 culturally significant sites, which could have major financial and reputational consequences for the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue was left exposed to the Yindjibarndi compensation claim in 2020 after the High Court denied the company special leave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings, which found that a large part of its Solomon iron ore mining hub was built without permission from traditional owners, raising legal and ethical concerns about its operations. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued that any compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should be funded by the State of Western Australia because it granted the mining tenements, but the WA government maintains that Fortescue should pay, creating further uncertainty over the company's financial liability. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Institutional investors are increasingly avoiding Fortescue, making it the least-held stock among the 10 largest companies on the ASX, with concerns over its lower iron ore grades, high executive turnover, and heavy spending on unprofitable green hydrogen projects. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been ranked as the \"least-loved\" stock among major Australian companies in a JPMorgan survey of 50 fund managers, reflecting ongoing skepticism about its business strategy and financial stability. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Analysts and brokers have been bearish on Fortescue for an extended period, with most maintaining a sell rating on the stock since November 2022, in contrast to competitors BHP and Rio Tinto, which have never held a majority sell rating since at least 2009. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue lost its final buy rating in January after JPMorgan's head of Australian resources advised investors to take profits, with the stock subsequently falling more than 10% from its peak in early February, raising concerns about its valuation and future performance. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's unconventional management style under Andrew Forrest has left the investment community baffled, with concerns that the company's entrepreneurial approach lacks the structured management seen in competitors like BHP and Rio Tinto. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been criticized for its approach to Indigenous compensation, with an expert witness arguing in court that the company\u2019s attempt to exclude the value of minerals from compensation calculations is \"nonsensical\" and unfair to the Yindjibarndi people. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue began mining at the Solomon hub in 2013 without an agreement from the Yindjibarndi\u2019s registered native title body and instead dealt with a breakaway group, raising ethical concerns about its treatment of traditional owners. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has slammed the Biden administration\u2019s proposed hydrogen incentive rules, arguing that they could triple the cost of low-carbon hydrogen projects and stifle growth in the sector, potentially impacting the company\u2019s green energy ambitions. [Australian Financial Review, Peter Ker, April 22, 2024]. - Fortescue's iron ore shipments fell 6% in the March quarter compared to the same period last year due to a derailment in late December and weather disruptions, raising concerns about the company's logistics resilience and ability to meet its full-year shipment targets.

But he warned to beware of white-anting of \nthe production credit rules by fossil fuel companies.\n\"It will also lower the cost of energy for every single Australian by making green hydrogen competitive with fossil \nfuels, spurring massive renewable energy projects in sparsely populated regions where employment is needed \nmost,\" Mr Forrest said.\nThe iron ore billionaire, whose company has taken investment decisions on $1.15 billion of green hydrogen and \nammonia projects in Queensland, Western Australia and Arizona, said fossil fuel companies were preparing to \nundermine the production credits program to foil the development of a low-cost competitor.\n\"The government has sent a clear message - business-as-usual for the fossil fuel monopoly driving up the cost of \nliving and trashing our environment is over.\nPage 2 of 2\nHydrogen credit could blow its $6.7b allocation Development\n\"Of course, the fossil fuel sector which, relative to the rest of us in heavy industry, is not a big employer, yet are \nexpert at shifting income around so they don't pay fair taxes in Australia, will use profits to try to complicate this \nlegislation to make it unworkable.\n\"The government should be fully prepared for this lobbying effort, one which will attempt to stop a cheaper \ncompetitor for fossil fuels being made right here in Australia, taxed right here in Australia, and enjoyed by Australian \nmums and dads and jobseekers.\"\nFortescue's projects include a $US550 million ($828 million) Phoenix Hydrogen Hub where it plans to build an 80 \nmegawatt electrolyser and liquefaction plant producing up to 11,000 tonnes a year of liquid green hydrogen, a \n$US150 million ($226 million), 50 MW green hydrogen project at Gladstone in Queensland, and a $US50 million \n($75 million) green iron trial plant at Christmas Creek iron ore mine in WA.\nWoodside and Fortescue are among multinationals chasing green hydrogen projects in Australia.\nGlobal oil and gas giant BP is the operator of the proposed 26 gigawatt Asian Renewable Energy Hub in the Pilbara \nregion of WA, and Queensland's Stanwell Corp is backing a large hydrogen project.\nLoad-Date: May 18, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Ben Potter\nDate: May 16, 2024\nTitle: Hydrogen credit could blow its $6.7b allocation\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Incitec hopeful on stalled Gibson plant\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Nick Evans\n### Date: May 17, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nIncitec hopeful on stalled Gibson plant\nIncitec hopeful on stalled Gibson plant\nThe Australian\nMay 17, 2024 Friday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 475 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue will be \"doing the numbers\" on its stalled Gibson Island hydrogen plant in Queensland \nwith a major federal government subsidy scheme bolstering the case for proceeding, according to project partner \nIncitec Pivot.\nThe Gibson Island project has been the flagship of Fortescue's proposed hydrogen production centres in Australia \nbut the company has delayed several investment decisions for moving forward with the development at Incitec's \nformer Queensland fertiliser plant.\n\"It's early days (but) I'm sure they have been doing the numbers,\" Incitec managing director Mauro Neves said. \"We \nare hopeful that with the incentives that were put in place to make those projects economic ...

The \"green hydrogen production credit will be \nbeneficial for project economics no doubt, but our current cost estimates are $US8.30 per kilogram for green \nhydrogen in Australia, and falling comparatively slowly to 2030,\" Mr Griffin said. \"So $2/kg won't immediately move \nthe needle when we expect prices of maximum $3 to allow green hydrogen to compete into steel for example.\"\nLoad-Date: May 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Nick Evans\nDate: May 17, 2024\nTitle: Incitec hopeful on stalled Gibson plant\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Busy Forrest on the job in Morocco\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Yoni Bashan, Christine Lacy\n### Date: May 29, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nBusy Forrest on the job in Morocco\nBusy Forrest on the job in Morocco\nThe Australian\nMay 29, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian2 Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 13\nLength: 878 words\nByline: MARGIN CALL YONI BASHAN & CHRISTINE LACY\nBody\nFortescue chairman Andrew Forrest landed his private jet in the Moroccan capital of Rabat overnight, hoping to \nadvance one of his ongoing investments in the country - and no, we don't mean the bilateral relations forming with \nEnergy Minister Leila Benali.\nIt's all part of what Team Fortescue told us was a \"long-planned trip\" to help Morocco become a \"major player in \nthe global energy transition\", a deal Benali helped broker during a visit by Forrest and Fortescue to Rabat in \nFebruary - and sealed with a kiss in Paris, evidently, thanks to some extravagant PDA caught by a wily snapper \nnearby. As a Forrest spox told us, the Rabat visit involves meetings with Fortescue's joint-venture partner OCP \n(Benali being one of its directors along with half the Moroccan cabinet, although Chairman Twiggy only deals with \nChairman Mostafa Terrab, we're informed), plus an event at the Australian embassy, a -speaking gig at the Africa -\nBusiness School and meetings with \"key ministers and local ambassadors\".\nLocal media was reporting on Tuesday that Forrest - \"surnomme par la presse australienne 'Twiggy' \" - had been \ndue to meet Moroccan Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch (apparently false, not happening, never was) and Industry \nMinister (and OCP director) Ryad Mezzour.\nNo pre-arranged business commitments with Benali either - who was doorstopped by a press pack and didn't want \nto comment on all the fuss - but nothing to stop the Twig from finding a corner table at Rick's Cafe in Casablanca. \nIt's only an hour's drive from the capital. Bah, even if she doesn't turn up - they'll always have Paris.\nIsraeli interlude Meanwhile, we note Twiggy's Bombardier Global Express 7500 had been in Tel Aviv just prior to \ndeparting for Morocco. We asked what Forrest was doing in Israel but his people would only say it was personal, \nrather than Fortescue-related. No doubt he met with a few Knesset members. The visit didn't sound so much like a \nsolidarity visit post-October 7 and more like an opportunity to cut a few deals. On what? TBC, we hear. Stay tuned.\nKing's share play A panicked Phil King appears to have tried to play the market over his holding in luxury goods \nmerchant Cettire, led by reclusive rich-lister Dean Mintz. Cettire has been the subject of ongoing prodding by this \nmasthead and we hear King was on the phone to News Corp journalists last Monday sniffing about for details of an \nimpending scoop - one that he knew would be hardly flattering to the business. On that basis, King's Regal Funds \nPage 2 of 2\nBusy Forrest on the job in Morocco\nManagement tried to beat the news (and the serious risk of a price drop, which ended up happening), selling 25,300 \nshares in Cettire for about $635,000 the very next day, well before any article had been printed.\nWe can't explain why he then bought back roughly one-third of those shares hours later. Did he suddenly think \nbetter of acting on the whiff of a rumour? In any case, once Joyce Moullakis and John Stensholt's yarn was \npublished exactly one week later King immediately scrambled to buy more Cettire, purchasing nearly $1.1m worth \nof stock - and not all of it at a discount. We put questions to King about this mischief but didn't receive a reply.\nCars in reverse Wretched news for investors in Peter Warren Automotive on Tuesday, the company announcing a \n20 per cent profit downgrade, with projections coming in somewhere between $52m and $57m.\nThat set off a share price crash to a low of $1.84, a cliff drop from the $2.21 and $2.40 that directors Niran Peiris \nand Paul Warren have been paying, respectively, to buy up shares in recent months. Peiris acquired 90,000 shares \nfrom March to mid-April; Warren, eldest son of company founder Peter Warren, bought 122,000-odd shares at the \nend of February.\nThe timing of these purchases could reflect some crappy judgment. Peiris and Warren would be well across the \ndeclining customer demand for vehicles, the higher costs of holding them, the discounting, the thin margin on sales. \nThere's also the big, billowing red flag of CEO Mark Weaver announcing his exit from the company in March, a \nsignal of doom and decay for any company right before the release of their results. Peiris didn't care, it seems, and \nbought more than $100,000 a week later, followed by another tranche a fortnight afterwards for a total of $200,000.\nNot that either of them are alone in making oddly miscalculated stock purchases in this sector. Two years ago the \nSutton family paid a premium for Quadrant Capital's remaining post-IPO stake in Peter Warren, a $50m deal that \npriced the shares at roughly $3.18, well above the market price of $2.99 at the time, and far higher than the $1.87 at \nwhich the shares closed on Tuesday.\nWe asked Peiris and Warren for some reasoning behind their purchases, to which CFO Victor Cuthell replied, \ntelling us both directors are \"strong supporters of the Peter Warren strategy, its long-term outlook and its prospects \nin general,\" and adding that they still hold those views post-trading update and even consider the investments \"well-\nmade\". Surely all said through gritted teeth. An alternative take is they've been sleep-walking through board \nmeetings - or maybe auto execs are generally in denial about the turmoil of their industry?\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Peter Warren executives mis-time their share buys\nLoad-Date: May 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Yoni Bashan, Christine Lacy\nDate: May 29, 2024\nTitle: Busy Forrest on the job in Morocco\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Risks in Twiggy's tryst with minister\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Nick Evans, Yoni Bashan, Mohammad Alfares\n### Date: May 29, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nRisks in Twiggy's tryst with minister\nRisks in Twiggy's tryst with minister\nThe Australian\nMay 29, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian2 Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: THENATION; Pg. 3\nLength: 661 words\nByline: Nick Evans, Yoni Bashan, Mohammad Alfares\nBody\nAndrew Forrest's big plans in -Morocco could be complicated by his romantic connection with the country's Energy \nMinister, who also sits on the board of Fortescue's joint -venture company in the North African country.\nIn her first comment on the matter since The Australian -revealed her identity, Moroccan Energy Minister Leila \nBenali -refused to shed any light on a photograph of her allegedly sharing an intimate moment with the Fortescue \nchairman in France last week.\nIn footage posted to a local news site, Ms Benali was asked by a Moroccan journalist whether she had a personal \nor business -relationship with Mr Forrest.\nThe minister did not confirm the authenticity of the photograph, but did not deny it. \"No, no I will not speak,\" she \nsaid.\nThe romantic connection threatens to complicate matters for Fortescue as it draws up plans for a multi-billion-dollar \nrenewable energy and green ammonia investment in Morocco with joint venture partners OCP Group.\nIn addition to being Energy Minister, Ms Benali sits on the board of state-owned OCP, along with other Moroccan \ngovernment ministers.\nOCP is one of the biggest phosphate miners in the world, controlling Morocco's vast deposits of the fertiliser - \nestimated to make up more than 70 per cent of the world's known reserves.\nTogether the two companies plan to build a green ammonia hub in the country, adding to OCP's fertiliser exports.\nThe joint venture was announced in April, and includes -renewable energy generation and \"large-scale integrated \ngreen -ammonia and green fertiliser production capacity\".\nThe two companies also plan a research, development and education facility near Marrakesh.\nPage 2 of 2\nRisks in Twiggy's tryst with minister\nOCP's plans are controversial in Morocco.

Its initial plans for a green ammonia production centre were centred around the \nsmall fishing town of Tarfaya in southwest Morocco - once best known for the treacherous waters off its coast, a \n19th-century British fortress now crumbling into the sea, and for being the closest mainland town to the surfing \nresorts of the Canary Islands, about 80km to the west.\nOCP planned to build a -3.8 gigawatt wind and solar farm in the region, with an eventual production capacity of one \nmillion tonnes of green ammonia a year from 2027 and three million tonnes from 2032.\nBut, in addition to its isolation, Tarfaya is also disputed territory. It is only 35km north of the disputed regional border \nof the Western Sahara - a Spanish colony until 1975, but since occupied by Morocco.\nMoroccan control of the -region is disputed by the traditional Sahrawi people. Their separatist movement has this \nyear launched attacks on Moroccan troops in the region - which already hosts large wind farms built by companies \nowned by the country's royal family.\nIt is unclear whether Fortescue's joint venture with OCP will focus on the Moroccan company's original plans, and \nthe Australian mining and energy giant has not elaborated further on their work in the region.\n\"The Fortescue team is working with key stakeholders as we continue to develop our ambitious strategy with OCP, \ndeveloped over more than two years, to develop green energy, hydrogen and ammonia in Morocco,\" a spokesman \nsaid on Tuesday.\nFortescue's African plans have already suffered one major setback this month, after it was - replaced as the \npreferred developer of the giant Grand Inga hydro-electric project in the Democratic Republic of Congo by Nigerian \noil company Natural Oilfield Services.\nThe Grand Inga, estimated to come with a total cost of more than $US80bn ($120bn), was a favoured project of Dr \nForrest, and Fortescue's involvement was announced with fanfare in mid-2021, during the first flush of \nannouncements around the company's plans to become a green energy giant by the end of the decade.\nMARGIN CALL P13\nLoad-Date: May 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Nick Evans, Yoni Bashan, Mohammad Alfares\nDate: May 29, 2024\nTitle: Risks in Twiggy's tryst with minister\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Twiggy's Moroccan energiser\n## Media outlet: Herald Sun\n### Author: Matthew Benns\n### Date: May 30, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nTwiggy's Moroccan energiser\nTwiggy's Moroccan energiser\nHerald Sun (Australia)\nMay 30, 2024 Thursday\nHeraldSun Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 21\nLength: 395 words\nByline: Matthew Benns\nBody\nStaff inside billionaire Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest's mining empire have confirmed he has been romantically involved \nwith a Moroccan politician.\nMr Forrest, 62, was photographed passionately kissing a woman in the Place de Vosges in Paris at the weekend.\nThe woman who had enjoyed the romantic walk with the Australian green energy champion along the Rue des \nFrancs-Bourgeois on the banks of the River Seine was later identified as Morocco's energy minister Leila Benali.\nConfronted by Moroccan media, Ms Benali at first declined to comment. \"No, no I will not speak,\" she said before \nbeing escorted away.\nA statement later released to Morocco World News claimed she was preparing to start defamation proceedings \nover the \"offensive publication\" of the picture in The Daily Mail and her name in The Australian.\nIt said Ms Benali \"denies any connection to either picture as a minister responsible in the government as well as a \nMoroccan woman and mother\".",

[The Australian, Nick Cater, April 29, 2024].  \n- Fortescue's iron ore shipments fell 6% in the March quarter compared to the same period last year due to a derailment in late December and weather disruptions, raising concerns about the company's logistics resilience and ability to meet its full-year shipment targets. [The Age, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n- Fortescue's Iron Bridge project continues to face significant operational issues, with a faulty water pipeline and plant inefficiencies slowing output, forcing the company to undertake costly repairs and reconfigure its processing plant, which could delay production targets. [The Age, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n- Fortescue has forecast that its full-year iron ore shipments will likely come in at the lower end of its guidance range due to operational setbacks, including a derailment and adverse weather, which could impact revenue and investor confidence.

[The Australian, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n- Fortescue's iron ore exports dropped 11% from the December quarter, and the decline in shipments pushed up average C1 cash costs by 7% to $18.93 per tonne, increasing operational expenses and potentially squeezing profit margins. [The Australian, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n- Fortescue will need to maintain near-record export rates to meet its full-year shipment guidance, requiring an ambitious 53.5 million tonnes in the June quarter, which may be difficult given recent logistical and operational setbacks.

[Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n- Fortescue has been ranked as the \"least-loved\" stock among major Australian companies in a JPMorgan survey of 50 fund managers, reflecting ongoing skepticism about its business strategy and financial stability.
