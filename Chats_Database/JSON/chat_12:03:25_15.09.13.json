Instead new rules \naround trailing liability provisions were introduced, which could slug former owners of the licence areas with the bill, \nthereby putting the onus on them to do adequate due diligence should the assets change hands.\nThe exploration permit in the current matter was granted to Woodside, Shell and BHP Billiton Petroleum in 1997, \nwith Woodside owning a half share and the other two companies one quarter each.\nProduction from the Laminaria and Corallina oilfields began in 1999. The writ filed with WA's Supreme Court says \nShell then sold two-thirds of its interest to Woodside in March 2005, and one-third to British company Paladin.\nShell says in its claim that the agreement with each company \"expressly provided ... that Woodside/Paladin is liable \nfor all environmental, abandonment, reclamation, remediation and restoration claims\". The claim says following the \nfailure of TSOGA, neither that company nor its liquidator made any efforts to remediate the platform. Woodside was \ncontacted for comment.\nLoad-Date: May 30, 2024\nPage 2 of 2\nShell sues Woodside and Paladin over $87m oil platform clean-up bill\nEnd of Document\n\nOnly output one of these values: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and nothing else.\n                ",
