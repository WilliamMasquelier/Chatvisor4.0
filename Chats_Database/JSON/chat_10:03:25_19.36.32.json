The couple confirmed their separation soon after the share \nallocation.\nIn a joint statement on Thursday, the Forrests said it was an appropriate time to step aside as co-chairs.\n\"We couldn't be more proud of what has been achieved over the past 23 years and, with Minderoo's 2030 strategy \nnow finalised and being implemented, it is the right time for change on the board,\" the Forrests said.\nThe Forrests said that, with Mr Myers as the independent chair, Minderoo would continue to deliver on its \"mission \nto forge a fair future by challenging inequalities and campaigning for meaningful change\".\nThe Forrests' daughter, Grace, left the Minderoo board in May, along with former Dow Chemicals chief executive \nAndrew Liveris.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrests step down as co-chairs of Minderoo\nAnd although she remains committed to Minderoo, Nicola Forrest is in the process of setting up the Coaxial \nFoundation to pursue additional philanthropic objectives.\nThe Minderoo restructure earlier this year cut the workforce by about a third and ruffled feathers within the \nfoundation that operates out of offices in Perth.\nIt was overseen by Minderoo CEO John Hartman, who last month stood down as a director of the Forrests' private \ncompany, Tattarang. His resignation left Andrew and Nicola as the sole directors of Tattarang, the entity that \ncontrols about two-thirds of the Forrest family's shares in Fortescue and most of their private business interests.\nMr Hartman remains CEO of both Minderoo and Tattarang.\nMr Myers, a Minderoo director since 2014, said he was honoured to become chairman. \"The unprecedented \ngenerosity, vision and optimism of Andrew and Nicola Forrest is embodied in the Minderoo Foundation. I will do my \nbest as chair to help realise their aspirations for the enduring benefit of Australia and the wider world,\" he said.\nDr Forrest said the foundation would continue its important work, which in recent times had focused on helping \nvulnerable communities; gender and equality; and protecting oceans. \"I have an unshakeable passion for steering \nthe world away from a potentially catastrophic future, and will continue to steer Minderoo, Tattarang and Fortescue \nin the one direction - to ensure we leave our planet liveable for future generations,\" he said.\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
