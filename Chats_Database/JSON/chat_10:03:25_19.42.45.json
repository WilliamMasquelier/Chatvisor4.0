Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"Fortescue's ambitious target to decarbonise the company's iron ore mines by 2030.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Chief Executive of Fortescue Metals | \"Fortescue was moving rapidly to decarbonise the iron ore operations.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Chief Executive of Fortescue Metals | \"To achieve the 2030 target, it would need to swap out hundreds of pieces of diesel mining equipment at the end of their life with zero-emissions alternatives.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Chief Executive of Fortescue Metals | \"As the global mining industry continues to evolve, we're proud to be at the forefront of driving innovation in value-adding green technology and showing the world that industry can decarbonise.\" | N.A. |\n| Yang Dongsheng | Chairman of XCMG | \"XCMG now offered electric options across its entire product range, with new energy products accounting for 18 per cent of revenue.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
