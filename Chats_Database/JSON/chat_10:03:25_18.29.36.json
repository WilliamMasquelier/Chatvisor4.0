His credits \ninclude selling Waste Services Group to Livingbridge for about $500 million in 2021, and Fermentum Group to \nJapanese giant Kirin's Lion business.\nAt Azure, Combes will focus on hunting down private equity gigs for the firm across red-hot sectors of advanced \nmanufacturing, waste and defence, in addition to food and beverage. Azure is also shipping off its Sydney-based \npartner and ex-Goldman Sachs infrastructure banker Phil Prenc - having just divested a slice of Linx on behalf of \nCanadian giant Brookfield - to co-lead the newly created Melbourne office with Combes.\nCombes joins Azure's senior leadership across industrials and private equity that includes Adrian Arundell, Grant \nMansell and Ben Sloman in Sydney, and Olivia Boyne, David Flynn, Daniel Della Vedova and Michael Campion in \nPerth. \"Having started my career in Perth, I have always admired what the Azure team have achieved over many \nyears; so I am thrilled to reunite with Adrian and help expand their market-leading business on the East Coast,\" \nCombes said.\nAlthough best recognised for advising mining companies, Azure has been winning a steady stream of work in \nindustrials and sponsors, including overseeing 7-Eleven Australia's $1.7 billion sale to Japan's Seven & I.\nThe firm's other roles have included advising Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners on its $1 billion acquisition of \nMinRes' pit-to-port road in Onslow, Westfarmers on the sale of its Evol LNG business, and gold miner Ramelius on \nits attempts to buy Canada's Karora and then local peer Westgold.\n\"Nick has developed a strong reputation as a leading M&A adviser. The appointment of someone of his calibre \ndeepens our private sponsors focus and builds on the momentum generated by Adrian Arundell's relocation to \nSydney earlier this year,\" Azure managing partner Richie Baston said.\nPage 2 of 2\nAzure poaches KPMG PE co-lead for Melbourne start; Street Talk\nAzure Capital, which sold a 50 per cent stake to Natixis in July 2019, has about 45 dealmakers - from analysts to \npartners - and is frequently spotted in resources, energy and industrials deals.\nIts last partner addition was Olivia Boyne, who led 7-Eleven's sale with David Flynn and has been advising financial \nsponsors and industrials clients at the firm since 2015.\nLoad-Date: June 14, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\nNone\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
