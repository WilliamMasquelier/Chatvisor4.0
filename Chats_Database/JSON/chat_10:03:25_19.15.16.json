But because Andrew Forrest and his \nleadership team spent the past three years waving away genuine concerns about the plans that were being \nexpressed by investors, market analysts, hydrogen and energy experts, and even the company's own staff - many \nof whom left in frustration well ahead of Wednesday's announcement.\nIn that time Fortescue has become increasingly erratic in its strategy and less tolerant of criticism - both internally \nand from the media and the investment community, as the company embraced the new vision of its founder and the \n\"creative chaos\" that came with it.\nYou cannot fault Forrest for his ambition, his commitment to innovation, and his attempt to try to drive a shift to \ngreen energy by bringing the scale of Fortescue's resources to bear on a problem others have found too difficult to \ngrapple with.\nHopefully some good will eventually come of all that frenzied work. But belief alone cannot defy reality, and it has \nbeen clear for some time that Fortescue took on more than it could ever handle - perhaps to the detriment of \nprojects that could have been achieved.\nPlenty of voices inside Fortescue have been saying that along the journey, but have been told to get with the \nprogram or leave.\nPage 2 of 2\nHumiliating move raises serious fears for our reputation\nThe reputational damage brought about by the retreat from this green foray is enormous, both to Fortescue and to \nother Australian companies operating overseas.\nForrest has spent the past four years touring developing nations making big promises about the jobs that green \nhydrogen will bring, and the economic transformation his company could help deliver to some of the poorest \ncountries in the world, if they give Fortescue access to their resources.\nFew, if any, of those promises will now be delivered - and that will not be easily forgotten the next time an Australian \ncompany rolls into town looking for support for a mining or energy project.\nMany investors will welcome Wednesday's backdown as offering hope the company will return its focus to the \nmining arm where it makes its money. But real questions still need to be asked about how the rest of the Fortescue \nboard did not reign in Forrest's green ambitions well before now.\nLoad-Date: July 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"You cannot fault Forrest for his ambition, his commitment to innovation, and his attempt to try to drive a shift to green energy by bringing the scale of Fortescue's resources to bear on a problem others have found too difficult to grapple with.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
