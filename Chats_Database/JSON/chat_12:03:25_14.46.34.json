It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nWhat's the deal with oyster-shell gins?\nWhat's the deal with oyster-shell gins?\nBrisbane Times\nDecember 6, 2024 Friday 5:33 AM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 375 words\nByline: Terry Durack\nHighlight: Want to feel like a merman or mermaid? Do a \"Shelly\" and slurp down a martini.\nBody\nYou forget just how good an oyster is until you have one. And then you wonder why you bother eating anything \nelse. The way the briny juices and creamy flesh take over your mouth and then your brain is as mystical as it is \nphysical; the closest you'll get to being a mer-creature.\nLink to Image\nSimon Letch\nI get this feeling every time I eat an oyster. But this isn't about oysters: this is about the shells. Their bowl fits into \nthe curve of your palm. The outer shell is rough, ragged, tactile. For poet Seamus Heaney, they \"clacked on the \nplates\". The inner shell is smooth, iridescent, glowing. Slug down the actual oyster (\"my tongue was a filling \nestuary, my palate hung with starlight\") and the shell itself has many uses.\nMostly calcium carbonate, they can be crushed and ground for the production of bricks, used to filter water and to \nmaintain the pH balance in soil. More importantly (to my mind), they also do a lot for gin.\nOyster-shell gins are remarkable for their minerality, salinity and depth. There must be a dozen on the market \nalready, from North of Eden on the Sapphire Coast of NSW and Wharf Street from Forster on the Mid North Coast, \nto Bass & Flinders on the Mornington Peninsula.\nLink to Image\nPenny Stephens\nNow we really have something to drink with oysters - like the oyster-shell martini at Saint Peter at the Grand \nNational in Paddington, Sydney. The bar infuses Archie Rose gin with long-spine sea urchin, adding drops of \nhouse-made oyster shell acid that float on top like lily pads. \nIn Melbourne, Pearl Diver bar adds to the oyster's mystique with its Sea & Shell martini, made with Saint Felix \noyster-shell gin and served with a spherified olive in an oyster shell. \nPage 2 of 2\nWhat's the deal with oyster-shell gins?\nThe clever lads at Never Never Distilling in McLaren Vale, South Australia, are even pushing \"the Shelly\", a ritual in \nwhich you first slurp down your oyster, then fill the shell with their frozen oyster-shell gin before slurping that down, \ntoo.\nI'm keen on this idea of re-utilising oyster shells as vessels for drinks, sauces and other seafood. Boiled clean, we \ncan use them as spoons and scoops or fill them with sea-salted butter. Smart, huh? \nBut really, they're already designed to be the perfect vessel. For an oyster. \ntheemptyplate@goodweekend.com.au\nGraphic\n \nPearl Diver's oyster shell gin martini.\nLoad-Date: January 4, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
