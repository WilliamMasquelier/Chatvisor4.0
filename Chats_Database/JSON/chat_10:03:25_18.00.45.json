It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 3\nBillionairrre rich-listers in carve-up\nBillionairrre rich-listers in carve-up\nThe Australian\nAugust 27, 2024 Tuesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 13\nLength: 1103 words\nByline: MARGIN CALL WITH YONI BASHAN & NICK EVANS\nBody\nTake two of Melbourne's most lauded billionaires, arm them with a phalanx of eminent lawyers, and square them off \nagainst each other over a carve-up of wealth and assets - accumulated over half-a-lifetime of marriage.\nYes, it's been a decade since rich-lister Alex Waislitz and his ex-wife Heloise Pratt - daughter of the late cardboard \ntycoon Richard Pratt - ended their union on seemingly amicable terms. Both moved quickly to find new partners, \nboth equally raffish: Waislitz with singer-actor Rebekah Behbahani (currently filming a reality TV show while also \nbeing sued by her sister) and Pratt with former Noiseworks rocker Jon Stevens, once a fiance to Jodhi Meares until \nshe had him charged with domestic assault (police withdrew the case months later).\nNearly 10 years divorced and not a murmur of any financial discord between them. Both achieved spectacular \nwealth through their joint-ownership of Thorney Investments, started by Waislitz in the early 1990s, although \nHeloise was basically born into luxury through her late father's success with Visy.\nBut whatever held until now as a fragile peace appears to have shattered, with Margin Call learning of a breakdown \nin efforts to finalise their financial separation.\nThis has been months in the making, leaving an impasse and a pile of legal letters that lawyers have been unable \nto clean up themselves.\nUglier still is the fact that Heloise is allegedly moving to make a greater claim on her ownership of Thorney \nInvestments. Margin Call hears she wants a sizeable portion of the group, potentially enough to take it off her ex-\nhusband and relegate him to the very bottom of the annual rich list, or off the steep cliff that follows Glencore CFO \nSteve Kalmin (in 250th place, with a net wealth of $590m). Her camp says that because it was her father's seed \nmoney injected at the start of the business, she's technically entitled to more - even though it was repaid.\nAnd perhaps there's some truth to this claim.\nIn 1991, Waislitz was given a $1.15m parcel of Amcor shares by his late father-in-law, which was parlayed into a \n$300m investment portfolio by the end of the decade. Waislitz's current net wealth is estimated to be in the order of \nPage 2 of 3\nBillionairrre rich-listers in carve-up\n$1.5bn. Heloise, chair of the philanthropic Pratt Foundation, and still listed as a director of Thorney, is worth at least \ndouble that amount, but given her family's ownership of Visy and Pratt Industries, a far more dizzying sum is just as \npossible.\nThe devil in all this is that while Heloise may demand a greater claim, Waislitz could conceivably do the same with \nthe Pratt wealth, which could make a mess of matters, though even if he's tempted to hit that button Waislitz will still \nhave to wait his turn.\nSomeone is already attempting to make a play on the family estate and its trust, Paula Hitchcock, a 27-year-old \nhalf-sister to Heloise and her siblings Fiona Geminder and Anthony Pratt. This happens once every couple of years \nor so, meaning Waislitz will have to get in line.\nMine battle Desperate not to have its name besmirched, Rio Tinto is sicking its top scientists onto one of the world's \nmost influential academic journals.\nThey're demanding Scientific Reports, a peer-reviewed title that shares a publisher with the prestigious Nature, \nretract a paper that criticises Rio's bid to develop Europe's biggest lithium play in western Serbia.\nHaven't heard of the Jadar project? It's one of the hottest political potatoes in the Balkans right now, worth $2.4bn \nand likely to cement Rio's reputation as a leading lithium producer - if it goes ahead.\nOpposition to the project has drawn thousands of protesters onto Belgrade's streets and at one point dragged in \nSerbian tennis ace Novak Djokovic.\nNow, Rio chief scientist Nigel Steward and three Serbian colleagues are blasting nasty letters to the editor of \nScientific Reports, demanding it withdraw a July paper that said Jadar is \"not worth mining in terms of \nenvironmental risks\" and will \"certainly destroy one of only three water-bearing areas in Serbia\".\nWrong, wrong and wrong, says Steward's letter, which attacked a swag of apparent inaccuracies in the research \npaper, which, for a start, said the mine site would cover 2,431 hectares. Rio scientists say Jadar will only run to 220 \nhectares.\nAlso in dispute is the study's claims that liquid waste will end up being stored on a flood plain, and that Rio's \nexploration drilling has already contaminated the region. We'll spare you the technical reasons for why this triggered \nthe scientists but it does involve the finer points of dry tailing and storage.\nTo be fair, there's an abundance of self-interest at play from everyone throwing mud in this sandbox. The study's \nlead author, Dragana Dordevic, happens to be a longstanding critic of Rio's plans. Meanwhile, the Serbian \nacademics who signed Steward's letter are notably featured on the very Environmental Impact Statement that Rio \nsubmitted to Serbian regulators.\nScientific Reports might be a venerated periodical, but, hang on, it's also made some appalling retractions in recent \nyears.\nOne 2018 paper went viral after careful readers noticed Donald Trump's face in a picture of baboon faeces that \naccompanied the study.\nAnother said phone-hunching could cause a horn to grow on the back of your neck. It was retracted, as was a 2020 \nstudy linking integrity to body weight, which, to be fair, at least explains why newly-elected Australian PMs always \nlook slimmer once they hit the Lodge.\nDodgy tactics The hired-goons at Lancaster Global really stooped to some pathetic lows in their surveillance of \nformer Fortescue executives Bart Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn Winther-Jensen and Michael Masterman.Page 3 of 3\nBillionairrre rich-listers in carve-up\nFor anyone unfamiliar, these are the men who left Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Group to start a rival green-iron \noutfit, Element Zero, and who remain in a court battle over allegations they stole intellectual property from the \nmining major.\nFresh filings in the case shed even more light on how operatives (hired by Fortescue) behaved in their pursuit of \nKolodziejczyk.\nMargin Call has learned they tailed Kolodziejczyk's wife as she dropped her daughter at childcare, the really sad \npart being that the joes were idiotic enough to get burned and actually fled when she confronted them. There's also \na Kolodziejczyk neighbour mentioned in the papers who claimed to have expressed concerns about an occupied \ncar with heavily-tinted windows idling on the street for three straight evenings. This at a time when neither \nKolodziejczyk, his family, or anyone else involved in Element Zero had a clue that Fortescue was in a beef with \nthem - or that PIs were on their case.\nLoad-Date: August 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
