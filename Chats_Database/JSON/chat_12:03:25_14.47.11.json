Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1717 words\nHighlight: A kitchen hero, eggs work around the clock, ready to save the day at breakfast, brunch, dinner or even \nan Easter dessert.\nBody\nEggs are one of the most indispensable ingredients in your last-minute meal arsenal. If you have eggs, you will \nhave a meal. \nIt can be as simple as cracking a spoon across the delicate shell of a soft-boiled egg, delving into its snow-white \nand sunset-coloured heart. Or an omelette for frazzled Friday, or perhaps fried alongside bacon in a quest to \nrecover from the night before. \nEggs serve many purposes, and here they stretch from breakfast and brunch to picnic and dinner, with an Easter \nchocolate version thrown in for good measure.\nLink to Image\nKatrina Meynink\nHerby egg breakfast sando with bacon jam\nLean in, I have a secret: silken tofu is the answer to this eggy sandwich. It results in the fluffiest, silkiest, easiest \nbaked eggs you will ever make. It makes them much lighter and less of a breakfast assault; the sort of rich eating \nthat requires a post-meal lie-down.\nNote: This makes more bacon jam than you need, but it's a wonder to have in your fridge to upscale any meal at a \nmoment's notice.\nINGREDIENTS\nBacon jam\n\u2022 1 tbsp olive oil\n\u2022 2 brown onions, diced\n\u2022 4 garlic cloves, grated\n\u2022 1kg streaky bacon, trimmed and diced\nPage 2 of 6\nThis croissant shakshuka bake makes the perfect Easter brunch (plus more egg-cellent ideas)\n\u2022 1 cup brown sugar\n\u2022 \u00bd cup sherry vinegar\nEggy goodness\n\u2022 10 eggs\n\u2022 \u00bd cup silken tofu\n\u2022 3 tbsp sour cream\n\u2022 1 cup melty cheese, grated (I used Swiss emmental, but fontina would also work like a dream)\n\u2022 2 tbsp finely chopped chives\n\u2022 2 tbsp finely chopped tarragon\n\u2022 2 tbsp finely chopped dill\nTo assemble\n\u2022 10 English muffins\n\u2022 10 slices of American cheese\nMETHOD\n\u2022 Preheat the oven to 175C fan-forced (195C conventional). Grease and line a baking dish (about 30cm x \n20cm x 10 cm), leaving enough baking paper overhanging to make it easy to remove the egg once cooked.\n\u2022To make the eggy goodness, add the eggs, tofu and sour cream to a blender and blitz to combine. Pour \ninto a bowl and stir through the cheese and herbs. Season with sea salt flakes and pepper. Pour into the \nprepared baking dish and bake for 20-25 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.\n\u2022To make the bacon jam, add the oil, onion and garlic to a frying pan and place over low heat. Season with \nsea salt flakes and pepper. Cook for 3-5 minutes or until the onions soften and caramelise. Add the bacon \nand cook for 5 minutes, then add the brown sugar, vinegar and a splash of water. Stir to combine then \nsimmer for 30 minutes, stirring until it has reduced to a jam-like consistency and darkens in colour. \n(Leftover jam can be stored in a jar in the fridge for 3 weeks.)\n\u2022 Run a spatula or knife around the edges of the baking dish to release the egg sheet, then remove it to a \nchopping board. Cut the baked egg into 10 even pieces, or to fit the size of your English muffins.\n\u2022 When you're ready to serve, preheat the oven to 150C fan-forced (170C conventional). \n\u2022To build the sandwiches, stack an egg piece, 1 slice of cheese and 1-2 tablespoons of bacon jam on half \nan English muffin. Top with the remaining muffin half. Repeat with the remaining muffins, then pop the \nsandwiches on a tray in the oven to heat through until the cheese has melted, about 10 minutes.\nMakes 10 (with bacon jam left over)\nNote: You can prepare these sandwiches well ahead of time and store them in the fridge. You can even freeze \nthem if not using them immediately \u2212 wrap them in baking paper, then foil, and place them in a freezer bag to \nensure they don't get any freezer burn.\nLink to Image\nKatrina Meynink\nCroissant shakshuka bakePage 3 of 6\nThis croissant shakshuka bake makes the perfect Easter brunch (plus more egg-cellent ideas)\nTwo of my favourite breakfast regulars combine for the ultimate easy share-friendly brunch. Prepare the saucy base \nahead of time, then it's a mere moment of assembly and shove-in-the-oven ease.\nINGREDIENTS\n\u2022 2 tbsp olive oil\n\u2022 1 red onion, finely diced\n\u2022 2 garlic cloves, finely grated\n\u2022 1 red capsicum, finely diced\n\u2022 1 tbsp ground coriander\n\u2022 1 tbsp ground cumin\n\u2022 1 tbsp tomato paste\n\u2022 generous pinch of brown sugar\n\u2022 2 x 400g cans finely crushed tomatoes\n\u2022 3-6 eggs (allow for one egg per person)\n\u2022 3 jumbo or 6 small croissants\n\u2022 \u00bd cup Persian-style feta\n\u2022 chopped coriander leaves, to serve\n\u2022 pinch of sumac, to serve\nMETHOD\n\u2022 Preheat the oven to 180C fan-forced (200C conventional).\n\u2022 Add the oil to a frying pan and place over medium heat. Once hot, add the onion and cook until soft and \ntranslucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, capsicum, coriander and cumin and cook until fragrant, stirring \nconstantly to prevent the spices from burning. Add the tomato paste and cook until the paste has \ndarkened. Add the canned tomatoes and brown sugar, and simmer for 15 minutes or until the sauce has \nreduced slightly.\n\u2022 Pour the shakshuka sauce into an ovenproof roasting or baking dish and gently nestle in the croissants \n(note: you may need two dishes if you're using 6 eggs). Crack the eggs in between the pastries and scatter \nover the feta. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until the egg whites have lost their translucency, and the yolks \nhave just set.\n\u2022 Remove the dish from the oven, scatter over the coriander leaves, dust with sumac, and serve hot.\nServes 3-6\nLink to Image\nKatrina Meynink\nRustic quiche, heavy on the greens, with bagel seasoning\nQuiche and I have a complicated relationship. A failed pastry seal in culinary school saw me cleaning those huge \npastry ovens of exploded quiche Lorraine filling long after my fellow commis chefs had gone home. I break out in a \ncold sweat whenever I think of that scrubbing.\nBut this quiche and I get along just fine. And you will be firm friends, too. She is intentionally free-form and rustic, \nand all the more robust for it.Page 4 of 6\nThis croissant shakshuka bake makes the perfect Easter brunch (plus more egg-cellent ideas)\nThe addition of bagel seasoning adds a different kind of crunch. It is a wonderful bedfellow for the greens luxuriating \nin their herby egg bath.\nINGREDIENTS\n\u2022 softened butter, to grease the tin\n\u2022 1 sheet (48cm x 27cm x 2.5mm) of frozen sour cream shortcrust pastry (I used Careme), placed in the \nfridge for 15 minutes to defrost slightly\n\u2022 2 tbsp olive oil\n\u2022 2 zucchini, ends trimmed, sliced lengthways into even slices\n\u2022 1 brown onion, halved, cut into even slices\n\u2022 \u00bd tbsp ground cumin\n\u2022 6 eggs\n\u2022 \u00bd cup sour cream\n\u2022 \u00be cup cream\n\u2022 \u00bc cup grated parmesan\n\u2022 \u00be cup Persian-style feta\n\u2022 2 cups spinach leaves, chopped\n\u2022 1 cup finely chopped soft herbs (I used basil, dill, tarragon)\n\u2022 3 tbsp bagel seasoning*\n\u2022 1 bunch of small asparagus spears (or other seasonal green of your choice)\nMETHOD\n\u2022 Preheat the oven to 185C fan-forced (205C conventional). Line the bottom of a 23cm springform cake tin \nwith baking paper and generously grease the sides with butter.\n\u2022 Gently place the pastry sheet over the tin and push down into the sides, pleating the edges of the sheet if \nnecessary and allowing it to overhang at the top - we don't want to cut and waste any of that glorious \npastry. Line with baking paper and fill to the brim with pastry weights or dried beans.\n\u2022 Add the olive oil, zucchini, onion and cumin to a roasting tray, and use your hands to turn and coat the \nvegetables in oil.\n\u2022 Pop both the pastry shell and the tray of zucchini in the oven and bake for 20-25 minutes.\n\u2022 While they cook, add the eggs to a large bowl and whisk to combine. Add the remaining ingredients, \nexcluding the bagel seasoning and asparagus, and stir to combine. Add 2 tablespoons of the bagel \nseasoning to the filling, season thoroughly with salt and pepper, and set aside.\n\u2022 Remove the tray of zucchini from the oven and set aside for 10 minutes to cool. Meanwhile, take the pastry \ntin from the oven, remove the weights and paper, then return the tin to the oven for another 10 minutes to \nbrown the base of the quiche shell.\n\u2022 Chop three-quarters of the zucchini into bite-sized pieces, reserving a few whole strips to dress the quiche. \nAdd the chopped zucchini pieces to the egg mixture, then pour the mixture into the quiche shell. Gently \nplace the reserved zucchini slices and the asparagus spears on top. Scatter over the remaining tablespoon \nof bagel seasoning.\n\u2022 Bake the quiche for about 45 minutes or until it looks puffed and brown on top and there is only the \nslightest wobble in the centre. It will look slightly lighter in the centre. Don't panic \u2212 this is OK. Allow it to Page 5 of 6\nThis croissant shakshuka bake makes the perfect Easter brunch (plus more egg-cellent ideas)\ncool slightly in the tin before removing, and especially before cutting. Season again with salt and pepper \nbefore serving.\nServes 6-8\nNote: To make your own bagel seasoning, mix 1 tablespoon each of nutritional yeast flakes, onion powder, garlic \npowder, black sesame seeds, white sesame seeds and poppy seeds. \nLink to Image\nKatrina Meynink\nThe ultimate Easter (chocolate) tart\nI wouldn't limit this easy-peasy chocolate tart to Easter - that feels far too restrictive. It is as pretty adorned with \nEaster eggs as with beautiful in-season fruit.\nINGREDIENTS\n\u2022 1 sheet (47cm x 27cm x 3mm) frozen vanilla bean shortcrust pastry (I used Careme), placed in the fridge \nfor 15 minutes to defrost slightly\n\u2022 200g milk chocolate\n\u2022 200g dark chocolate (minimum 75 per cent cocoa)\n\u2022 50g white chocolate\n\u2022 285ml cream\n\u2022 80ml milk\n\u2022 2 eggs\n\u2022 1 bag speckled chocolate Easter eggs (about 1\u00bd cups)\nMETHOD\n\u2022 Unfurl the pastry and use it to line a 24cm-diameter loose-bottomed tart tin, trim the edges and refrigerate \nfor 30 minutes.\n\u2022 Preheat the oven to 180C fan-forced (200C conventional). Line the pastry with baking paper and top with \npastry weights.\n\u2022 Blind-bake the tart shell until the edges are golden (10-15 minutes), remove paper and weights, then bake \nuntil the base is golden (7-8 minutes) and set aside.\n\u2022 Place the milk, dark and white chocolate in separate bowls and set aside. \n\u2022 Bring the cream and milk to a simmer in a saucepan over medium heat. Once simmering, add 2 \ntablespoons of the hot milk and cream to the white chocolate bowl, then divide the remaining milk and \ncream between the milk and dark chocolate bowls. Stand until chocolate melts (1-2 minutes), stir to \ncombine, cool slightly, then stir 1 lightly whisked egg into each of the two main chocolate bowls.\n\u2022 Place the pre-baked tart tin on a baking tray. Reduce the oven temperature to 130C fan-forced (150C \nconventional).\n\u2022 Spoon the two main chocolate mixes into the tart; you want beautiful blobs of dark and milk chocolate. \nDrizzle the white chocolate mixture over the top. \n\u2022 Gently place the tray in the oven and bake until the chocolate filling is just set - it should have the slightest \nwobble in the centre. This should take between 30 and 40 minutes. Allow the tart to cool completely before \nadorning with chocolate Easter eggs. To serve, slice with a hot, wet knife.Page 6 of 6\nThis croissant shakshuka bake makes the perfect Easter brunch (plus more egg-cellent ideas)\nServes 8-10\nNote: Leftovers will keep in the fridge for 1 week.\nGraphic\n \nFeed a crowd with these egg-and-bacon muffins with a twist.\nShakshuka meets savoury bread-and-butter pudding in this bake-and-take brunch dish.\nBagel seasoning adds an extra something to this vegetarian quiche.\nThis chocolate tart is equally pretty decorated with Easter eggs or seasonal fruit.\nLoad-Date: March 29, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
