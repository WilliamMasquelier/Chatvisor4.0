The company has experienced a dramatic decline in its stock value, with shares plummeting over 80% since their peak in 2021, prompting a strategic shift in leadership to address ongoing financial difficulties.\n\n3. \u00d8rsted has announced substantial writedowns of 12.1 billion Danish krone (\u00a31.4 billion) related to its US operations, attributing these losses to rising interest rates and market uncertainties, further complicating its position in the renewable energy market.\n\n4. The company is facing a significant reduction in wind farm output, potentially resulting in the construction of 1,500 fewer turbines, which raises concerns about its ability to meet renewable energy targets.\n\n5. The recent political climate, particularly the return of Donald Trump as US president, poses additional risks to \u00d8rsted's operations, as his administration has signaled a reversal of policies supporting renewable energy initiatives.",
