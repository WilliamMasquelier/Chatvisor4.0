Your task is to evaluate the overall sentiment expressed in the article regarding Cisco by carefully considering the tone, language, context, and any descriptive cues related to Cisco.\n\nGuidelines for Scoring:\n\n-5: The article is extremely critical and conveys a highly negative sentiment toward Cisco.\n-4: The article offers notable criticism, highlighting significant negative aspects of Cisco.\n-3: The sentiment is moderately negative, with clear indications of disapproval of Cisco.\n-2: Some negative remarks about Cisco are present, though they are not predominant.\n-1: The article shows mild negativity or slight disapproval of Cisco.\n0: The portrayal of Cisco is neutral with no significant positive or negative sentiment.\n1: The article exhibits slight positive sentiment or mild approval of Cisco.\n2: The tone is moderately positive, suggesting a favorable view of Cisco.\n3: The article is largely favorable, displaying clear positive sentiment about Cisco.\n4: The content strongly praises Cisco.\n5: The article is exceptionally complimentary, demonstrating an extremely positive sentiment about Cisco.\n\nInstructions:\nAnalyze the language, tone, and context used in the article with respect to Cisco.\nBased solely on the observations, assign one sentiment score from the list: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].\nYour final output must be exactly one of these values and nothing else.\nArticle Content: Page 1 of 2\nSecond thoughts on AI as results fall short\nSecond thoughts on AI as results fall short\nThe Australian\nDecember 31, 2024 Tuesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 17\nLength: 710 words\nByline: Joseph Lam\nBody\nAustralian companies have been given an artificial intelligence reality check, with 58 per cent of those who have \ninvested in programs and applications saying the technology has fallen short of -expectations.\nMeanwhile, 70 per cent of investors have pulled out of active deals due to AI considerations.\nCisco's AI readiness index, formulated for the second time this year, has found that 38 per cent of companies \nallocate between 10 to 30 per cent of their IT budget to AI, despite many not seeing a return on the investment.\nCarl Solder, the company's Australian chief technology officer, said about half of the companies surveyed find AI \nhas not hit the mark with processes and operations. About 44 per cent see no improvement or not enough in \nautomating their businesses.\n\"I think the reality is that they started to appreciate the work and effort involved in getting all those building blocks \nsquared away, and the strategy, infrastructure data governance, talent and culture,\" he said.\n\"The reality is that maybe there is a little bit more work that we have to do to be fully -prepared.\" Cisco's index \nmeasured the responses of 3660 senior business leaders from companies with 500 or more staff across 14 \ncountries in the Asia-Pacific.\nThe index found just 4 per cent of the country are in a position to leverage AI, down from 5 per cent the previous \nyear.\nMr Solder said 92 per cent of companies were facing increasing pressure to adopt AI.\nMost of that pressure comes from chief executives and boards and it has risen over the past six months.\n\"Fifty-six per cent of those organisations said that the pressure has increased significantly,\" Mr Solder said.\nMore than one fifth of companies plan to allocate 40 per cent of their IT budget to AI over the next four to five years.\nPage 2 of 2\nSecond thoughts on AI as results fall short\nMeanwhile, Bain has found that investors believe generative artificial intelligence will not add much value in 2025, \nbelieving it will take up to three years to see the full benefit.\nA number of investors said that just 20 per cent of their portfolio companies had Generative AI use cases that were \n\"delivering value\". About 30 per cent of portfolio companies are still testing or developing AI use cases.\nSimilarly to Cisco, Bain found that AI investments are four times more likely to disappoint investors than they are to \nexceed -expectations.\nOver the past 12 months, AI agents - chatbots that use \"large language models\" to undertake tasks such as reading \nand responding to emails - have been cited as one of the first major uses of the technology.\nBut Australian workers disagree, with a recent EY report finding that just 37 per cent of employees are comfortable \nwith their companies introducing AI assistants and just 31 per cent thinking AI chatbots are helpful for customer \nservice.\nThat report says the integration of AI in the workplace has been met with mixed responses.\nMore than half of those surveyed are deeply concerned that AI could result in job losses. That fear is greater for \nwomen: 59 per cent are concerned about job losses, compared to 51 per cent of men.\nMeanwhile, 40 per cent are \"deeply uncomfortable\" with AI being used to monitor their behaviour and 46 per cent \ndon't want AI to provide efficiency -recommendations.\nAlmost half of respondents are uncomfortable with AI taking on employee performance reviews and 52 per cent \ndon't wish to be interviewed by a chatbot when going for a new role.\nAlmost two thirds of respondents - 62 per cent - are worried that employees will attempt to manipulate the way they \nthink with AI applications.\nEY chief technology officer Katherine Boiciuc said there were real \"innovation versus insecurity\" and \"progress \nversus privacy\" issues.\n\"On the one hand, there's recognition of the benefits AI can bring to business and people, suggesting an openness \nto the potential for it to enhance productivity and improve work-life balance,\" she said.\n\"On the other hand, there is a level of discomfort and concern among Australians about the broader implications AI \nmight have on their employment, workplace culture and privacy.\" It was clear AI used in a supervisor-type role \"has \nalso struck a nerve\" and the technology was fuelling \"insecurities\" in the workplace, especially \"among those in \nmanual labour/skilled trades and among women\".\nLoad-Date: December 30, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOnly output one of these values: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and nothing else.\n                ",
