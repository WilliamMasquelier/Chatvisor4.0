Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 784 words\nHighlight: With a new winter menu and head chef fresh from Oncore by Clare Smyth and Newtown's Cafe Paci, \nShell House has plenty of compelling reasons to visit.\nBody\nHere's what I like about Shell House: it feels like a proper restaurant. Small praise, you might say, but these days \nproper restaurants - real restaurants - seem less common than a decade ago. \nReading a \"hot new places to try this weekend\" list can feel like scrolling through the Netflix home page without an \nagenda. There are projects created with care and a point of view, but there's a growing amount of dross born from \nwhat marketers think we want to consume. For a streaming service, this stuff exists to keep the content coffers full. \nIn hospitality, it adds investor value to a new \"lifestyle\" precinct or high-rise development. Claims of cultural value \nshould be treated with suspicion.\nI certainly treated Shell House with suspicion when it opened near Wynyard Station in late 2021. A highly \nmanicured venue - all marble, metal and dark wood - in a heritage commercial palazzo site that reportedly cost $14 \nmillion to renovate. Hmm. That's the kind of outlay that leads CBD operators to offer \"elevated\" pub standards, \nkeeping costs down and prices up. \nBut when Shell House owner Brett Robinson lured Aria's executive chef, Joel Bickford, to come on board as \nculinary director across the venue's three bars, restaurant and rooftop terrace, it was a head-turning move that said, \n\"We're not just here to grill steaks.\" \nAaron Ward - second-in-charge at Stanmore's three-hatted Sixpenny - was appointed to helm the glitzy dining \nroom's kitchen and his opening menu was a humdinger. Ambitious scope executed with quiet elegance.\nIt felt like Shell House Dining Room & Terrace would be around for the long haul until - record scratch - Ward left \nlate last year. Bathers' Pavilion in Mosman made an offer he couldn't refuse. \nIn March, Shell House announced its new head chef would be a bloke named Brad Guest, fresh from senior roles \nat Oncore by Clare Smyth and Newtown's Cafe Paci. He must have settled in all right because when I visited \nrecently for a Saturday lunch, Bickford was nowhere to be seen.\nNew head chef Brad Guest would like you to know that he's not here simply to grill steaks, either.\nPage 2 of 3\nNot just here to grill steaks: This 'proper restaurant' offers bells-and-whistles dining\nAt its core, the top level of Shell House is a spring and summer restaurant - a place for oysters and chardonnay \nand liberal squeezes of lemon over whole fish. But the new winter menu listed too many things I wanted to eat right \nnow, so a booking was made; who needs asparagus season when there's steamed quince pudding dolloped with \nclotted cream?\nAcross a vast carte of snacks, starters, pastas, shellfish, coal-roasted meats and vegetable-focused mains, Guest \nwould like you to know that he's not here simply to grill steaks, either. That said, there are four of them, ranging \nfrom a $48 hanger to a $220 slab of retired dairy cow on the bone, and each one will do the job if you want to get \nstuck into the triple-digit reds. \nMeanwhile, five thick slices of molasses-glazed lamb belly ($68) are precision-rendered and on hand for all your \nmid-August shiraz needs. \nLink to Image\nJennifer Soo\nSquid ink-black lobster agnolotti pasta ($74) comes out as a squad of eight parcels that would make fine pillows for \na family of fat mice. It's beautifully long-flavoured - unmistakably lobster - topped with tiny curls of squid and a well-\nbehaved Geraldton wax oil. \nJust-tender abalone ($34) is threaded with shiitake and supercharged with chicken fat; roasted hunks of Jerusalem \nartichoke ($38) are teamed with the white balsamic tartness of agrodolce sauce, golden raisins and potent taleggio \ncheese. A confident swing that doesn't miss.\nNow here's what I don't like quite as much. The mild sweetness of cobia ($38), served sashimi-style, is blunted by a \nbottom layer of cream, and the dish's advertised inclusion of horseradish is undetectable. \nLink to Image\nJennifer Soo\nThat quince pudding ($26) is a crumb closer to something from Sara Lee than the Dickensian ideal I was hoping for. \nI could also whinge about some of the prices ($65 for a mud crab tart? Thirty-eight dollars for a Tanqueray No. Ten \ngin martini?), but at least there are options.\nIf you want to pop in for a quick dinner in the hands of well-rehearsed floor staff who take hospitality seriously, it \nmight look like the butter-forward risotto topped with five sweet and crunchy spot prawns ($38) or the juicy \nspatchcock boldly flavoured with romesco and smoked garlic ($60; it can and should be shared). \nMaybe put an $18 glass of Jim Barry 2023 Assyrtiko on the final bill, too. Head wine guy Eduardo Fritis-Lamora, or \nsomeone from his team of six sommeliers, will present the bottle to the table, no matter your order. It's the kind of \nproper service it would be nice to see more of.\nThis review was originally published in Good Weekend magazine\nGraphic\n \nGo-to dish: Lobster agnolotti.\nSteamed quince pudding.Page 3 of 3\nNot just here to grill steaks: This 'proper restaurant' offers bells-and-whistles dining\nLoad-Date: October 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
