I consider that the Element Zero process is substantially the same process as that \nwhich Dr Kolodziejczyk took steps to develop while employed at Fortescue. That is because both processes are \nbased on a hydroxide electrolyte where the water has been removed to make an ionic liquid.\" Dr Bhatt also says he \nreviewed Dr Winther-Jensen's email folders at Fortescue and \"identified five documents of concern that Dr \nWinther-Jensen emailed from his Fortescue professional email address ... to his personal email address ... \nbetween his resignation from Fortescue on November 3, 2021 and his final day at Fortescue, November 12, \n2021\".\n\"Each of the five documents is confidential and directly relevant to the Fortescue project.\n\"Following my review ... I consider that the leaching technical report, iron ore leaching update, TEA Sheet and TEA \nCovering Email contain information that would be of particular value in progressing a competing research and \ndevelopment project in relation to the purification of iron ore utilising electrochemical reduction.\n\"I cannot conceive of any legitimate reason for Dr Winther-Jensen to have sent an email attaching any of these \ndocuments in the November 2021 period. I am concerned that the confidential information in each document could \nhave been misused, could continue to be misused and/or may in the future be misused by Dr Winther-Jensen and \nElement Zero.\" FFI employee Adrian Huber has also claimed in his affidavit that Dr Kolodziejczyk was the subject of \ncomplaints he misrepresented his qualifications.\nA subsequent Deloitte investigation, Mr Huber's affidavit says, found Dr Kolodziejczyk made \"material \nmisrepresentations and inaccuracies in respect of activities, positions held and qualifications\" in his CV.\nA letter published as part of the trove of documents also raises concerns about Dr Kolodziejczyk's behaviour \nfollowing his resigning from FFI in mid-2021, and then later retracting his resignation.\n\"All of us who serve at FFI, would like to support you and see you successful,\" the letter, from then-FFI CEO Julie \nShuttleworth says. \"Bart, this however will necessitate a substantial behavioural change by you and leads me to our \nchairman's chief concern, to your failure to be a positive and encouraging leader.\" The nature of the concerns about \nDr Kolodziejczyk's behaviour are not detailed in the letter. The matter is scheduled to return to court for an \ninterlocutory hearing on Thursday.Page 3 of 3\nFortescue outlines IP theft case\nLoad-Date: August 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
