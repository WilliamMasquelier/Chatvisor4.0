What \ndoes he mean \u2013 and can he achieve it?\nThe Guardian (London)\nOctober 9, 2024 Wednesday 2:48 PM GMT\nCopyright 2024 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc. All Rights Reserved\nSection: ENVIRONMENT; Version:2\nLength: 1139 words\nByline: Graham Readfearn\nHighlight: The mining tycoon says his iron ore business will stop using fossil fuels by the end of the decade without \ncarbon offsets or carbon capture and storageFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updatesGet our breaking \nnews email, free app or daily news podcast\nBody\nAbout $45 trillion of global business revenue is covered by corporate \u201cnet zero emissions\u201d pledges but iron ore \nbillionaire Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest thinks the whole net zero thing is \u201cfantasy\u201d.\n\u201cNow is the time to walk away from net zero 2050, that hasn\u2019t been anything really but a con to maintain fossil \nfuels,\u201d Forrest said last week. \nWhat was needed instead, Forrest said, was \u201creal zero\u201d, and he was confident his Fortescue iron ore business \nwould stop using fossil fuels by the end of this decade while shunning the use of carbon offsets or carbon capture \nand storage.\nSo what is \u201creal zero\u201d and could Fortescue really decarbonise a business that\u2019s part of a global steelmaking \nindustry responsible for about 9% of global CO2 emissions?\n                   Attack on net zero                   \nForrest\u2019s attack on \u201cnet zero\u201d is not likely to win him many friends.\nA recent stocktake of net zero pledges around the globe by Net Zero Tracker  found 60% of the 200,000 largest \ncompanies have net zero targets covering about $45 trillion in revenue.\nBut the analysis also said only 61 of the net zero plans of those 1,145 companies met all integrity criteria, such as \nthe appropriate use of offsets or whether the target covers the entire climate impact of a company.\nPage 2 of 3\nAndrew Forrest says net zero is \u2018fantasy\u2019 so his goal is \u2018real zero\u2019. What does he mean \u2013 and can he achieve it?\nThe original concept of \u201cnet zero\u201d was for global economies to end almost all fossil fuel use and then use \ntechnologies, many not proven at scale, to directly cut atmospheric CO2.\nBut examples are legion of major corporates  buying carbon offsets, some of dubious quality, to make their \nemission reduction targets instead of actually cutting fossil fuel use.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email\nClaire Snyder, the founder and director of Climate Integrity, said: \u201cAndrew Forrest is right on this: the \u2018net\u2019 in net \nzero is a loophole that is frequently exploited.\n\u201cFossil fuels are the primary cause of climate change, yet hardly any companies have explicit plans to phase out \ncoal, oil and gas from their own operations.\u201d\n                   Old lies and offsets                   \nFortescue\u2019s latest climate transition plan , published last month, reflects Forrest\u2019s disdain for carbon offsets. \nOffsets and carbon capture are not part of Fortescue\u2019s plans.\nFortescue says its annual emissions that it has direct control over were at 2.72m tonnes of CO2-equivalent last \nyear. Most of that comes from the diesel burned by haulage trucks, trains and ships, and the gas burned for power \ngeneration at its mining sites.\nBy 2030, Fortescue aims to have eliminated all those fossil fuels with a combination of green fuels (such as \nammonia for shipping and clean hydrogen for power generation) and battery electric vehicles charged with \nrenewables.\nSimon Nicholas, a global steel sector analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said \nFortescue\u2019s operations are concentrated in the remote Western Australia Pilbara region, giving the company ample \naccess to solar and wind and the space needed to build them.\n\u201cIt seems like the technology to enable Fortescue to reach real zero is either already available or will be soon,\u201d he \nsaid.\n\u201cReal zero by 2030 is very ambitious, but even if they hit the target a bit late, they will have transformed operational \nmining emissions and laid the path for others to follow.\u201d\n                   A much bigger problem                   \nFortescue\u2019s (and the climate\u2019s) much bigger problem comes when its iron ore goes to overseas steelmakers that \nuse combinations of coal, gas and fossil-fuel powered electricity to turn the ore into iron, and the iron into steel.\nThe indirect emissions (called scope 3) from the shipment and use of Fortescue\u2019s iron ore last year were 100 times \nthe company\u2019s direct emissions: about 262 Mt CO2-e (for comparison, Australia\u2019s entire annual emissions are now \nat 440 Mt).\nAbout 97% of that is emitted in the steelmaking process. But Fortescue has a target for \u201cnet zero scope 3 \nemissions by 2040\u201d \u2013 an odd choice of the \u201cnet zero\u201d phrase given Forrest\u2019s dislike of it.\nBut could it be done?\nMost of Fortescue\u2019s iron ore is low-grade and not suitable for a process known as Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), \nwhere the ore is turned into iron metal using gas. But this process could be emissions free, Nicholas said, if the gas \nwas replaced by clean hydrogen.Page 3 of 3\nAndrew Forrest says net zero is \u2018fantasy\u2019 so his goal is \u2018real zero\u2019. What does he mean \u2013 and can he achieve it?\nFortescue says it is working on ways to tweak the DRI process that would allow use of its lower grade ore to \nproduce \u201cgreen metal\u201d, while also developing higher grade ore deposits (such as its massive Iron Bridge mine  ). \nThe company is also building a pilot green metal production plant. \nThe company told analysts a few months ago that \u201cpivoting to producing green metal\u201d was its planned next step.\nOnce you have iron, about a third of steelmakers use electric arc furnaces to produce the steel and these too can \nbe powered by renewables.\n\u201cThe technology to decarbonise iron and steelmaking is already available,\u201d Nicholas said.\n\u201cElectric arc furnaces and renewable energy are perfectly mature technologies. DRI is also mature and in use today \nat commercial scale. \n\u201cThe technology to do this at commercial scale is available now,\u201d he said, pointing to a green steel manufacturing \nplant in Sweden. \n                   Clean power and influence?                   \nBut questions linger over how much control Fortescue can have over the source of power generation for electric \narc furnaces.\nFurnaces not powered by renewable electricity, but using Fortescue\u2019s ore or green iron would still leave the \ncompany with scope 3 emissions.\n\u201cThe key challenge is what happens to Fortescue\u2019s future green iron production when it reaches steelmakers in \nplaces like China,\u201d Nicholas said.\nOn this, Fortescue\u2019s plan just says it will \u201cpartner\u201d with customers and establish a \u201cgreen metal value chain\u201d.\nTemperature Check asked Fortescue why it had used the term \u201cnet zero\u201d for its scope 3 target and how it would \nconvince its customers to go \u201creal zero\u201d.\nA Fortescue spokesperson said ending reliance on fossil fuels \u201cis the only way to secure the global temperature \ngoals of the Paris agreement\u201d and the company backed \u201call companies and governments\u201d in phasing out fossil fuels \n\u201cno later than 2040\u201d.\nFortescue was working with \u201cglobal science-based standard setting entities\u201d to understand trends that could \n\u201cimpact best-practice Scope 3 target\u201d, the spokesperson said, adding the company may change its position.\n\u201cFortescue has a policy to not use voluntary [carbon] offsets towards its real zero 2030 target and only supports \ngenuine decarbonisation solutions such as investment in green iron and other innovations necessary to eliminate \nscope 3 emissions in the iron ore industry.\n\u201cIf every company takes the necessary action to reduce their scope 1 and 2 emissions, for which they are directly \nresponsible, then globally scope 3 emissions will decline quickly.\u201d\nLoad-Date: October 9, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | CEO of Fortescue | \"Now is the time to walk away from net zero 2050, that hasn\u2019t been anything really but a con to maintain fossil fuels.\" | N.A. |\n| Simon Nicholas | Global steel sector analyst | \"It seems like the technology to enable Fortescue to reach real zero is either already available or will be soon.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
