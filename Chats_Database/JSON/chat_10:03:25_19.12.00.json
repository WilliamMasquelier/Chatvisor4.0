Today though, Dr Forrest notes, Murrin \nMurrin has become an eventual success for its now owner Glencore, and he personally has since gone on to build \nFortescue Metals into an iron ore powerhouse.\nHe is now onto his next revolution, turning Fortescue into what he hopes will eventually be the world's biggest \nenergy company via his huge green hydrogen production ambitions.\nPage 2 of 2\nKeating our most influential Australian: Forrest\n\"I think, if I look back on anything with a semblance of pride, it will be switching off all fossil fuels of this huge \nindustrial hyper-successful company,\" Dr Forrest says of Fortescue, every move of which continues to be covered \nin detail by The Australian.\nDr Forrest is a notable member of this newspaper's annual The List - Australia's Richest 250 edition, and his trials \nand tribulations as Fortescue boss have been written about extensively.\nThat has included tracking Fortescue's incredible share price rise over the last decade, the huge amounts of \ndividends it has paid and that has also caused billions of dollars to flow to the Forrest family's Minderoo foundation, \nextensive executive and boardroom changes and much more.\nDr Forrest's personal battle against Meta, which he has claimed did nothing to stop thousands of scams being \npublished on its platforms such as Facebook that fleeced scores of Australians of their life savings, has also been \nwritten about in detail.\nThe mining billionaire has also attracted plenty of publicity for his backing of various causes, ranging from vowing to \nhelp rebuild Ukraine to saving the Western Force rugby union team, and more recently his separation from wife \nNicola. But it is Fortescue's push into green energy, firstly via its Fortescue Future Industries subsidiary and which \nhas more recently seen Dr Forrest return to the company as executive chairman, that has attracted the most -\nattention.\nIt is one that from a corporate point of view fills him with the most pride. \"This company which has proved to its \ninvestors all over the world that it's high performing yet it was the one, even being a heavy industry mining \ncompany, that switched off fossil fuels,\" Dr Forrest says.\n\"And it further cemented its position as the leading industry player by doing so, setting the example for the rest of \nthe industrial world that they can and must as well.\" See full video interview online at \ntheaustralian.com.au/60thanniversary\nLoad-Date: July 9, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
