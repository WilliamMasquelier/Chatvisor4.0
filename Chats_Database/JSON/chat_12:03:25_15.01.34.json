It operates in the digital communications technology, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Cisco based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Cisco is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Cisco.\n\nIf Cisco is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nSan Cisco back in city's lights\nSan Cisco back in city's lights\nThe Cairns Post (Australia)\nMay 8, 2024 Wednesday\nCairns Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 3\nLength: 280 words\nByline: Catherine Duffy\nBody\nReturning to Cairns for the first time in two years, powerhouse indie-pop band San Cisco will kick off their regional \ntour Under The Lights with their Gilligan's debut on Thursday, May 9.\nSan Cisco singer and guitarist Jordi Davieson, who caught Covid on their last tour of Cairns, said he was looking \nforward to exploring the city ahead of the opening show.\n\"We've been to Cairns a few times. The last time we played at Tanks was in the middle of Covid times,\" Davieson \nsaid.\n\"We all got sick at different spots in the tour and I ended up getting caught in Cairns for a week.\" Although the band \nwill have limited time in the Far North, Davieson said he was looking forward to taking in the ocean views.\n\"We're usually in a place for one day on tour, but we like to make the most of it wherever we can. I like to try and \njump in the ocean if it's nearby and get a bit of vitamin D,\" he said.\nFar North fans will be the first to experience San Cisco's latest hits live, with some crowd favourites.\n\"I think it's frustrating when a band comes to town after they release a new record and only play the new songs,\" he \nsaid.\n\"We're trying our best to play some of the new tracks, but also not forget about the bigger songs everyone loves \nand listens to, so it's going to be a mixed bag.\" One of the latest songs Mr Davieson is excited to bring to crowds for \nthe first time is called One Percent.\n\"It's a song I've always liked and it's really fun to play. It's a new one that's going to be really good to play live,\" he \nsaid.\nThe tour marks their fifth studio album, Under the Lights, which was released on March 1. Tickets to San Cisco's \nshow at Gilligan's are available via the Oztix website.\nPage 2 of 2\nSan Cisco back in city's lights\nLoad-Date: May 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Cisco.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
