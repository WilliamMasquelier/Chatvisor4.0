as government chases targets\nOffshore wind contracts worth \u00a310bn awarded as government chases \ntargets\n \nProactive Investors (UK)\nSeptember 3, 2024 Tuesday 12:33 PM EST\nCopyright 2024 Proactive UK Ltd All Rights Reserved\nLength: 429 words\nByline: Josh Lamb\nBody\nSome \u00a310 billion worth of public money will be spent on new offshore wind contracts over the coming years as the \ngovernment chases 2030 renewable energy targets.\nNine project subsidies were awarded under the UK's latest allocation round on Tuesday, guaranteeing prices for the \nenergy they produce.\nDevelopments by Orsted and ScottishPower were among the nine contracts awarded as the government aims to \nboost offshore wind capacity from 15 gigawatts currently to 55 by 2030.\nBritain's energy security department hailed the auction, which stretched to other green technologies, as the largest \never, after no bids were received for offshore wind in 2023.\nLow offers on subsidies, ensuring \u00a340 per megawatt hour, had seen developers avoid last year's auction, but the \nbase price this time was much higher.\nIndeed, Orsted secured a strike price of \u00a358.90 for power produced from the Hornsea 4 wind farm, though given \nthis was based on 2012 prices the actual figure will be up at \u00a374.\nThis means it will receive subsidies funded by consumer bills if wholesale prices sit below this and have to refund \nthe government in any case it rises above.\nPage 2 of 2\nOffshore wind contracts worth \u00a310bn awarded as government chases targets\nCombined with contracts for other offshore Orsted developments, alongside the likes of ScottishPower's East \nAnglia 3, the subsidies are set to be worth billions.\nAccording to National Grid's system operating wing, some \u00a3335 million will go to the new 5 gigawatts of offshore \nwind between 2027 and 2028, before rising to \u00a32.7 billion and \u00a32.8 billion respectively in the following two years.\nGiven these are calculated on 2012 prices, this is set to equate to \u00a310 billion by 2031.\nThis could well rise too, with Orsted's contracts due to be inflation-indexed over their 15-year terms, alongside \nsubsidies for other developers.\nWhether the ramped-up funding helps the UK meet 2030 targets remains to be seen, with RenewableUK boss Dan \nMcGrail noting future auctions were \"crucial\".\nThe industry body added more offshore wind would mitigate growing costs for billpayers to the tune of \u00a33 billion by \n2030 when accounting for the gas it will replace.\nOthers were less certain about the numbers, with the Renewable Energy Foundation, which has connections to the \nGlobal Warming Policy Foundation climate denial thinktank, warning the spending was \"reckless\" given grid \nconstraints, which will have to be addressed by National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.).\nEnergy UK chief executive Emma Pinchbeck said the use of British-based green energy was \"more important than \never,\" after surging costs in recent years.\n\"This is by far the cheapest way to power the UK,\" she said.\nLoad-Date: September 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Dan
