Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 24\nLength: 442 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nAn investigation by Fortescue into former employees - which has left the iron ore miner embroiled in a row over \nprivate investigators photographing children and tailing family members to Kmart - was sparked by a report in The \nAustralian Financial Review.\nDocuments released by the Federal Court, filed by Fortescue as part of its dispute with Element Zero, show the \ncompany did not start investigating workers who left to start the green metals group until publication of an interview \nin the Financial Review in January.\nThose investigations eventually led to 19 days of surveillance by private investigators of the homes and families of \nformer Fortescue employees Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen.\nFortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest earlier this week distanced himself from the spying, saying legal \nteams had kept him in the dark.\nSeparate documents filed by lawyers acting for Element Zero and released by the court on Friday accuse \nFortescue of omitting key information in submissions that resulted in it gaining search and seizure orders covering \nfamily homes and business premises.\nThe Fortescue document released by the court says Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman participated in an \ninterview which \"launched the public profile of Element Zero\".\nFortescue referred to a quote from Dr Kolodziejczyk that read: \"Everything we do was developed after Fortescue \nand doesn't bring anything from Fortescue.\"\n\"Dr Kolodziejczyk also told The AFR that the idea to pursue Element Zero's electroreduction method had not \npreviously occurred to him: 'You actually had to step out of Fortescue to brainstorm, ideate and develop a \npathway',\" the filings read.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue says report led to spying Green metals\n\"With these statements, The AFR article set in train a line of inquiry at Fortescue, which involved reviewing the \nprojects that Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen had been working on, and investigating their Fortescue \nemail inboxes, group SharePoint folder, and two laptops, on suspicion of IP leakage.\"\nMr Masterman worked for Fortescue and Dr Forrest for about 25 years and, along with former Fortescue chief \nscientist Dr Kolodziejczyk, was part of a group that travelled the world with the billionaire businessman in 2020 on a \nhunt for green energy projects.\nDr Winther-Jensen also worked for Fortescue. Element Zero and the former Fortescue employees reject the \nallegations of intellectual property theft and counter that the Element Zero technology was developed independently \nand is very different from anything Fortescue has done.\nMaterial seized from raids on the homes of Mr Masterman, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen is being held \nby independent lawyers.\nLoad-Date: July 15, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's Executive Chairman | \"legal teams had kept him in the dark.\" | N.A. |\n| Dr. Bart Kolodziejczyk | Former Fortescue Chief Scientist | \"Everything we do was developed after Fortescue and doesn't bring anything from Fortescue.\" | N.A. |\n| Dr. Bart Kolodziejczyk | Former Fortescue Chief Scientist | \"You actually had to step out of Fortescue to brainstorm, ideate and develop a pathway.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Former Fortescue Employee | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n| Dr. Bjorn Winther-Jensen | Former Fortescue Employee | Not mentioned | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
