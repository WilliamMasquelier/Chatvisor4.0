Dewar disclosed that Fortescue had instructed Lancasters Investigations to conduct surveillance on \nKolodziejczyk, Winther-Jensen and a third individual to establish their identities and locations.\nThe surveillance included detailed observations, such as Winther-Jensen watering his garden and following a \nwoman into a shopping centre. Despite a search order granted by Justice Melissa Perry permitting raids on \nKolodziejczyk's home, Dewar's affidavit revealed that the investigators also spied on properties owned by Michael \nMasterman, who was not targeted by the search orders.\nPage 2 of 2\nGreen iron battle: Fortescue raided former staff to investigate 'IP theft'\nAn affidavit from a solicitor for Element Zero, Kolodziejczyk and Masterman, highlighted concerns over the invasive \nnature of the surveillance and the extensive data capture during the search orders. Williams said around three \nterabytes of data were seized, containing confidential and privileged information that was unrelated to the case.\nUpon discovering the surveillance, Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest expressed his surprise and warned the FMG \nlegal team. \nA new affidavit, from mining and engineering consultant Wayne McFaull, asserts that Element Zero's rapid progress \ncould only be attributed to having access to Fortescue's design documents from January 2023. \nMcFaull claims that Element Zero's $5 million research fund was not enough for the level of research and \ndevelopment they achieved. He said, \"Projects in the nature and complexity of the Fortescue project and the \nElement Zero project take a great deal of trial and error.\"\nElement Zero has denied Fortescue's claims and is challenging the private search and seizure orders. A \npreliminary hearing in the Federal Court was set for today, with the full hearing scheduled from August 18.\nLoad-Date: August 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
