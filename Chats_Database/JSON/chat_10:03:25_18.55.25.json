Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 21\nLength: 938 words\nByline: Hans van Leeuwen\nBody\nAt the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, only one Australian company had its own office in the \njamboree's central hotel, sitting cheek-by-jowl with those of the big global banks and accounting firms.\nOccupying a prime corner, with a big placard warning about lethal humidity at the door, is Fortescue Metals Group. \nAndrew Forrest has become a highly visible Davos regular, and for the past two years has been joined by \nFortescue Future Industries chief Mark \"Hutch\" Hutchinson.\nThis year, though, they brought a third Fortescue exec with them: Robert Tichio, who has been part of Team \nTwiggy for all of eight weeks.\nIt wasn't the Wall Street financier's first time at Davos, but on this trip he had a new mission: to speed-date \ninstitutional investors, educating them about Forrest's latest initiative: Fortescue Capital, which Tichio has been \nrecruited to run.\nTaking a breather in the Fortescue office, he describes to The Australian Financial Review what the Fortescue \nmaster schedule might look like on a given day at Davos.\n\"Andrew Forrest is Andrew Forrest - his calendar is like nobody else's, and it involves extraordinary visits with \npeople who are shaping the way that, frankly, the world will move over the next decade,\" he says.\n\"Hutch will spend an incredible amount of time working with project partners and large corporates - whose identities \nwouldn't surprise you - who may be partners, who may be suppliers, who may be governments, who are going to be \ninstrumental in helping Fortescue projects achieve escape velocity. And then I've been spending my time entirely \nwith allocators ... sovereigns, pensions, endowments, global investment banks.\"\nA lot of northern hemisphere financial giants don't really know Fortescue well. And even if they do, they certainly \nneed a steer on Fortescue Capital - because Forrest, Hutchinson and Tichio are trying to do something that \nnobody else has quite done before.\nPage 2 of 3\nDavos speed-dating for Forrest recruit Analysis\nEssentially, not everything in Forrest's vastly ambitious slate of green energy projects can be funded from the iron \nore miner's balance sheet. But rather than send Fortescue Metals Group to the private markets, Forrest has \ndelegated the job of finding the funds to Tichio and his rapidly growing team.\nFortescue Capital has a foot in both camps: it works inside the company to get projects ready to pitch for external \nfunding; and then it raises and manages those funds. It's like an in-house asset manager or investment bank.\nBut this puts Tichio in an interesting position. From the outside, it looks very much like Forrest exercises pretty \nunfettered authority inside Fortescue. Shareholders can either like that or lump it.\nThose shareholders who have stuck with Forrest have been amply rewarded. But he can't take that attitude with the \nprivate markets. Institutional investors, running the risk-o-meter over specific Fortescue projects, will demand a \ntighter straitjacket.\nAnd Fortescue Capital, as the middle man, serves two masters. It raises the capital for its parent company, but it \nhas fiduciary duties to its investors. It looks as if Tichio is a man who might sometimes have to say \"no\" to Forrest. \nOr at least \"yes, but\".\nIt's a role he acknowledges is \"delicate\". \"No one will unmoor the chairman, he's an extraordinary visionary. I \nwouldn't have come to do this if I didn't believe in the way that he sets out a vision, particularly in categories that are \nunmarked, that are uncharted,\" Tichio says.\n\"He has an extraordinary ability to see long-term vision and make decisions that oftentimes really require the \neducation of the market versus the other way around. And we're not going to change that.\"\nHe rejects the idea that he will be some kind of Dr No. He describes Fortescue Capital as \"a voice in the room \nabout what third-party capital will want to see in a project\", helping decide whether a project is best suited to \nexternal or internal funding.\n\"Those are conversations we're having now daily. And I think it has been a really remarkable early series of \nexchanges, robust exchanges, on this,\" he says.\nTichio has spent his early weeks visiting various parts of the Fortescue empire, learning about the projects that \nmight ultimately come to his unit for funding. He was in Norway before Davos, and heads to the WAE operation in \nBritain afterwards.\n\"This has been a ramp period for us to work with the industrial teams, particularly on the energy side, to ensure that \ndecisions that are getting made around how these projects are being framed, sized, de-risked ... [are made] with \nthird-party equity investors in mind,\" he says.\nAlthough, of course, not every project will end up going externally for funding - some \"just may not be ready or \nappropriate\".\nMeanwhile, back at Fortescue Capital in New York, his colleagues are assembling \"a Wall-Street-deep team\" of \npeople from the likes of JPMorgan, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs.\nThe plan is not to raise capital for a pooled fund, in the style of Brookfield or Macquarie Asset Management, where \nthe money manager gets wide discretion about what to do with the cash.\nInstead, Tichio and his team will hawk \"diligenced, ringfenced assets or investment offerings\" for investors to \nconsider on an individual basis. Those offerings will come in the next three years, although probably not in 2024.\n\"If you were a fly on the wall of this room in Davos, there have been a lot of conversations with allocators to start to \nintroduce to them what they might expect to see from us, because of what we know is coming in the pipeline.\"Page 3 of 3\nDavos speed-dating for Forrest recruit Analysis\nIf Tichio can navigate his tricky job successfully, it sounds like he will be finding his way back to Davos again next \nyear.\nLoad-Date: January 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
