Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Richard Coppleson | Bell Potter strategist | \"Asian hedge funds were still shorting Aussie resource stocks [yesterday morning], but as they saw iron ore still rallying, it looked like they went to the sidelines to see if this is a false recovery, or it keeps going and takes iron ore back above $US100.\" | N.A. |\n| Rahul Anand | Equity analyst at Morgan Stanley | \"Although a rebound in iron ore prices will benefit all iron ore miners, it is likely to benefit higher-cost miners more.\" | N.A. |\n| Chris Kourtis | Fund manager at Ellerston Capital | \"I sold my fund's BHP stake to buy Fortescue.\" | N.A. |\n| Robert Rennie | Head of commodity and carbon strategy at Westpac | \"If we do see iron ore back into the late $US90s, we want to sell it again for that coming drop into the $US80s.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
