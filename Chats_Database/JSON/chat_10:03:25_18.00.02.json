It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nFortescue 'staff stole green iron tech'\nFortescue 'staff stole green iron tech'\nThe Australian\nJune 7, 2024 Friday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 863 words\nByline: Angelica Snowden, Nick Evans\nBody\nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue has launched secret raids on the homes and offices of directors of a green steel \ncompetitor, in a move described by Federal Court judge John Logan as a potential \"industrial-scale forensic \ndebacle\" amid claims of intellectual property theft.\nFortescue won court orders authorising the searches in May, targeting the offices of would-be green steel \ncompetitor Element Zero and the homes and computers of company directors including former Fortescue chief \nscientist Bart Kolodziejczyk, long-term Andrew Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman and former Fortescue staff \nmember Bjorn Winther-Jensen.\nFortescue sought the co-called Anton Pillar orders after accusing all three men of taking Fortescue's intellectual \nproperty with them when they quit the iron ore and would-be green energy giant, in what the mining giant describes \nas \"industrial-scale misuse\" of their positions with the company.\nAn Element Zero spokesman said the claims were \"spurious\" and \"entirely without merit\".\nElement Zero won the first round in the battle to prevent Fortescue from accessing the devices and documents on \nWednesday, ahead of a further hearing into arguments to set aside the -orders.\n\"Other affidavits \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 give pause for thought about whether, as the Fortescue parties have alleged, there was \n'industrial scale misuse', or rather whether what occurred in the obtaining of the search orders, and the obtaining of \nmaterial upon their execution, was what one might describe as an 'industrial-scale forensic debacle',\" Justice Logan \nsaid in his decision.\nSuppression orders covering the case were only partially lifted by Justice Logan on Tuesday, but the case centres \naround allegations made by Fortescue that Element Zero directors used confidential Fortescue intellectual \nproperty about Fortescue's green iron (carbon-dioxide free) technology to found their own company.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue 'staff stole green iron tech'\n\"That is said to have occurred \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 whilst undertaking and leading research and development work, which included \nwork on what is said to be a confidential process of electrochemical reduction of iron oxide in iron ore using ionic \nliquid electrolytes, to create metallic iron,\" Justice Logan said.\n\"It is alleged that, without the knowledge of the Fortescue parties, upon resignation of the second (Dr \nKolodziejczyk) and third respondents (Dr Winther-Jensen) from the employment of the Fortescue parties in late \n2021, information concerning such a process was copied and taken.\" In his decision Justice Logan stressed there \nwas no finding or decision about the veracity of Fortescue's claims against Element Zero, and a spokesman for the \ncompany denied the allegations on Thursday.\n\"Element Zero believes this legal action is entirely without merit and welcomes the opportunity to respond to \nFortescue's spurious claims. Our response will include an application to vary or set aside the original search \norders,\" a spokesman said on -Thursday.\n\"As Element Zero will demonstrate, its green metals technology was developed independently of and is very \ndifferent from anything that Fortescue is doing or has done in this space. We continue to rapidly advance our \ntechnology.\n\"As the matter is now before the court, we will not be making further comment at this time.\" A Fortescue \nspokesman said the company's intellectual property is critical and \"must be -protected\".\n\"Protecting our IP helps to protect the substantial investment of time and effort made by our innovative employees \nand stakeholders every day,\" he said.\n\"We invest significant resources in creating IP and are committed to vigorously managing and enforcing its \nprotection. As the matter is the subject of legal proceedings, we do not intend to comment further at this stage.\" The \ndocuments and devices were made under Anton Pillar orders, which are made without alerting respondents, Justice \nLogan said.\n\"The purpose of such search orders is invariably to preserve evidence, so as to assist in the proof of an applicant's \nclaim, which may be in jeopardy of destruction, concealment or perhaps removal from the jurisdiction,\" he said.\n\"They usually provide, and in this case, did, for a search by representatives of the applicants, here the Fortescue \nparties, of nominated places associated with the respondents, under the supervision of an independent lawyer.\" \nThe court action comes as Fortescue kicked off negotiations with Chinese authorities for the supply of 100 million \ntonnes of green iron from its Pilbara operations in May.\nThe company ticked off a $50m pilot plant for its green iron production plant in late 2023, estimating it could \nproduce 1500 tonnes of iron ore a year from 2025.\nDr Forrest has spruiked his ambitious goal of producing 200 million tonnes a year of carbon-free iron ore for export \nto the company's customers.\nFortescue plans to produce high-grade iron ore for use in the steel industry by using renewable energy and green \nhydrogen reduction technology, together with an electric smelting furnace at its pilot plant. Fortescue will need \nabout eight million tonnes of hydrogen a year to reach its goal of producing 200 million tonnes a year of green iron, \npotentially eliminating 220 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually.\nLoad-Date: June 6, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
