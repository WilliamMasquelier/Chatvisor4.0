Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nFortescue's secret search 'improper'\nFortescue's secret search 'improper'\nThe Australian\nJune 27, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 18\nLength: 556 words\nByline: NICK EVANS\nBody\nFormer Fortescue executives will try to have a lawsuit alleging they stole the mining giant's intellectual property \nthrown out for \"egregious material nondisclosures\" when Fortescue won legal permission to launch raids on their \nhomes and offices.\nFortescue won court orders authorising the searches in May, targeting the offices of would-be green steel \ncompetitor Element Zero and the homes and computers of company directors - including former Fortescue chief \nscientist Bart Kolodziejczyk and former Fortescue staff member Bjorn Winther-Jensen.\nLong-term Andrew Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman, now an Element Zero director, is also a party to the case.\nFortescue sought orders allowing the secret raids after accusing all three men of taking Fortescue's intellectual \nproperty with them when they quit the iron ore and would-be green energy giant. Lawyers for Element Zero and its \nexecutives on Wednesday flagged a move to have Fortescue's suit struck out, saying the accusations had caused \n\"ongoing reputational damage\" to all three men, and the orders were improperly obtained by Fortescue.\nAppearing for Element Zero, John Hennessy SC told the court the original orders were won on the basis of \"the \nweakest of weak prima facie cases\".\n\"We say the order was improperly obtained, off on the back of what was egregious material non disclosure, and so \nwe don't want it to continue any longer than it must out there in the marketplace,\" he said.\nMr Hennessy flagged plans to introduce evidence showing Fortescue employees had previously met with Element \nZero to discuss the company's technology, which it says is not based on any work conducted by the men at \nFortescue.\nThe court was told Mr Kolodziejczyk also planned to introduce evidence he was allowed by Fortescue to take some \ndocuments with him when he resigned.\nFortescue's lawyer told the court the company would \"refute\" the allegations it won the orders improperly.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue's secret search 'improper'\n\"There was no material nondisclosure,\" he said.\nThe computers and electronic devices seized in the raids are currently held at the offices of an independent lawyer, \nand Element Zero and its directors will also seek to have the original search orders overturned and their property \nreturned.\nDetails of Fortescue's case, and of the new allegations by Element Zero, remain subject to suppression orders.\nThe case centres around allegations made by Fortescue that Element Zero directors used confidential Fortescue \nintellectual property about Fortescue's carbon-dioxide free green iron technology to found their own company.\nThe matter will return to court in August.\nMr Masterman this month took aim at the hydrogen technology at the centre of his former employer's \"green steel\" \nstrategy.\nHe revealed that key customers in Asia had directly questioned the merits of using -hydrogen to make steel, \narguing that Element Zero's technology would be far more energy efficient than rival green steel techniques that \ninvolved the use of hydrogen.\nElement Zero's technology involves removing many of the impurities in iron ore by running renewable electricity \nthrough a chemical -solution. Mr Masterman previously said such an approach would require less renewable energy \nthan rival plans involving hydrogen DRI (direct reduced ironmaking), which require using renewable energy to \nproduce hydrogen then used to process the iron ore.\nLoad-Date: June 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
