However, many roads remain closed and remote \ncommunities and cattle stations have been hard hit by flooding.\nRio was able to get iron ore carriers back into the ports of Cape Lambert and Dampier late on Saturday and there \nare no indications of damage to its 2000km-long rail network.\nHowever, the latest disruption means Rio's port operations have been out of action for almost two weeks since late \nJanuary.\nRio shipped 328.6 million -tonnes of iron ore from its Pilbara ports in 2024, in line with production guidance, which \nremains unchanged for 2025 despite its recent setbacks.\nCyclone Zelia crossed the Pilbara coast northeast of Port Hedland on Friday and weakened into a tropical low that \ndumped heavy rain on the minerals-rich but sparsely populated Pilbara region.\nThe cyclone's eventual path took it away from a direct hit on Port Hedland or Rio's ports, and also spared the LNG \nindustry from major damage.\nBHP said it mines, rail and infrastructure at Port Hedland had fared better than expected as it hunkered down for \nCyclone Zelia.\n\"The experience of our teams in managing cyclones in the Pilbara meant we were well prepared,\" a spokesperson \nsaid. \"Our teams are now progressively returning to site, with recovery and ramp-up operations underway.\" \nFortescue said all non-essential travel to its mines remained suspended and that all its workers on the ground were \nsafe.\nPage 2 of 2\nPilbara miners dodge worst of cyclone\n\"While some of our operations have experienced temporary disruptions, we are working to resume normal activities \nas quickly and safely as possible,\" a Fortescue spokesperson said.\nBHP is due to hand down its first half results on Tuesday, followed by Rio's full-year results on Wednesday and \nFortescue's first- half numbers on Thursday.\nLithium miner Pilbara Minerals, which reports first-half results on Thursday, appears to have dodged a bullet after \nearly modelling showed Cyclone Zelia tracking straight at its Pilgangoora mine. \"Initial assessments indicate no \nmaterial damage to our operation, and our on-site team continue to conduct infrastructure checks,\" a spokesman \nsaid.\nPilbara Minerals has offered support to surrounding communities, including Strelley and Warralong, caught up in \nflooding and other fallout from the cyclone.\nMineral Resources shut down operations at it Wodgina lithium mine and flew non-essential staff to Perth in advance \nof the cyclone.\nIt said initial assessments indicated minimal impact at Wodgina with workers returning to site.\nCyclone Zelia hit the Pilbara with Rio still carrying out repair work in the wake of Cyclone Sean, which flooded key \nparts of its operations in January and also hit BHP, Fortescue and MinRes.\nEven before the latest storm, Rio admitted first-quarter shipments would be affected by the impact of Cyclone Sean, \nand subsequent closures from Cyclone Taliah and Cyclone Vince.\nThe most northern of Rio's 17 mines in the Pilbara, including Gudai-Darri, appear to have copped the brunt of the \nlatest downpour and may still have water sitting in the bottom of pits.\nThe mines would normally be better prepared to cope with cyclone disruption but they were soaked by heavy \nrainfall in the December quarter, forcing Rio to draw down on stockpiles. Rio's export terminal at East Intercourse \nIsland remains out of action after flooding caused by Cyclone Sean, which dumped a record 274mm of rain on parts \nof the Pilbara in a 24-hour period. The operations are scheduled to come back online this week.\nLoad-Date: February 16, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\nNone\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
