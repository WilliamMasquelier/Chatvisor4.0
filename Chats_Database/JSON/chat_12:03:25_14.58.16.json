Instead new rules \naround trailing liability provisions were introduced, which could slug former owners of the licence areas with the bill, \nthereby putting the onus on them to do adequate due diligence should the assets change hands.\nThe exploration permit in the current matter was granted to Woodside, Shell and BHP Billiton Petroleum in 1997, \nwith Woodside owning a half share and the other two companies one quarter each.\nProduction from the Laminaria and Corallina oilfields began in 1999. The writ filed with WA's Supreme Court says \nShell then sold two-thirds of its interest to Woodside in March 2005, and one-third to British company Paladin.\nShell says in its claim that the agreement with each company \"expressly provided ... that Woodside/Paladin is liable \nfor all environmental, abandonment, reclamation, remediation and restoration claims\". The claim says following the \nfailure of TSOGA, neither that company nor its liquidator made any efforts to remediate the platform.

Shell is pursuing legal action against Woodside Energy and Paladin Resources for $86.6 million, claiming that previous agreements exempted it from responsibility for the clean-up costs of the Northern Endeavour oil platform.\n\n2. The lawsuit highlights the ongoing issue of liability for abandoned oil and gas projects in Australia, particularly in light of new regulations aimed at protecting taxpayers from remediation costs if operators fail to meet their obligations.\n\n3. The Northern Endeavour platform, previously owned by Woodside, was sold to Timor Sea Oil and Gas Australia, which subsequently went into administration after safety concerns halted production, raising fears of government intervention for clean-up costs.\n\n4. Shell's claim asserts that agreements made during the sale of its interests in the Northern Endeavour explicitly place the responsibility for environmental remediation on Woodside and Paladin, indicating a potential shift in liability dynamics within the industry.",
