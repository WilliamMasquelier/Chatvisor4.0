Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | CEO of Fortescue | \"Ongoing process It's been six months since Andrew Forrest's Fortescue bowed to the inevitable and wound back the exponential growth of its green energy hiring, sacking as many as 700 staff in the process.\" | N.A. |\n| Sasha Pendal | General Manager of Community and Government Engagement at Fortescue | \"Pendal's departure is said to be amicable, but appears part of another round of redundancies among senior managers.\" | N.A. |\n| Samantha Buchanan | Former Commercial Manager for Fortescue's Hydrogen Systems Unit | \"Also departing Fortescue this year is the former commercial manager for Fortescue's hydrogen systems unit, Samantha Buchanan, who took a promotion to become a Shell Australia vice-president in January.\" | N.A. |\n| Robert Tichio | Leader of Fortescue Capital | \"But also in need of a market update is the progress of Forrest's green fundraising arm, Fortescue Capital, which, since its 2023 launch under the guidance of Robert Tichio, has built up a leadership group of no less than eight managing directors - all lured away from well-paid gigs at investment banks.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
