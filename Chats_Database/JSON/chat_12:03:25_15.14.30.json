It's also on paper, in Document 79.\nThe 2022 Chinese government directive expands a drive that is muscling US technology out of the country - an \neffort some refer to as \"Delete A\", for Delete America.\nDocument 79 was so sensitive that high-ranking officials and executives were only shown the order and weren't \nallowed to make copies, sources say. It requires state-owned companies in finance, energy and other sectors to \nreplace foreign software in their IT systems by 2027.\nAmerican tech giants had long thrived in China as they hot-wired the country's meteoric industrial rise with \ncomputers, operating systems and software. Chinese leaders want to sever that relationship, driven by a push for \nself-sufficiency and concerns over the country's long-term security.\nThe first targets were hardware makers. Dell, IBM and Cisco Systems have gradually seen much of their \nequipment replaced by products from Chinese competitors.\nDocument 79, named for the numbering on the paper, targets companies that provide the software enabling daily \nbusiness operations from basic office tools to supply chain management. The likes of Microsoft and Oracle are \nlosing ground in the field, one of the last bastions of foreign tech profitability in the country.\nThe effort is just one salvo in a year-long push by Chinese leader Xi Jinping for self-sufficiency in everything from \ncritical technology such as semiconductors and fighter jets to the production of grain and oilseeds. The broader \nstrategy is to make China less dependent on the West for food, raw materials and energy, and instead focus on \ndomestic supply chains.\nOfficials in Beijing issued Document 79 in September 2022, as the US was ratcheting up chip export restrictions \nand sanctions on Chinese tech companies. It requires state-owned firms to provide quarterly updates on their \nPage 2 of 4\nChinese push to delete US technology\nprogress in replacing foreign software used for email, human resources and business manage-ment with Chinese \nalternatives.\nThe directive came down from the agency overseeing the country's massive state-owned enterprise sector - a \ngroup that includes more than 60 of China's 100 largest listed companies.\nThat agency, the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, and the country's national \ncabinet, the State Council, didn't respond to requests for comment.\nSpending by China's state sector topped 48 trillion yuan ($10 trillion) in 2022. The directive leverages that \npurchasing power to support Chinese tech companies, which in turn can improve their products and narrow the \ntechnology gap with US rivals.\nState firms have ramped up their buying of domestic brands, even if the Chinese substitutes sometimes aren't as \ngood. The buyers include banks, financial brokerages and public services such as the postal system.\nBack in 2006, \"China was the land of milk and honey, and intellectual property was the main challenge\", says a \nformer US Trade Representative official involved in previous technology discussions with the Chinese. \"Now, there \nis a feeling that the sense of opportunity is off. Companies are merely hanging on.\" The push to localise tech is \nknown as Xinchuang, loosely translated as \"IT innovation\" with a reference to technology that is secure and \ntrustworthy. The policy has gained urgency amid an escalating tech and trade war with Washington, which has cut \nmany Chinese entities off from American technologies.\nPremier Li Qiang reiterated the push during China's annual legislative sessions this week. China's central \ngovernment plans to increase its spending on science and technology by 10 per cent to about $US51bn ($77bn) \nthis year, according to a budget report released on Tuesday - up from a 2 per cent increase last year.\nAt some trade fairs across the country, vendors tout homegrown tech as an alternative to foreign brands. One \nsemiconductor equipment maker stall in Nanjing put it bluntly, offering to help buyers \"Delete A\" from their supply \nchain.\nDomestic alternatives are growing more user-friendly. A local official recalled how in 2016, it took a whole day to \nopen and close a spreadsheet on a computer with an operating system known as KylinOS, developed by a Chinese \nmilitary-linked company. He compares the usability of the latest KylinOS version to Microsoft's Windows 7, \nintroduced in 2009 - workable if not great.\nAs recently as six years ago, most government tenders sought hardware, chips and software from Western brands. \nBy 2023, many were seeking Chinese tech products instead. When the customs department in the eastern Chinese \ncity of Ningbo sought to purchase rack servers in 2018, it stated a preference for brands such as Dell and Hewlett \nPackard Enterprise, and for hardware powered by Intel's Xeon central processing units. Five years later, the same \nagency asked for rack servers made by Chinese companies and equipped with Huawei chips.\nThese servers are typically assembled by state-owned tech manufacturers that barely sell equipment overseas, \nsuch as Beijing-based Tsinghua Tongfang. Tongfang's controlling shareholder is a state-owned company in charge \nof China's civilian and military nuclear programs.\nSome government officials in China's capital had their foreign-branded PCs replaced with those made by Tongfang \nand officials last year were told to use Chinese phones instead of Apple's iPhones for work.\nOver the past decade, Xi has repeatedly emphasised technological innovation and the use of trusted homegrown \ntechnology in government departments and industry. Revelations by former National Security Agency contractor \nEdward Snowden in 2013 that US authorities had hacked into Chinese mobile phone communications, universities \nand private companies strengthened Xi's resolve. More recently, he has told senior officials that China should \nleverage its strengths and market to break bottlenecks in the development of essential software such as operating \nsystems.Page 3 of 4\nChinese push to delete US technology\nAs China focused on replacing hardware, IBM's China revenues have steadily declined. It downsized its China \nresearch operations in Beijing in 2021, more than two decades after it opened.\nCisco, once a technology powerhouse in China, said in 2019 that it was losing orders in the country to local \nvendors. PC maker Dell's market share in China has almost halved in the past five years, to 8 per cent. Hewlett \nPackard Enterprise, which makes servers, storage and networks, got 14.1 per cent of its revenue from China in \n2018, according to estimates from FactSet. By 2023, that had fallen to 4 per cent.\nIn May, HPE said it would sell its 49 per cent stake in its Chinese joint venture. The company continues to sell direct \nto multinational customers in China and sells selected products to the broader mainland market through its Chinese \npartner.\nIn software, Adobe, Citrix parent Cloud Software Group and Salesforce have pulled out or downsized direct \noperations in the country over the past two years.\nMicrosoft, the world's biggest software provider, historically dominated computer operating systems in China. A \nMorgan Stanley poll of 135 chief information officers in China found that many expected the share of computers \npowered by Microsoft's Windows operating system installed in their companies to fall over the next three years. \nThey expected Linux-based UOS, or Unity Operating System, an effort co-led by a state-owned company, to gain in \nthe shift. Even as Microsoft's top executives and co-founder Bill Gates have frequently travelled to Beijing for high-\nprofile meetings with Chinese leaders on subjects like co-operation on AI and US-China trade relations in recent \nyears, the company has decreased its offerings in China. Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a subcommittee \nhearing last September that China made up just 1.5 per cent of its overall sales. The company posted sales of \n$US212bn in the last fiscal year.\nSome state-owned companies are dragging their feet on orders to replace foreign IT products that are essential to \ntheir core businesses over concerns about the stability and performance of domestic alternatives.\nBut in addition to becoming more advanced, China's own technology is also plugged into the local ecosystem. \nProviders of domestic business software allow interoperability with WeChat, a ubiquitous chat messaging app \nwidely used in place of email among Chinese businesses.\nThe buy-local policy is trickling down to privately run companies, which are showing greater inclination to buy \ndomestic software, according to Morgan Stanley's CIO survey.\nA shift towards hosting and managing data on cloud servers instead of servers on the premises has also allowed \nChinese companies to narrow the gap. Oracle, IBM and Microsoft dominated the database software market in \nChina in 2010. Since then, Chinese companies including Alibaba and Huawei have come up with their own \ndatabase management products to replace American technology.\nChina-based vendors took more than half of that market in China - worth $US6.3bn overall - for the first time in \n2022, and continue to grow, according to researcher Gartner. Tenders examined by the Journal show more state-\nlinked entities and companies have opted for Huawei's databases in recent years.\nChina's banks, brokerage firms and insurers had sped up procurement of homegrown databases, Yang Bing, chief \nexecutive of Chinese database company OceanBase, said at a Beijing conference in November. OceanBase, \ndeveloped by Alibaba and its fintech affiliate Ant Group, replaced Oracle databases at Alibaba and Ant in 2016.\nWestern companies are being replaced not just by Chinese national champions such as Huawei but also more \nspecialised companies. Yonyou Network Technology, a Shanghai-listed firm with a market value of $US6bn, \nprovides systems to manage human resources, inventory and finances. Yonyou has been gaining users at the \nexpense of Oracle and SAP, which together used to dominate more than half the market.\nLoad-Date: March 8, 2024Page 4 of 4\nChinese push to delete US technology\nEnd of Document\n  Tone: Negative\n  Sentiment Score: -3\n\n2 most negative Journalist: Michelle Bowes\nAverage Sentiment Score: -2.00\nArticles:\n- Content: Page 1 of 4\nHow to become a lazy investor (and yes, it's a good thing)\nHow to become a lazy investor (and yes, it's a good thing)\nAFR Online\nJanuary 22, 2025 Wednesday 11:19 PM UTC\nCopyright 2025 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1282 words\nByline: Michelle Bowes\nHighlight: Set-and-forget investing can get good results over long periods, but you'll need to overcome the \ntemptation to trade.\nBody\nShani Jayamanne is a self-confessed \"lazy investor\". It's an unusual admission for someone whose day job is \ndirector and investment specialist at financial services firm Morningstar, but Jayamanne says she \"doesn't \nparticularly enjoy the art of investing\".\n\"I don't enjoy poring through company reports on a Friday night,\" she says.\nJayamanne learnt early in her investing journey that stock picking wasn't for her - owning shares directly in \nindividual companies made her \"incredibly nervous\".\n\"I tend to try to seek out as much information as I can, confirming that I've made the right decision all the time, and \nthat's quite exhausting,\" she says.\nInstead, she has adopted a no-hassles, \"lazy\" approach to her portfolio, investing in managed equity funds and \nexchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nLazy investors lean into diversification, low-cost products and a long investment horizon.\nAshley Owen, who runs a consulting business called Owen Analytics and writes a weekly newsletter about \ninvesting, says the biggest barriers to lazy investing are an inability to tune out noise and ignore emotions, and \navoiding the temptation to chase returns, all of which can be costly.\n\"Human nature is the killer of buy and hold,\" he says. \"You literally have to learn to control yourself to ignore \nfrenzied booms and the frenzied busts, and that's very hard to do. Controlling your emotions is the hardest part of \ninvesting.\"\nVanguard founder John Bogle and legendary investor Warren Buffett both advise that individual investors can get \nby with a simple portfolio consisting of just two index funds - one covering US shares and one covering US bonds.\nBut a lazy Australian investor might have 70 per cent invested in growth assets like Australian and global shares, \nwith the global shares usually 50 per cent hedged, Owen says.\nPage 2 of 4\nHow to become a lazy investor (and yes, it's a good thing)\nThe remaining 30 per cent could be in defensive assets such as Australian and global fixed rate investment grade \ngovernment or corporate bonds, with the global component fully hedged.\nOwen's own long-term investment portfolio features 10 ETFs, none of which are invested in long-duration bonds, \nwhich Owen believes won't deliver the same returns over the next 20 years as they have over the past 30 years.\nHe adds that if someone is establishing a set-and-forget portfolio today, they should also be aware that they're \n\"going to be buying shares at a very expensive point in the cycle\", with future returns to be lower than average.\nETFs and managed funds\nJayamanne isn't invested in bonds, either. Her portfolio consists of four managed funds and three ETFs tracking \nbroad market indexes across Australian and international equities.\nOwen says someone with a standard growth portfolio mix - 70 per cent invested in Australian and global shares and \n30 per cent in bonds - achieved a return of about 11 per cent after fees in the 2023-24 financial year. This is the \nasset mix most large superannuation funds use as their \"default\" option.\n\"Even after inflation of 4 per cent, a lazy return of 11 per cent is still a very healthy 7 per cent real return for the \nyear,\" he says. \"I say 'lazy' because any passive investor would have achieved these returns without trying to chase \nhot stocks or funds or themes or fads, or fiddle with opaque alternatives, or whacky 'new' asset classes, or listened \nto perennial doomsayers prattling on about recessions or political crises or world wars.\"\nInvestors using a buy-and-hold strategy need to accept that there will inevitably be periods of outperformance and \nunderperformance, Jayamanne says.\nBut on average, you will perform better compared to someone who tries to time the market by switching in and out \nof investments, she says.\nBesides incurring the transaction costs associated with buying and selling, market data for the past 30 years shows \nthat if you missed the S&P 500's 10 best days, your returns will be cut in half, Jayamanne says.\n\"And if you missed the best 30 days ... your return would be 83 per cent lower,\" she says.\nJayamanne takes the emotion out of her investment decisions by adhering to an investment policy statement, a \ndocument that outlines exactly what she's investing for and how her investments connect to her financial goals.\n\"Those sorts of guidelines allow you to sit back and think about why you're making a decision, whether it's \nemotionally driven, whether you're feeling like you're missing out on something, or you're doing it in line with your \nportfolio, your financial goals, and what will benefit you over the long term.\"\nJayamanne's investment policy statement also includes parameters for when she will buy and sell investments.\nBuying at the right price\nThese are the two most critical time points for lazy investors, Owen says. In particular, buying investments at the \nright price is key, as buying when investments are overvalued can destroy returns from a set and forget portfolio for \ndecades, he says.\nLink to Image\n\"You make your money when you buy. You've got to be aware of when things are expensive and you've got to be \naware of when things are cheap.\"\nEric Marais, an investment specialist at Orbis Investment Management, agrees that little matters more than the buy-\nin price.Page 3 of 4\nHow to become a lazy investor (and yes, it's a good thing)\nOrbis invests based on an active management philosophy of seeking out undervalued companies, and Marais \npoints to investors who bought into successful tech companies like Cisco Systems and Microsoft before the dotcom \ncrash of the early 2000s, as an example of those who got the buy-in price wrong.\n\"Cisco is a business that has actually been extremely successful. It's continued to grow its revenue and its profits, \nbut it has yet to recoup its peak price 25 years later.\" In the case of Microsoft, Marais says recovering to its pre-\ndotcom share price took 16 years.\nFor lazy investors who don't want to follow the markets closely enough to time their entry, the solution is dollar cost \naveraging, which is the approach Jayamanne uses. Dollar cost averaging is the process of investing the same sum \nat regular intervals, regardless of market movements.\n\"You're just putting $100 in every week, and you buy all the way through the booms and busts and that works quite \nwell,\" Owen says.\nWhen to review\nDespite her hands-off approach, Jayamanne does monitor her portfolio.\n\"You always have to monitor and maintain your portfolio because markets will always change, economic conditions \nwill change,\" she says. \"There's no set-and-forget portfolio that you can just leave and let it run and be confident \nthat it's still aligned with your goals over the long term.\"\nJayamanne reviews her portfolio every six months. \"I think that's a pretty good cadence for lazy investors,\" she \nsays.\nOwen agrees that some tweaking does make sense from time to time as conditions change, adding that \"about \nonce or twice per decade there is a major market rupture that requires some serious thinking and major changes\".\nYield Financial Planning managing director James McFall agrees staying invested when markets fall suddenly and \nwaiting for the recovery is part of a successful investor's mindset.\nHe advocates a more active approach, suggesting investors should \"actively switch among asset classes where the \ngreater risk or opportunity is at different points in the market cycle\".\nWhile the thesis that there are some companies that you can buy and hold forever might be considered central to \nlazy investing, Marais calls this idea \"dangerous\".\n\"Over time, it has tended to be the case that most businesses get disrupted, so the idea that there is a good-\nenough company that you can buy and hold forever is sort of redundant.\"\nHe says rather than an annual or biannual review, the right time to review your investments \"should be based on \nwhat's changing in the market\".\nGraphic\n \nInvestment specialist Eric Marais\nLoad-Date: January 25, 2025Page 4 of 4\nHow to become a lazy investor (and yes, it's a good thing)\nEnd of Document\n  Tone: Neutral\n  Sentiment Score: -2\n\n\nB.

While that predictive capability has \nbeen developing for some time, the company also plans to launch more capabilities that make use of generative AI \nto simplify their software and make it easier for people without technical training to operate the tools.\nSplunk, launched in 2003, developed a dashboard that allows users to search, monitor and analyse machine-\ngenerated data. It takes training to use it and generative AI helps reduce the learning curve, according to Mr Steele. \n\"Splunk has its own proprietary language, the way in which you issue commands, and you have to be reasonably \ntechnical to do that,\" he said.\n\"With the AI assistance that we've launched, you can use English language to automatically generate that \nproprietary language. You can get outcomes without having all the advanced knowledge.\" Splunk's AI would benefit \nfrom Cisco's massive amounts of data, not to mention its global presence and sales and marketing channels, Mr \nSteele said.\nGenerative AI will have other applications across Cisco's business, such as simplifying the complex task of setting \na configuration screen for a company's security policy, according to Mr Robbins. \"It's very technical. We're going to \nenable our customers to just use English language to describe what security capabilities they would like \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and \nthen we will translate that into a policy that they would review,\" he said.\nPage 2 of 2\nCisco finalises $42bn Splunk buy\nThe software will function as an assistant, simplifying and speeding up the deployment of security policy and other \nresources without replacing human operators, according to Mr Robbins.\nWhen the deal was announced in September 2023, the companies said it expected it to be completed by the end of \nSeptember 2024. The process was completed in roughly half a year. Last week, the European Union gave the deal \nunconditional antitrust approval, after regulators found it wouldn't pose barriers to competition. Networking \nequipment pioneer Cisco, founded in 1984, rode the telecommunications boom of the 1990s. It was for a time the \nmost valuable company in the world.\nLoad-Date: March 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n  Tone: Positive\n  Sentiment Score: 3\n\n2 most positive Journalist: Vernal Galpotthawela, Jack Witzig, And Ian King\nAverage Sentiment Score: 0.00\nArticles:\n- Content: Page 1 of 2\nAI chipmaker Nvidia CEO's wealth soars $15b in a day; Technology\nAI chipmaker Nvidia CEO's wealth soars $15b in a day; Technology\nSydney Morning Herald (Australia)\nFebruary 24, 2024 Saturday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 2\nLength: 735 words\nByline: Vernal Galpotthawela, Jack Witzig and Ian King\nBody\nNvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang said artificial intelligence had hit a \"tipping point,\" sending the stock to \nnew dizzying heights.\nThe renewed rally has Huang, known for his love of wearing leather jackets, on the verge of his own breakthrough: \nbecoming one of the 20 richest people in the world.\nHuang's wealth jumped $US9.6 billion ($14.7 billion) to $US69.2 billion, a gain that leapfrogged him ahead of \nCharles Koch and Chinese bottled-water tycoon Zhong Shanshan to 21st place on the Bloomberg Billionaires \nIndex. It's a remarkable rise for the co-founder of the semiconductor company, who was ranked 128th with a net \nworth of $US13.5 billion as recently as early last year.\nNvidia surged 16 per cent to a record high on Thursday in New York, adding about $US277 billion in market value. \nThat was the biggest single-session increase in market history, beating Meta's $US197 billion gain earlier this \nmonth. The company was able to exceed sky-high investor expectations with a revenue forecast that was more \nthan $US2 billion ahead of analyst expectations.\nNvidia's rally boosted the fortunes of the 30 billionaires on Bloomberg's wealth list who attribute at least some of \ntheir wealth to AI by a combined $US42.8 billion. Charles Liang, CEO of Super Micro Computer, was the biggest \nwinner on a percentage basis with a 33 per cent jump.\nNvidia's outlook extends a streak of the company shattering expectations, thanks to insatiable demand for its \nartificial intelligence accelerators - highly prized chips that crunch data for AI models. The technology has helped \npower a proliferation of chatbots and other generative AI services, which can create text and graphics based on \nsimple prompts.\n\"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,\" Huang said. \"Demand is surging worldwide \nacross companies, industries and nations.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nAI chipmaker Nvidia CEO's wealth soars $15b in a day; Technology\nNvidia's market capitalisation has now increased by more than $US650 billion this year - bringing its valuation to \n$US1.89 trillion - as investors bet that the company will remain the prime beneficiary of an AI computing boom.\nThat turned Wednesday's report into a highly anticipated event for both Wall Street and the tech world. And the \nnumbers - along with the upbeat tone from Huang - renewed confidence that spending will stay strong.\n\"The entire market is watching this report and expectations have been elevated,\" Wolfe Research analyst Chris \nCaso said.\nGuidance was strong enough to \"demonstrate continued momentum, while also leaving room for continued upside \nthrough the second half.\"\nNvidia, co-founded by Huang in 1993, got its start as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. Its profile \nblew up in the last two years, when its technology proved adept at handling heavy AI workloads. The company's \nH100 accelerators have become legendary in the tech world, with customers scrambling to get their hands on as \nmany as possible.\nCompanies such as Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet's Google are Nvidia's largest customers, \naccounting for nearly 40 per cent of its revenue, as they rush to invest in hardware for AI computing.\nIn the US fiscal fourth quarter, which ended January 28, Nvidia's revenue more than tripled to $US22.1 billion. Profit \nexcluding certain items was $US5.16 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $US20.4 billion and earnings \nof $US4.60 a share. Underscoring the magnitude of its recent growth streak: As recently as 2021, Nvidia didn't \ngenerate that much revenue in an entire year.\nNvidia's data centre division, now by far its largest source of sales, generated $US18.4 billion of revenue, up 409 \nper cent from the same period a year earlier. Gaming chips provided $US2.87 billion of sales.\nNvidia is now working to spread its AI technology beyond the big data-centre companies. Huang, 61, has travelled \nthe globe arguing that governments and corporations need their own AI systems - both to protect their data and \ngain a competitive advantage.\nNvidia announced a deal with Cisco Systems earlier this month that gives it a new distribution channel. As part of \nthat deal, Cisco, the world's biggest provider of networking gear, will help sell complete AI systems to companies.\nBut Nvidia faces risks, including mounting competition and a push by some customers to develop their own AI \nchips.\n\"We're going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in the marketplace,\" Huang said. \nBloomberg\nLoad-Date: February 23, 2024\nEnd of Document\n  Tone: Neutral\n  Sentiment Score: 0\n",

Her article details how Cisco, along with other American tech firms, has been systematically replaced by Chinese alternatives as part of China's push for technological self-sufficiency. The narrative emphasizes Cisco's diminishing market share, lost orders, and the broader geopolitical forces working against the company. The tone is consistently bleak, portraying Cisco as a victim of an irreversible trend, which contributes to her extreme negative sentiment score. In contrast, Michelle Bowes' article only briefly mentions Cisco in a negative light, referencing its historical stock price struggles post-dotcom crash. While this is a negative remark, it is not the central theme of the article, which is primarily about investment strategies. This explains why Bowes' sentiment score is less negative than Lin's, as her coverage of Cisco is incidental rather than a focal point of criticism.\n\nAmong the most positive journalists, Stephen Rosenbush's reporting on Cisco is highly favorable, focusing on the company's successful $42 billion acquisition of Splunk. His article highlights the strategic benefits of the deal, emphasizing Cisco's integration of AI and cybersecurity capabilities, its accelerated timeline for completion, and the positive outlook from company executives. The narrative presents Cisco as a forward-thinking leader in AI-driven security, reinforcing a strong and optimistic image. This overwhelmingly positive framing results in his high sentiment score. In contrast, the article by Vernal Galpotthawela, Jack Witzig, and Ian King is neutral, as it primarily discusses Nvidia's success and only briefly mentions Cisco in the context of a partnership. The lack of a strong positive or negative stance on Cisco results in a neutral sentiment score, making Rosenbush's coverage significantly more positive in comparison.",
