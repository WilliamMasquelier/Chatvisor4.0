Part of that is its Never Never high-grade gold deposit on which the company is pinning its \nhopes for growth.\nSpartan was previously called Gascoyne Resources and collapsed after gold ore levels being processed through \nits mill were not profitable, and it was later recapitalised after its market value fell beneath $100m.\nRamelius purchased Spartan shares at 92c in June, and they are currently trading at about $1.33, while Ramelius \nshares are trading at $2.09.\nPage 2 of 2\nRamelius may look to M&A if Rebecca-Roe project doesn't stack up - DATA ROOM\nLate last year, it was known around the market that Ramelius was in search of an opportunity, preferably in WA, \nwhere it could add 100,000 ounces of gold per annum and wanted to add a third production hub to put its $261m \ncash pile to work.\nMr Zeptner said in August he did not feel an obligation to get bigger but was more focused on good margins and \ncashflow.\nThe focus on Ramelius comes after the results of Newmont's recent sales campaign shows corporate activity \nbooming in the gold mining space, with Newmont achieving over $US1bn more than the market had initially \nestimated for asset sales.\nNewmont has been selling assets in North America, Australia and Africa following its $24bn acquisition of Newcrest \nin 2023. Most recently, it agreed to sell its Eleonore mine in Quebec, Canada for up to $US795m to Dhilmar, which \nanalysts at Macquarie said was 62 per cent higher than its valuation.\nNewmont expects its final two non-core remaining assets, Porcupine and Cripple Creek & Victor Mine Gold Mine in \nColorado, to be sold in the first quarter of next year, and they are valued at about $US1.5bn.\nIt had targeted returns of $US2bn from assets sales and has realised $US3.6bn, excluding two others to go A share \nbuyback is expected to be on the cards. It sold its Akyem mine in Ghana to Zijin Mining for $US1bn in October and \nhas also sold the Telfer asset in WA in August for $714m to Greatland Gold.\nLoad-Date: November 27, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**ENTITY**: [Organization Name]\n**TYPE**: [Type of organization - e.g., Company, Government Agency, NGO, etc.]\n**DESCRIPTION**: [Brief description of how the entity is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**ENTITY**: Tesla, Inc.\n**TYPE**: Company\n**DESCRIPTION**: Main subject of article, discussing Q4 earnings report\n\nOnly include entities that are meaningful to the article's content.
