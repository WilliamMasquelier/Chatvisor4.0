Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Major shareholder | \"Total dividends for the year of $1.97 a share translate into $2.2 billion for Andrew and Nicola Forrest, who collectively control 36.7 per cent of Fortescue.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue energy chief | \"We would get going on the project, we would bring bank debt in at some stage, probably at financial close, of 50 to 60 per cent, and then we would sell down some of the equity.\" | N.A. |\n| Sean Williams | Moody's analyst | \"This leaves Fortescue with significant capacity as the company steps up its decarbonisation efforts and capital expenditure for Fortescue Energy in fiscal 2025, while considering further green energy projects.\" | N.A. |\n| Adrian Prendergast | Morgans analyst | \"The stock had become oversold following two discounted block trades in two months and fears around China growth [where we expect much more stable iron ore fundamentals].\" | N.A. |\n| Fiona Hick | Former chief executive | \"Her pay was described as $327,205 of fixed remuneration, plus a $2.08 million 'termination payment'.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
