Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"I want to make it really clear: Fortescue is steadfast in our commitment to green hydrogen.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue Energy Boss | \"However, our financial discipline always comes first, and we will never do projects that are not economically viable.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue Energy Boss | \"We totally believe green hydrogen is what the world ultimately needs, that is why we will continue to maintain a significant portfolio of projects.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Chief Executive of Fortescue Metals | \"It's been an outstanding quarter by the team who rallied together to deliver record iron ore shipments of 53.7 million tonnes, which was 10 per cent higher than the June quarter last year.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
