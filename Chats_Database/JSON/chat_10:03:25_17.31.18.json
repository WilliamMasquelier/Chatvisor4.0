Another key area of focus has been the development of its CMA mine pit underground extension to the \nYaoure Gold Mine.\nMeanwhile, Chinese groups may be in the strongest contention for Akyem when it comes to price, but Newmont will \ntake into consideration whether the buyer is a responsible owner of the asset, so it may not get sold to the highest \nbidder.\nNewmont is offloading mines globally following its $24bn purchase of Australia's largest gold mining company \nNewcrest.\nIt is also working with advisory firm BMO to sell mines in Canada and North America, including the Musselwhite, \nCripple Creek (US) and Eleonore (Canada) projects, potentially worth a combined $1.5bn.\nThe contest is expected to attract North American miners.\nPage 2 of 2\nPerseus drops out of the contest for Ghana asset - DATA ROOM\nLast on the block will be Newmont's Telfer gold mine in Western Australia, which Macquarie Capital is mandated to \nsell. Greatland Gold has first right to buy the asset and there's been some market chatter that perhaps the \nnegotiations are already afoot, despite floating at Telfer's tailings dam causing production delays.\nThere was also a suggestion that Ramelius Resources could be interested. However, judging by the trading in \nSpartan Resources, it appears Ramelius's interest lies elsewhere.\nThe Australian listed gold miner that last year held merger talks with near-by rival Westgold Resources told the \nmarket on Thursday it had purchased 8.9 per cent of the $994m listed gold miner Spartan after a major holding \nfrom Tembo Capital was on offer through Citi.\nHowever, it added that it had no current intention to acquire control or make a takeover of the business that owns \nthe Dalgaranga Gold Project, 65km northwest of Mt Magnet in Murchison, Western Australia, where Ramelius \nowns a gold processing hub.\nStill, it gives Ramelius deal certainty should it be keen to move in on the target in the future.\nDataRoom reported in April that Spartan was on the radar of Ramelius. Spartan was previously called Gascoyne \nand had to undergo a string of emergency equity raisings since 2019 following losses, with a mill far bigger than its \nproduction capacity being its downfall.\nThe strategic move by Ramelius resembles Silver Lake's with Red 5, buying 11 per cent last year ahead of a scrip \nmerger deal later with the $1.2bn company.\nThe share price of Red 5 post the merger has been lagging, down about 20 per cent in the past month and taking \nits market value to $2.5bn. Some Silver Lake assets now part of Red 5 are also close to Spartan's. Australian listed \ngold mining companies are under pressure to consolidate to attract global institutional investors that want gold \nmining investment opportunities of scale.\nLoad-Date: June 27, 2024\nEnd of Document\n            ",
