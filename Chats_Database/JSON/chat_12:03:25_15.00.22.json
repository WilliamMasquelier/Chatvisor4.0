But Australia's east coast faces a \nlooming crisis as offshore gas from Victoria's Bass Strait - the traditional bedrock of the country's supplies - rapidly \ndepletes.\nThe Australian Energy Market Operator has warned the country must urgently unlock new supplies to prevent a \ncatastrophic shortfall but new developments are struggling to secure regulatory approvals and/or the support of \nlocal communities.\nAnalysts have warned the country's $2.5 trillion economy will be significant harmed by a shortfall. The \nmanufacturing sector is particularly exposed with gas its only viable energy source, and any interruptions could \nthreaten their viability.\nHouseholds could also be disrupted. Victoria is the most gas-dependent state, relying on the fuel source to heat \nhomes, and a shortfall could make heating prohibitively expensive.\nOther states will also be hit. Gas is used as a so-called peaker, burnt to provide electricity during periods of high \ndemand or low supply from other fossil fuels or renewables. If Australia's National Electricity Market has insufficient \ngas on hand, the price of electricity will spike. Higher electricity bills was a key driver behind Australia's spike in \ninflation, which in turn forced the Reserve Bank of Australia to raise interest rates 13 times.\nWith a looming shortfall, gas developers have insisted governments fast-track applications, a request that the \nfederal Labor government has refused - insisting it must properly assess each application.

It is \nexpected to cost about $2 billion. Shell did not give an estimated cost for the second phase, but it is also expected \nto reach into the billions of dollars.\nThe decision to proceed with the second phase of the Arrow project follows increasingly urgent warnings from the \nAustralian Energy Market Operator about the need for investment in new gas supply to head off shortages \nexpected later this decade on peak-demand winter days.\n\"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to \nmarket,\" said Zoe Yujnovich, director of integrated gas and upstream for Shell.\n\"This investment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a lower-\nemissions alternative.\"\nStill, the drilling of the up to 450 new wells involved will only maintain existing supplies rather than increase \nproduction and does not address shortfalls that are looming because of declines in supplies in the southern states, \nsaid Rick Wilkinson, chief executive of consultancy EnergyQuest.\n\"This makes no change at all to the supply-demand balance and the requirement for new gas to come on for the \neast coast of Australia,\" he said.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell, PetroChina plan to expand Surat gas project\nMr Wilkinson said that for the full development of the project, thousands of wells needed to be drilled, \"so this is one \nstep of many that are required for capital to be allocated to the project to maintain flat production\".\nArrow, jointly owned by Shell and its Chinese state-owned partner, holds the largest reserve of undeveloped gas \non the east coast, where elevated contract prices and a limited choice of supply have been sources of constant \ncomplaint among manufacturers.\nShell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said the project would support up to 400 jobs and create opportunities for \ncontractors and local suppliers.\n\"At its core, this project promotes stronger regional communities, and it also has wider benefits for Australian \nmanufacturing and industry more broadly,\" said Ms Wake.\nShell said the project was underpinned by a 27-year sales deal between Arrow and QGC, a division of the London-\nbased oil and gas giant. In investor briefings last year, the company flagged that it would secure additional gas for \nits LNG facilities in Queensland \"to increase value for shareholders\". The second phase of the project will require \nthe construction of 27 kilometres of pipelines, as well as other infrastructure upgrades.\nIt is opposed by farming families and landholders in the Darling Downs, who said they were worried about the risk \nof damage to water and land. The project is also opposed by environmental groups, concerned about increased \nemissions from fossil fuel production.\nThe go-ahead comes despite years of annual losses by Arrow. The company had originally intended to develop four \nLNG export projects in Queensland but abandoned those plans after the first three plants were built.\nShell later took over BG Group in one of the biggest takeovers in the oil sector, giving it ownership of one of those \nthree plants, Queensland Curtis LNG.\nIt opted to use gas from the Arrow project to instead supply that plant, a major facility near Gladstone, Queensland \nthat was completed in 2014.\nArrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said production from this second phase was expected to start in 2026. \nConstruction will begin later this year. Surat is expected to comprise up to 2500 gas wells and produce 4000 \npetajoules of gas in total.\n\"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify \nArrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast,\" Mr Peng said in a statement.\nLoad-Date: August 15, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Angela Macdonald-Smith\nDate: August 13, 2024\nTitle: Shell, PetroChina plan to expand Surat gas project\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Shell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Angela Macdonald-Smith\n### Date: September 10, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nShell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes\nShell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes\nAustralian Financial Review\nSeptember 10, 2024 Tuesday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Elixir, chaired by coal seam gas entrepreneur Richard Cottee, late last month \nreported a successful flow of gas to the surface from its Daydream-2 well in the area.\nOmega, which is backed by Queensland coal seam gas pioneer Tri-Star Group and Brian Flannery's Ilwella Group, \nis now moving the rig used by Shell for its wells to its Canyon site where it expects to start drilling a well on \nSeptember 20 to test the flow of gas in its acreage for the first time.\n\"If we're successful here this could be the next big wave of development post the coal seam gas wave,\" said \nOmega CEO Trevor Brown, a former vice president geoscience at Santos.\nHe said that while the Beetaloo Basin was more advanced in terms of proving up the flow of gas, the Taroom \nTrough had several compelling reasons that gave it a quantifiable commercial advantage.\nLoad-Date: September 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Angela Macdonald-Smith\nDate: September 10, 2024\nTitle: Shell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: 'Perverse': Woodside, Shell spend millions getting into offset game\n## Media outlet: WA Today\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: September 18, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 4\n'Perverse': Woodside, Shell spend millions getting into offset game\n'Perverse': Woodside, Shell spend millions getting into offset game\nWA Today\nSeptember 18, 2024 Wednesday 12:13 AM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
