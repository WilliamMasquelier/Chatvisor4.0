Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 939 words\nHighlight: Billionaire Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has been accused of failing to disclose \"material\" information \nwhen it secured a warrant to raid the homes and offices of ex-Fortescue staff, who have been accused of stealing \nthe iron ore group's intellectual property.\nBody\nBillionaire Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has been accused of failing to disclose \"material\" information when it \nsecured a warrant to raid the homes and offices of ex-Fortescue staff, who have been accused of stealing the iron \nore group's intellectual property, according to court documents.\nFortescue has taken legal action in the Federal Court against three former employees: Michael Masterman, Bart \nKolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen. It has accused the men of copying and taking the company's intellectual \nproperty when they left to start a rival green iron project, called Element Zero.\nElement Zero has rejected the allegations, and its chief executive, Masterman, has described the claims as \n\"spurious\". Fortescue's executive chairman, Forrest, has argued that protecting the company's intellectual property \nremains \"critical to its success\".\nA warrant was secured to conduct raids on Element Zero's offices and the homes of Kolodziejczyk and Winther-\nJensen. It is estimated that three terabits of data was gathered from personal computers, mobile phones and cloud \nstorage accounts.\nIncluded in the trove of data were the entire business records of Element Zero, including payroll data, budgets and \nforecasts, and all the personal emails sent and received by Kolodziejczyk since 2008. However, Kolodziejczyk only \nstarted at Fortescue Future Industries on July 1, 2020, and ceased working there on November 5, 2021, in his \nroles as chief scientist (energy) and later chief scientist.\nKolodziejczyk is now chief technology officer of Element Zero, a company he and Masterman founded at the end of \n2022.\nIn affidavits filed to the court, Gilbert + Tobin partner Michael Williams, who is representing Element Zero, said he \nhad \"serious concerns\" about the material that was relied on by Fortescue to secure the warrant from the Federal \nCourt.\nHe said the material \"omitted key information\" about the relationship between Fortescue and Element Zero, \nparticularly in the six months before the orders were executed.\nPage 2 of 3\nFortescue accused of keeping key meeting a secret in intellectual property case\nWilliams said the material relied on for the orders, which included affidavits, did not disclose a meeting that \noccurred on December 19 between Masterman, Fortescue's chief legal counsel, Phil McKeiver, and Paul Dewar of \nlaw firm Davies Collison Cave. Dewar is representing Fortescue in its case against Element Zero.\nWilliams said that in that meeting Masterman advised the men that Element Zero's technology was very different \nfrom Fortescue's green iron technology. He said this was because the technology did not use a membrane, \noperated at a different temperature range and used a non-aqueous alkaline solution.\nLink to Image\nAlex Ellinghausen\nMasterman told the men that Element Zero had completed freedom-to-operate searches, which cleared its \ntechnology and found no overlap with Fortescue.\nA freedom-to-operate search is undertaken when trying to establish that a new product or service offering will not \ninfringe on a third party's patents.\nIn January, there was a meeting as well as emails exchanged between the two companies that discussed the \ntesting of Fortescue's iron ore, sharing of information, and future commercial opportunities, Williams said. A non-\ndisclosure agreement between the companies was also signed.\nIn 2023, Element Zero received iron ore samples from Fortescue, which allowed it to test its technology. It had \nprovided Fortescue with information about the results. Element Zero was also testing iron ore samples from other \ncompanies such as BHP and Rio Tinto.\nMany companies are researching and developing ways to produce green iron ore. Green iron technology is a \ntechnology for processing iron ore into metallic iron without burning fossil fuels that produce carbon dioxide.\nThis court case focuses on the technology that uses electrochemical reduction of the iron oxides found in iron ore to \nproduce metallic iron.\nIn his affidavits, Williams also argued that the warrant secured by Fortescue allowed for the collection of \"highly \nconfidential and privileged material\" and \"the indiscriminate capture of material entirely unrelated to Fortescue's \npleaded claim\".\nHe said the volume of material taken was an \"extraordinary invasion of the privacy\", which exceeded what is \n\"usually contemplated\" in civil proceedings. He said the invasion of privacy also extended to spying on Element \nZero staff that had occurred before the warrant was issued.\nThe Federal Court has heard how Fortescue hired a private investigation firm to trail the three men, their family \nmembers and other Element Zero staff, for 19 days.\nA 600-page report was compiled. Fortescue lawyers said the investigation and report was required so that it could \nsecure the warrant.\nForrest has since said he was \"surprised\" to learn of the spying.\nFortescue is seeking loss and damages in the case. In its submission to the court, it claims that green iron could \nsell for as much as $900 a tonne, \"which means hundreds of millions in revenue per year for Fortescue\". Last \nfinancial year, Fortescue said it produced 190 million tonnes of iron ore.\nFortescue alleges that through forensic searching of its computer systems that the men took with them information \nthat was developed for Fortescue, which they used to create their own green iron technology. A claim that Element \nZero founders have denied.Page 3 of 3\nFortescue accused of keeping key meeting a secret in intellectual property case\nThe Federal Court's Justice Brigitte Markovic is presiding over the case, which she has deemed to be in the public \ninterest.
