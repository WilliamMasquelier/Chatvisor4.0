It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nA few worries to iron out\nA few worries to iron out\nThe Daily Telegraph (Australia)\nAugust 20, 2024 Tuesday\nTelegraph Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 31\nLength: 491 words\nByline: Terry McCrann\nBody\nThe plunge in the iron ore price - almost halving since its peak in January - is good news for the rest of the world, \nbut just terrible to awful news for us.\nIt is especially bad news for BHP and Rio and their shareholders, who have had their share prices slashed by more \nthan 20 per cent as a consequence.\nIt's been even worse news for Fortescue and its green groupie chairman and now co-biggest shareholder \"Twiggy\" \nForrest.\nIts share price is down 43 per cent, and teetering.\nFortescue is especially sensitive to the rise and fall of the China-driven iron ore price. One, because that's all it has \n- it's 100 per cent iron ore, and almost all of it goes to China. But secondly and more potently, its iron ore is inferior \nto BHP's and Rio's (and Brazil's Vale).\nThis is great when China is booming and iron ore is in demand; the price Fortescue gets starts to approach the \nBHP/Rio price.\nBut when the opposite occurs, as now, its iron ore price falls further and faster; and the drop in the price comes all \nand straight off Fortescue's profit.\nAnd, obviously, its company tax bill. The same goes for BHP and Rio. Hence, their pain is also Treasurer Jim \nChalmers's pain. And so ours.\nFor instance, as I've argued, it's going to be critical for the government to repeat its $300 electricity rebate in the \n2025-26 year.\nBut will the post iron ore-plunge budget numbers be able to afford it? The obviously unknown - but critically \nimportant for us - question is what happens in China, not just next year but through the rest of the 2020s.\nPage 2 of 2\nA few worries to iron out\nThough the big spenders in Canberra are unable to understand it, it's not just the budget revenues built on China \nbut our entire economic prosperity.\nEven if it doesn't buy them directly from us, like it does iron ore, China drives both the prices of and the volumes of \ncoal and gas we sell into the global market.\nIf their prices really plunged, and stayed down for any extended period, for all the post-fossil fuel fantasies of people \nlike Forrest and the minister for destroying our energy system, Chris Bowen, the Aussie dollar would really collapse \nand this country's economy would become a rubbish heap.\nYet, that would actually be good news for the rest of the world. Lower iron ore and energy prices would feed into \nlower prices for everything - and I really mean everything - across the world.\nYou would see sustained near zero inflation, much lower interest rates, and booming economies. Some of that \nprosperity would even filter down to our trash heap.\nNow as for the three companies themselves, apart from his now essentially abandoned hydrogen fantasies, Forrest \nhas shown zero interest in diversifying away from the total reliance on iron ore and on a never-ending China growth \nstory.\nAfter actually going long on iron ore and China, by selling out of fossil fuels, BHP is now trying desperately to \ndiversify into other commodities. Rio, extraordinarily, has just doubled down in Africa on its iron ore exposure.\nLoad-Date: August 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
