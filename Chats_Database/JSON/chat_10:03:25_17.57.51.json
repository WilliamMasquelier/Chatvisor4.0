It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nFortescue nears green hydrogen call\nFortescue nears green hydrogen call\nThe Australian\nJanuary 26, 2024 Friday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 796 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nFortescue Energy CEO Mark Hutchinson says the company is likely to make a decision next month on whether to \npush ahead with its biggest Australian green hydrogen project, as the company's mining division hits more troubles \nwith its Iron Bridge magnetite project.\nFortescue delivered its December quarter production report on Thursday, blaming ongoing troubles with the water \nsupply to Iron Bridge for a decision to again slash production guidance, and saying an additional $US140m ($213m) \nwould need to be spent on work to get the plant running at full tilt.\nIt is the second time in six months that Fortescue has cut export guidance from the troubled operation, after initially \nflagging exports of 7 million tonnes for the full financial year.\nIn September, Fortescue said it expected to ship about 5 million tonnes of magnetite concentrate from Iron Bridge \nthis financial year, but has so far managed only five cargoes.\nThe company, which is controlled by billionaire Andrew Forrest, said shipments from the facility could reach as little \nas 40 per cent of that 5 million tonne guidance, giving a new range of 2-4 million tonnes.\nFortescue said it was still having trouble with supply from its borefields for the water-hungry operation, where a \nhigh-pressure water line keeps springing leaks.\n\"Work is under way to evaluate options to derisk and improve the performance of the high-pressure section (65km) \nof the raw water pipeline, where the leaks have occurred,\" the company said. \"It is anticipated that replacing this \nsection of the pipeline would not materially impact Iron Bridge's ramp-up schedule and would require investment of \n-approximately $US100m (For-tescue's share).\" Fortescue owns about 70 per cent of the operation, with the \nremainder controlled by Taiwan's Formosa.\nThe company increased the total cost of delivering the 22 -million-tonnes-a-year mine to $US4bn in its annual \nfinancial results last year, from a previous -estimate of $US3.9bn, and its initial guidance, when the project was \napproved in 2019, of $US2.6bn. Fortescue wrote $US1bn off its valuation of the project in its last annual report.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue nears green hydrogen call\nFortescue shipped 48.6 million tonnes of iron ore in the December quarter, slightly below the 49.4 million tonnes \nshipped in the same period in 2022.\nThe company said its C1 cash cost for the period averaged $US17.62 a wet metric tonne, and it received an \naverage $US116.18 a dry metric tonne for its sales in the December period.\nFortescue closed December with net debt of $US600m, the company said. The company has said it still expects to \nship 192-197 million tonnes for the full year, despite the impact of the troubles at Iron Bridge and a derailment on its \niron ore line in the Pilbara that stopped trains for four days over the New Year weekend.\nFortescue said it was implementing an \"operational recovery plan\" to optimise rail loading and shipments for the \nsecond half of the year.\nFortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said he believed the company would still meet its full-year \nshipments guidance for the year, despite the setbacks at Iron Bridge and through the derailment.\n\"The rest of the supply chain is performing exceptionally well. The bottleneck for our operations is rail, so we expect \nany specific recovery plan just to be focused on that, but we're in a pretty good position,\" Mr Otranto said.\nAfter falling short of its promise to reach a final investment decision on as many as five green energy projects in \n2024, the company was likely to make a call on its biggest planned hydrogen project in Australia, Mr Hutchinson \nsaid.\nFortescue announced the -approval of two projects from its energy division in November, ticking off plans for small \nhydrogen production plants in Phoenix in the US and at Gladstone in Queensland.\nAt the time, Fortescue said it would fast-track a decision on larger projects in Norway, Kenya and Brazil.\nBut the company put off any decision on its Gibson Island proposal in Brisbane, where For-tescue has been \nworking with Incitec Pivot on a green hydrogen feed for Incitec's mothballed fertiliser plant. At the time, Fortescue \ncited high Australian energy costs for the deferral.\nLate last month, Genex Power told the market it had extended a deadline for Fortescue to close a deal for power \nfrom its proposed Bulli Creek solar farm - first -announced in October - by two months until the end of February.\nMr Hutchinson told reporters and analysts that a final decision on the plant was likely at Fortescue's board \nmeeting.\n\"We're working hard to get this project over the line,\" Mr Hutchinson said. \"We have a board meeting coming up \nlater in February and I would imagine there will be a 'go or no go' decision made at that board meeting.\" Fortescue \nshares rose 2 per cent to $28.97 in a higher market on Thursday.\nLoad-Date: January 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
