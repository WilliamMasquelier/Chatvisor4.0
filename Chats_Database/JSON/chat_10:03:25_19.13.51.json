She had previously worked for Transgrid, Transurban and \nOrigin Energy.\nHer exit comes after Fortescue has retreated from many of its planned green hydrogen and ammonia projects in \nthe region.\nA plan to develop an ammonia production facility at Incitec Pivot's mothballed Gibson Island - once at the top of \nFortescue's Australian development list - has been stalled since 2023 over high energy costs.\nPlans to build an ammonia facility at Bell Bay in Tasmania have similarly been put on ice over power costs, and the \ncompany's grand plans to build huge hydro-electric power facilities in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia have also \nseemingly fallen by the wayside.\nFortescue has made only three final investment decisions on green hydrogen projects over the past year - a small \nhydrogen plant in Gladstone in Queensland, a facility in Arizona, and a green iron trial commercial plant in the \nPilbara. Fortescue last year also \"fast-tracked\" work on hydrogen production projects in Brazil, Kenya and Norway, \nbut is still to make a formal investment decision on any of those.\nMs Hanly is the latest of a long line of Fortescue executives to part ways with the company.\nPage 2 of 2\nUpheaval continues as Fortescue loses another energy exec\nLast month Judith Judson, chief executive of UK technology company Fortescue Zero - formerly known as Williams \nAdvanced Engineering - stepped down from the role after only 10 months, although she is still believed to be \nworking for the company after returning to the US.\nMr Hutchinson took on the role of running Fortescue Zero in addition to his other responsibilities at the company. \nHis predecessor in Fortescue's top energy job, Julie Shuttleworth, parted ways with the company in recent months, \nand Fortescue Europe president Bruh Terfie also handed in his notice after replacing Carlos Lange in the role in \nFebruary.\nFortescue's energy division is also involved in a damaging dispute with another group of former key executives, \nincluding former chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk and long-term Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman, over \nallegations of intellectual property theft.\nFortescue has accused the pair - along with another former employee, Bjorn Winther-Jensen - of using proprietary \nFortescue information to form their own green iron technology company.\nAll three have denied the accusations and have, in turn, accused Fortescue of wildly inappropriate behaviour in its \nefforts to win court orders allowing a search of their homes and offices - including spying on family members, \nreading their mail, and omitting key information in submissions to the court ahead of those orders being granted. \nFortescue shares closed up 38c to $22.48 per share on Monday.\nLoad-Date: July 15, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
