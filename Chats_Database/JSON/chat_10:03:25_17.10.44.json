The All Ordinaries were flat, while the Australian dollar \nheld just below US65\u00a2.\nFinancial markets largely shrugged off the December-quarter GDP report that showed Australia's economy had \nbarely expanded in the final three months of the year as consumers refrained from spending amid higher borrowing \ncosts.\nReal gross domestic product increased by 0.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, just under forecasts of 0.3 per cent. \nAnnual growth was a touch firmer than expected at 1.5 per cent, against forecasts of 1.4 per cent, but in line with \nthe Reserve Bank of Australia's projections.\n\"For the RBA, we expect today's figures will be seen as suggesting that the economy continues to move slowly in \nthe right direction for achieving its inflation target,\" said HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham.\nThe bond market is now fully priced for the first RBA rate cut in September. It is nearly fully positioned for a follow-\nup move by Christmas.\nThe financial sector was the best performing on the ASX 200 as all the major banks recorded gains.

The sale reduces ANZ's shareholding \nin the banking group from 21.7 per cent to 5.2 per cent.\nPage 2 of 2\nBig four send ASX higher; Cettire tumbles Equities\nThe tech sector, meanwhile, was the worst performing, finishing down 1.4 per cent. WiseTech dropped 2.6 per cent \nto $93.16 and Xero lost 0.9 per cent to $133.30. That's after the Nasdaq Composite overnight dropped 1.7 per cent \nas investors took profits in the mega cap tech stocks.\nIn commodities, gold rose as much as 1.3 per cent to $US2141.79 an ounce, before losing its gains.
