All Rights Reserved.\nCopyright 2024 International Business Times Australia \nLength: 291 words\nByline: Vidhya CK\nBody\nAugust 12th, 2024 ( International Business Times Australia  - Delivered by  Newstex )\nRepresentational image of a gas rigPixabay\nArrow Energy, the joint venture between Shell and PetroChina, will soon develop the second phase of Surat coal \nseam gas project (SGP) in Australia's Queensland.\nAccording to Shell, the phase 2 development will produce 130 terajoules of additional gas per day at peak \nproduction. The first gas production is expected in 2026, as phase 1 was launched in 2020,  Reuters reported.\n\"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify \nArrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast,\" Arrow CEO Zhengxin Peng said.\nThe announcement by Arrow Energy comes in the wake of calls for more investment to increase the local energy \nsupply. Australia's energy market operator and competition watchdog, too, had urged oil and gas companies to \ninvest more to increase the supply of energy.\n\"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to \nmarket,\"  Energy Connects quoted Zo Yujnovich, Integrated Gas and Upstream Director at Shell. \"QCLNG marked \nits 1000th cargo at the end of last year, reflecting its significance as a gas supplier for Australia and the region. This \ninvestment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a lower emissions \nalternative to options like coal.\"\nThe gas will flow to the Shell-operated QCLNG liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility on Curtis Island, near \nGladstone. It is expected to  meet the requirements of long-term contracts and domestic market, as part of a 27-\nyear agreement between Arrow Energy and QGC.\nLink to the original story.\nPage 2 of 2\nArrow Energy To Develop Phase 2 Of Surat Coal Gas Project In Australia\nNotes\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex \nAuthoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its \nre-distributors.
