It's a remarkable rise for the co-founder of the semiconductor company, who was ranked 128th with a net \nworth of $US13.5 billion as recently as early last year.\nNvidia surged 16 per cent to a record high on Thursday in New York, adding about $US277 billion in market value. \nThat was the biggest single-session increase in market history, beating Meta's $US197 billion gain earlier this \nmonth.
