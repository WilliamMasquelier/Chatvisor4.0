It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nFortescue execs face bonuses backlash\nFortescue execs face bonuses backlash\nThe Australian\nNovember 6, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian2 Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 641 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nSome of the world's biggest pension funds are pushing back against bonus packages potentially worth millions of \ndollars for Fortescue chief executives Dino Otranto and Mark Hutchinson.\nFortescue intends to grant the performance rights regardless of whether shareholders vote down the move at the \ncompany's annual general meeting in Perth on November 6.\nThe iron ore miner is not required to put the matter to a vote or bound by the outcome, but gave an undertaking to \ndo so in response to a massive protest vote against its remuneration report at last year's annual meeting.\nThree major US pension funds have aligned against the bonus packages for Mr Otranto, who runs the company's \nmining division, and its green energy boss Mr Hutchinson.\nSBA Florida, which has about $US238bn in assets under management, said there was insufficient disclosure of \nperformance targets and weighting for the short-term incentive awards.\nThe California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) and the California Public Employees' Retirement \nSystem (CalPERS) are also opposed, although not major shareholders.\nFortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest and Nicola Forrest own about 37 per cent of the company.\nFortescue intends to grant up to 208,656 performance rights to Mr Otranto and up to 248,001 rights to Mr \nHutchinson.\nThe performance rights could be worth up to $4.6m to Mr Otranto on top of his fixed remuneration which increased \nto $1.75m on January 1 this year.\nMr Hutchinson stands to gain up to $5.46m in addition to his fixed salary of $2.08m if he can deliver on some of \nFortescue's green energy and hydrogen ambitions, which stalled in July when the company moved to cut 700 jobs.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue execs face bonuses backlash\nIn its AGM statements to shareholders, Fortescue said the granting of performance rights did not require \nshareholder approval under the Corporations Act or ASX listing rules.\nFortescue said in the interests of good governance and transparency the board had decided to seek shareholder \napproval.\nIt is one of the measures agreed by Fortescue to placate shareholders after a first strike on its remuneration report \nin 2023. More than 52 per cent of shareholders who voted last year opposed the remuneration report.\nThe backlash came after more than a year of leadership upheaval that saw CEO Elizabeth Gaines step aside, her \nreplacement Fiona Hick exit after a short stint in the top job as well as the departure of chief financial officer Ian \nWells and other executives.\nFortescue's move to pay Ms Gaines and Mr Wells special recognition payments of $1.98m and $1m respectively \nearned a rebuke for proxy advisory firms, with CGI Glass Lewis saying \"such ad hoc discretionary payments on \nretirement are unusual among ASX 100 entities\".\nFortescue does not expect to have issues with this year's remuneration report after moving to address shareholder \nand proxy adviser concerns.\n\"The board has heard this feedback and while it retains the ability to apply discretion to incentive outcomes, it will \nnot make discretionary payments that do not clearly align with shareholder interests,\" the company said in its 2024 \nremuneration report.\nThree resolutions on performance rights, including those for Mr Otranto and Mr Hutchinson, that will be put to a vote \non Wednesday are separate to the remuneration report.\nFortescue told investors Ms Gaines, now a part-time executive director and global ambassador for the company, \nhad agreed not to participate in the performance rights plan even though she was eligible.\nFortescue said that if shareholders voted down the resolutions on Mr Otranto and Mr Hutchinson it would need to \nreconsider their remuneration packages for 2025-26 and could offer equivalent cash incentives. Fortescue noted \nsome of the targets that applied to the two chief executives were market sensitive and said it would provide more \ndisclosure in the 2024-25 annual report.\nLoad-Date: November 5, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
