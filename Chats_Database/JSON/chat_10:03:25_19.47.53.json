What better time to sink a cocktail and stuff \nyour face with fondue - or shimmy around to a live performance by Duran Duran at the big Salesforce party, which \nScott, hungry like the wolf, dutifully -attended.\nCatch was acquired in 2019 for $230m, but apart from a growth spurt during the Covid-19 pandemic it's done \nnothing but tank hard and fast in the face of Amazon, Shein and Temu, the Chinese purveyor of cheap, breakable \ncrap people are buying by the buttload.\nScott's eulogy of Catch to the ASX tried to smear out the bloodbath. Yes, the business sucked, and yes, our pet \ngoose got the axe but, hey, Wesfarmers still gained \"valuable insights and capabilities that have accelerated the \ngroup's digital transformation and supported the \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" We'll spare you the guff, you get the idea.\nAccording to Wesfarmers' accounts, Catch shed $96m during the last financial year, and Scott told investors that \nwinding it down would soak up another $60m in exit costs, bringing total losses for the business, or so we hear, to a \nballpark figure of about half a billion dollars. Small change for some in Davos, but we doubt Scott was making any \nof this unpleasantness known while hoping to bump into someone high-status around the staircase of the Congress \nCentre.\nIt's obvious what Scott was hoping to gain from Davos. Doesn't every small pond CEO want to kick back in the end \nzone with Jamie Dimon and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman? Doesn't everyone want to see Yo-Yo Ma get \ngently dusted with cloud-soft snow while performing Bach on a mountainside?\nPage 2 of 3\nScott lives high life as Catch dies\nOf course Scott didn't need to be there. Wesfarmers doesn't have a tonne of assets outside of Australia and New \nZealand, and its forays into offshore markets have been absolute duds. Remember Bunnings UK and Ireland? Yet \nanother dog, sold for a British pound by the time the shades were drawn. Woof.\nLet's not even mention Wesfarmers' acquisition of a West Australian mining site, a most unprofitable venture given \nthe current prices of lithium hydroxide. The commodity has crashed from highs of $US84,000 a tonne, in 2022, to \nas low as $US10,550 in October - and the numbers have barely eked upwards since.\nWesfarmers' response to our questions on this Davos caper was equally puzzling. All we wanted to know was how \nmany company representatives attended with Scott and how much it all cost.\n\"Unfortunately, we are in a full media blackout in the lead-up to our half-year results in Feb, so we can't comment \non your below request,\" a Wesfarmers spokesman said.\nSure, because the boss's attendance at the World Economic Forum has such a pivotal bearing on the company's \nearnings. Give us a break.\nGame for a laugh A press release landed in our inbox on Thursday announcing the launch of Monopoly: Central \nCoast Edition, named in honour of the retiree haven of NSW nestled between Sydney and Newcastle (also known \nas God's Waiting Room).\nThis is where Anthony Albanese recently bought a $4.3m house atop a cliff in Copacabana, a suburb whose \nstreets, we imagine, are a shot at being located at the Mayfair and Park Lane sector of the board, thanks to their \nglow-up from Albo's arrival. Woy Woy's less-salubrious Railway Street is shaping as a lock for the lesser-loved \nbrown tiles of Whitechapel and Old Kent Road. They're the one just after \"Go\", where even a proud row of hotels \nwon't even come close to winning you the game. Only an idiot buys up that real estate.\nBesides, everyone knows the smarter money trains its eye on the yellow or green tiles closer to Free Parking, and \nwe're guessing they'll be named after streets in Avoca Beach, where Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar bought a \nmansion two years ago, or perhaps Terrigal, where rich-lister Tony Denny listed a penthouse last year.\nOf course, there'll still be a square stipulating a payment on Income Tax, with the usual fine of $200 expected. But \nin this edition we imagine the retiree players get a pass; instead they actually get money back from all their franking \ncredits.\nHydrogen hope lost Another day, and another one of Andrew Forrest's hydrogen projects bites the dust.\nNews that Incitec Pivot has officially put the site of its mothballed Gibson Island ammonia plant on the market \nshould finally put a tombstone on the project that was for years supposed to be Fortescue's flagship Australian \ngreen ammonia play.\nNot that you'd know it from Fortescue's disclosures. The mining major put Gibson Island on the backburner 15 \nmonths ago citing high electricity costs. Despite missing multiple deadlines for the financial close on the multibillion-\ndollar project last year, Fortescue refused to admit that the horse was dead, telling the world it was still working to \nreduce costs.\nEven when Incitec flagged plans to sell the Brisbane site in November, Fortescue would only say it remained \ncommitted to green hydrogen but energy costs in Australia are too high, and it would never commit to a project that \nwasn't commercially viable, etc etc.\nAnd on Thursday the company still wasn't going any further, despite the sight of real estate agents spruiking the \nvalue of the land.\nPretty much everyone else involved has abandoned ship. Even the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which \nchipped in $13.7m of taxpayer cash into the $55m spent on feasibility studies. ARENA's website, as of this week, \nsays the project was completed on December 18.Page 3 of 3\nScott lives high life as Catch dies\nNo mention of the project's presumed abandonment in Fortescue's most recent quarterly production report, \nalthough iron ore boss Dino Otranto promised analysts \"a more comprehensive view\" of the status of its green \nenergy projects at Fortescue's half-year financial results in February last year.\nFortescue's own website still lists Gibson Island as a viable project, with commercial production planned for 2026.\nForrest himself was still banging the drum at Davos this month, telling Bloomberg he believes the dream is still \nalive, even after Fortescue sacked 700 people last year as it rationalised its energy and mining divisions.\n\"There is a new form of hydrogen, which will come onto the marketplace, which will be a lot cheaper,\" he said. \n\"We're not yet in a position where I want to talk about it publicly.\" We can't wait to hear about it.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Another of Twiggy's hydrogen projects bites the dust\nLoad-Date: January 30, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's Executive Chairman | \"There is a new form of hydrogen, which will come onto the marketplace, which will be a lot cheaper.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
