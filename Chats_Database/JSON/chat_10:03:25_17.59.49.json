It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nFortescue to slash 700 jobs\nFortescue to slash 700 jobs\nThe Advertiser (Australia)\nJuly 18, 2024 Thursday\nAdvertiser Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 5\nLength: 484 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nAndrew Forrest has launched a sweeping restructure at -Fortescue in the face of the company's failure to deliver \non its green energy promises, with as many as 700 jobs going.\nThe massive cutbacks come as Dr Forrest abandons the company's goal of producing 15 million tonnes of green -\nhydrogen a year by 2030.\nDr Forrest is understood to have addressed Fortescue staff on Wednesday afternoon, -flagging a major round of -\nredundancies - including the departure of more of the company's senior management. The concession that For-\ntescue cannot meet its green -hydrogen targets represents a major backdown by Dr Forrest, who only a few years \nago was boasting that the company's green energy ambitions would one day make it bigger than Saudi Energy \ngiant Aramco.\nIt comes after a swag of executive departures.\nThe sweeping changes include the departure of senior operational staff in Fortescue's iron ore division, including \nsenior mine managers, amid a widespread expectation that the company has failed to meet its annual production \ntargets.\nSources say the changes -affect far more than just the company's energy division, which has burned hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in examining potential green hydrogen and ammonia sites across the world, but has so far only \ndelivered three final investment decisions across the would-be green energy portfolio.\nThose three projects include a small hydrogen plant in Gladstone in Queensland, a second hydrogen project in \nArizona in the US, and a green iron commercial pilot plant in the Pilbara.\nAll three remain in For-tescue's development portfolio, along with a green ammonia -project in Norway and one in \nBrazil. The company is also still working on some earlier stage projects, such as a joint venture in Morocco.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue to slash 700 jobs\nBut a swag of others have been \"deprioritised\". Fortescue is effectively abandoning its green ammonia and energy \nprojects in Kenya, Argentina, Canada and the US state of Washington - where Dr Forrest had promised to replace \nformer coal-fired power plants with clean energy production.\nFortescue's failure to maintain the pace or exports at its flagship iron ore division is also understood to be at the \nheart of the sweeping changes, which will only add to the chaos that has engulfed the company over the past 18 \nmonths.\nA derailment on its main -Pilbara line over Christmas hit its export rates, as did heavy weather there in February. \nThe company is also still struggling to get its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project operating to anywhere close to \nfull capacity, and has -issued multiple downgrades to its expected output over the past year. Market analysts expect \nFortescue to miss its 192 million tonne export forecast when the company releases its June quarter production \nreport next week, with consensus expectations tipping the company to only barely break the 190 million tonne mark. \nFortescue shares closed down 1 per cent at $22.36 on Wednesday.\nLoad-Date: July 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
