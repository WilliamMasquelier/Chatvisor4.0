It now has to prove itself with its ambitious \\nplan to take its production level to 500,000 ounces of gold annually.\\nBut if it pulls it off, it will become the third-largest gold miner in Australia.\\nSo far it has impressed, with the once embattled Westgold Resources soaring in value from $300m to over $1bn \\nunder Mr Bramwell's leadership.\\nAnd one of the reasons it is interested is it believes Karora had been producing 170,000 ounces of gold, when it \\nshould have been producing about 200,000, as it had earlier forecast.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nDual listing the price Westgold has to pay for deal - DATA ROOM\\nGold miners are currently cashed-up on the back of the buoyant gold price. Now the question is whether Ramelius \\nResources pounces on Spartan Resources (formerly Gascoyne), which is said to be on its radar given the close \\nproximity of its assets to Spartan's.\\nYet the speculation has been around for a while and it is still to move, leaving some to think Ramelius sees \\nSpartan as over-priced for now.\\nAs gold mining consolidation continues apace, the other deal some believe will play out over the medium term is an \\nacquisition by Northern Star of the $2.5bn De Grey Mining.\\nNorthern Star's first priority is rebuilding the processing plant of the Super Pit gold mining asset that it owns, but \\nafter that attention will likely turn to De Grey.\\nThis is why many found its presence at Newcrest's Telfer mine and Havieron processing facility on a site visit in \\nrecent weeks curious.\\nNorthern Star sources say it has no interest in Telfer, but it's very close to De Grey's assets, so perhaps it was there \\nwhile on a De Grey site visit, determining whether gold could be processed there.\\nMeanwhile, the terms of Westgold's deal will see Karora shareholders receiving 2.524 Westgold shares and 68c \\ncash a.\\nThe offer represents about $6.60 per Karora share based on Westgold's closing share price on the ASX of $2.28 on \\nApril 5.\\nIt represents a 10.1 per cent premium to Karora's closing share price on the TSX of $5.99 ($C5.36) on April 5.\\nWestgold shareholders will own 50.1 per cent of the combined company. Westgold, advised by Argonaut and \\ncurrently producing about 220,000 ounces of gold from its underground and open pit mines in Western Australia, \\nsays the business is capable of producing 400,000 ounces of gold per annum from Western Australia assets and \\nestimates operating synergies of $209m and estimated corporate savings of $281m.

The second was offshore oil services stocks, which surged between 300 per cent \\nand 350 per cent in two-and-a-half years. But Piperoglou is confident that Collins St's latest bet will produce even \\nbetter returns than both those opportunities.\\n\\\"With gold stocks, the way the asymmetry is playing out currently, I think there is a greater potential in this than the \\nother two ... we're seeing the very early signs of the start of a gold bull market,\\\" Piperoglou says.\\n\\\"At some stage, investors are going to get smacked in the face ... there will be a moment within months, not years, \\nwhere people wake up and these quality small caps will multibag.\\\"\\nA multibagger is every investor's dream - a stock that at least doubles in value. And while the best chance of finding \\none is at the smaller end of the market, those companies also present the highest risk. But Piperoglou believes the \\nlocal gold sector is filled with potential multibaggers, and it's only a matter of time before the record gold price flows \\nthrough to miners.\\nThat is why Collins St has spent the past 12 months undertaking its own due diligence by speaking to management \\nand visiting operations to construct what Piperoglou describes as a portfolio of \\\"some of the best, well-run, well-\\ncapitalised, pre-production plays on the ASX\\\".\\nAmong gold sector small caps, the value fund holds Barton Gold, Brightstar Resources, Tesoro Gold, Great \\nBoulder Resources, Meeka Metals and Odyssey Gold. At the larger end of the market, it holds Ramelius \\nResources and West Gold Resources.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nTaking a shine to the gold diggers; MONDAY FUNDIE\\nIndeed, Collins St's $200 million value fund has a long track record of spotting winners, and regularly appears \\namong the best performers in Mercer's investment survey. It was the top-ranked Australian long-only strategy in the \\nfive years to December, returning 24 per cent per annum, and also boasted a podium finish on a three-year time \\nhorizon. Its strong run of form has continued over the past nine months, with the fund returning 18.6 per cent, net of \\nfees, in the financial year to date, beating the S&P/ASX 200's 7.6 per cent gain over the same period.\\nCollins St has also reopened its special situation fund, which is targeting the local and international small-cap gold \\nsector following strong demand from clients. The firm believes that miners in North America are also looking cheap, \\nparticularly small- and mid-cap companies in Canada and the US.\\nMuch of the value fund's recent performance has been fuelled by an 11 per cent return in December when two of its \\nkey holdings - Carnarvon Energy and Link Administration - rallied sharply. While Collins St doesn't typically engage \\nin shareholder activism, the firm played a key role in rolling the board at Carnarvon in December amid frustrations \\nover its handling of its major offshore gas project majority-owned by Santos.\\nCollins St teamed up with Nero Resources Fund to raid Carnarvon's share register and force the company to \\npledge it would not acquire new assets, would cut administrative costs and work with Santos to speed up drilling at \\nthe Dorado field in which Carnarvon is a minority owner. The stock rallied nearly 44 per cent in December.\\n\\\"Usually when we buy a new position, we have no intention of being activist because it's a lot easier to make money \\nbeing passive,\\\" Piperoglou says.\\n\\\"We were willing on that occasion to throw down the gauntlet of having a pretty public fight, but thankfully it was the \\nquickest coup - within 24 hours they basically resigned.\\\"\\nThe value fund also benefited from a 60 per cent surge in Link shares in December following a $1.2 billion buyout \\noffer from Japanese financial services company Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. The bid ended a rollercoaster ride \\nfor shareholders over the past three years, when four other suitors attempted takeovers.\\nThe disastrous acquisition of a British company in 2017 also dragged Link into the messy collapse of the $7 billion \\nWoodford investment fund, which triggered heavy losses and a complex exit involving the financial regulator. \\\"At \\ntimes when we do have a significant amount of cash because we don't see much opportunity on the long end, we \\nplayed what we thought at the time was a low\",\n    \"media_outlet\": \"Australian Financial Review\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"date\": \"2024-04-23\",\n    \"title\": \"ASX up as investors look to CPI\",\n    \"sentiment\": -3,\n    \"content\": \"Page 1 of 2\\nASX up as investors look to CPI\\nASX up as investors look to CPI\\nThe Australian\\nApril 24, 2024 Wednesday\\nAustralian Edition\\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\\nSection: MARKETWATCH; Pg. 17\\nLength: 547 words\\nByline: EQUITIES JACK QUAIL\\nBody\\nShares advanced on Tuesday as investors anticipated the release of key inflation data that could keep a Reserve \\nBank rate cut off the table anytime soon.\\nThe benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index rose 34.3 points, or 0.45 per cent, to 7683.5 points, while the broader All \\nOrdinaries rose a similar amount to 7937.9 points.\\nOf the 11 industry sectors, all finished in the green bar energy, materials and industrials.\\nAhead of the release of the inflation figures on Wednesday, EightCap market analyst Zoran Kresovic said traders \\nwould be closely watching for indications on the path of rate cuts.\\n\\\"The concern for the market is because inflation is running so high locally, unemployment is very low and wages \\ngrowth is substantial, we might not get interest rate cuts in Australia at all this year,\\\" Mr Kresovic said. \\\"If that is the \\ncase, then obviously the market will need to reprice itself.\\\" According to consensus forecasts, the consumer price \\nindex is expected to accelerate to 0.8 per cent in the March quarter, up from 0.6 per cent in December.\\nThis would take the headline inflation rate to 3.5 per cent in the year to March, down from an annual reading of 4.1 \\nper cent recorded in December.

The Fund performance compared to a 21% sterling return \\nregistered by the Gold Bugs Index and the GDXJ equity ETF. However, we anticipate that the lag in performance of \\nthe smaller equities held in the Fund will catch-up with larger peers given their relatively attractive valuations.\\nGold was one of the stronger commodities with the price rising over 9% during March to new all-time highs. Silver is \\nlatterly starting to catch-up, registering a 10% price increase over the month. Prices held despite a more hawkish \\nmove in US FED rate expectations after FOMC minutes indicated broader US labour markets were stubbornly \\nresilient despite relatively tepid economic growth. Increasingly there appears to be a focus on ever growing \\ngovernment debt levels which have shown little sign of reversing, as evidence by the latest US congression Budget \\nOffice projections.\\nRecent physical gold buying has been led by China, with a pick-up in retail demand showing in import data. This \\nhas been potentially driven by broader concerns on the economy, particularly the weak regional property sector. \\nAlongside this is the healthy net central bank demand: People's Bank of China (PBoC) data showed China's gold \\nreserves continued to rise with the addition of 0.39 Moz in February taking official reserves to 72.6Moz (+10% year-\\non-year). Physical gold ETF's showed a pick-up in buying but aggregate holdings nevertheless ended 246k ounces \\nlower over the month. We believe gold hitting all-time highs despite steady ETF selling is a positive, as would also \\nbe the case should ETF's turn steady buyers, further tightening the market.Page 3 of 4\\nMonthly Investor Report - March 2024\\nWest African Resources and Fortuna Gold and Silver were strong contributors to performance. This was closely \\nfollowed by Australian gold producer Karora which received bid interest from ASX-listed Ramelius, as well as \\nreports of a further interested party also in discussion with the company. While we do not focus our stock selection \\nspecifically on M&A targets, we believe quality undervalued assets should result in a higher probability of them \\nbecoming targets. The sector remains short of growth projects, and so we would anticipate a pick-up in M&A activity \\ngoing forward. This should help close the discounts of junior miners to the larger.

The Melbourne-based firm oversees \\nmore than $1 billion in assets.\\nThe global fund has returned 22.6 per cent so far this financial year. What has driven that performance? | The fund \\ninvests in several themes including gold, automation, decarbonisation, and emerging markets. Over the past three \\nmonths, performance has been led by investments in gold and decarbonisation.\\nThe largest contributor has been Australian gold miner Red 5, which has moved from developing an asset into \\ncommercial production. We've been a substantial shareholder since March 2021, and we have supported it through \\nthe development financing phase to its profitable production today.\\nJapanese company Hitachi has also added significant returns over the past two years. It's divested its legacy \\nconstruction machinery, chemicals, and metals businesses to focus on producing higher margin products with \\ngreater returns on capital, and with a higher propensity for cash flow generation. It has also sharpened its focus on \\nreturning cash to shareholders and growing dividends per share at a compound annual growth rate of 13.6 per cent \\nover the past five years.\\nHow much further do you expect the copper price to run and which stocks do you own? | We expect that copper \\ndemand will remain strong, with price upside driven by structural supply constraints.\\nWe like miners with strong leadership and proven records in creating shareholder returns and value low \\njurisdictional risk and higher-grade orebodies with expansion potential.\\nFor producing companies, we like Canadian miners Lundin Group and Capstone Copper.\\nAnother company we support is US-based mineral exploration company Ivanhoe Electric, which is developing the \\nSanta Cruz project and exploring for new major copper deposits in North America.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nThe stocks fuelling Victor Smorgon's 40pc returns Fundie Q&A\\nWe are also involved in BMC Minerals, which is developing one of the most exciting volcanogenic massive sulphide \\n(sources of copper, zinc, gold, silver) districts globally.\\nDo you expect the disconnect between gold prices and mining stocks to abate? Which stocks are best positioned? | \\nWe have noticed that a large majority of recent gold demand has come from BRICS nations, which are increasingly \\ntransacting with each other in their local currencies and settling the surplus with physical gold. This demand from \\nnon-Western buyers will continue to support the gold price.\\nWestern gold investors are preferring to invest in gold mining equities, and are less enthused by the gold bull \\nmarket, which has created this disconnect. If this trend continues, we believe it's more likely that gold equities will \\nreflect the gold price.\\nHistorically, the bottom of the cycle typically sees gold mining equities trade at a discount to the spot gold price and \\nhistoric average multiples. As the cycle peaks, analysts start to imply a forward price greater than spot, and a \\nmarket multiple above average.\\nAssuming the future rhymes with history, the greatest gains will be with smaller, higher-cost gold producers and \\nexplorers. For this reason, we like Ramelius Resources and Canada's Agnico Eagle.\\nWhat's a stock you're bullish on that investors might not have heard of? | Copper miner Metals Acquisition listed on \\nthe ASX this year after acquiring the NSW CSA copper mine in 2023. It's run by Mick McMullen, who has a track \\nrecord of turning around major mining companies globally.\\nWe believe the company's inception as a US-listed special purpose acquisition company and the capital structure \\ntied to its initial acquisition has turned many potential investors away. Additionally, CSA was previously owned by \\nGlencore, whose exit likely led people to perceive that the asset is of low quality.\\nHowever, we view Glencore's retained equity in Metals Acquisition as an endorsement of the asset and \\nacknowledgement that the business will improve under a focused management team. The company has recently \\ntaken several steps to simplify and improve its balance sheet which we also see as accretive.\\nWhat's a stock you'd like to own but can't (for whatever reason)? | Semiconductors are a critical resource of the \\nmodern world.

Auric's latest 822m campaign followed up on a \\nsignificant historic drillhole by Tychean that returned 25m grading 1.67g/t gold from just 44m.\\n'The Fugitive Prospect is midway between two prominent, high-grade gold deposits; Wattle Dam and Spargos \\nReward at Spargoville.'\\nAuric Mining managing director Mark English\\nThe prospect sits in a good neighbourhood with the 185,000-ounce Spargos Reward gold deposit just 8km to the \\nnorth and the 266,000-ounce Wattle Dam gold deposit only 8km to the south-east.\\nAuric Mining managing director Mark English said: \\\"The Fugitive Prospect is midway between two prominent, high-\\ngrade gold deposits; Wattle Dam and Spargos Reward at Spargoville. Our first-pass drilling has highlighted \\nsimilarities with both deposits. We're looking forward to the next phase when we will get the opportunity to test that \\nmodel.\\\"\\nThe company already has plans for air-core (AC) drilling towards the centre of the Fugitive target to infill the current \\n100m spacing in the area. A follow-up RC campaign is also being planned beneath the historic and latest drillholes \\nPage 2 of 2\\nAuric to home in on intriguing gold target in WA Goldfields\\nto target the mineralised zone in fresh rock at about 75m to 100m below surface - similar to where high grades \\noccur at the nearby Wattle Dam deposit.\\nJust last week, Auric netted nearly $4.46 million in gross revenue from its first mining campaign of the year at its \\nJeffreys Find project in the Goldfields after selling 1256 gold ounces to the Perth Mint. As part of its latest mining \\nprogram, more than 30,000 dry metric tonnes were processed for its joint venture (JV) partner BML Ventures at a \\nreconciled head grade of 1.44g/t at the Greenfields Mill in Coolgardie.\\nThe partnership produced more than 9740 ounces during two mining campaigns last year, returning a total gold \\nrevenue of $29.28 million.\\nAuric plans to put its surplus cash to work by continuing with the development of its nearby Munda gold deposit, \\nalongside broader exploration. That now appears likely to include follow-up drilling at Spargoville, with results from \\nthe company's latest campaign at the Fugitive prospect delivering several promising new targets.\\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

            "content": "The positive sentiment peak for Ramelius Resources between April 24 and June 3, 2024, was primarily driven by strong gold production results, favorable market conditions, and positive analyst endorsements. A key catalyst was Ramelius' record-breaking gold production, which saw its stock price surge by 9.67% on April 2 (AAP Newsfeed, 2024-04-02). This was further reinforced by a broader rally in gold prices, which reached all-time highs, benefiting gold miners like Ramelius (The Australian, 2024-04-03). Additionally, investment firms such as Tribeca and Victor Smorgon Group highlighted Ramelius as an undervalued stock with strong growth potential, citing its strategic acquisitions and operational efficiency (Australian Financial Review, 2024-04-04; Australian Financial Review, 2024-05-30). The company's stock also rebounded by 5.11% on May 30, following a period of volatility, as investors regained confidence in its long-term prospects (Investing, 2024-05-30). These factors collectively contributed to the positive sentiment surrounding Ramelius Resources during this period.",
