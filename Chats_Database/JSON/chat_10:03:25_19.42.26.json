The orders allowed it to carry out surprise \nraids on the houses of Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen to seize millions of files for their case off the back of \nwhat the Element Zero personnel described as \"unprecedented\" surveillance.\nMr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk challenged the initial decision to grant Fortescue the search orders. Federal \nCourt judge Brigitte Markovic dismissed their application.\nA Fortescue spokesman reiterated a previous statement. \"Fortescue will vigorously defend Element Zero's \nattempt to have the decision of the court overturned,\" he said. Now, the Element Zero team has lodged an appeal \nagainst Justice Markovic's decision to allow the search orders. She had found Fortescue failed to inform the \nprimary judge about a series of meetings involving the two companies and a nondisclosure agreement signed by Mr \nMasterman.\nLoad-Date: November 27, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Michael Masterman | Ex-Fortescue executive | \"Element Zero's personnel described as 'unprecedented' surveillance.\" | N.A. |\n| Bart Kolodziejczyk | Ex-Fortescue executive | \"Element Zero's personnel described as 'unprecedented' surveillance.\" | N.A. |\n| Bjorn Winther-Jensen | Ex-Fortescue executive | \"Element Zero's personnel described as 'unprecedented' surveillance.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
