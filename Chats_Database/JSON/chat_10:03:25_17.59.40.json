It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nFortescue names exec to drive unit\nFortescue names exec to drive unit\nThe Australian\nNovember 19, 2024 Tuesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKETWATCH; Pg. 23\nLength: 493 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nFortescue has appointed a new chief executive to run what was known as Williams Advanced Engineering in the \nlatest leadership shake-up in the company's green energy division.\nEllie Coates will be in the driver's seat at Fortescue Zero Power Systems, a business that started life as an \noffshoot of the Williams F1 racing team and was acquired for $US222m in 2022.\nShe will become the third chief executive at the UK-based business in the past six months and steps into the role \npost a major Fortescue reset that saw the company slash 700 jobs and slow its push into green hydrogen. The \nbusiness is tasked with adapting the technology applied in racing electric cars in Formula E to moving big volumes \nof iron ore using haul trucks under Fortescue's goal to eradicate greenhouse gas emissions in its mining \noperations.\nFortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest doubled down on his commitment to stop using diesel in the \ncompany's mining operation by 2030 at the weekend by backing a proposed fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty. Ms \nCoates will report to Fortescue energy boss Mark Hutchinson, who stepped in to run Fortescue Zero after the \nsudden departure of Judith Judson in June.\nA separate business within the energy division - Fortescue Zero Hydrogen Systems - is run by Cameron Smith, \nwho also reports to Mr Hutchinson.\nThe work done by Fortescue Zero Power Systems is integral to Fortescue's $US2.8bn ($4.3bn) partnership with \nEurope-based Liebherr to jointly develop zero emission mining machinery -solutions.\nFortescue expects to purchase about 360 autonomous battery electric trucks, 55 electric excavators and 60 battery \npowered dozers under the deal.\nLiebherr's role is to provide the chassis while the battery power systems will be supplied by Fortescue Zero.\nMs Coates, previously Fortescue's executive director of strategy and innovation, will move from Perth to the UK in \nher new role.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue names exec to drive unit\nA Fortescue spokesman said Mr Hutchinson would remain chief executive of the Fortescue energy division.\nThe $US2.8bn figure on the Liebherr partnership represents the cost to the Fortescue mining division of buying \ntrucks and other machinery.\nMr Hutchinson recently told analysts Fortescue Zero would capture some of the revenue from the sales. \"We just \nhave to remember that a big part of that flows back to Fortescue Zero because a big part of the trucks is the power \nsystem,\" he said.\nMs Judson was appointed chief executive of Fortescue Zero in 2023 as it opened two new -facilities in the UK and \nforeshadowed a recruitment drive. She lasted less than a year before returning to her home in the US.\nFortescue has budgeted $US6.2bn to achieve a switch to renewable energy to decarbonise its iron ore operations \nby 2030. Dr Forrest described the company as one of Australia's biggest greenhouse gas polluters at the weekend, \nbut said it could convert the burning of one billion litres of diesel equivalent a year into \"long-term profitable green \nenergy assets\" by 2030.\nLoad-Date: November 29, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
