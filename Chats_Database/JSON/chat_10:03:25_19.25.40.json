Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 19\nLength: 623 words\nByline: Brad Thompson and Elouise Fowler\nBody\nWest Australian premier Roger Cook has backed unions seeking to re-establish themselves in the Pilbara iron ore \nindustry despite warnings from the nation's biggest miners about risks to productivity and their ability to remain cost-\ncompetitive.\n\"The Cook government supports WA workers and their unions undertaking collective bargaining with employers for \nbetter pay and conditions,\" a spokesman for Mr Cook said.\n\"Unions play an important role in our society representing workers in a diverse range of industries, including the \nmining and resources sector.\"\nIron ore royalties generated from largely union-free mines are the backbone of the WA economy, most flowing from \nRio and BHP. Both companies sounded alarm over the Albanese government's industrial relations changes that \nhave allowed unions to force BHP to the negotiating table on a collective bargaining agreement.\nWA has already forecast iron ore royalties will fall by more than 35 per cent, or $3.5 billion, in 2024-25. The forecast \nis based on the iron ore price falling to $US71 a tonne amid concerns about the strength of the Chinese economy \nand its real estate market.\nThe Cook government said the new bargaining provisions in the Fair Work Act were the responsibility of the \nAlbanese government.\nUnder these new rules, unions no longer need to demonstrate that the majority of the workforce supports collective \nbargaining, as long as an agreement is within five years of expiring.\nThis has opened up terrain for the Australian Workers' Union to pounce, forcing BHP back to the negotiating table \nto start bargaining on wages and conditions at the Mining Area C and South Flank mines. BHP's last agreement on \nthis site expired in August 2019.\nThis is the last agreement covering iron ore mines that can be triggered by federal Labor's new provisions, The \nAustralian Financial Review understands. Unlike BHP, Rio is not compelled to negotiate with unions because its \nPage 2 of 2\nWA premier backs union drive for membership in Pilbara mines\nenterprise agreements expired before 2019. Fortescue has not struck a collective agreement in more than a \ndecade.\nStill, the big miners fear a return to the strike-prone Pilbara of the 1980s if unions re-establish themselves in an \nindustry already grappling with softening prices for the steel-making ingredient and emerging competition from \nAfrica, including the Rio-backed Simandou project.\nThe Chamber of Mining and Energy WA, whose members include Rio Tinto, BHP, Fortescue Limited and Gina \nRinehart's Roy Hill, said unionisation of the Pilbara had the potential to increase costs and lower productivity.\n\"While we are fortunate to have a world-class resources industry, we also know Australia is a relatively high-cost \njurisdiction,\" CMEWA chief executive Rebecca Tomkinson said.\n\"Any levers that could further increase operational costs and uncertainty will jeopardise our investment \nattractiveness and need to be carefully considered by all parties.\"\nUnions are known to have targeted BHP and Rio as part of recent recruitment drives with limited success.\nUnion members made up just 10 per cent of the mining workforce in 2022, down from 16.5 per cent in 2016, \naccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Union membership on mine sites was 44 per cent in 1994. \nFortescue is understood to be the least unionised of the three biggest miners.\nAsked if it was concerned about unions gaining a foothold in the Pilbara, Fortescue said workers already received \nsome of the highest wages in the country together with other favourable terms and conditions.\nBHP said on Sunday it had been forced to bargain with unions under the new legislation, which does not require the \nunions to establish that the workforce is in favour of bargaining.\nRio has declined to comment on union demands that it come to the negotiating table.\nLoad-Date: August 15, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Roger Cook | WA Premier | \"The Cook government supports WA workers and their unions undertaking collective bargaining with employers for better pay and conditions.\" | N.A. |\n| Rebecca Tomkinson | CMEWA Chief Executive | \"Any levers that could further increase operational costs and uncertainty will jeopardise our investment attractiveness and need to be carefully considered by all parties.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
