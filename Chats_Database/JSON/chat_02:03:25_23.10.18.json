Mr Andersen \nsaid: \"2023 was a challenging year for \u00d8rsted. We have learned from the challenges and today, we are announcing \na robust business plan with revised strategic growth ambitions for 2030.\"\nIn total, \u00d8rsted has written off \u00a33.3bn from its wind farm business.\nIt comes as Siemens Energy, which produces turbines for many UK wind farms, swung to a (EURO)1.58bn \n(\u00a31.35bn) profit in its first quarter thanks to a one-off gain relating to the sale of an Indian subsidiary to its parent \nSiemens for \u00a31.8bn.\nThe German company is still reeling from cash struggles partly caused by quality issues affecting some of its \nonshore wind turbines.\nThis led to the business being forced to seek a financial guarantee from the German government last year.\nSiemens Energy has become a vital part of the UK wind industry, owning a turbine blade factory in Hull that \nemploys 1,200 people. Overall, the company employs 6,000 people in the UK.\nThe company has other profitable divisions, including producing tech for gas generation and power grids.\nHowever, its business has struggled in the past year as a result of its troubled wind division, as faults in its 4X and \n5X onshore wind turbine models led to them being taken off the market.\nLoad-Date: February 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Mads Nipper | Chief Executive of \u00d8rsted | \"Despite a year with strong underlying business progress, 2023 marked a year with substantial challenges for \u00d8rsted.\" | N.A. |\n| Thomas Thune Andersen | Chairman of \u00d8rsted | \"2023 was a challenging year for \u00d8rsted.
