It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nFortescue to slash up to 700 jobs in green retreat\nFortescue to slash up to 700 jobs in green retreat\nThe Australian\nJuly 18, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 15\nLength: 767 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nAndrew Forrest has launched a sweeping restructure at For-tescue in the face of the company's failure to deliver on \nits green energy promises, with as many as 700 jobs going in the massive cutbacks after Dr Forrest abandoned the \ncompany's goal of producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030.\nDr Forrest is understood to have addressed Fortescue staff on Wednesday afternoon, flagging a major round of \nredundancies - including the departure of more of the company's senior management.\nThe concession that For-tescue cannot meet its green -hydrogen targets represents a major backdown by Dr \nForrest, who only a few years ago was boasting that the company's green energy ambitions would one day make it \nbigger than Saudi Energy giant Aramco.\nThe move also punches a hole in the Albanese government's $8bn cash splash for hydrogen production with Labor \noffering lucrative production tax credits in a bid to turbocharge the fledgling sector.\nThe sweeping changes include the departure of senior operational staff in Fortescue's iron ore division, including \nsenior mine managers, amid a widespread expectation that the company has failed to meet its annual production \ntargets.\nSources say the changes affect far more than just the company's energy division, which has burned hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in examining potential green hydrogen and ammonia sites across the world, but has so far only \ndelivered three final investment decisions across the would-be green energy portfolio.\nThose three projects include a small hydrogen plant in Gladstone in Queensland, a second hydrogen project in \nArizona in the US, and a green iron commercial pilot plant in the Pilbara.\nAll three remain in For-tescue's development portfolio, along with a green ammonia -project in Norway and one in \nBrazil. The company is also still working on some earlier-stage projects, such as a joint venture in Morocco.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue to slash up to 700 jobs in green retreat\nBut a swag of others have been \"deprioritised\". Fortescue is effectively abandoning its green ammonia and energy \nprojects in Kenya, Argentina, Canada and the US state of Washington - where Dr Forrest had promised to replace \nformer coal-fired power plants with clean energy production.\nFortescue's failure to maintain the pace or exports at its flagship iron ore division is also understood to be at the \nheart of the sweeping changes, which will only add to the chaos that has engulfed the company over the past 18 \nmonths.\nA derailment on its main Pilbara line over Christmas hit its export rates, as did heavy weather in the Pilbara in \nFebruary. The company is also still struggling to get its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project operating to \nanywhere close to full capacity, and has -issued multiple downgrades to its expected output over the past year. \nMarket analysts expect Fortescue to miss its 192 million tonne export guidance when the company releases its \nJune quarter production report next week, with consensus expectations tipping the company to only barely break \nthe 190 million tonne mark.\nThe move comes amid signs of a further slowing in Chinese steel demand, which is expected to drive down iron ore \nprices, with lower-grade ores - such as those exported by Fortescue - seen as likely to suffer the biggest falls in the \nmedium term.\nRio Tinto noted in its June quarter production report on Tuesday that the price differential between ore grades had \nwidened in the June period.\nIn a late market announcement on Wednesday, Fortescue said it had appointed acting chief financial officer Apple \nPaget to the role on a permanent basis, and moved chief corporate officer Shelley Robertson to the position of chief \noperating officer.\nFortescue said it remained \"resolute in its commitment to be the world's leading green technology, energy and \nmetals company with a laser focus on achieving Real Zero by 2030\". The company said it had \"undergone a period \nof rapid growth and transition, and as part of bringing together Metals and Energy into One For-tescue, initiatives \nare being imple-mented to simplify its structure, remove duplication and deliver cost efficiencies.\n\"The company must continually evolve to ensure it remains lean, is best positioned to deliver on its strategy and \ngenerate the maximum value for shareholders,\" it said.\nFortescue shares closed down 23c at $22.36 on Wednesday.\nFortescue changes   700 jobs to go across global operations   Redundancies to be finalised this month   \nStreamlined executive team, comprising nearly 50% women   Apple Paget is the new chief financial officer   Shelley \nRobertson is the new chief operating officer   Navdeep Gill is the new company secretary\nLoad-Date: July 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
