Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Mark Hutchison | Energy CEO | \"we are realistic about the pace of the current global energy transition\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchison | Energy CEO | \"financial discipline always comes first\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman | \"It is the responsibility of every company to join us in moving to a world that is no longer reliant on fossil fuels\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman | \"the group's emissions in FY24 were around 10 per cent less than forecast\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
