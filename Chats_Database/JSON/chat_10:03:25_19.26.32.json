Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 510 words\nHighlight: Weeks ago Fortescue dumped a target to be a major producer of green hydrogen by 2030, but Andrew \nForrest still insists his native Pilbara can supply the globe with green iron.\nBody\nJust weeks ago Fortescue shed 700 workers and dumped a target to be a major producer of green hydrogen by \n2030, but the miner's billionaire owner Andrew Forrest still insists his native Pilbara can supply the globe with green \niron.\nStraight from a dinner in China the night before, the company founder pointed to the red dirt at his feet at \nFortescue's Cloudbreak mine, said, \"this is rich iron,\" then turned his hand up to the blue sky and said, \"and that is \nenergy.\"\nLink to Image\nPeter Milne\nThe simple proposition of combining ample raw material and energy occurring in the same place will succeed or fail \non practicalities.\nWhen questioned about whether he is overly ambitious, Forrest always has the justified retort that many doubted if \nthen tiny Fortescue could break the BHP-Rio Tinto duopoly and become the third force in Pilbara iron ore mining.\nFortescue's $53 billion market capitalisation is proof he got it right, but Forrest's next challenge is tougher.\nHis first success, in iron ore, was as a late entrant into an existing business. This time he wants to be one of the first \nmovers into a sector that hardly exists outside the laboratory.\nSteelmaking produces by some counts 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Most of it is made from \niron ore - a mix of iron and oxygen - in huge integrated steel plants.\nFirst the oxygen is removed in a process called reduction, using coal for heat and to aid the chemical reaction. The \nresult is iron, and an enormous amount of carbon pollution. Next the iron is refined and turned into steel.\nForrest wants the first, most polluting part of the process, to be done in the Pilbara and to ship the zero-emissions \ngreen iron to the world.\nPage 2 of 2\nAndrew Forrest isn't giving up on his green iron Pilbara dream\nOn Friday he turned the first sod on what in 12 months' time is to be a $75 million electric smelting furnace to test \ndifferent ways of producing 1500 tonnes of green iron a year.\nRight now it is a flattened piece of dirt, but Fortescue was keen to show progress elsewhere. Zero-emissions iron \nneeds zero-emissions iron ore, and Fortescue is aiming for its mining to be fossil-fuel free by 2030.\nThat will require more than two gigawatts of solar and wind generation and massive battery storage to provide \nreliable power - enough for about a million homes, the company said.\nFortescue said the plant would use green hydrogen from one of the company's facilities, as well as an electric \nsmelting furnace.\nThe project milestone follows Fortescue's announcement last month that it would cut 700 jobs and merge its \nmining and energy divisions, as it also tempered its ambition to be a major producer of the clean fuel hydrogen.\nForrest has maintained he is committed to green hydrogen, and on Friday, West Australian Premier Roger Cook \nsaid hydrogen had an important role to play in remote areas such as mine sites.\n\"WA is on its way to becoming a global clean energy powerhouse, and a major producer, user and exporter of \ngreen iron,\" Cook said.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.
