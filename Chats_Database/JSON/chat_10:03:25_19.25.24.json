Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue executive chairman | \"Neither I or any other member of the Fortescue board had any knowledge of the lengths taken by Fortescue's investigators to spy on its former employees.\" | N.A. |\n| Phil McKeiver | Senior internal Fortescue lawyer | \"We were able to get a close internal view of the facility using a minute covert camera during the surveillance period.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke SC | Fortescue lawyer | \"I'd seek to cross-examine Mr Masterman and Mr Williams, about their so called privacy concerns.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
