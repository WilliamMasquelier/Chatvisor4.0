Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Rasmus Errboe | Group President and CEO of Orsted | \"Errboe ist seit 2012 bei Orsted t\u00e4tig und geh\u00f6rt seit 2022 dem F\u00fchrungsteam an.\" | \"Errboe has been with Orsted since 2012 and has been part of the leadership team since 2022.\" |\n| Mads Nipper | Former CEO of Orsted | \"Mads Nipper gibt seine Position zum 1. Februar ab.\" | \"Mads Nipper will leave his position on February 1.\" |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Orsted.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Orsted or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
