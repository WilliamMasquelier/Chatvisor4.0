It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nShark's frantic bid to bring newborn home\nShark's frantic bid to bring newborn home\nThe Daily Telegraph (Australia)\nOctober 17, 2024 Thursday\nTelegraph Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 11\nLength: 503 words\nByline: David Riccio\nBody\nNRL player's son in ICU after premature birth in Bali NRL player Jesse Ramien and his fiancee Shell have made an \nimpassioned plea for help from the Australian Government after their baby needed to be resuscitated for five \nminutes after being born six weeks premature at a Bali hospital.\n\"It's been as scary as any parent could imagine,\" Ramien said. The harrowing experience has led to a distraught \nRamien contacting the Australian Embassy in Indonesia in a desperate attempt to source a care flight for their \nmedically-induced baby boy Teo back to Australia at an estimated cost of $130,000.\nA GoFundMe page has been set up by Ramien's friend Shavaun Hunt, the partner of Cronulla teammate Royce \nHunt, to help fund the costs of getting the family back to Australia.\nBoth Shell and Ramien are yet to hold their newborn for fear of infection and have been left to view him in his \nincubator during two two-hour visiting slots during the morning and afternoon at the Siloam Hospital in Bali.\nRamien is so desperate to help his son, the Sharks centre said: \"I'll play for nothing just to get our baby boy home \nsafely.\n\"There's just so much uncertainty here.\n\"We've been told by doctors it could be four weeks before our baby is okay to travel, but that could quickly change \nto five, six, or seven weeks, who knows.\n\"We're doing everything to contact the Australian Embassy to see how we can get home both as quickly as \npossible, so that our boy can get the medical attention he needs.\" Cronulla CEO Dino Mezzatesta and the NRL are \nalso working closely with Australian consulate officials to fast track the process.\nShell was 33 weeks pregnant when they left Sydney for Cronulla player Briton Nikora's wedding and was cleared \nby her obstetrician, as well as the airline and travel insurance cover for her pregnancy.\nThe ordeal unfolded when Shell went into early labour last Friday and needed an emergency C-section.\nPage 2 of 2\nShark's frantic bid to bring newborn home\n\"That was so worrying being in another hospital in another country,\" Ramien said.\n\"I wasn't allowed into the room to be with Shell. It was difficult, especially for Shell.\" During this time, Shell had to \nbe put under anaesthesia, with doctors then needing to revive their newborn son for five minutes until he started \nbreathing, when he was born just after 11pm.\nHe was immediately rushed to the intensive care unit where he remains under close watch with the new parents \nunable to see their boy until 9am the following morning.\n\"It's been really hard to get some answers, because as every parent knows, you just want the best care for your \nbaby, it's certainly been scary for Shell,\" Ramien said.\n\"The unfamiliarity of the medical system here and that ability to communicate our concerns in Bali only adds to the \nstress and emotion.\" NRL players Nicho Hynes, Blayke Brailey, Braden Hamlin-Uele, Connor Tracey, Hame Sele, \nSitili Tupouniua and former player Denan Kemp have already donated to the Go Fund Me page. \"We can't thank \neveryone for their care and generosity, we just want to see our baby home safely,\" Ramien said.\nLoad-Date: October 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
