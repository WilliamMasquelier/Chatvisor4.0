Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 28\nLength: 729 words\nByline: Anthony Macdonald\nBody\nAs our two biggest iron ore exporters dress themselves up as future-facing copper companies, third force \nFortescue has nowhere to hide. In fact, it does not even want to.\nFortescue's future is firmly Pilbara iron ore. It will spend $US4 billion ($5.9 billion) this year developing hubs and \nmines, exploration and trying to decarbonise its operations, mostly focused on iron ore. Energy - the hydrogen part - \nis slated to get only $US500 million of it.\nThat's not to say Fortescue wants to keep doing what it has always done. It knows China is changing - as is what it \nwants from Australia and the miners that sell it 1 billion tonnes of red dirt a year.\nFor 60 years, China has bought that red dirt and burnt it with metallurgical coal (mostly from Queensland) to make \nsteel. It got more hungry as its property and infrastructure construction stepped up, sending the price of iron ore to \nmore than $US100 a tonne, where it has mostly stayed.\nBut China's growth has slowed, including in the all-important property sector, its steel mills have dropped production \nand even bulls such as Fortescue co-CEO Dino Otranto see the difference.\n\"We're in the middle of China changing,\" he says.\nWhat China wants, Otranto says, is higher grade and cleaner products to help decarbonise its own industries, \nincluding those steel mills. There are ongoing talks about how this will play out inside China and Fortescue is trying \nto deal itself into the discussions; executive chairman Andrew Forrest was in China for such talks yesterday and \nOtranto will be there next week, he says.\nFortescue's plan is to sell China what it is calling \"green metal\" - made in Australia, using that same red dirt from \nthe Pilbara. It would dig up the dirt, and use hydrogen (not coal) to make a product that looks like a granule and \nexport it to China (via its railway and port infrastructure).\nThe steelmaking bit would still happen in China - that is important - but without the need to burn coal, and without \nthe pollution that would usually spill into the air and hang over major cities including Beijing and Shanghai.\nPage 2 of 2\nAustralia's iron ore future is different, not dead\n\"Up until now, it hasn't been economic to do it,\" Otranto says. \"We are on a mission to make it economic.\"\nTo make it economic, Fortescue probably needs China's (and Australia's) help. It would need Chinese equipment, \ncapital and skills at its production sites, the first of which is a small green energy hub at its Christmas Creek mine in \nthe Pilbara. Fortescue hopes it can produce 1500 tonnes of green iron metal a year with first production in 2025.\nTo get from there to 100 million tonnes or even the whole 191.6 million tonnes shipped in FY24 would be a huge \ntask, requiring huge investment. It cannot happen overnight. There are plenty of sceptics - as there have always \nbeen around Fortescue's ambitious plans - as Otranto acknowledges. \"Some of the sceptics still say it is not \neconomic and 'you're wasting your time'. We don't agree with that.\"\nTo make it work, Otranto says Fortescue (and Australia) need to attract China's capital, which is looking to replace \nthe big blast furnaces that have burnt Australia's iron ore and coal to make steel. He says that money is making its \nway into Brazilian, African and Saudi technology. \"That's why we need to muscle our way back in and say 'no, our \nores have a future',\" he says.\nThe key to it all is bringing the capital cost down - which in Saudi Arabia, for example, means concessions, \napprovals for land access and the like. Otranto says the Australian government needs to think similarly here - China \nhas always wanted our commodities, and the next ones are sun and wind.\nIt's interesting to hear Otranto talk so passionately about it on results day. Our three big miners are dealing with \nChina's slowdown in different ways, with BHP and Rio Tinto spending a lot of time talking up electrification and their \ncopper portfolios. The word \"copper\" appeared 78 times in BHP's results presentation on Tuesday, as James \nThomson wrote, while \"iron ore\" featured just 14 times.\nCopper does not get a mention at all at Fortescue. Its buzzword is \"green\" - which can be green metal, green \nhydrogen, green energy and even \"green pioneer\".\nFortescue shares dropped 1 per cent to $18.44 on Wednesday, following its result. UBS said earnings fell slightly \nshort of expectations, but the 89\u00a2 a share final dividend was better than expected.\nANTHONY MACDONALD\nLoad-Date: August 31, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
