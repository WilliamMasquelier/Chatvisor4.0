However, \n45V, in its current form, is a straitjacket on the industry and works against the Biden administration's own climate \ngoals,\" he said. Dr Forrest said the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act was helping the US make serious \nstrides towards decarbonising its economy, but said the proposed rules were \"fine print shoved into the IRA \nlegislation to do everything it can to kill off what is the saviour in energy for humanity and every organic life on \nEarth\".\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest slams US hydrogen regime\n\"You deserve much better than faceless people wandering around with chequebooks full of lobbying money, putting \nin a landmine into the law which is getting green hydrogen off the ground,\" he said.\n\"That landmine is put in by fossil fuel lobbyists - they masquerade as environmentalists and I can tell you they're \nnot, I can tell you that they're paid for by the fossil fuel sector.\" Fortescue ticked off on the development of the \nArizona hydrogen project late last year. The company plans to spend $US550m ($837m) building a plant capable of \nproducing 11,000 tonnes of liquid hydrogen a year for sale to the heavy transport -industry.\nScheduled to begin production in 2026, Fortescue has said the plant will be supplied by utility Arizona Public \nService with \"new sources of wind and solar generation under its regulated extra high load factor tariff, together with \ngreen attributes under its Green Power Partners program\".\nThe Arizona grid was still dominated by fossil fuel generation in 2022, however, according to the US Energy \nInformation Administration.\nAbout 42 per cent of the state's net energy generation came from natural gas plants, with 12 per cent from coal-\nfired power stations. Another 29 per cent came from nuclear generation, and 16 per cent coming from solar, wind \nand hydro-electric sources. Fortescue shares closed up 9c to $25.66 on Friday.\nLoad-Date: May 3, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
