The site has since been destroyed.\nThe accuracy of that estimate was challenged by the archaeologist enlisted by Fortescue, Doug Williams, who \ndescribed it as \"highly speculative\".\nAll three archaeologists, however, agreed the sites pointed to human habitation in the area since at least 42,500 \nyears ago.\nThe scientific significance of the various sites are being considered by the court as it weighs up what if any \ncompensation Fortescue owes the Yindjibarndi for the mining it has carried out on land over which the Yindjibarndi \nholds Native Title rights.\nAlso admitted as evidence this week was a joint report signed by economics consultant Murray Meaton and PwC \npartner Campbell Jaski - engaged respectively by Yindjibarndi and Fortescue - examining the calculation of -\npotential royalty-based compensation. Those experts considered royalties of between 1 per cent and 0.55 per cent, \nwhich if ultimately found by the court would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the -Yindjibarndi.\nThe Solomon hub has to date exported around $50bn of iron ore since 2013 and is expected to continue operating \nfor decades.\nPage 2 of 2\n'Oldest' Pilbara Aboriginal site destroyed\nFortescue was granted approval to damage or destroy 249 sites across the area under Western Australia's \nAboriginal Heritage Act, the same legislation that gave Rio Tinto the legal authority to destroy the Juukan Gorge \nrockshelters in 2019.\nExcavations at the Juukan Gorge rockshelters before their destruction had found charcoal and other artefacts that \nsuggested they had been inhabited as long as almost 43,000 years ago.\nIn their report, Professor Veth and Dr Bird said there were five rock-shelter sites within Solomon \"which by virtue of \ntheir great age and repeated occupation through time are, in our opinion, based on our study, training and \nexperience as archaeologists, of national significance\".\nThose sites included TRYINPAD13-03.\nThe pair was critical of how -little information from the -excavation works at Solomon had been made available \npublicly, given the wider cultural, public and research value of the sites.\n\"There appears to be a lack of dissemination and publication of excavation site reports for early Aboriginal \noccupation and use of the [Solomon hub]. It is not clear why this information has not been disseminated for wider \nheritage management and significance assessment both in the Pilbara and the wider Australian arid zone,\" they \nsaid.\nMr Williams, who among other roles is the ACT Heritage Council's expert for archaeology, said Professor Veth and \nDr Bird had relied on a \"relatively uncritical analysis\" of the estimated dates for the sites.\nHe said the estimate for TRYINPAD 13-03 was based on just 22 recovered artefacts and there were indications \nthere had been mixing of the deposit over time.\nA spokeswoman for Fortescue said the company was committed to seeing this matter settled \"so all Yindjibarndi \npeople can benefit\".\nBusiness P15\nLoad-Date: October 20, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
