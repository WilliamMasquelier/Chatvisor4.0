Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Kate Chaney | Teal independent MP | \"This will stay on the agenda... it creates headwinds for decarbonisation that we can't afford to have when we need to make sure Australia doesn't get left behind.\" | N.A. |\n| Allegra Spender | Wentworth MP | \"I know that Kate is passionate about this, and so am I. We need to have long-term reform in the tax system and the diesel fuel rebate is an example of that.\" | N.A. |\n| David Pocock | Independent ACT senator | \"It is locking in the use of diesel because if you stop using diesel, you stop getting the fuel tax credits. Let's reshape it and tie it to decarbonisation.\" | N.A. |\n| Madeleine King | Federal Resources Minister | \"We are not changing the diesel fuel rebate. Farmers and miners get the rebate for vehicles that only operate on private roads that are not funded by the taxpayer.\" | N.A. |\n| Tania Constable | Chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia | \"We already have effective mechanisms to reduce emissions; tinkering with our tax system won't help us achieve these goals.\" | N.A. |\n| Zali Steggall | Teal independent member for Warringah | \"Miners should not receive them at all, regardless of whether they were tied to decarbonisation efforts.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
