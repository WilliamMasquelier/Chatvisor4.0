Now they are leading the retreat.\nBody\nBP and Shell led Big Oil's push into renewable energy. Now they are leading the retreat.\nLast week BP announced that it had sold its offshore wind assets into a joint venture with Japan's JERA, itself a \njoint venture between Tokyo Electric Power and Chubu Electric Power, to create one of the world's largest offshore \nwind businesses.\nThat followed an earlier BP announcement, in September, that it planned to sell its US onshore wind farms.\nUnder former chief executive, Bernard Looney, BP had been building its wind farm portfolio as part of an ambitious \nstrategy to cut its hydrocarbon production by 40 per cent by 2030, reduce its emissions and those of its customers \nby 35 to 40 per cent by the end of this decade and become a \"net zero\"-emissions company by 2050.\nLast year it started backing away from those commitments, saying it would cut production by only 25 per cent by \n2030 and its emissions by 20 to 30 per cent.\nThis year, under a new chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, it now appears even those reduced targets are being \nwound back.\nIt's not just BP.\nShell has scaled back its investment in renewables, including offshore wind and hydrogen; it has reduced its \nemissions' intensity targets and it has abandoned its objective of becoming the world's largest electricity company. \nNorway's energy giant, Equinor, has also announced plans to shrink its renewable energy division.\nAs they retreat from their push into renewable energy and downgrade their ambitions to build major exposures to \nelectricity generation, the UK and European oil companies are refocusing on their traditional oil and gas \nbusinesses.\nWhere previously they planned to cap or reduce their production, now they are planning and investing to increase it.\nPage 2 of 3\nBig Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare\nLast year BP raised its forecast of oil equivalent production from 1.5 billion barrels a day by 2030 to 2 million \nbarrels a day, planning to invest $US8 billion ($12.6 billion) more than previously budgeted on new oil and gas \ninvestments. Since Auchincloss became CEO, that focus on lifting hydrocarbon production has intensified.\nThe commercial logic in what they are doing is clear. BP generates returns of 15 to 20 per cent on its fossil fuel \ninvestments but only 6 to 8 per cent from its renewable assets, with wind's returns inferior to solar's.\nPloughing billions each year into wind, solar and hydrogen dilutes the overall returns on capital and reduces the \nreturns to shareholders, making them most unhappy. Having invested about $US18 billion over the past five years \nin lower-returning renewables between them, BP and Shell investors have become increasingly unhappy.\nMoreover, the UK and European energy majors are always compared with their US counterparts.\nExxon and Chevron haven't been anywhere near as committed to lowering the carbon intensity of their portfolios as \ntheir transatlantic rivals. The US majors were committed to the \"drill, baby, drill\" mantra before Donald Trump and \nsaw that reflected in their share price relativities with their UK and European counterparts.\nWhere, over the past five years, Exxon's share price has risen 54 per cent and Chevron's 23 per cent, BP's has \nfallen 22 per cent and Shell's more than 6 per cent. That kind of disparity in performance tends to galvanise \nshareholders, along with executives motivated by their remuneration.\nBy moving its offshore wind assets into a joint venture vehicle and off its own balance sheet BP will keep an \nexposure to wind but significantly reduce the amounts of capital devoted to it and the levels of debt supporting it.\nBetween them, BP and JERA plan to spend up to $US5.8 billion on their combined portfolios (which includes the \nproposed Blue Mackerel offshore wind farm in Bass Strait) by the end of 2030. With shared investment and non-\nrecourse funding, BP's capital commitment will be modest relative to what it would otherwise have been.\nBoth BP and Shell still seem committed to solar, which is less capital intensive than wind, but that won't help them \nescape the criticism from climate activist groups and ESG (environmental, social and governance) investors, who \nare particularly vocal and litigious in Europe and the UK.\nThe problem, of course, is that the companies can't satisfy both constituencies and in a contest between emissions \nand returns is one that ultimately shareholders will always win.\nWith Trump about to return to the White House and open up US federal lands to more drilling for oil and gas, and \nthe incoming Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, having a \"3-3-3\" plan that includes lifting US energy production by \nthree million barrels of oil equivalent a day, the contrast between the environment for the US producers and their \ncompetitors elsewhere will only become starker and the pressure from shareholders on companies like BP and \nShell will only intensify.\nTrump also plans to remove the generous 10-year tax credits for renewables within Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction \nAct, which, if he is successful, would make the returns from investment in US renewables even less competitive \nwith those from fossil fuels.\nAny increase in US oil production would add to the existing glut in the oil market and depress prices that are \nalready under pressure, despite the withdrawal of about six million barrels a day of supply by the OPEC+ cartel.\nThe lower prices being experienced now and likely to continue into at least the first half of next year, however, \naren't an argument for the oil majors to invest in renewables.\nReturns from oil and gas will still be superior to those from renewables and, if oil and gas prices and profits are \nunder pressure, there will be even more of an incentive to invest only in the highest-returning assets.\nThose who invest purely in renewables appear unconcerned about the gradual withdrawal of the oil majors who \ngatecrashed their sector and, seeking to gain scale rapidly, drove up the costs of developing greenfields projects.Page 3 of 3\nBig Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare\nPloughing billions each year into wind, solar and hydrogen dilutes the overall returns on capital and reduces the \nreturns to shareholders, making them most unhappy.\nThere are a lot of environmentally-sensitive and patient investment funds available from sources other than the oil \nmajors that are willing to trade off returns for their convictions and/or consistent long-term returns, so losing some \ninvestment from the oil companies shouldn't retard renewables developments.\nIt was always going to be difficult for BP and Shell to try to produce a balance of their traditional oil and gas \nbusinesses and renewable energy portfolios while satisfying both financially-motivated and ESG-driven investors.\nIt has been particularly difficult for the UK and Europeans, with their lower returns but better environmental \ncredentials, to attract investors in the US. There's been a backlash against ESG investing in the US where, \nbecause there is no significant stigma associated with the oil and gas industry, valuation metrics tend to be higher.\nIf BP and Shell want better access to those more attractive metrics, improved share price performances and \naccess to cheaper capital, they have no realistic option but to shed, and invest less in, low-returning assets. That's \nwhat they are now doing.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

BP, the FTSE 100 constituent, is set to unwind 2030 targets to cut oil and gas production targets and \ndrop its low-carbon deployment goal when it updates its capital allocation strategy later this month.\nEquinor chief executive Anders Opedal said that cutting capital expenditure on renewables would help address \nchallenges in the offshore wind industry, and increase \"value creation\". The company expects to produce free \ncashflow of $US23bn by 2027, $US11n of which will be returned to shareholders as dividends.\nIn December, Equinor combined its British oil and gas assets with Shell under a new 50-50 joint venture, which \nthey claimed would create the largest independent producer in the maturing North Sea.\nHowever, its ambitions in the North Sea were dealt a blow last week when the Scottish courts quashed consent for \nRosebank, which is co-owned by Ithaca Energy, and Shell's Jackdaw field after a legal challenge brought by the \ncampaign groups Greenpeace and Uplift against the government's decision in 2023 to greenlight the projects.\nShell's Jackdaw gas field and Equinor's Rosebank oilfield must now reapply for government permission because \ntheir original approvals failed to consider the emissions that will be generated when the oil and gas is burnt. \nPage 2 of 2\nOil group Equinor cuts green spending\nHowever, the companies have been allowed to continue development work in the meantime. Equinor has spent \n\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a32.2bn on Rosebank so far.\nPhilippe Mathieu, executive vice-president for exploration and production international, said that the project would \ncontribute to Britain's growth agenda and create about 2000 jobs in the construction phase.\nThe fate of the fields will be a test of the government's approach to the North Sea. British Energy Secretary Ed \nMiliband has vowed to stop issuing new North Sea oil and gas licences and described Rosebank as a \"colossal \nwaste of taxpayer money and climate vandalism\" while in opposition.\nMr Mathieu said the project would boost domestically produced oil and gas and reduce reliance on imports.\n\"If you don't have Rosebank oil for the UK, then you have to import it from somewhere else \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 how much CO2 is \nthat going to cost?\" he said.

Campbell's landmark financial \nsystem review in the late 1970s laid out the intellectual case for Labor's financial deregulation and the floating of the \ndollar.\nRod Carnegie, now 91, also draws praise from Keating in an exclusive interview with The Australian Financial \nReview to mark his 80th birthday. Carnegie set up McKinsey in Australia and sought to Australianise CRA, now \nknown as Rio Tinto, as CEO in the 1980s. \"He was a progressive thinking guy and an economic nationalist,\" \nKeating says.\nOn the other hand, it's hard to pick a banker given the banks hold public licences, Keating says.\nAnother on Keating's list of business greats is former BHP boss Marius Kloppers, who \"broke the back\" of \nnegotiating contract pricing in 2010 in favour of using market spot prices for Australia's iron ore exports. \"You've got \nto give him big, big marks for that,\" Keating says.\nPressed about his complaint about a lack of outward-looking entrepreneurs in the modern Australian economy that \nhe helped create, Keating accepts there are some. He points to Fortescue Minerals' Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest, \nalong with Atlassian founders Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, and Canva founders Melanie Perkins and \nCliff Obrecht.\nBut the business person that merits a story is Ian McLennan, general manager and chairman of BHP between 1967 \nand 1977. McLennan helped drive the company's search for oil in Bass Strait and gas in the North West Shelf.\nThe story takes place in 1975 - just after the defeat of the Whitlam government - when Keating was appointed \nshadow minister for minerals and resources.\nPage 2 of 2\nMovers, shakers caught PM's eye\nMcLennan caught a train to Keating's electorate office in Bankstown, a suburb in south-west Sydney, on a Saturday \nmorning. He told the young Labor frontbencher that BHP had a chance of buying the exploration leases of the \ntroubled British oil company, Burmah, in the highly prospective North West Shelf.\nBut with the prospect of a very long lead time for the major gas development, McLennan said BHP would not make \nthe investment if the Labor opposition held to the policy of its previous resources minister, Rex Connor, that the gas \nshould be controlled by the government and used for local industry rather than be exported to Japan.\n\"I said, 'Sir Ian, you will be very pleased with my answer',\" Keating said. \"I thought that Rex had made huge \nmistakes in this because this is a gas-prone continent. And anyone who puts a contract before us, we should sign \nand anyone who wants to capitalise on it, we should grab in a foot tackle and get their signature on the page.\"\nThat convinced BHP to buy part of Burmah's stake in what became Australia's biggest ever resource project. And \nso began the nation's liquefied natural gas export industry.\nKeating then wrote support for the North West Shelf project into the Labor Party's policy platform at its 1977 \nconference in Perth. The other part of the stake was bought by Shell, which played a big role in building the project. \nKeating recalls travelling to Tokyo three times with Shell's Ric Charlton to talk to Japanese bankers and gas \nbuyers. And he was impressed with Shell Australia boss and International Olympic Committee member Kevan \nGosper.

But Australia's east coast faces a \nlooming crisis as offshore gas from Victoria's Bass Strait - the traditional bedrock of the country's supplies - rapidly \ndepletes.\nThe Australian Energy Market Operator has warned the country must urgently unlock new supplies to prevent a \ncatastrophic shortfall but new developments are struggling to secure regulatory approvals and/or the support of \nlocal communities.\nAnalysts have warned the country's $2.5 trillion economy will be significant harmed by a shortfall. The \nmanufacturing sector is particularly exposed with gas its only viable energy source, and any interruptions could \nthreaten their viability.\nHouseholds could also be disrupted. Victoria is the most gas-dependent state, relying on the fuel source to heat \nhomes, and a shortfall could make heating prohibitively expensive.\nOther states will also be hit. Gas is used as a so-called peaker, burnt to provide electricity during periods of high \ndemand or low supply from other fossil fuels or renewables. If Australia's National Electricity Market has insufficient \ngas on hand, the price of electricity will spike. Higher electricity bills was a key driver behind Australia's spike in \ninflation, which in turn forced the Reserve Bank of Australia to raise interest rates 13 times.\nWith a looming shortfall, gas developers have insisted governments fast-track applications, a request that the \nfederal Labor government has refused - insisting it must properly assess each application. The gas industry has \naccused the government of slow walking, which indicates its support for gas - a claim denied by Labor.\nLoad-Date: August 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n  Tone: Neutral\n  Sentiment Score: 2\n",

His narrative emphasizes Shell's shift back to fossil fuel investments, portraying this as a failure of its green strategy and a capitulation to market forces. The article repeatedly highlights the financial underperformance of renewables compared to oil and gas, the pressure from US competitors, and the broader industry trend of scaling back sustainability goals. His tone is particularly critical of Shell\u2019s inability to balance financial returns with environmental commitments, making his coverage more negative than others. Emma Powell also adopts a critical stance, focusing on Shell\u2019s involvement in joint ventures that prioritize fossil fuel expansion over renewables. However, her coverage is slightly less negative as it presents Shell\u2019s actions within the broader industry trend rather than singling it out as aggressively as Bartholomeusz does.\n\nAmong the most positive journalists, Michael Stutchbury frames Shell as a key player in Australia\u2019s energy development, particularly in historical contexts such as the North West Shelf project. His article highlights Shell\u2019s role in securing energy exports and economic growth, portraying the company as a visionary force in the industry. This historical perspective, combined with a focus on Shell\u2019s contributions to national economic policy, results in a more favorable sentiment. Colin Packham also presents Shell positively, emphasizing its role in expanding domestic gas supply through the Arrow Energy joint venture. His coverage highlights the economic and energy security benefits of Shell\u2019s projects, portraying the company as a responsible and necessary player in addressing Australia\u2019s energy needs. However, Stutchbury\u2019s coverage is judged more positive because it ties Shell\u2019s actions to broader economic progress and national development, whereas Packham\u2019s reporting, while favorable, remains more focused on specific projects.",
