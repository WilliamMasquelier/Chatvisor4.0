All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Version:2\nLength: 649 words\nByline: Alex Lawson\nHighlight: Company developing world\u2019s largest offshore windfarm in North Sea attempts to recover from turbulent \nyearBusiness live \u2013 latest updatesEurope live \u2013 latest updates\nBody\nThe Danish company developing the world\u2019s largest offshore windfarm in the North Sea is to cut hundreds of jobs \nand pause its dividend in an attempt to recover from a chaotic 12 months.\n\u00d8rsted, which is behind the \u00a38bn Hornsea 3 project off the Yorkshire coast, said on Wednesday it planned to axe \nup to 800 jobs, pull back from markets in Spain, Portugal and Norway and suspend dividend payments to \nshareholders covering the 2023-25 financial years.\nThe company said it would cut its target for developing renewable energy capacity by 2030, reducing it from 50 \ngigawatts to 35-38GW.\nIts chair, Thomas Thune Andersen, will step down after almost a decade in the role, following the two senior \nexecutives who left the business  in November.\nThe company, which is majority owned by the Danish government, said the \u201creset plan\u201d was designed to make it a \n\u201cleaner and more efficient company\u201d.\n\u00d8rsted has struggled in the face of high inflation, supply-chain disruption and rising interest rates, which have hit \nthe windfarm industry. The company has also experienced problems in the US in attempting to secure tax credits.\nLast year, \u00d8rsted cancelled two big offshore windfarm projects in the US , the Ocean Wind I and II schemes, \nblaming a sharp rise in costs. It took a 28.4bn Danish kroner (\u00a33.3bn) hit as a result of the decision.\nThe company had also raised doubts over the cost of the Hornsea 3 project early last year. However, in December \nit reaffirmed its commitment to 2.9GW development, which is expected to supply power to about 3.3m homes.\nPage 2 of 2\nDanish windfarm firm \u00d8rsted to axe up to 800 jobs and pause dividend\nThe RBC analyst Alexander Wheeler said financial markets had been expecting \u00d8rsted to tap investors for funds, \n\u201cwhich would have resolved the issues quicker and removed future risk in this regard\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cHowever, we now have a period where \u00d8rsted needs to execute on various components of its plan to \nimprove its balance sheet metrics over the medium term.\u201d\n\u00d8rsted has 12 existing windfarms in the UK producing enough energy to power six million UK homes. It is also \nworking on a floating offshore wind project  in Scotland.\nSeparately on Wednesday, the turbine maker Siemens Energy, which was forced to strike a \u20ac15bn rescue deal with \nthe German government  last year, reported a \u20ac1.58bn first-quarter profit after selling a stake in its Indian unit.\nIt said orders remained lower than forecast in its turbine division, where newer models have suffered technical \nfaults, but it hoped to break even in that business in 2026.\nThe problems affecting the windfarm industry caused the Swedish energy firm Vattenfall to stop work  on the \nmultibillion-pound Norfolk Boreas windfarm last year because it was no longer profitable.\nThe Norwegian oil and gas producer Equinor posted quarterly profits of $8.68bn \u2013 down from $17bn a year earlier \nbut ahead of City forecasts \u2013 due to lower energy prices.\nMeanwhile, the British Gas owner Centrica signed an agreement to buy a million metric tonnes of liquified natural \ngas (LNG) from Spain\u2019s Repsol. The cargoes will be delivered to the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent between 2025 \nand 2027. Britain has a collection of gas terminals, providing fuel for domestic use and to be re-exported.\nGermany has raced to bolster its ability to import shipped LNG  since piped Russian gas supplies dropped after the \ninvasion of Ukraine, while the US last month moved to curb gas exports by pausing all pending export permits  amid \nclimate concerns.\nThe new chief executive of BP said on Tuesday  the oil and gas company would take a \u201cmore pragmatic\u201d approach \nto reaching its green targets. Shell faced calls to speed up its investment in renewable energy last week, as it \nannounced bumper profits and shareholder payouts  and increased oil and gas production.\nIn January, gas-fired power stations provided the largest share of Great Britain\u2019s electricity supply, at 35.7%, ahead \nof wind power at 33.5%, National Grid said  this week. \nLoad-Date: February 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Alexander Wheeler | RBC Analyst | \"However, we now have a period where \u00d8rsted needs to execute on various components of its plan to improve its balance sheet metrics over the medium term.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
