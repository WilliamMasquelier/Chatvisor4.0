It operates in the Renewable energy, with a prefered focus on the Netherlands market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Orsted based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Orsted is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Orsted.\n\nIf Orsted is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nFlagship green fuel factory scrapped in net zero blow\nFlagship green fuel factory scrapped in net zero blow\ntelegraph.co.uk\nAugust 15, 2024 Thursday 2:45 PM GMT\nCopyright 2024 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Version:1\nLength: 521 words\nByline: By Jonathan Leake\nHighlight: State-owned Norwegian energy giant \u00d8rsted says there is a lack of demand for e-fuel\nBody\nA flagship green fuel factory has been scrapped by the renewable energy giant \u00d8rsted  amid a lack of demand \nfrom customers.\nWork has halted on the FlagshipONE project, a proposed e-methanol plant in the Swedish town of \u00d6rnsk\u00f6ldsvik, \nmeant to supply container ships as part of the battle to reach net zero.\nThe announcement is the latest sign that energy majors are retreating from the mega-projects needed to accelerate \nthe global shift from fossil fuels to cleaner substitutes. \n\u00d8rsted took a 1.5bn Danish kroner (\u00a3172m) hit from the decision to axe the facility, according to its latest financial \nresults.\nThe business, which is controlled by the Danish government, has become one of the UK\u2019s leading developers of \noffshore wind, with 12 operational wind farms in UK waters.\nThey include Hornsea 1 and 2 off the east coast \u2013 together comprising one of the world\u2019s largest wind farms.\nThe company produces 7pc of the UK\u2019s power and is planning further expansion including two more wind farms \nnear Hornsea  and a massive floating one off Scotland.\nHowever, its ventures into new technologies and regions have hit the company hard this year, with Mads Nipper, \ngroup president and chief executive of \u00d8rsted announcing a total of 3.9bn DKK of impairments.\nThe FlagshipONE project would have used renewable electricity to produce hydrogen that could then be combined \nwith CO2 to produce methanol.\nPage 2 of 2\nFlagship green fuel factory scrapped in net zero blow\nThe aim was to produce 55,000 tonnes of methanol a year, enough for one large container vessel, making it a \nlarge-scale pilot project.\nMr Nipper said the company had been unable to secure long-term contracts to buy its e-methanol at a viable price.\nHe said: \u201cThe liquid e-fuel market in Europe is developing slower than expected, and we have taken the strategic \ndecision to deprioritise our efforts within the market and cease the development of FlagshipONE.\n\u201cWe will continue our focus and development efforts within renewable hydrogen, which is essential for \ndecarbonising key industries in Europe and closer to our core business.\u201d\n\u00d8rsted suffered a second impairment totalling 2.1bn kroner at its Revolution wind farm project near Martha\u2019s \nVineyard, off the US east coast. Construction delays at its onshore substation are the key cause.\nMr Nipper said: \u201cDespite encouraging progress on our US offshore wind project, Revolution Wind, the construction \nof the onshore substation for the project has been delayed. This means that we have pushed the commercial \noperation date from 2025 into 2026, which led to an impairment.\n\u201cThis is, of course, unsatisfactory.\u201d\nThe company reported a pre-tax profit of 3.9bn kroner, up from 2.4bn kroner in the same period last year, and net \nprofits of 931m kroner.\nTancrede Fulop, senior equity analyst at Morningstar said \u00d8rsted had outperformed expectations especially in \noffshore wind, but the impairments \u201cunderscore the impact of project delays\u201d.\n\u00d8rsted\u2019s cuts follow similar moves by other energy majors in scaling back renewable energy projects.\nLast month, Shell halted construction of a new plant in Rotterdam meant to convert waste into jet fuel and biodiesel, \nwarning that market conditions were not right.\nLoad-Date: August 15, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Orsted.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
