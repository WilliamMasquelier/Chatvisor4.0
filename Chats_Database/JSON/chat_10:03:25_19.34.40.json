Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 21\nLength: 453 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nA group of former Fortescue employees has failed to convince a court to throw out evidence gathered through a \nsearch of their property, in a ruling that boosts Fortescue's case against the former employees' company Element \nZero.\nFortescue has accused Element Zero founders Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen \nof taking intellectual property from Fortescue to advance their green-iron start-up, and Fortescue controversially \nused surveillance then search-and-seizure methods to gather evidence against them. The Federal Court on Friday \ndismissed attempts by Element Zero to have the search-and-seizure tactics ruled invalid.\nFortescue's use of private investigators was described by Element Zero as a \"massive overreach\" because the \nsurveillance reports included photographs of children and private homes, and details obtained by rifling through mail \nand following family members.\nIn July, Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest distanced himself from the use of private investigators and reports of \nspying on the children of the Element Zero founders, saying that the surveillance and search raids did not align with \nthe \"values\" of the mining giant.\nBut Friday's ruling means evidence seized during the searches that followed the surveillance campaign may be \nadmissible in court when the matter goes to trial. Fortescue can also order Element Zero to pay costs.\nFederal court judge Brigitte Markovic's reasons for judgment will not be published until next week.\nElement Zero is developing a low-carbon method for turning iron ore into higher-value green iron.\nAll three of the Element Zero founders previously worked in Fortescue's clean energy division, with Dr \nKolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen involved in the scientific work to develop green-iron manufacturing methods.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue can use controversial surveillance to sue former execs Mining technology\nDr Kolodziejczyk has insisted Element Zero's manufacturing methods were developed after he left Fortescue, but \nthe miner believes important information was taken from its laboratories. \"Fortescue remains committed to \nprotecting its intellectual property and investment in green technologies, and looks forward to progressing the \nmatter to a final trial,\" a Fortescue spokesman said on Friday.\nA spokesman for Element Zero said the company still believed Fortescue had over-reacted by ordering the \nsurveillance. \"Element Zero will review the judgment before determining whether to appeal today's decision,\" he \nsaid.\nSeparately, Fortescue has told shareholders Dr Forrest will cast his substantial vote in favour of his re-election - \nand that of other incumbent directors - if investors vote to spill the miner's board next month. Fortescue suffered a \n\"first strike\" against its remuneration plan at last year's shareholder meeting.\nLoad-Date: October 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's Chairman | \"the surveillance and search raids did not align with the 'values' of the mining giant.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
