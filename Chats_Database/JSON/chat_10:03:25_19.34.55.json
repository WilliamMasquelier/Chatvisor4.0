Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Chairman of Fortescue | \"Dr Forrest has vowed that Fortescue will not rely on offsets to achieve 'real zero' emissions across its iron ore mines by 2030.\" | N.A. |\n| Spokesman for Fortescue | Not mentioned | \"Fortescue is finalising its position on the implications of the reformed Safeguard Mechanism and is working closely with the government.\" | N.A. |\n| Spokesman for Fortescue | Not mentioned | \"We will show that decarbonisation is good for business and creates greater value for shareholders while safeguarding our planet.\" | N.A. |\n| Ben Caldecott | Director of Oxford Sustainable Finance Group | \"The plan is marked by high ambition and well-defined actions, underpinned by accountability mechanisms to ensure systematic delivery across the organisation.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
