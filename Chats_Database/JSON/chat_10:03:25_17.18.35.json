Any Core Lithium \nshareholders looking to indulge in a little tax-loss selling to offset taxable gains elsewhere in their portfolio will have \nbeen well-placed last week, with the company - the first major Australian victim of the lithium price plunge - finishing \nthe year down 89.7 per cent, the biggest loss on the S&P/ASX 300 Metals and Mining index.\nInvestors who jumped on the Canadian lithium bandwagon have also had a torrid time, with Sayona Mining and \nPatriot Battery Metals down 79 per cent and 67.5 per cent respectively.\nChalice Mining was the third biggest loser on the list, with a 77.3 per cent plunge for the fiscal year after delivering \nan underwhelming scoping study on its Gonneville project in WA in August last year.\nIGO was hit by falling lithium and nickel prices - while still feeling the hangover from its disastrous takeover of \nWestern Areas - and suffered a 60.6 per cent value loss for the year.\nGraphite plays Talga Group, Syrah Resources and Renascor Resources all made the top 10 loser list.\nThe list is rounded out by -Liontown Resources, which was the hottest lithium play on the market when Albemarle \nlobbed a $2.50-a-share bid in March 2023. Hancock Prospecting spoiled that takeover, however, and the falling \nlithium price - as well as cost blowouts at its Kathleen Valley project in WA - did the rest, with Liontown stock \nclosing off 68 per cent for the financial year at 90.5c.\nLoad-Date: June 30, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Wild ride as investors tally mining's FY24 winners and losers\n## The Australian\n### Nick Evans\n### July 01, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Ramelius Resources, to report.

Ramelius Resources achieved a total return of 54.7% for the financial year, positioning it as one of the leading mid-tier gold companies in Western Australia, alongside Westgold Resources, which delivered a slightly higher return of 68.7%.\n\n2. The performance of Ramelius Resources reflects the broader trend in the gold sector, which has seen significant returns driven by rising gold prices amid global inflation and geopolitical uncertainties, contrasting sharply with the struggles faced by the critical minerals sector.\n\n3. Despite its strong performance, Ramelius Resources is part of a competitive landscape where other gold miners, such as Red 5 and West African Resources, have outperformed it, indicating a need for Ramelius to enhance its operational strategies to maintain investor interest.\n\n4. The article highlights the volatility in the mining sector, with Ramelius Resources needing to navigate potential market fluctuations and investor sentiment shifts, particularly as the gold market experiences both highs and lows throughout the financial year.",
