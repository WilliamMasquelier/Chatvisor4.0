ASIC v Star directors Former Star \nEntertainment directors are being sued over allegations they failed to stop money-laundering risks and criminal links \ncreeping into its operation will face a trial from February 10.\nASIC first launched the civil case in the Federal Court against former CEO Matthias Bekier and ex-chairman John \nO'Neill among other board members in December 2022. It is set to run for about six weeks.\nBarrister James Arnott, SC, a silk who regularly advises and -appears in relation to regulatory investigations, \naccording to his Sixth Floor Selborne Wentworth Chambers profile, represented ASIC for the past few court dates in \nthe matter.\nChinese high-roller junket operator Suncity allegedly pumped billions of dollars into Star casinos, with Star's \nturnover from Suncity reportedly worth $2.1bn, $4bn and $5.9bn for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years.\nASIC has alleged the board continued to allow the junket operator to expand its operations instead of scrutinising its \npotential organised crime links and money laundering risks.\nIn 2022, a royal commission-style inquiry into Star revealed the casino operator stopped short of issuing Suncity, \nwhich was owned by Alvin Chau, a third warning letter after it was busted operating a \"pseudo cage\" where bundles \nof cash from black backpacks were exchanged for casino chips, breaching anti-money-laundering rules.\nPage 2 of 4\nLegal stoushes set to keep courts busy\nInstead, Star allegedly renewed its agreement with the junket operator in 2018. It was claimed that senior Star \ninvestigator Andrew McGregor wrote to management in May 2018 to alert it that \"we have an entity within our four \nwalls, which is totally non compliant to reasonable requests for basic -information. I'm going to call it out early. \nSuncity is operating a business model under our noses, which is problematic for Star -Entertainment Group with \nregard to AML CTF (anti-money laundering, counter terrorism financing) laws.\" Other board members Kathleen \nLahey, Richard Sheppard, Gerard Bradley, Sally Pitkin, Benjamin Heap, Zlatko Todorcevski, Paula Martin and Greg \nHawkins have been named in the lawsuit, which will be presided over by Federal Court judge Michael Lee.\nAll 11 former executives have denied the allegations against them in defence papers. Star Entertainment is not \nnamed as a party to the proceedings.\nFortescue's Andrew Forrest v Element Zero Mining giant Fortescue managed to keep an explosive lawsuit it \nlodged against some of its ex-senior executives secret for a while.\nBut in June, a judgment was quietly published that revealed the Andrew Forrest-led company obtained court orders \nto launch raids on the homes and offices that targeted former Fortescue chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk, long-\nterm Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman and former Fortescue staff member Bjorn Winther-Jensen.\nAfter the Federal Court initially granted Fortescue a suppression order, which kept the proceedings secret from late \nApril to early June, it was revealed that Fortescue - a $57bn listed company - accused Element Zero of \"industrial-\nscale misuse\" of confidential information concerning its green (carbon dioxide-free) iron technology.\nElement Zero denied the allegations, calling them \"spurious\". The dispute turned ugly after it was revealed \nFortescue paid a private investigator, Robert Lancaster, who spied on the wives and children of the former \nFortescue staff including by following them to Kmart, taking pictures of them leaving school and rummaging \nthrough their mail.\nIt is necessary to ensure the parties are aware if there are \"vulnerable\" people at the properties to be searched, \nsuch as children, but the Element Zero parties argued the level of surveillance they were subjected to was \nexcessive.\nThe case continues, after -Element Zero failed to appeal against a decision that granted the search orders. It will file \nanother appeal to overturn that decision, while Fortescue has applied to change its statement of claim against it.\nElement Zero has previously briefed Sydney-based barrister David Studdy, SC, while Fortescue has previously \nbriefed Sydney-based Julian Cooke, SC.\nRetailers defend 'fake' discount allegations The country's biggest grocery outlets, Coles and Woolworths, are \ndenying claims that they mislead consumers by promoting \"illusory discounts\" on hundreds of common supermarket \nproducts.\nThe ACCC's separate proceedings in the Federal Court alleged a breach of Australian Consumer Law by \n\"misleading consumers through discount pricing claims\" on the products.\nACCC chair Gina Cass-Gott-lieb said in late September that -social media sleuths who were tracking prices online \ntipped off the regulator, which claimed products such as tampons and fly spray were sold at regular long-term \nprices, before they were subject to an increase of at least 15 per cent for a brief period and then \"discounted\".\nWhen the products were placed in Woolworths' Prices Dropped promotion and Coles's Down Down promotion, the \nACCC alleged the prices were lower than during the price spike but higher than or the same as the regular price \nthat applied before the spike.\nBoth supermarkets have denied the allegations, and in defence papers said surging supplier commodity prices and \nother cost increases led them to pump up the value of household goods.Page 3 of 4\nLegal stoushes set to keep courts busy\nThe filing of defence papers is likely to mean a drawn-out court fight, unless the parties settle, as both supermarkets \nappear intent on fighting the allegations.\nTrial dates have not been set, but Coles, Woolworths and the ACCC could go head to head in the second half of \nnext year.\nPratt family in two fights The billionaire Pratt family is now embroiled in two court fights aimed at protecting its \nwealth.\nThe latest legal saga was launched by one of the Pratt siblings, Heloise, after she accused former husband and \nbillionaire investor Alex Waislitz of criminality and acting \"dishonestly\" by paying himself and his charitable \nfoundation $1.147m without her knowledge and approval.\nMr Waislitz responded on Christmas Eve, denying the allegations against him and claiming his former wife failed to \ninvolve herself in the affairs of their family business.\nMs Pratt and siblings Anthony Pratt and Fiona Geminder are children of the late Richard Pratt and own the Visy \ncardboard box-making and recycling empire.\nThe court case appears to centre on control of the $1.3bn stock investment empire run by Mr Waislitz but also \nowned by Ms Pratt for more than three decades.\n\"It appears to be a highly provocative and unbecoming action in response to failed negotiations which had up until \nnow been kept private,\" Mr Waislitz has previously said in response to news about the court case.\nMr Waislitz has briefed Sydney-based barrister Jeremy Stoljar, KC, and Melbourne-based Kane Loxley.\nThe latest legal saga to ensnare the family came after the late Pratt's love child, Paula Hitchcock, secured a partial \nwin in her bid to claim an equitable slice of the family trust in October.\nThe NSW Supreme Court ruled Ms Hitchcock would be -allowed to argue she is legally -entitled to a slice of the \nfamily fortune because she is a child not only of the late billionaire but his wife Jeanne.\nSydney-based barrister Christopher Withers, SC, has appeared for Ms Hitchcock in past hearings. Appearing for \nthe Pratt family trustee has been Melbourne-based barrister Allan Myers, KC.\nThe matter has dragged on since 2022, and could continue in 2025 after Ms Hitchcock asked the court to update \nher pleadings again.\nBoth cases are set to play out in the new year.\nASIC v Cbus After ASIC sued $92bn super fund Cbus over allegations it delayed insurance payments to vulnerable \nfamilies with a bang in November, the matter could slow down in 2025.\nASIC claimed Cbus took more than a year in some cases for the fund - which is chaired by Labor national president \nWayne Swan - to pay out death and disabilities payments. It prompted the regulator to warn that it would crack \ndown on the $4 trillion sector over failures to track end-to-end death benefit claims handling times and \"weak\" -\npractices.\nAccording to the latest court updates, Cbus will not be required to file a defence to the allegations until May 16, after \nASIC lodges a full statement of claim.\nThe case is then listed for -mediation on June 23.\nAlleged insider trading ASIC has at least two insider trading criminal court cases on foot, including one it lodged \nagainst Melbourne man Duncan Stewart and another against Perth man Vittorio Letizia.Page 4 of 4\nLegal stoushes set to keep courts busy\nMr Stewart is set to face a trial in Melbourne's County Court, after ASIC alleged in a committal hearing at the \nMagistrate's Court that he passed on inside information about possible takeover bids of Kidman Resources by \nChilean major SQM and separately Wesfarmers in 2019.\nASIC alleged Mr Stewart received information from his brother-in-law and Kidman Resources boss Martin Donohue \nabout the possible bids in 2019, which he used to buy shares in the company and urged his brother Ashley to do \nthe same. Mr Stewart has denied the allegations.\nMr Stewart's legal team have briefed Melbourne-based barrister Ruth Shann, SC in the matter.\nSeparately, the regulator revealed Mr Letizia faced Perth Magistrates Court after he was charged with five counts of \ninsider trading over purchases in mid-tier miner Genesis Minerals dating back to 2021. ASIC lost an insider trading \ncase lodged against ex-Vocus chair Vaughan Bowen in December. Mr Bowen was found not-guilty by a jury.\nLoad-Date: January 1, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
