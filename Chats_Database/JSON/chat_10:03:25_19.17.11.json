Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BOSS_; Pg. 29\nLength: 1043 words\nByline: Euan Black\nBody\nThis year's The Australian Financial Review Rich Bosses list is dominated by tech and mining executives and also \nwelcomes a new face.\nRichard White\nRank: 1\nCompany: WiseTech Global\nShareholding: $12.95 billion\nWiseTech Global co-founder and chief executive Richard White has retained the top spot on the Rich Bosses list \nafter increasing the value of his shareholding by more than $2 billion last financial year.\nThe annual Rich Bosses list ranks the ASX 300's wealthiest executives based on the value of their shareholdings in \nthe company where they work as of June 30.\nWiseTech's shares returned to all-time highs in February after the software company's first-half earnings beat \nanalysts' expectations. Months later, they temporarily edged above $100 per share for the first time since White had \nco-founded the company with Maree Isaacs in 1994.\nWiseTech has never made a loss - and 85 per cent of its 3500 employees globally own shares in it thanks to an \nemployee share scheme.\nAlan Wilson & Peter Wilson\nRank: 2 & 6\nCompany: Reece\nShareholding: $9.03 billion & $3.02 billion\nPage 2 of 4\n\" THE 10 WEALTHIEST EXECUTIVES IN THE ASX 300 REVEALED\nPlumbing parts maker Reece Group boosted net profit after tax by 20 per cent in the first half of last financial year.\nThe solid result shocked analysts as it came after the company warned shareholders last August that it expected to \nsell fewer products and experience margin pressure in the months ahead.\nSenior reporter Jonathan Shapiro said the result raised questions about Reece's adherence to the continuous \ndisclosure rules, as the company provided no trading updates before reporting profits that far exceeded market \nexpectations.\nNevertheless, executive director Alan Wilson climbed one spot on this year's list after the value of his company \nshareholding increased by 36 per cent to $9.03 billion.\nHis son, Peter, who has been chief executive of the family business since 2008, also made the top 10 for the first \ntime after it was announced in May that he would also replace Alan as executive chair from November.\nPeter's shareholding was worth $3.02 billion on June 30.\nAndrew Forrest\nRank: 3\nCompany: Fortescue Metals Group\nShareholding: $8.95 billion\nAndrew Forrest, executive chairman of Fortescue Metals Group and the eighth-richest person in Australia, dropped \nto third place on this year's Rich Bosses list after the value of his Fortescue shareholding fell by roughly $300 \nmillion.\nForrest had already conceded first place to White last year after the terms of his divorce left him with fewer \nFortescue shares than his ex-wife Nicola. The couple also transferred $5 billion of Fortescue shares to their \nMindaroo Foundation last June. The company's share price dropped 6.2 per cent last financial year as lower iron \nore prices offset an earlier rally that had taken the stock to record highs. But it still ended the financial year 137 per \ncent higher than it did in 2019.\nMore recently, Forrest made headlines when he was photographed kissing a woman on the streets of Paris in May. \nMoroccan Energy Minister Leila Benali, who sits on the board of one of Fortescue's joint ventures in the North \nAfrican country, later denied she was the woman in the picture.\nThe iron ore miner also became embroiled in a spying scandal that involved 19 days of surveillance by private \ninvestigators of the homes and families of three former Fortescue employees.\nFortescue had accused them of copying and stealing its intellectual property when they left to start rival green iron \nbusiness Element Zero.\nSam Hupert and\nAnthony Hall\nRank: 4 & 5\nCompany: Pro Medicus\nShareholding: $3.74 billion each\nHealthcare software developer Pro Medicus was the best-performing stock on the ASX 200 last financial year, \ndelivering shareholders a return of 118.7 per cent after a record year of new contract wins.Page 3 of 4\n\" THE 10 WEALTHIEST EXECUTIVES IN THE ASX 300 REVEALED\nThat meant the value of co-founders Sam Hupert and Anthony Hall's respective shareholdings more than doubled \nto $3.74 billion each.\nThe company's flagship Visage software enables radiologists to view reports and image files generated by X-rays \nand other medical scans on their mobile devices.\nHall and Hupert set up the company in 1983 and floated its stock in 2000 at $1.15 a piece. Last month, the share \nprice temporarily surpassed $140.\nMichael and Matt Heine\nRank: Joint 7th\nCompany: Netwealth Group\nShareholding: $2.67 billion\nNetwealth, the wealth company that Michael Heine registered in 1999, reported record inflows of $22 billion last \nfinancial year as it took its total funds under management to $88 billion.\nMichael's son, Matt, became sole managing director when Michael moved from joint managing director to executive \ndirector in 2022. The value of their combined shareholdings increased by almost $900 million last financial year to \n$2.67 billion.\nGerry Harvey\nRank: 9\nCompany: Harvey Norman\nShareholding: $1.73 billion\nRetailer Harvey Norman reported a 45.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profit in the first half of last financial year, as gloomy \nconsumers weighed down by interest rate hikes and stubbornly high inflation pulled back on spending.\nYet, the company's share price still rose by about 20 per cent, boosting the value of executive chairman Gerry \nHarvey's shareholding by more than $300 million.\nIn an interview after the company's first-half results in February, Harvey said he was feeling more optimistic about \nthe outlook than he was last year despite the large profit drop.\n\"So many more people are in the country, and they have all got to have a bed and a fridge,\" he said. \"If interest \nrates drop a bit, inflation drops, consumer confidence picks up and big tax cuts are coming.\"\nGreg Goodman\nRank: 10\nCompany: Goodman Group\nShareholding: $1.51 billion\nGreg Goodman has had a good year. The property giant he co-founded and continues to lead as chief executive \nupgraded its earnings guidance twice last financial year as its shift into data centres offset weakening demand for \nwarehouse space in China.\nThe company still makes most of its money from building warehouses, but Goodman told Chanticleer in March that \nthe company's data-centre play had a 10-year tailwind behind it.Page 4 of 4\n\" THE 10 WEALTHIEST EXECUTIVES IN THE ASX 300 REVEALED\nOver the 12 months to June 30, the value of his shareholding increased by 70 per cent to $1.51 billion.\nLast week, Goodman was also revealed to be the highest-paid locally based ASX 200 CEO in the 2023 financial \nyear.AFR EUAN BLACK\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue Metals Group | \"Forrest had already conceded first place to White last year after the terms of his divorce left him with fewer Fortescue shares than his ex-wife Nicola.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
