It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nFortescue exodus blamed on culture\nFortescue exodus blamed on culture\nThe Australian\nMarch 12, 2024 Tuesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 493 words\nByline: Colin Packham\nBody\nAn exodus of senior staff from Fortescue was due to a cultural misalignment and not an indication of underlying \nwoes, two of the company's most senior executives say, insisting that the upheaval has now settled.\nFortescue has in recent years significantly stepped up its investment in renewable projects to cash in on the global \ntransition to green energy.\nHowever, this has led to an exodus of high-level management and raised investor concerns about the capacity of \nthe company to execute its high-stakes pivot to green energy from its iron ore foundations, which made its founder \none of Australia's richest men.\nNotable hires such as former NT chief minister Michael Gunner and deputy RBA governor Guy Debelle have left \nAndrew Forrest's company in recent months.\nHowever Fortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson and Fortescue Metals head Dino Otranto said the \nexodus was indicative of the company's unique culture and a desire of some to change an organisation that did not \nneed changing.\n\"Fortescue is unique and some people come in and think they can fix it, that it needs to be run differently, but we \ndon't need to be fixed,\" said Mr Hutchinson.\n\"We've got to change and evolve. I think things will settle down.\" The comments came just weeks after Dr Forrest \nrejected suggestions the company has faced upheaval and the green agenda has been a catalyst for the exits.\n\"We employ 22,000 people. When you go from a fossil fuel-burning company to a green energy company, you're \ngoing to lose people who say, 'what are you doing? You've got this fantastic economic model. You have the most \nsuccessful company shareholder returns in decades in our company. Why are you fiddling around with it?' \" said Dr \nForrest.\nMr Otranto acknowledged the commitment to renewable energy had been a concern to many within the \norganisation.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue exodus blamed on culture\n\"Eighteen months ago when we announced the pivot into green energy, we were a bit anxious, to be honest,\" said \nMr Otranto.\nFortescue is aiming to capitalise on demand for zero-emission energy sources, but there is broad concern about \nthe capacity of many countries to meet emissions targets as new renewable energy generation projects take longer \nthan expected to materialise. The sluggish transition has fuelled fierce debate about the possibility of nuclear \nenergy.\nIt is currently banned in Australia, but the Coalition has proposed using small modular nuclear reactors to replace \ncoal-fired power.\nThe Coalition insists nuclear power is the only viable means to achieve Australia's 2050 net zero emission targets, \nbut federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen insists independent evidence shows the fuel source remains prohibitively \nexpensive.\nDr Forrest has rejected the nuclear plan, insisting it amounts to \"dividing us with the false hope that we can cling to \nfossil fuels forever\". Echoing his boss, Mr Hutchinson said nuclear power was \"not the answer\", and Australia \nshould instead focus on plentiful opportunities in renewable energy.\nLoad-Date: March 11, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
