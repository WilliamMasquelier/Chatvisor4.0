Soft-sided luggage was once the big seller but most of the cases flopping onto the baggage \ncarousels these days are hard-shell. Each has its pros and cons.\nLink to Image\niStock\nMaterials and durability\nSoft-sided luggage is most commonly made from one of several versions of woven nylon, which might be ripstop, \ncordura or ballistic.\nThey're all heavy-duty and durable but cordura is softer and more durable and performs better in puncture tests \nwhile ballistic is smooth and glossy and more resistant to scuffs and scratches than cordura.\nRipstop is less common, it gets its name from the way the fabric is woven in a crosshatch pattern at intervals, \nmaking it more resistant to tears. It's lighter than both cordura and ballistic nylon but it looks more industrial.\nThe material of choice for hard-side cases these days is polycarbonate, a strong, tough thermoplastic that \nmaintains its rigidity in very high or low temperatures. It's also lightweight and flexes without cracking, making it \nideal for suitcases that might get rough treatment in the baggage hold.\nSome high-end hard-shell cases are constructed from sheets of polycarbonate with an aluminium skeleton which \nmakes them both durable and relatively light. Aluminium cases are more frequently seen on the baggage carousels \nthese days, although this probably has more to do with fashion than functionality.\nAluminium dents and scratches but for connoisseurs that only adds to its rugged good looks, and many \nmanufacturers will replace damaged panels and wheels. As a far more expensive material, it commands a price of \nup to $2000 for a top-of-the-line model. Unless you plan to do a lot of travelling over the next 20 years, it's a \nquestionable investment. A quality hard case costs a quarter the price, and a decent soft case can be had for half \nthe price of a hard model.\nPage 2 of 3\nHard or soft, light or heavy-duty: Which is the best suitcase for you?\nWeight is not likely to be a factor in anyone's choice between hard and soft luggage, except for metal cases. A soft-\nsided case weighs less than a hard-shell case of equivalent size but not by much. A soft case with a capacity of 85 \nlitres might weigh 2.8 kilograms but a polycarbonate hard case the same size will probably weigh just half a kilo \nmore.\nIf absolute minimum weight is what you're after, it's hard to go past a wheeled duffle. The Eagle Creek Migrate \nWheeled Duffel Bag weighs in at just 2.27 kilograms yet it swallows a massive 110 litre payload.\nHeaviest of all are metal cases. Even though they're made from aluminium, a metal suitcase takes a big bite out of \nyour checked baggage allowance. The Rimowa Check-in L (large) weighs 6.2 kilograms, and even its downsized \nbrother, the Rimowa Check-in M (Medium) is no lightweight at 5.4 kilograms. These cases are fine if you're \ntravelling in a style in which others handle your bags but if you're going to be schlepping your own luggage on and \noff trains and buses, a metal case might not be the best choice.\nHard-shell cases do a better job of protecting whatever might be inside. If you're travelling with camera gear or \nbottles of wine, the extra insulation that comes with a hard case buys you peace of mind. Even so, it's best to \nsurround fragile items with soft clothing that will absorb impact if they come in for rough treatment. Although they're \nnot totally water and dust resistant, hard cases do a better job of withstanding rain, snow and spills. There are no \nintegrated locks on soft-sided cases, but a small padlock does the same job. However zips can be prised apart \nwithout too much difficulty. If security is an issue, a hinged metal case offers massively better protection.\nLink to Image\niStock\nTwo wheels good, four wheels better\nMost hard cases have four wheels, soft-sided luggage usually has two. Those four wheels are typically 360-degree \nspinners which makes it a breeze to manoeuvre even heavy cases through crowded airport terminals, railway \nstations and anywhere else they're on a smooth surface. If it's rough underfoot - pavements, cobblestoned streets - \nyou'll probably find it easier to tip your case onto two wheels and the advantages of four wheels are nullified.\nHard-shell cases split down the middle and open into two equal halves, the so-called clamshell design. So \nubiquitous is the clamshell that it's unusual to find hard cases that open any other way. This makes it easy to pack \nand unpack the two halves. Soft-sided luggage has a zipper that opens around the top and you might have to dig to \nfind what you're looking for. Also, packing is not so neat as with a hard case.\nLink to Image\niStock\nBoth hard and soft cases can often be expanded by a few extra litres by opening a zip on top of the case, allowing \nyou to cram just a little more inside. Even though a hard and soft case might have the same capacity, the soft \nversion has slightly more give. If you find yourself sitting on your case to close it, a soft case will serve you better.\nGraphic\n \nHard shell or soft shell? Each case has its pros and cons.\nHard-shell luggage is ideal for protecting precious case contents.\nThe clamshell design of hard cases makes for easy packing.Page 3 of 3\nHard or soft, light or heavy-duty: Which is the best suitcase for you?\nLoad-Date: March 3, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
