The name of a real person who has expressed a quote in the provided article\n2. His role or relation with regards to Shell.\n3. Their original quote about Shell exactly as it appears in the article, without any modifications or translations\n\nGuidelines:\n- Include only real people: Exclude organizations, companies, or any other non-person entities\n- Direct connection: Ensure that each selected individual is explicitly connected to Shell or explicitly express his opinion on Shell.\n- Only include those whose statements are directly about Shell\n- Exclude individuals whose comments are not directly relevant to Shell or are too general\n- Pertinent stakeholders only: Only include the most relevant individuals\n- Do not include stakeholders who are not directly associated with Shell\n\nOutput Format Requirements:\n- Each line must contain exactly two columns separated by \"|\" symbols\n- Column 1: Stakeholder's name\n- Column 2: Stakeholder's role or link to Shell.

This investment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a \nPage 2 of 2\nArrow to expand Queensland gas project\nlower emissions alternative to options like coal.\" Shell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said the expansion would \nbe boon for the local community.\n\"At its core, this project promotes stronger regional communities, and it also has wider benefits for Australian \nmanufacturing and industry more broadly,\" she said.\nThe expansion will inflame environmentalists, who oppose any new gas drilling. But Australia's east coast faces a \nlooming crisis as offshore gas from Victoria's Bass Strait - the traditional bedrock of the country's supplies - rapidly \ndepletes.\nThe Australian Energy Market Operator has warned the country must urgently unlock new supplies to prevent a \ncatastrophic shortfall but new developments are struggling to secure regulatory approvals and/or the support of \nlocal communities.\nAnalysts have warned the country's $2.5 trillion economy will be significant harmed by a shortfall. The \nmanufacturing sector is particularly exposed with gas its only viable energy source, and any interruptions could \nthreaten their viability.\nHouseholds could also be disrupted. Victoria is the most gas-dependent state, relying on the fuel source to heat \nhomes, and a shortfall could make heating prohibitively expensive.\nOther states will also be hit. Gas is used as a so-called peaker, burnt to provide electricity during periods of high \ndemand or low supply from other fossil fuels or renewables. If Australia's National Electricity Market has insufficient \ngas on hand, the price of electricity will spike. Higher electricity bills was a key driver behind Australia's spike in \ninflation, which in turn forced the Reserve Bank of Australia to raise interest rates 13 times.\nWith a looming shortfall, gas developers have insisted governments fast-track applications, a request that the \nfederal Labor government has refused - insisting it must properly assess each application. The gas industry has \naccused the government of slow walking, which indicates its support for gas - a claim denied by Labor.\nLoad-Date: August 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
