Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Street Talk; Pg. 16\nLength: 390 words\nByline: Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood and Emma Rapaport\nBody\nAn unnamed buyer was seeking to acquire at least 10 per cent of West Australian gold explorer Spartan \nResources (n&#xE9;e Gascoyne Resources) after yesterday's closing bell, sending out Citi's equities desk to \nround up the shares.\nPotential sellers were told to bid in 1\u00a2 increments from an 82\u00a2 floor to a maximum of 89\u00a2 per Spartan share. That \nrepresented a nil to 8.5 per cent premium to the last close.\nA term sheet seen by Street Talk said the \"industry participant\" already owned 4.75 per cent of the register and \nwanted to inch up to at least 10 per cent. \"The Acquirer has no current intention to acquire control or make a \ntakeover offer for SPR,\" it added.\nFund managers know it's only would-be-bidders or strategics that lap up shares at a premium to the last close.\nBut in Spartan's case, they might have to wait for a while before the buyer is ready to make a move.\nIn 2021, when it was still called Gascoyne, the company fielded a scrip bid from the now $1.2 billion Westgold \nResources. Nothing came of the talks, and Westgold has since moved on its scrip-and-cash bid for Canada-listed \nKarora Resources.\nInterestingly, another listed gold player, Ramelius Resources, has sniffed around Spartan in the past. Ramelius \nboss Mark Zeptner's made no secret he's on the M&A trail as the company stares down a big production slump in \nFY25, thanks to its ageing Edna May mine.\nSo far this year, Zeptner's had to walk away from Karora - the same company being bought by Westgold. To make \nmatters worse, Ramelius also approached Westgold to explore a $3 billion-plus merger, but was turned back. The \ncompany is now at the Takeovers Panel, nit-picking its rival's Canadian acquisition.\nGiven the recent events, it wouldn't be surprising if Ramelius pops up with a substantial shareholding notice at \nSpartan Resources come this morning. However, fund managers who asked Citi to name last night's buyer were \nmet with silence.\nPage 2 of 2\nMystery buyer raids gold play Spartan's register; Street Talk\nSpartan had a $916.8 million market capitalisation and has run up a whopping 382 per cent in the past 12 months. \nIn April, the company raised $80 million via Canaccord Genuity, Euroz Hartleys and Sternship Advisers. Its share \nprice has been a rollercoaster ride for investors, who have had to sit through a few recaps as its Dalgaranga mine \nstuttered through exploration.\nThe book was to shut at 7pm for Asia Pacific investors.\nLoad-Date: June 27, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOnly output one of these values: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and nothing else.\n                ",
