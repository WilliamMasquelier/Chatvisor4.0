The slip in exports also pushed up \naverage C1 cash costs by 7 per cent, to $US18.93 ($29.08) a tonne.\nAlthough Fortescue said it still expected to meet its annual export guidance, the company said it was likely to come \nin towards the bottom of its 192 to 197 million tonne range.\nBut the company will need a significant performance to meet even that expectation. It will need to export 53.5 \nmillion tonnes in the June quarter.\nFortescue Metals boss Dino Otranto said the company was confident it could hit that rate, despite needing to ship \nat near-record rates.\n\"You can hold a lot of confidence in the performance that we've had over the last six weeks - March was an all-time \nrecord. So we're looking pretty good for the remainder of this quarter,\" he said. Fortescue shares closed up 16c to \n$24.76 on Wednesday.\nLoad-Date: April 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
