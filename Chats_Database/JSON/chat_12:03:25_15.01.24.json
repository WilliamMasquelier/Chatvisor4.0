Now. Can you go work on it right now please,\" Clarke messaged Cisco.\nClarke then messaged Mpinganjira:\n\"Yes done bro, I'll go see my mate in an hour or soon when he's (up).\"\nMpinganjira messaged Clarke back about two hours later:\n\"Hey my bro any update yet? His about to start off to head towards this way.\"\nClarke then messaged Cisco and told him he needed the kilo \"ASAP\".\n\"Need to get this deal bro whether we make money on this one or not,\" Clarke said.\nThe court heard Cisco confirmed he was \"meeting his supplier in 15 minutes\" but then said the meet \"fell through\".\nClarke and Cisco swapped messages with \"ideas about where they could obtain the cocaine\".\nCisco also told Clarke to \"be patient\".\n\"Bro its not about being patient,\" Clarke responded.\n\"Its I need a key now ... bro ... I do not want to let this guy (down) then we loose (sic) out big time ...
