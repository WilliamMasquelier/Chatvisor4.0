To achieve the 2030 target, it \nwould need to \"swap out hundreds of pieces of diesel mining equipment at the end of their life with zero-emissions \nalternatives\".\n\"As the global mining industry continues to evolve, we're proud to be at the forefront of driving innovation in value-\nadding green technology and showing the world that industry can decarbonise,\" he said.\nMr Dongsheng said XCMG now offered electric options across its entire product range, with new energy products \naccounting for 18 per cent of revenue.\nIn September, Fortescue unveiled a $US2.8bn partnership with Europe-based Liebherr to jointly develop zero-\nemission mining machinery. Fortescue expects to purchase about 360 autonomous battery electric trucks, 55 \nelectric excavators and 60 battery powered dozers under the deal with Liebherr.\nLoad-Date: November 27, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"Fortescue's ambitious target to decarbonise the company's iron ore mines by 2030.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Chief Executive of Fortescue Metals | \"Fortescue was moving rapidly to decarbonise the iron ore operations.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Chief Executive of Fortescue Metals | \"To achieve the 2030 target, it would need to swap out hundreds of pieces of diesel mining equipment at the end of their life with zero-emissions alternatives.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Chief Executive of Fortescue Metals | \"As the global mining industry continues to evolve, we're proud to be at the forefront of driving innovation in value-adding green technology and showing the world that industry can decarbonise.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
