It offers exceptional exploration upside, \nwith high-grade drill intercepts and underexplored historical prospects providing a clear path to potential resources. \nIt features multiple high-priority targets requiring immediate follow-up work. \nMarda regional location with greenstone. \nA pivotal step\nLeeuwin executive chair Christopher Piggott said: \"The acquisition of the Marda Gold Project is a pivotal step for \nLeeuwin Metals, delivering significant value with minimal dilution to shareholders. \n\"This advanced gold project in Western Australia provides an exciting growth platform with substantial exploration \npotential. \n\"Marda hosts extensive known mineralisation in and around existing pits. This mineralisation is open and \nrepresents low hanging fruit for our initial exploration campaign. \nPage 2 of 3\nLeeuwin Metals to acquire Marda Gold Project in WA from Ramelius Resources\n\"There are also numerous drilling targets which have been defined by geophysics and limited drilling. There is \nimmense upside at these targets which we will prioritise as part of our resource growth strategy. \n\"The project's strategic location, within trucking distance of multiple gold mills and supported by excellent \ninfrastructure, further enhances its viability. \n\"With granted mining leases included in the acquisition, Leeuwin is well-positioned to rapidly progress discoveries \ninto development. We are excited to commence work programs and look forward to sharing updates as we advance \nthis opportunity into 2025.\"\nExploration ahead\nHistorical exploration at Marda has largely focused on near-mine areas and existing open pits, but Leeuwin says it \nwill prioritise the vast underexplored high-grade potential across the project which remains open and requires \nimmediate follow-up drilling.\nThere are multiple targets within the project area, with the project broken into four main areas: Marda Central, \nMarda North, Marda South and Marda West.\nTargets represent various stages of exploration maturity from resource definition around existing open pits, \nhistorical workings, geochemical anomalies and untested concepts. \nThis will enable Leeuwin to develop multiple work programs for 2025 to advance exploration within the project with \nan initial focus on more advanced target areas.\nMarda Central Mine Trend (Left). Evanston Mine Trend (right). Multiple targets requiring follow up at both \nareas.\nLeeuwin's strategy will focus on defining extensions to high-grade zones across key prospects, supported by \nhistorical un-mined intercepts such as:\n  \n\u2022 2-metres at 16.75g/t gold from 12 metres (NRC043) - Evanston;  \n\u2022 3.6-metres at 16.4g/t gold from I metre (EDM003) - Evanston;  \n\u2022 8-metres at 5.76 g/t gold from 8 metres (ERC147) - Evanston;  \n\u2022 5-metres at 7.47g/t gold from 120 metres (MKC003) - Mt King;  \n\u2022 4-metres at 7.27g/t gold from 70 metres (MKC006) - Mt King;  \n\u2022 1-metre at 15.84g/t gold from 47 metres (MRC248) - Taipan; and  \n\u2022 1-metre at 27.75g/t gold from 31 metres (MAR111) - Taipan.\nMarda Central prospects.\nLeeuwin plans to immediately commence follow-up exploration programs to prioritise near-term drill targets across \nthe project.\nThe acquisition\nLM1 entered into a binding share sale agreement with Ramelius to acquire 100% of Marda Operations, which owns \nthe Marda Gold Project.\nThe company believes that the acquisition represents significant value for its shareholders, with an upfront \nconsideration of $500,000 in Leeuwin shares to be issued to Ramelius upon completion.\nAdditional milestone payments, payable in cash, include:\n  \n\u2022 Milestone 1: $500,000 upon the definition of a JORC-compliant resource of 500,000 ounces; and  Page 3 of 3\nLeeuwin Metals to acquire Marda Gold Project in WA from Ramelius Resources\n\u2022 Milestone 2: $1,000,000 upon the definition of a JORC-compliant resource of 1 million ounces.\nUpon completion of the acquisition, Ramelius will become a strategic shareholder in Leeuwin, reinforcing alignment \nand positioning both companies for potential future collaborative growth opportunities.\nLoad-Date: December 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
