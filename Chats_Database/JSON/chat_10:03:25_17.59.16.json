Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 6\nLength: 609 words\nByline: Tom Rabe\nBody\nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue has warned Australia risks losing its place in the global steel supply chain to Africa, \nBrazil and Europe without government and industry ramping up efforts to develop a green iron plan for the \nresource-rich Pilbara.\nWestern Australia's low- to medium-grade iron ore is facing increased competition from higher grades overseas, \nand the country has little chance of replacing revenue lost to those developing markets, Fortescue said in a \nsubmission to the Senate inquiry into the Albanese government's Future Made in Australia policy.\n\"Fortescue is concerned that without the Australian government, WA government and industry uniting to develop a \nfocused and funded green iron plan for the Pilbara, the nation runs the risk of losing its long-established and high \nearning place in the global steel supply chain,\" the submission said.\nFortescue said the Pilbara must transition from low-grade haematite production to high grade green iron production \nwith the help of widespread government investment.\n\"Pilbara iron ore is facing increased competition from higher-grade ores in Africa, Brazil and Europe, and green \nmetals processing locations being established in the Middle East,\" it said.\nThe mining giant's submission also urged the federal government to tread carefully in developing its national \ninterest, given the importance of Chinese investment. \"We encourage the Australian government to find the right \nbalance regarding national interest considerations and continuing to support foreign investment and trade where it \nbrings significant economic and emissions reductions opportunities to Australia,\" the submission said.\nA key hurdle to a viable green iron industry in WA is access to renewable energy infrastructure, WA Chamber of \nMinerals and Energy chief executive Rebecca Tomkinson said.\n\"We need governments to be making bold decisions, big investment decisions now,\" she added.\n\"We don't do an energy transition, and we don't decarbonise and address our scope three emissions in our industry \nwithout there being a co-ordinated effort across state, federal governments making big infrastructure investments.\" \nPage 2 of 2\nSteel risk without green push, says Fortescue\nMs Tomkinson said the government needed to invest in major common-user infrastructure that would benefit a \nvariety of industries.\n\"Without affordable energy, cheap decarbonised energy, we can't do any of it,\" she said of the green iron push.\nAsked about Fortescue's push for more federal assistance to promote green iron in WA, Premier Roger Cook said: \n\"WA is best-positioned to support a low-carbon steel project given our vast reserves of iron ore, mature and \nadvanced iron ore industry, local technological know-how, and significant renewable energy opportunities.\n\"Further opportunities to reduce emissions across the steel-making supply chain are applicable if plants can be \nlocated near renewable energy precincts.\" Mr Cook said in May he wanted WA to become the \"California of \nAustralia,\" using magnetite and renewable energy to create a green iron future.\nA key pillar of Anthony Albanese's re-election pitch to voters, the Future Made in Australia Act, proposes the use of \ngovernment grants, loans and investments to encourage advanced manufacturing and green energy.\nThe Senate committee received scores of submissions from the private sector, with miners including BHP and \nFortescue both warning against duplication of government approvals processes.\nWhile broadly supporting the policy, the Fortescue submission said the government could use it to create more \npolicies that would better help develop a green iron industry. A government discussion paper estimated that the \nsector could be worth up to $120 billion.\nLoad-Date: August 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
