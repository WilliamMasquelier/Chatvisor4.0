They need to keep on building their cities but if they can do it in a way that doesn't cause any harm then they're going to take that shot.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Chief Executive of Fortescue Metals | \"Hydrogen and fuels made using renewable energy will have a role to play in decarbonising mining, whether it's in buses, heavy mining equipment such as haul trucks and excavators, or producing green iron.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder of Fortescue | \"This program has really been a game changer for us and it wouldn't be where it is today without the dedication of all of you - our First Nations business partners, and the incredible Fortescue team driving forward this initiative.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
