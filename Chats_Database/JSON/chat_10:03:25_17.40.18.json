Auric's latest 822m campaign followed up on a \\nsignificant historic drillhole by Tychean that returned 25m grading 1.67g/t gold from just 44m.\\n'The Fugitive Prospect is midway between two prominent, high-grade gold deposits; Wattle Dam and Spargos \\nReward at Spargoville.'\\nAuric Mining managing director Mark English\\nThe prospect sits in a good neighbourhood with the 185,000-ounce Spargos Reward gold deposit just 8km to the \\nnorth and the 266,000-ounce Wattle Dam gold deposit only 8km to the south-east.\\nAuric Mining managing director Mark English said: \\\"The Fugitive Prospect is midway between two prominent, high-\\ngrade gold deposits; Wattle Dam and Spargos Reward at Spargoville. Our first-pass drilling has highlighted \\nsimilarities with both deposits.

As part of its latest mining \\nprogram, more than 30,000 dry metric tonnes were processed for its joint venture (JV) partner BML Ventures at a \\nreconciled head grade of 1.44g/t at the Greenfields Mill in Coolgardie.\\nThe partnership produced more than 9740 ounces during two mining campaigns last year, returning a total gold \\nrevenue of $29.28 million.\\nAuric plans to put its surplus cash to work by continuing with the development of its nearby Munda gold deposit, \\nalongside broader exploration.

Nothing came of the talks, and Westgold has since moved on its scrip-and-cash bid for Canada-listed \\nKarora Resources.\\nInterestingly, another listed gold player, Ramelius Resources, has sniffed around Spartan in the past.

However, judging by the trading in \\nSpartan Resources, it appears Ramelius's interest lies elsewhere.\\nThe Australian listed gold miner that last year held merger talks with near-by rival Westgold Resources told the \\nmarket on Thursday it had purchased 8.9 per cent of the $994m listed gold miner Spartan after a major holding \\nfrom Tembo Capital was on offer through Citi.\\nHowever, it added that it had no current intention to acquire control or make a takeover of the business that owns \\nthe Dalgaranga Gold Project, 65km northwest of Mt Magnet in Murchison, Western Australia, where Ramelius \\nowns a gold processing hub.\\nStill, it gives Ramelius deal certainty should it be keen to move in on the target in the future.\\nDataRoom reported in April that Spartan was on the radar of Ramelius. Spartan was previously called Gascoyne \\nand had to undergo a string of emergency equity raisings since 2019 following losses, with a mill far bigger than its \\nproduction capacity being its downfall.\\nThe strategic move by Ramelius resembles Silver Lake's with Red 5, buying 11 per cent last year ahead of a scrip \\nmerger deal later with the $1.2bn company.\\nThe share price of Red 5 post the merger has been lagging, down about 20 per cent in the past month and taking \\nits market value to $2.5bn.

The ASX 200 hit a record high of \\n8083.7 points as the top end of town continued to flourish.\\nBody\\nGreen shoots and blue skies.\\nCould it be that a difficult couple of years for small-cap companies are now starting to make their way - finally - into \\nthe rear-vision mirror? Well, the signs are good, at least, after stock exchange highs emerged this week.\\nThe ASX 200, for example, hit an all-time record of 8083.7 points during the week, largely on a growing expectation \\nthat interest rate cuts are coming in the United States on the back of the Federal Reserve's optimism that inflation is \\nreturning to target levels.\\nThe big companies - such as the Commonwealth Bank, which hit a record share price high of $134.25 this week - \\nhave been surfing the crest of the bull wave. Major banks, tech stocks and health care companies have also been \\ndonning their boardies and bikinis for their time in the sun.\\nSo, is it also now time for the small-caps to start lathering up with the Reef Oil? Many would be hoping that the \\nmore-than-solid ASX runs for the four companies appearing in this edition of Bulls N' Bears Runners of the Week is \\na sign of better times to come for those in the shallower end of the pool.\\nThis week's Runners all centre around the red and yellow metals - for the uninitiated, that means copper and gold - \\nwhich, like the ASX this week, are testing all-time highs. Traders cashing in on the pending US interest rate cuts \\npumped the gold price to dizzying record levels of more than US$2480 (AU$3700) an ounce, while the global glut \\nfor quality copper and copper assets continues as the red metal's price also remains near all-time highs.\\nSo, to our Runners and taking out top spot this week is DGR Global, which enjoyed a sharp price hike of 290 per \\ncent from a previous close of 1c, launching to a 3.9c high. The company surged in valuation on the strength of its \\n6.6 per cent shareholding in TSX-listed copper-gold developer SolGold.\\nLate Monday night, SolGold confirmed it had secured a US$750 million (AU$1120 million) funding package to \\nprogress its tier-one Cascabel copper-gold project in northern Ecuador. The company claims the project is the \\nbiggest undeveloped Latin American copper asset that is not in the hands of a major.\\nThe operation has a mammoth measured and indicated resource of more than 19.1 million tonnes of copper \\nequivalent.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nASX leads way to better market times ahead\\nThe funding package from North American syndicate Franco Nevada and Osisko Royalties validates an estimated \\nUS$3.2 billion (AU$4.78 billion) net present value (NPV) at an after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 24 per cent as \\noutlined in SolGold's prefeasibility study (PFS) in March. Interestingly, the study is comprised of some conservative \\nmetals prices for copper at US$3.85 (AU$5.75) per pound and gold at US$1750 (AU$2611) per ounce.\\nThe syndicate has no doubt run some back-of-the-envelope calculations in its valuations, perhaps using the recent \\nall-time price highs for copper and gold, which are more than 25 per cent and 40 per cent higher than those used in \\nthe PFS, respectively.A close second placing this week goes to Labyrinth Resources, which jumped 280 per cent \\nafter revealing its plan to acquire 100 per cent of two gold projects in Western Australia's Goldfields region. The \\nwell-timed announcement, which saw the company's stock rise from a 0.5c close last week to 1.9c, coincided with \\ngold hitting its record high.\\nThe deal will see Labyrinth acquire Ramelius Resources' Vivien gold project and also affords it the option to \\nacquire the remaining 49 per cent of its Comet Vale gold project.\\nComet Vale, just 32km south of Menzies next to the Goldfields Highway, features a recently-updated mineral \\nresource of 96,000 ounces at 4.8 grams per tonne gold. Labyrinth is aiming to bolster the high-grade resource \\ninventory and capitalise on its new underexplored, high-grade mines.\\nA 4.8g/t gold resource is nothing to poke a stick at by WA standards. Just last month, emerging Murchison major \\nWestgold Resources penned a\\\"strategic alliance\\\" agreement with junior explorer Ora Gold to gain access to its \\n240,000-ounce Crown Prince deposit that runs at an impressive 4.1g/t.\\nLabyrinth has also raised $2 million through a placement and will present existing shareholders with an additional \\n$2 million entitlement offer to support its endeavours to expand its high-grade resources and hopefully follow in \\nOra's footsteps.\\nTaking out bronze, a fitting alloy for a story with a majority copper flavour, is Miramar Resources.

The project is situated in a highly fertile greenstone belt with numerous gold deposits and abundant \\ngold occurrences nearby. The Coogee, Salt Creek, Daisy-Milano and Lucky Bay gold deposits, plus the major St \\nIves gold camp are specifically relevant to exploration of the project. The project tenements have undergone \\nvarying levels of exploration with the discovery of gold in the 1800's at Hogans Find. Modern exploration \\ncommenced in the 1900's by BHP who discovered the Carnilya Hill Nickel deposit. The Coogee gold deposit \\nlocated within the project tenements was discovered in the mid-1990's by Sovereign Resources and was \\nsubsequently mined by Ramelius Resources (ASX : RMS) in 2013. Ramelius mined an open cut pit \\n(approximately 70m deep) at Coogee in 2013, with reported production of 147,400 tonnes at 4.7 g/t Au for a \\nrecovered 20,400 ounces of gold. Processing was at the Burbanks Mill (conventional carbon-in-leach processing \\nfacility), south of Coolgardie with metallurgical recovery of 96.4%\\nGeology and Prospectivity\\nThe project is located in the southern part of the Norseman - Wiluna Greenstone Belt within the Parker Domain of \\nthe Kalgoorlie Terrane (Griffin and Hickman, 1988a). The project is situated in a highly fertile greenstone belt with \\nnumerous gold deposits and abundant gold occurrences nearby. The Coogee, Salt Creek, Daisy-Milano and Lucky \\nBay gold deposits, plus the major St Ives gold camp are specifically relevant to exploration of the project. The \\nCoogee Deposit is hosted within a package of intermediate to felsic volcanics and volcaniclastics, comprising \\ndacite, andesite and rhyolite lithologies. The primary mineralised zone comprises a moderately southwest dipping \\nshear zone at the contact between the dacitic crystal tuff unit and a locally porphyritic andesite flow. Gold is directly \\nassociated with pyrite, which is frequently intergrown with magnetite and high gold values coincide with increased \\npercentages of pyrite and magnetite. Magnetite rich zones have also been intersected, but without pyrite, they do \\nnot host gold mineralisation.\\nCOOGEE WEST E26/177 GEOPHYSICS RESULTS AND TARGETS\\nLocated immediately west of M26/477 the southern half of this tenement covers Lake Lefroy with the northern half \\ncontaining widows of weathered outcrop and Cenozoic cover.

One \\ncompany, however, has remained uncharacteristically quiet.\\nNewmont, the world's top gold producer caught headlines last year for its $26.3 billion merger with Australia's \\nbiggest gold miner Newcrest, forming a $US59.5 billion dual-listed gold stock and pumping its long list of advisers \\nup the M&A league table.\\nAt the time, much was also made of its intention to divest six non-core assets once the acquisition wrapped up in \\nNovember including WA's ageing Telfer gold mine and Havieron, which Newmont operates under a joint venture \\nagreement with Greatland Gold (70 per cent/30 per cent). This was aimed at generating $US2 billion-plus ($3.05 \\nbillion) in cash.\\nWhile the sale of its Akyem gold mine in Ghana has reportedly drawn Chinese interest, investors haven't heard a \\npeep about the local assets. Street Talk understands sell-side adviser Macquarie started preliminary preparation for \\na sale process earlier in the year, but iced the mooted deal after processing operations at Telfer were suspended. \\nHowever, it is understood MacCap's resources bankers are back on the tools, and soft soundings are under way.\\nTelfer is a larger scale, producing asset, but it's best days are behind it. The mine hasn't made a lot of cash over the \\nlast several years and would require a substantial commitment to rehabilitate it. However, its interaction with \\nHavieron is interesting; one has the infrastructure, the other has the orebody. As such, they'll likely be sold together \\nwith estimates around the $500 million mark.\\nGiven its interest in Havieron, Greatland Gold is the obvious buyer. The London-listed firm also has pre-emptive \\nrights, acquired when Newcrest and Greatland began the joint venture in 2020. Street Talk understands the Andrew \\nForrest-backed company has been meeting with fund managers for months, making no secret of the fact they're \\nkeen to consolidate its stake - and would use the associated raise to peg their Australian float. Investor sources told \\nStreet Talk the last time they heard from Greatland was May when they were told the company was still waiting on \\nsale terms from Newmont. Bank of America has been mandated on Greatland's potential ASX-listing.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nNewmont asset sales pegged for year end; Street Talk\\nNorthern Star Resources and Evolution have both indicated a lack of interest in Telfer and Havieron, The \\nAustralian Financial Review wrote in November. A mid-tier name like Genesis Minerals, Ramelius Resources, \\nCapricorn Metals or Gold Road would be more likely candidates given the desire to increase market capitalisation \\nand attract investors.\\nRed 5/Silver Lake is also a contender on the back of it M&A ambitions and sizeable cash balance sheet.\\nLoad-Date: August 25, 2024\\nEnd of Document\",\n    \"media_outlet\": \"Australian Financial Review\"\n  }\n]\n    \n    Provide a comprehensive but not too long paragraph analysis that explains the sentiment trend during this period.

            "content": "The sentiment dip for Ramelius Resources between July 13 and August 22, 2024, appears to be driven by a series of negative developments in its M&A activities and strategic positioning. A key factor was its failed attempt to acquire Karora Resources, which was instead taken over by Westgold Resources, despite Ramelius' objections to the Takeovers Panel (Australian Financial Review, 2024-08-07). Additionally, Ramelius' acquisition of a significant stake in Spartan Resources raised concerns about its strategic direction, with speculation that Spartan's rising valuation might make it too expensive for a full takeover (Australian Financial Review, 2024-08-09). The company also faced setbacks in its broader consolidation efforts, as earlier merger talks with Westgold fell through, and its bid for Karora was unsuccessful (The Australian, 2024-08-06). These events likely contributed to investor uncertainty and a decline in sentiment, as Ramelius struggled to secure a major acquisition while competitors successfully expanded their portfolios.",
