It operates in the Mining, exploration and drilling of gold, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Ramelius Resources based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Ramelius Resources is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Ramelius Resources.\n\nIf Ramelius Resources is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nWestgold snaps up Karora\nWestgold snaps up Karora\nThe Daily Telegraph (Australia)\nApril 9, 2024 Tuesday\nTelegraph Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 20\nLength: 320 words\nByline: Nick Evans\nBody\nAustralia's mid-tier gold consolidation has taken another step forward, with Westgold Resources agreeing to a \n$1.1bn deal to acquire Karora Resources, after WA rival Ramelius walked away from talks with the Canadian-\nlisted gold producer.\nThe deal will add Karora's Beta Hunt and Higginsville gold operations to Westgold's stable of producing assets, in a \nmove targeted at pushing the company's annual production to more than 400,000 ounces.\nIf the deal is consummated, Westgold will issue 2.52 of its shares for each Karora share, plus pay 68c in cash. \nKarora holders will also get a share in a new company that will hold its 22 per cent stake in lithium hopeful Kali \nMetals.\nThe Westgold deal comes only a week after Westgold rival Ramelius Resources walked away from talks with the \nCanadian-listed miner, saying that no agreement on valuation could be reached.\nWestgold boss Wayne Bramwell said the company had been monitoring Karora's position for some time, and had \nagreed to a deal as a play on the future of the company's Beta Hunt mine.\nWestgold sold the Higginsville mine and processing plant to Karora (then known as RNC Minerals) in 2019 for \n$50m in cash and shares, but Mr Bramwell said the growth potential at Beta Hunt was the key to the transaction.\n\"We've been underground at Beta Hunt and we see that there is a massive opportunity. There is the bolt-on cash \nflow - once we complete this transaction the combined business will produce 400,000 ounces a year, unhedged,\" \nhe said. And we're absolutely confident that Beta Hunt can be bigger and higher grade, because we think it's under-\ndrilled.\" Westgold expects its operations to produce about 225,000 ounces in the current financial year. Westgold \nshareholders will control 50.1 per cent of the combined company.\nKarora shareholders will vote on the agreement in June, with a 67 per cent majority needed to seal the merger. \nWestgold shares closed 1c lower at $2.27.\nPage 2 of 2\nWestgold snaps up Karora\nLoad-Date: April 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Ramelius Resources.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
