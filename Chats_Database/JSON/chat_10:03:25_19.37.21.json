Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 4\nLength: 555 words\nByline: Tom Rabe\nBody\nFortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto has called on the Albanese government to fast-track a review of its \nclimate safeguard mechanism which he said was \"entirely compromised\" by diesel tax credits and holding back the \nmining industry from decarbonising.\nThe mining giant also warned the West Australian government against palming off responsibility for local \ngreenhouse emissions to Canberra, and said if the state wanted to streamline approvals it should instead prioritise \ngreen projects over traditional mining developments.\nMr Otranto said the state government needed to resist the allure of leaving policing of greenhouse emissions to the \nCommonwealth via the safeguard mechanism, an instrument he believes is compromised by the diesel fuel tax \ncredit.\n\"Putting all the focus on the safeguard mechanism to address emissions reduction in WA is concerning,\" Mr Otranto \ntold The Australian Financial Review.\n\"In the mining sector, the safeguard mechanism is entirely compromised by other initiatives such as the diesel fuel \ntax credit. We encourage the federal government to bring forward its review, so the mining sector can focus on \ninvesting in decarbonisation.\"\nThe safeguard mechanism is slated for review in 2026-27.\nCalls for a review mark an escalation in Fortescue's attack on the diesel tax credit system, which allows mining \ncompanies to claim a tax rebate when the diesel is used on private roads.\nFortescue's director of global sustainability and external affairs, Bronwyn Grieve, earlier this month told the \nFinancial Review the government should consider tying the lucrative fuel tax credit to decarbonisation efforts for \nmajor miners.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue pushes Canberra for emissions safeguard review Exclusive\nFortescue argues the cost incurred by companies paying for Australian carbon credit units when they don't meet \nprescribed emission reduction levels under the safeguard mechanism are outweighed by the value of the diesel fuel \ntax.\nBut Productivity Commission commissioner Barry Sterland said the policy was working to prompt big emitters to \nreflect on their emission abatement opportunities.\nHe said while the commission wanted to see the safeguard mechanism expanded to cover more industrial players \nand heavy transport, he did not believe it was being undermined by fuel credits.\n\"I don't think that necessarily works at cross purposes, I think there's a different complex argument to be had about \nthe transport fuel space,\" Mr Sterland told The Australian Financial Review Energy and Climate Summit in Sydney. \n\"I think, regardless, the safeguard sends a signal into that sector.\"\nThe call for a shake-up of the safeguard mechanism comes a week after the WA government announced it would \nstrip its environment protection agency of the power to assess mining and other major project applications on their \nemissions.\nThe government cited legal advice that suggested the Commonwealth should be responsible.\nThe move, which the government argued would reduce duplicative assessments between the state and federal \nsystems, was lauded by the WA mining lobby and energy giant Woodside, but condemned by environmental groups \nand the Greens.\nAsked whether the federal government would consider bringing forward its review, a spokeswoman for Climate \nChange and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the safeguard mechanism was driving down emissions from the \nnation's biggest industrial facilities.\nLoad-Date: October 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
