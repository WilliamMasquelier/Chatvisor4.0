BHP shareholders on Wednesday night were taking \nthe view that the negotiations with its takeover target Anglo American would probably result in a compromise. But \nAnglo American has slammed the door shut on further talks by failing to extend the deadline for BHP to make a firm \nbid in an announcement that followed its earlier increased bid.\nBHP had tried to show that it was moving to allay concerns around risks in South Africa related to its deal.\nAnother week would have allowed Anglo American time to work through the issues further.\nBut some believe BHP should have even gone as far as underwriting the transaction by taking the South African \nKumba iron ore operation from Anglo American shareholders as part of the deal, rather than returning it to them as \nplanned, BHP could combine it with some coal mines in a sale process down the track and potentially achieve a \nbetter price for the assets.\nAs reported on Wednesday, among BHP's efforts to allay fears surrounding structure was the offer of a \"reverse \nbreak fee\", and it had offered direct responses to Anglo's concerns, including offering the South African government \na three-year guarantee to maintain staffing levels in the country, sharing any costs of employee share schemes, \nand establishing a mining centre of excellence in South Africa to train mine workers and conduct research and \ndevelopment for BHP's global mining operations.\nElsewhere, an odd application to the Takeovers Panel revealed to the market on Wednesday shows that mergers \nand acquisitions remain on the agenda for Ramelius Resources.\nPage 2 of 2\nBHP shareholders remain hopeful of deal on takeover despite rebuff from Anglo American - DATA ROOM\nThe gold miner led by Mark Zeptner is seen as a sophisticated operator that will soon be more cashed-up than it \nalready is and has executed well on M&A in the past, so the market would probably support any deal it puts \nforward.\nIt walked away from a deal to buy Canadian gold miner Karora, with which Westgold Resources has agreed to \nembark on a $2.2bn merger transaction.\nBut judging by the Takeovers Panel application, it appears that Ramelius is keen to take part in some sort of two-\nway of three-way tie-up with Westgold and/or Karora.\nIt's objecting to the cost of the break fee on Westgold's deal with Karora, which is standard for deals in Canada, and \na one-year standstill agreement Ramelius and Westgold had in place from November.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 25\nLength: 855 words\nByline: Alex Gluyas\nBody\nPeter Edwards is chairman of Victor Smorgon Group and co-chief investment officer of the Global Multi-Strategy \nFund, which has returned 40.6 per cent annually since its 2019 inception. The Melbourne-based firm oversees \nmore than $1 billion in assets.\nThe global fund has returned 22.6 per cent so far this financial year. What has driven that performance? | The fund \ninvests in several themes including gold, automation, decarbonisation, and emerging markets. Over the past three \nmonths, performance has been led by investments in gold and decarbonisation.\nThe largest contributor has been Australian gold miner Red 5, which has moved from developing an asset into \ncommercial production. We've been a substantial shareholder since March 2021, and we have supported it through \nthe development financing phase to its profitable production today.\nJapanese company Hitachi has also added significant returns over the past two years. It's divested its legacy \nconstruction machinery, chemicals, and metals businesses to focus on producing higher margin products with \ngreater returns on capital, and with a higher propensity for cash flow generation. It has also sharpened its focus on \nreturning cash to shareholders and growing dividends per share at a compound annual growth rate of 13.6 per cent \nover the past five years.\nHow much further do you expect the copper price to run and which stocks do you own? | We expect that copper \ndemand will remain strong, with price upside driven by structural supply constraints.\nWe like miners with strong leadership and proven records in creating shareholder returns and value low \njurisdictional risk and higher-grade orebodies with expansion potential.\nFor producing companies, we like Canadian miners Lundin Group and Capstone Copper.\nAnother company we support is US-based mineral exploration company Ivanhoe Electric, which is developing the \nSanta Cruz project and exploring for new major copper deposits in North America.\nPage 2 of 2\nThe stocks fuelling Victor Smorgon's 40pc returns Fundie Q&A\nWe are also involved in BMC Minerals, which is developing one of the most exciting volcanogenic massive sulphide \n(sources of copper, zinc, gold, silver) districts globally.\nDo you expect the disconnect between gold prices and mining stocks to abate? Which stocks are best positioned? | \nWe have noticed that a large majority of recent gold demand has come from BRICS nations, which are increasingly \ntransacting with each other in their local currencies and settling the surplus with physical gold. This demand from \nnon-Western buyers will continue to support the gold price.\nWestern gold investors are preferring to invest in gold mining equities, and are less enthused by the gold bull \nmarket, which has created this disconnect. If this trend continues, we believe it's more likely that gold equities will \nreflect the gold price.\nHistorically, the bottom of the cycle typically sees gold mining equities trade at a discount to the spot gold price and \nhistoric average multiples. As the cycle peaks, analysts start to imply a forward price greater than spot, and a \nmarket multiple above average.\nAssuming the future rhymes with history, the greatest gains will be with smaller, higher-cost gold producers and \nexplorers. For this reason, we like Ramelius Resources and Canada's Agnico Eagle.\nWhat's a stock you're bullish on that investors might not have heard of? | Copper miner Metals Acquisition listed on \nthe ASX this year after acquiring the NSW CSA copper mine in 2023. It's run by Mick McMullen, who has a track \nrecord of turning around major mining companies globally.\nWe believe the company's inception as a US-listed special purpose acquisition company and the capital structure \ntied to its initial acquisition has turned many potential investors away. Additionally, CSA was previously owned by \nGlencore, whose exit likely led people to perceive that the asset is of low quality.\nHowever, we view Glencore's retained equity in Metals Acquisition as an endorsement of the asset and \nacknowledgement that the business will improve under a focused management team. The company has recently \ntaken several steps to simplify and improve its balance sheet which we also see as accretive.\nWhat's a stock you'd like to own but can't (for whatever reason)? | Semiconductors are a critical resource of the \nmodern world. With this view, ASML is a company that if it traded back to our target buy level, it would be added to \nthe portfolio.\nThe company has a dominant position in the semiconductor lithography market, benefiting from pricing power and \nstrong customer relationships, and is poised to continue benefiting from the increased demand for computing \npower.\nWhat is your favourite local restaurant and your go-to order? | A local favourite restaurant is Terrace cafe, inside the \nBotanic Gardens. Great place to be on a beautiful day, and the chicken avocado salad is delicious.\nAre there any podcasts that you'd recommend? | I spend a bit of time in the car, so love a good podcast. Currently, \nI'm listening to Pivot by Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway, The Grant Williams Podcast, and the Australian Strategic \nPolicy Institute have recently launched a weekly show called Stop the World.\nLoad-Date: June 2, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Alex Gluyas\nDate: May 31, 2024\nTitle: The stocks fuelling Victor Smorgon's 40pc returns Fundie Q&A\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Auric to home in on intriguing gold target in WA Goldfields\n## Media outlet: The Sydney Morning Herald\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: June 04, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nAuric to home in on intriguing gold target in WA Goldfields\nAuric to home in on intriguing gold target in WA Goldfields\nThe Sydney Morning Herald (Australia) - Online\nJune 4, 2024 Tuesday 6:23 AM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Auric's latest 822m campaign followed up on a \nsignificant historic drillhole by Tychean that returned 25m grading 1.67g/t gold from just 44m.\n'The Fugitive Prospect is midway between two prominent, high-grade gold deposits; Wattle Dam and Spargos \nReward at Spargoville.'\nAuric Mining managing director Mark English\nThe prospect sits in a good neighbourhood with the 185,000-ounce Spargos Reward gold deposit just 8km to the \nnorth and the 266,000-ounce Wattle Dam gold deposit only 8km to the south-east.\nAuric Mining managing director Mark English said: \"The Fugitive Prospect is midway between two prominent, high-\ngrade gold deposits; Wattle Dam and Spargos Reward at Spargoville. Our first-pass drilling has highlighted \nsimilarities with both deposits. We're looking forward to the next phase when we will get the opportunity to test that \nmodel.\"\nThe company already has plans for air-core (AC) drilling towards the centre of the Fugitive target to infill the current \n100m spacing in the area. A follow-up RC campaign is also being planned beneath the historic and latest drillholes \nPage 2 of 2\nAuric to home in on intriguing gold target in WA Goldfields\nto target the mineralised zone in fresh rock at about 75m to 100m below surface - similar to where high grades \noccur at the nearby Wattle Dam deposit.\nJust last week, Auric netted nearly $4.46 million in gross revenue from its first mining campaign of the year at its \nJeffreys Find project in the Goldfields after selling 1256 gold ounces to the Perth Mint. As part of its latest mining \nprogram, more than 30,000 dry metric tonnes were processed for its joint venture (JV) partner BML Ventures at a \nreconciled head grade of 1.44g/t at the Greenfields Mill in Coolgardie.\nThe partnership produced more than 9740 ounces during two mining campaigns last year, returning a total gold \nrevenue of $29.28 million.\nAuric plans to put its surplus cash to work by continuing with the development of its nearby Munda gold deposit, \nalongside broader exploration. That now appears likely to include follow-up drilling at Spargoville, with results from \nthe company's latest campaign at the Fugitive prospect delivering several promising new targets.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Ordell is chaired by Tommy \nMcKeith, who stepped down as Genesis chair in 2022.\nAnd Ordell's main exploration project, Barimaia, also comes from Genesis, which will emerge with a 9 per cent \nstake in the explorer after the float as part of an agreement to sell the tenements.\nBarimaia sits a stone's throw from Ramelius Resources' Mt Magnet operations, and in a district that's seen a fair \nbit of corporate interest in recent times as Ramelius and Westgold jostle for position.\nThe project was previously drilled by both IGO and Genesis, and Ordell's prospectus shows pretty solid historical \nintercepts, including 15m at 11.4 grams a tonne gold, 17m at 3.4 grams a tonne, and 70m at 0.68 grams a tonne.\nBut the company now reckons the work conducted by Ramelius at its nearby deposit offers a better geological \ninterpretation for Barimaia and hopes to have better luck hanging a resource off previous drilling by targeting the \nnext round a bit better.\nOrdell also plans to spend a bit of its exploration cash at its Goodia Project, 15km southwest of Norseman - an area \nonce best known for gold, but now the subject of lithium interest.",
