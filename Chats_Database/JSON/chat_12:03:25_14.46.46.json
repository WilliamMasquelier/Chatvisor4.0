Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nTunnel duty was the worst job in Vietnam\nTunnel duty was the worst job in Vietnam\nThe Courier Mail (Australia)\nAugust 4, 2024 Sunday\nCourierMail Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: AGENDA; Pg. 68\nLength: 747 words\nByline: Jayne Keogh\nBody\nWAY WE WERE with Jayne Keogh\nImagine standing looking down a deep, dark hole in the ground in the middle of the jungle, knowing that the enemy \nwho have been killing your mates, the Viet Cong, are down there beneath your feet. It is your job to climb into that \ndirty tunnel head-first and crawl along with a torch and a handgun and sometimes a telephone line to communicate \nwith your mates on the ground.\nYou have been chosen because you are tough, short and slim, similar to the enemy, but at times your shoulders \nscrape the sides.\nIt is pitch black, smells like sewerage, and is cloyingly hot. It is hard to breathe as you get further into the abyss and \nyou wonder if you will run out of air or breathe poison gas.\nYou have a huge adrenaline rush as you edge into the hole, on high alert, in readiness to face the mortal danger of \nbooby traps, grenades or a gunfight with the enemy.\nThe bomb, which is disguised as a Coke can, must be defused in the dark or you will be blown to bits.\nThere were no good jobs in the Army in the Vietnam War. If you were there as a regular, a conscript or as an \nentertainer, then you served your country. But most in the military would agree that the worst job in the Army was \nthe 'Tunnel Rats', or officially the 1, 2 and 3 Field Troop, 1st Field Squadron, Royal Australian Engineers.\nThese are the men who went bush with the Armoured Corps and Infantry, staying out in the jungle for four to six \nweeks as Infanteers, both engineers and infantrymen.\nThey carried out mine and booby trap detection and clearing, tunnel and bunker searching and demolition, plus \nbomb disposal.\nPage 2 of 2\nTunnel duty was the worst job in Vietnam\nThe first tunnels appeared during the Japanese occupation of Vietnam in WWII. When the French Vietnamese War \nbegan in 1946, the use of tunnels by the Viet Minh expanded and the French formed their own specialist units to \nsearch and destroy the deadly pits.\nThen when the Vietnam War broke out in 1967, the Viet Cong created a whole underground network that hid their \nsnipers who shot the Australians and Americans and then disappeared underground.\nThis story is told by one Tunnel Rat, Queenslander John (Joe) Cazey on an oral history recording for the State \nLibrary of Queensland.\nJoe was a regular Royal Australian Engineer, the corps that built roads, bridges and airfields in Vietnam. His unit \nwas the 1st Field Squadron, were also responsible for destroying the tunnels inflicting casualties on our troops.\nOn the 18th of August 1966, Joe witnessed the Battle of Long Tan being waged from 2-3km away, and assisted \nwith running additional ammunition to those involved.\nAnother Queenslander, Bombardier John Burns, was in the thick of it at Long Tan, second in charge of gun Number \n5, 103 Field Battery in the Royal Australian Artillery with seven gunners under his charge.\nHe describes a quiet afternoon at Nui Dat, gunnery secured for the night and on his way to enjoy a cold one.\n\"I didn't even get a sip when the channel barked out 'fire mission regiment' and I just ran to my bay as all hell was \nbreaking loose. D Company RAR was out there on a patrol in the rubber plantation in extreme danger surrounded \nby an estimated 2000 North Vietnamese troops en route to attack the Australian base.\" He loaded shell after shell.\n\"We were working in a fog of burnt cordite and smoke, which couldn't get away because of a heavy downpour. As \nwe fired shell after shell, the gun was white-hot and the troops ran in with ammo and I was worrying that we would \nrun out.\" The fire order 'danger close' was given to him and his blood ran cold. \"The North Vietnamese Army and \nthe Viet Cong were advancing so close to our guys that we had to ensure that our shells didn't hit our own men,\" he \nsaid. \"Your training just kicks in; you are totally focused on the job. Prepare, load, fire, check, adjust, repeat. But \none thing that sticks in my mind is that at one point I looked around. Every single person on base was helping, \nadmin people, cooks, they came from everywhere and I felt so much pride that I was part of this Army. We all were \ntrying to save our mates out there. In doing so, Long Tan probably saved the whole base, had D Company not \nstopped them they could have wiped us out.\" On Vietnam Veterans' Day, the recalling of a single battle on one \nafternoon in August 1966 commemorates and honours all Australians like Joe and John who took part in that \nconflict.\nCONTACT JAYNE KEOGH If you have an idea for a Way We Were feature or want to get in contact, email Jayne \nKeogh at waywewere@news.com.au\nLoad-Date: August 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
