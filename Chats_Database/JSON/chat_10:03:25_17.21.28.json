It's just the latest in a string of takeover plays in the sector both in \nAustralia and abroad as companies look to bulk up on the back of record high gold prices.\nIn Australia this month, one of the biggest gold companies, Northern Star Resources, announced a scrip-only \nmerger with De Grey Mining - which is yet to produce a bar of gold - in a proposed deal to create a $5bn miner. And \nWest Australian gold explorer Spartan Resources announced a $220m capital raising, which it said was for \nexploration and mine development. The company is building up a war chest after itself being the target of fellow \nminer Ramelius Resources, which -grabbed 17.9 per cent of its shares in a surprise raid in July.\nOne of the nation's biggest market makers says there will \"probably\" be more consolidation in the short term. He \ndeclined to be named for this article.\n\"We think it makes sense,\" the unnamed fund manager says. \"There's a big premium for size. Larger companies \ntrade at higher multiples.\" Companies such as Ramelius, Genesis Minerals and Westgold Resources are potential \nbidders for targets such as Spartan, and Vault Minerals and Pantoro, which his firm holds shares in.\nSharing his prediction of takeovers in the gold industry is funds firm Capital Outcomes.\n\"We anticipate further consolidation is likely to occur in the Australian gold market,\" says Capital Outcomes chief \ninvestment officer Emanuel Datt. \"We expect most of the consolidation to occur among the Australian mid-tier gold \nplayers.\" Datt predicts the hunters will be Ramelius, Westgold and Perseus Mining and their targets could be \nSpartan Resources, Bellevue Gold and Predictive -Discovery.\nGold is hot right now (as a pop starlet might say) because the global markets believe risks are rising. Gold is viewed \nas an investment safe haven in a world where the conflict in the Middle East has never looked further from ending, \nPage 2 of 2\nActress with the Midas touch joins gold rush\nthe war in Ukraine continues, and as markets try to predict which countries US president-elect Donald Trump may \nchoose to either punish or praise.\nIn addition, many central banks, such as the People's Bank of China have been buying gold to diversify their \nholdings away from US bond markets.\nPredicted interest rate cuts in Australia and globally may lead to a further hike in the gold prices as investors look to \nescape falling yields from bonds. \"Gold prices remain high with a strong fundamental outlook,\" says Datt.\nThe price of gold hit record highs several times this year, reaching $US2790 in October.\nFor gold companies looking for the scale to attract the attention of large investors, this bullish outlook gives them \nthe confidence to make capital plays that might otherwise seem too risky. \"We have observed an increase in risk \nappetite among the acquirers, case in point being Northern Star acquiring De Greys, which holds a large orebody \nwith a complex processing flowsheet,\" says Datt.\nThe fact that even exploration-only miners are starting to attract greater attention also reflects the increased \ndifficulty of starting new mines. Four months ago, West Australian gold miner Regis Resources saw its $1bn \nproject in NSW blocked by Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek in a surprise Indigenous heritage ruling.\nGoldman Sachs head of metals & mining Gavi Friedland believes the balance is shifting towards companies that \nhave mines or project approvals in place.\n\"We may now see this materialise in an environment where it is generally cheaper to 'buy versus build',\" says \nGoldman Sachs Australia head of metals & mining Gavi Friedland.\n\"The lack of genuine 'bolt-on' growth opportunities means mid-cap miners are considering consolidation to increase \nscale and provide a platform to pursue larger M&A opportunities that may be out of reach today,' he says.\n\"M&A pairing brownfield and greenfield mining deposits with underutilised mills is sensible and comes with synergy \npotential.\" All this predicted gold consolidation relies on the idea gold prices will remain high. So where too next for \nthe gold price?\nIG Senior Technical Analyst Axel Rudolph believes it's likely to go up to as much as $US2900 and potentially hit \n$US3000 in the first quarter of 2025.\n\"The gold price is likely to trade around the $US3000 mark for several months as it represents a major \npsychological resistance level as a round number for many investors,\" Rudolph says. \"Physical gold purchases by \nseveral central banks, and especially by China, are likely to continue until this threshold is reached. Were these \npurchases of gold bullion to continue beyond the $US3000.00 technical level, then $US3113.00 could be reached \nas well.\" It augers well for former Melburnian Valance. The firm she part owns with husband Candy - Metals \nExploration - expects to produce 80,000 ounces of gold from its mines in The Philippines this year and its target \nCondor owns gold mines in Nicaragua. The former actress and singer seems to have a great track record with \ntiming, starring in Neighbours in its prime, sticking to just one well-timed pop album, marrying a property mogul, \nbecoming a very early anti-woke antagonist and backing Trump way back in 2022 when he looked more likely to go \nto jail than become the leader of the free world again.\nLoad-Date: December 20, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Actress with the Midas touch joins gold rush\n## The Australian\n### Tansy Harcourt\n### December 21, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Ramelius Resources, to report.

Ramelius Resources has been actively involved in the consolidation trend within the Australian gold sector, having acquired a significant 17.9% stake in Spartan Resources, indicating its strategic interest in expanding its portfolio amidst rising gold prices.\n\n2. The company is identified as a potential acquirer in the ongoing wave of mergers and acquisitions in the gold industry, with analysts predicting that Ramelius, along with other mid-tier players, will target companies like Spartan Resources and Bellevue Gold for further growth.\n\n3. The current bullish outlook on gold prices, which have reached record highs, is encouraging Ramelius Resources and similar companies to pursue aggressive capital plays, reflecting an increased risk appetite among acquirers in the market.\n\n4. The challenges faced by new mining projects, such as regulatory hurdles exemplified by Regis Resources' blocked project, suggest that established companies like Ramelius may benefit from acquiring existing operations rather than developing new mines from scratch.",
