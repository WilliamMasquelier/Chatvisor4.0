Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: CHANTICLEER; Pg. 40\nLength: 1051 words\nByline: Myriam Robin and Mark di Stefano\nBody\nYoung fogeys of\nprivate clubs unite!\nSpeaking in generalities, the membership of Australia's elite private clubs splits by generation.\nThose who joined when it was just what successful men did are often not particularly fond of gender rules, keen on \nmodernising, or passing on membership to their daughters, should they have any.\nIt can be a rather different situation for younger members. Those under 40 (\"young\" being a relative term here) \njoined when it was explicitly not something most of their generation did.\nBy spending their time at a private membership club over, say, a pricey gym or business networking group, they \nmade a deliberate choice. They don't want female members. And they get very uppity at the old codgers keen on \nfoisting such a thing upon them.\nBeing a young fogey can be isolating. And so, last night in Melbourne, a portion of the memberships of the city's \nfour leading private members clubs gathered at the Athenaeum, where an earlier vote of the membership showed a \ndistinct preference for segregation among the younger set.\nCall it a show of force from conservative members of the Athenaeum Club, Melbourne Club, Australian Club and \nSavage Club. It follows concerns about the salami tactics by which Athenaeum's general committee seemed to be \nallowing women into the place (most recently into the Drawing Room, to align the club with \"proper etiquette and \nsocial norms\").\nAt the dinner, a presentation was planned on the mental health benefits of single-sex spaces. And then, the young \nfogeys would no doubt have compared tactics and strategies.\nAfter all, it's hard being counter-cultural.\nPage 2 of 3\nRear Window Young fogeys of private clubs unite!\nTwiggy's 'ambassador'\nleft holding her bags\nEven as executives fled Fortescue, one didn't leave Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest's side.\nIn August last year, off went CEO Fiona Hick (after six months) and CFO Christine Morris (two months). Guy \nDebelle was out from the board a week later. Some 11 executives had left Fortescue in three years. It was former \nCEO Elizabeth Gaines who stayed.\nTurns out she had so many reasons to! Last year, Fortescue shareholders found out that Gaines' transition from \nnon-executive to executive director as a result of a reshuffle came with a $794,856 one-off exertion payment, \nrelating to her role as Fortescue's first \"global ambassador\".\nThis fee was to compensate for the additional \"work, time and travel commitment\" that came with her emissary \nduties. It was awarded on top of a $1.97 million payment she was given for her CEO reign in 2023, and another \n$1.05 million for FY24.\nThose inducements are unwinding. Yesterday, Gaines' executive director pay was effectively slashed in half to \n$500,000 to reflect a \"reduction in time commitment\" for the former CEO. This is after proxies objected to her pay.\nStill, a decision to remove her travel allowance is a head-scratcher. How can a global ambassador fulfil her duties \naround the, err, globe, if she's left carrying her own bags through Perth International? Could it be that the position \nwas a nebulous panic title that her boss gave her so she wouldn't follow others out the door?\nBesides, if the company had need of a global ambassador, wouldn't it be the bloke spending an inordinate amount \nof time crossing timezones in a private jet? University lectures on lethal humidity. Media hits in the Bloomberg \nLondon studio. Drone shows over Manhattan. Global ambassador for Twiggy is as useful as being spokeswoman \nfor Donald Trump: you may as well wait to hear from the big mouth.\nGaines isn't the only one in line for a pay cut. Former Reserve Bank board member-cum-Village People enthusiast \nMark Barnaba will no longer be the lead independent director on the Fortescue board, where he was paid $1.26 \nmillion for FY24. That duty will soon fall to ex-CSIRO boss Larry Marshall.\nBut there are still plenty of benefits in staying in Twiggy's graces. Both Barnaba and Gaines were added to the \nboard of Western Australia's Greatland Gold in 2022. Two weeks later, it was reported that Twiggy's Wyloo Metals \nhad taken an 8.6 per cent stake in the gold and copper explorer. That's the thing about boardroom jobs, the most \nqualified candidates are so often the ones already in the contact book.\nGaines also sits on the board of the West Coast Eagles. She's there along with Fortescue's new PR chief Nicole \nMoody (another coincidence surely).\nGaines is so well favoured, she's talked about in Perth as the next leader of the influential AFL club. You have to \nwonder if crossing the Nullarbor to watch cellar-dwellers lose at the MCG can hold a candle to flying through Paris.\nJon Adgemis' vintage\nyacht seeks buyers\nWhat's the saying? The two happiest days in a boat owner's life are the day they buy the boat, and the day they sell \nit.\nSo, we arrive at the situation facing embattled publican and ex-KPMG dealmaker Jon Adgemis, who's living an \nintriguing day-to-day life riding the debt markets, holding off creditors, all the while living the life of a budding \nHollywood producer on Sydney Harbour. Imagine the stress!Page 3 of 3\nRear Window Young fogeys of private clubs unite!\nSome of the properties in his Public Hospitality Group have been seized. But in June, Deutsche Bank and New \nYork-headquartered Muzinich came to the rescue with a $400 million refinancing package.\nThat eases the pressure somewhat. For now. But it doesn't mean that Adgemis can't take steps to show things are \nchanging. And that's where the boat comes in.\nHe owns the 95-foot yacht called Hiilani. But unlike some of the more modern craft doing laps of the harbour, his \nHiilani has a distinctly vintage feel. It was once owned by celluloid royalty Shirley Temple.\nNews has reached us that Adgemis is seeking buyers for the yacht, turning to a local dealer to gauge interest. \nOffloading the yacht is part of the owner's quest seeking a more humble, less flashy life, apparently. The seafaring \nelite are hardly affected by the cost-of-living crisis. Though this is too retro a toy for the Bondi plastic set.\nHowever, there's always other ways to extract cash flow. Celeb accountant Anthony Bell's Ghost 2 recently played \na starring role in Ryan Gosling's Fall Guy this year, set around Sydney Harbour. Did the studio pay for the pleasure \nto have the yacht moored in one of the movie's central scenes? Adgemis certainly has new friends in the industry.\nRemember Jon: a ship is safest in the harbour, but it is not built for that.\nLoad-Date: August 31, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
