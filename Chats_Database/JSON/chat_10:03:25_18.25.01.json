Traders cashing in on the pending US interest rate cuts \\npumped the gold price to dizzying record levels of more than US$2480 (AU$3700) an ounce, while the global glut \\nfor quality copper and copper assets continues as the red metal's price also remains near all-time highs.\\nSo, to our Runners and taking out top spot this week is DGR Global, which enjoyed a sharp price hike of 290 per \\ncent from a previous close of 1c, launching to a 3.9c high. The company surged in valuation on the strength of its \\n6.6 per cent shareholding in TSX-listed copper-gold developer SolGold.\\nLate Monday night, SolGold confirmed it had secured a US$750 million (AU$1120 million) funding package to \\nprogress its tier-one Cascabel copper-gold project in northern Ecuador. The company claims the project is the \\nbiggest undeveloped Latin American copper asset that is not in the hands of a major.\\nThe operation has a mammoth measured and indicated resource of more than 19.1 million tonnes of copper \\nequivalent.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nASX leads way to better market times ahead\\nThe funding package from North American syndicate Franco Nevada and Osisko Royalties validates an estimated \\nUS$3.2 billion (AU$4.78 billion) net present value (NPV) at an after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 24 per cent as \\noutlined in SolGold's prefeasibility study (PFS) in March. Interestingly, the study is comprised of some conservative \\nmetals prices for copper at US$3.85 (AU$5.75) per pound and gold at US$1750 (AU$2611) per ounce.\\nThe syndicate has no doubt run some back-of-the-envelope calculations in its valuations, perhaps using the recent \\nall-time price highs for copper and gold, which are more than 25 per cent and 40 per cent higher than those used in \\nthe PFS, respectively.A close second placing this week goes to Labyrinth Resources, which jumped 280 per cent \\nafter revealing its plan to acquire 100 per cent of two gold projects in Western Australia's Goldfields region. The \\nwell-timed announcement, which saw the company's stock rise from a 0.5c close last week to 1.9c, coincided with \\ngold hitting its record high.\\nThe deal will see Labyrinth acquire Ramelius Resources' Vivien gold project and also affords it the option to \\nacquire the remaining 49 per cent of its Comet Vale gold project.\\nComet Vale, just 32km south of Menzies next to the Goldfields Highway, features a recently-updated mineral \\nresource of 96,000 ounces at 4.8 grams per tonne gold. Labyrinth is aiming to bolster the high-grade resource \\ninventory and capitalise on its new underexplored, high-grade mines.\\nA 4.8g/t gold resource is nothing to poke a stick at by WA standards. Just last month, emerging Murchison major \\nWestgold Resources penned a\\\"strategic alliance\\\" agreement with junior explorer Ora Gold to gain access to its \\n240,000-ounce Crown Prince deposit that runs at an impressive 4.1g/t.\\nLabyrinth has also raised $2 million through a placement and will present existing shareholders with an additional \\n$2 million entitlement offer to support its endeavours to expand its high-grade resources and hopefully follow in \\nOra's footsteps.\\nTaking out bronze, a fitting alloy for a story with a majority copper flavour, is Miramar Resources. The company's \\nshare price jumped almost 188 per cent - from 0.8c to 2.3c - after revelations of promising high-grade copper, lead \\nand silver samples from its Joy Helen prospect within its new Chain Pool project in WA's Gascoyne region.\\nThe project, while still not granted, shows plenty of potential after returning rock chip assays going up to 5.49 per \\ncent copper, 42 per cent lead and 73.48g/t silver. Despite the impressive at-surface numbers, management says \\nthe Joy Helen prospect has seen no modern and systematic exploration, nor drilling.\\nThe mineralisation style is interpreted to be \\\"Mississippi Valley-type\\\" and shows some intriguing similarities to its \\nneighbouring Abra lead-zinc-silver deposit that is also hosted in the Irregully rock formation.\\nBut Miramar will be hoping this story doesn't turn out like that of Abra owner Galena Mining, which ran aground \\nearlier this year with debts totalling some $160 million to international lenders because of a poor lead-zinc \\nenvironment. Fortunately for Miramar, copper seems to be the ticket this week and maybe that's what Galena's \\ndeposit was missing.\\nOur final Runner for the week is Stelar Metals, which shot up more than 101 per cent this week on ... yep, you \\nguessed it, copper rock chip samples.\\nHigh-grade copper findings were sampled along a 3km strike at its Baratta project in South Australia, returning \\ngrades of up to 28.7 per cent. It is a region Stelar says shows similarities to the prolific Central African Copper Belt \\n(CACB) - the biggest and most prolific mineralised sediment-hosted copper province known on Earth.\\nThe company reported 21 of the 72 samples exceeding grades of 10 per cent copper, underscoring the potential of \\nthe historically-productive Baratta site featuring a mine that produced copper ore between 1896 and 1904.\\nRather unfortunately for Stelar, the traditional owners in the Adnyamathanha native title organisation remains in \\nadministration. The company says it will continue to monitor the native title situation and will lodge applications for \\ndrilling at Baratta when the traditional owner organisation comes out of administration.Page 3 of 3\\nASX leads way to better market times ahead\\nIf copper is the flavour of the month, then it seems rock chip samples were this week's tipple of the week. Now, we'll \\njust have to wait and see if the all-time highs for the index will overlap with a return of interest to the small end of \\ntown.\\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

And \\nWest Australian gold explorer Spartan Resources announced a $220m capital raising, which it said was for \\nexploration and mine development. The company is building up a war chest after itself being the target of fellow \\nminer Ramelius Resources, which -grabbed 17.9 per cent of its shares in a surprise raid in July.\\nOne of the nation's biggest market makers says there will \\\"probably\\\" be more consolidation in the short term. He \\ndeclined to be named for this article.\\n\\\"We think it makes sense,\\\" the unnamed fund manager says. \\\"There's a big premium for size. Larger companies \\ntrade at higher multiples.\\\" Companies such as Ramelius, Genesis Minerals and Westgold Resources are potential \\nbidders for targets such as Spartan, and Vault Minerals and Pantoro, which his firm holds shares in.\\nSharing his prediction of takeovers in the gold industry is funds firm Capital Outcomes.\\n\\\"We anticipate further consolidation is likely to occur in the Australian gold market,\\\" says Capital Outcomes chief \\ninvestment officer Emanuel Datt. \\\"We expect most of the consolidation to occur among the Australian mid-tier gold \\nplayers.\\\" Datt predicts the hunters will be Ramelius, Westgold and Perseus Mining and their targets could be \\nSpartan Resources, Bellevue Gold and Predictive -Discovery.\\nGold is hot right now (as a pop starlet might say) because the global markets believe risks are rising. Gold is viewed \\nas an investment safe haven in a world where the conflict in the Middle East has never looked further from ending, \\nPage 2 of 2\\nActress with the Midas touch joins gold rush\\nthe war in Ukraine continues, and as markets try to predict which countries US president-elect Donald Trump may \\nchoose to either punish or praise.\\nIn addition, many central banks, such as the People's Bank of China have been buying gold to diversify their \\nholdings away from US bond markets.\\nPredicted interest rate cuts in Australia and globally may lead to a further hike in the gold prices as investors look to \\nescape falling yields from bonds. \\\"Gold prices remain high with a strong fundamental outlook,\\\" says Datt.\\nThe price of gold hit record highs several times this year, reaching $US2790 in October.\\nFor gold companies looking for the scale to attract the attention of large investors, this bullish outlook gives them \\nthe confidence to make capital plays that might otherwise seem too risky. \\\"We have observed an increase in risk \\nappetite among the acquirers, case in point being Northern Star acquiring De Greys, which holds a large orebody \\nwith a complex processing flowsheet,\\\" says Datt.\\nThe fact that even exploration-only miners are starting to attract greater attention also reflects the increased \\ndifficulty of starting new mines. Four months ago, West Australian gold miner Regis Resources saw its $1bn \\nproject in NSW blocked by Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek in a surprise Indigenous heritage ruling.\\nGoldman Sachs head of metals & mining Gavi Friedland believes the balance is shifting towards companies that \\nhave mines or project approvals in place.\\n\\\"We may now see this materialise in an environment where it is generally cheaper to 'buy versus build',\\\" says \\nGoldman Sachs Australia head of metals & mining Gavi Friedland.\\n\\\"The lack of genuine 'bolt-on' growth opportunities means mid-cap miners are considering consolidation to increase \\nscale and provide a platform to pursue larger M&A opportunities that may be out of reach today,' he says.\\n\\\"M&A pairing brownfield and greenfield mining deposits with underutilised mills is sensible and comes with synergy \\npotential.\\\" All this predicted gold consolidation relies on the idea gold prices will remain high. So where too next for \\nthe gold price?\\nIG Senior Technical Analyst Axel Rudolph believes it's likely to go up to as much as $US2900 and potentially hit \\n$US3000 in the first quarter of 2025.\\n\\\"The gold price is likely to trade around the $US3000 mark for several months as it represents a major \\npsychological resistance level as a round number for many investors,\\\" Rudolph says. \\\"Physical gold purchases by \\nseveral central banks, and especially by China, are likely to continue until this threshold is reached. Were these \\npurchases of gold bullion to continue beyond the $US3000.00 technical level, then $US3113.00 could be reached \\nas well.\\\" It augers well for former Melburnian Valance.

The drill intercepts reveal the possibility of an extensive \\nzone of shallow gold mineralisation on the western side of McNabs East, which at this stage remains open at depth \\nand along strike.\\nThe company completed the five hole, 426m diamond drilling program last December as part of an ongoing \\nprogram to systematically test the currently defined 2.5km strike extent of shallow gold mineralisation at Barimaia.\\nResults from the program confirm the existence of a shallow, coherent zone of potentially open-pittable gold \\nmineralisation on the western side of McNabs East, within an extensive gold system that remains untested at depth \\nand open along strike.\\nPage 2 of 4\\nOrdell locks onto new gold zone in Mt Magnet\\nOrdell's flagship Barimaia gold project is an advanced exploration project with significant historical drilling results. \\nOrdell acquired an 80.3 per cent interest in Barimaia from Genesis Minerals, which is now a major shareholder of \\nOrdell with an 8 per cent interest.\\nHowever, Barimaia was never fully explored by Genesis due to its other commitments, although the company \\nsuccessfully identified an extensive gold system at the project, supported by historical RC drilling results pointing to \\ngood shallow open pit potential.\\nThe project is strategically located within a stone's throw of at least three gold processing plants, including the \\nadjacent Ramelius Resources' Mt Magnet mill, 70km from Spartan Resources' Dalgaranga mill and 80km from \\nWestgold Resources' Tuckabianna mill.\\nThe company is planning to launch a more extensive program of about 5000m of reverse circulation drilling at \\nBarimaia in February. The upcoming program will include infill drilling at McNabs East to close up the current 100m \\ndrill section spacing and will also include first-pass extensional drilling in areas where previous air-core (AC) drilling \\nwas undertaken in 2019 and 2021.\\nAdditionally, the new program will test depths between 100m and 200m in selected areas and will also include \\nadditional AC drilling east and north of the currently defined mineralisation at McNabs.\\nOrdell says drilling of the McNabs East western zone will comprise a significant part of the company's big drilling \\nprogram slated for February.\\n------------------\\nSierra Nevada Gold (ASX:SNX)\\nHit: 4.88m at 481g/t silver, 0.61g/t gold, 0.6 per cent copper and 0.4 per cent antimony from 87.78m.\\nSierra Nevada Gold's Phase 1 reverse-circulation (RC) drilling at its Endowment Mine within the overall Blackhawk \\nepithermal project area pulled up a big silver hit while targeting a remnant ore position between the 3rd and 4th \\nmine levels on the historic Endowment Vein.\\nThe headline drill hit from the latest campaign is 4.88m at 481g/t silver, 0.61g/t gold, 0.6 per cent copper and 0.4 \\nper cent antimony from 87.78m\\nThe vein was targeted based on indications from historic mine records pointing to part of the vein not having been \\nmined, with drilling successfully spearing through an inter-stope zone to jag the vein which remains open down-\\nplunge to the east.\\nThe Endowment Mine is the biggest of the historic mines in the locality and was initially mined in the 1860s, with \\nmost mining completed by the 1880s and a total production being reported of 70,000 ounces of gold equivalent.\\nThe operation's inability to process sulphide ores and prevailing depressed economic conditions led to the \\ncessation of mining in the 1920s, although mineralisation remains within reach of current infrastructure.\\nNotably, the area has seen little modern-day exploration before Sierra Nevada Gold acquired the ground, with the \\nlatest prior exploration in the area being undertaken in the mid to late 1980s by American Gold Resources.\\nThe focus of recent exploration has been on defining shallow oxide gold and silver deposits, with two shallow oxide \\nresources being estimated by AGR at Silver Gulch and Morning Star, which also lie within the overall Blackhawk \\nproject\\nImportantly, before Sierra Nevada Gold's presence, no exploration drilling was recorded within 600m of the \\nEndowment Mine due to previous ownership issues.Page 3 of 4\\nOrdell locks onto new gold zone in Mt Magnet\\nThe company's other drilling at the adjacent near-surface South Vein turned up additional silver hits, including 6.1m \\ngoing 66.04g/t silver in one hole and 1.22m at 82.80g/t silver in a second hole.\\nGeochemically the South Vein is like the Endowment Vein, characterised by high silver, antimony, ore-grade lead, \\nzinc and elevated copper and manganese.\\nInterestingly, apart from its big hit in the Endowment Vein, the headline hole also punched through a 1.22m section \\nof the South Vein which assayed a serious 275g/t silver, 3.65 per cent lead, 6.47 per cent zinc, 0.40 per cent \\ncopper, and 0.21 per cent antimony from 37.79m.\\nSierra Nevada has identified a big high-grade intermediate sulphidation epithermal (ISE) silver-gold-lead-zinc vein \\nfield which is related to the adjacent big Blackhawk porphyry system just south of the epithermal field.\\nThe ISE vein system covers about 5 sq. km and is open under cover both to the north and north-east, with about \\n22.5 line kilometres of veins recorded so far. Sierra Nevada is continuing its mapping and sampling and has \\nidentified additional veins within the ISE vein field.\\n------------------\\nAsian Battery Metals (ASX:AZ9)\\nHit: 6.1m of 4.16 per cent copper, 3.51 per cent nickel, 0.93g/t 3E and 0.13 per cent cobalt from 98.2m.\\nLast week Asian Battery Minerals landed a 6.1m hit grading 4.16 per cent copper, 3.51 per cent nickel, 0.93g/t 3E \\nand 0.13 per cent cobalt from 98.2m.\\nA 3E value refers typically to the combined value of assays for gold, platinum and palladium.\\nThe result, from one of the last four holes analysed in its 2024 Phase 2 drilling program, was designed to confirm \\nthe extent of high-grade mineralisation in the company's Oval gabbroic intrusion.\\nThe intercept is book-ended by two broad, lower grade mineralised zones, the first of which is a dense, \\ndisseminated intercept of 26.2m at 0.44 per cent copper, 0.52 per cent nickel, 0.12g/t 3E and 0.03 per cent cobalt \\nfrom 78.2m. The second zone comprises a net-textured 15.3m assaying 1.15 per cent copper, 0.79 per cent nickel, \\n0.35g/t 3E and 0.04 per cent cobalt from 104.3m.\\nThree of the last four drillholes analysed targeted electromagnetic (EM) conductors identified from downhole \\n(DHEM) responses, which the company believes could represent base metal mineralised targets.\\nThe headline hole probed a strongly conductive DHEM plate in the northern half of the Oval body, which is strongly \\nexpressed in high-resolution magnetics as a 500m long, 125m wide ovoid body oriented to the north-northwest.\\nThe hole successfully encountered low to highly mineralised gabbroic rock from 16m depth to 142.2m, including the \\nforegoing intercepts.\\nA second hole in the final suite of four was collared 35m east of and on an opposing azimuth to the headline hole.\\nIt targeted a separate DHEM conductor for which the source turned out to be a broad high-grade intersection in the \\nnorthern third of the Oval area that includes a massive sulphide intercept of 1.8m at 3.21 per cent copper, 3.32 per \\ncent nickel, 0.69g/t E3, and 0.14 per cent cobalt from 105m.\\nThe 1.8m at 3.21 copper intercept lies within a broader mineralised zone comprising 19.8m at 1.23 per cent copper, \\n0.98 per cent nickel, 0.36g/t 3E and 0.05 per cent cobalt from 91.2m.\\nThe 19.8m zone also includes three other significant intercepts of disseminated, semi-massive and massive \\nmineralisation in gabbro, the best of which are 6.6m going 1.56 per cent copper from 96.0m and 2.4m at 1.52 per \\ncent copper and 1.39 per cent nickel from 102.6m.Page 4 of 4\\nOrdell locks onto new gold zone in Mt Magnet\\nThe third drillhole targeted an off-hole conductor plate that had been determined by DHEM surveying of a nearby \\nprevious hole. It intercepted 18.5m of lower grade mineralised gabbro from 13.5m to 32m, although it includes 3.2m \\nrunning 0.50 per cent copper, 0.38 per cent nickel, 0.30g/t 3E and 0.02 per cent cobalt from 25m.\\nFurther support was lent to the intriguing possibilities presented by the Oval body, with the fourth drillhole testing \\nthe southern extremity of the Oval gabbroic intrusive and the zone of contact with its enclosing sediments.\\nThat hole was also intended to provide a vector for a subsequent DHEM survey to sniff out any new useful \\nconductors within range. It intercepted disseminated mineralised gabbro with 5m going 0.17 per cent copper, 0.17 \\nper cent nickel, 0.03g/t 3E and 0.01 per cent cobalt from 126m.\\nThe company's recent drilling has focused mainly on identifying high-grade mineralisation in the gabbro at the Oval \\nproject. It views the multiple intercepts of massive sulphide mineralisation with their varying ratios of metal \\nthroughout the Oval intrusion as encouraging for the possibility of finding one or more deeper sources of high-grade \\ncopper-nickel-platinum group mineralisation.\\nFor its follow-up 2025 exploration program, Asian Battery Metals plans to focus on scoping out the overall scale of \\nthe Oval mineralisation and to target possible deeper magmatic sources at the prospect. It also plans additional \\nexploration for potential extensions of Oval and nearby look-alike prospects.\\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Notably, Eureka already comes gift-wrapped with a 112,000 ounce \\n1.42 gram per tonne starter resource.\\nThe initial shares issued to Delta Lithium will be subject to escrow for 12 months.\\nThe old Eureka open pit sits about 50km north-west of Kalgoorlie in the prospective sequence of mafic and \\nultramafic rocks which forms part of the more than 290km-long\\nKalgoorlie-Menzies leg of the 700km-long Norseman to Wiluna Greenstone belt.\\nImportantly it is only 20kms north-west of the Paddington gold mine that has been mined for years and is well \\nknown for doing toll treating deals.\\nPaddington has turned out more than four million ounces during its production history from the same prospective \\nrock sequence as mapped at Eureka, which is also held to be a structural setting similar to the half-million ounce \\nZoroastrian gold deposit at Bardoc Gold, only 1.4km east of the Eureka deposit.\\nThe Eureka mine site was mined for the most part in the early 1990's and was subject to small scale tribute mining \\nagain in 2018 by Kalgoorlie identity Graham McGarry who pulled a bit over 5000 ounces from the old pit at 3.16 g/t \\ngold. However, Javelin says prior drilling was poorly targeted at the project and was not deep enough to follow the \\ninterpreted structures properly.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nJavelin rolls dice to replicate Spectrum, Spartan success at Eureka\\nJavelin has a theory that the old-timers were too focussed on the existing pit and given the ordinary gold prices at \\nthe time, were not motivated to spend too much money exploring the areas around it.\\nSpectrum Metals and Spartan Resources both spectacularly proved this was a mistake at their respective projects. \\nSpectrum stumbled across the Penny North gold deposit just 300m north of its old mined out Penny West open pit \\nin WA and subsequently sold the whole company to Ramelius Resources for $230m (which increased dramatically \\non settlement day as the deal involved Ramelius shares that ran hard between the announcement of the deal and \\nthe settlement of the deal). The maiden resource at Penny North was just over 300,000 ounces going a whopping \\n16.8 g/t gold.\\nMore recently Spartan employed the same near mine theory when it stubbed its toe on the 1.5m ounce Never \\nNever discovery lurking just 300m north of its mothballed Gilbey's open pit in WA's Murchison.\\nOminously, the Eureka project already has sniffs of gold 300m north of the old Eureka pit too - some of which are in \\nounce to the tonne dirt like a 4m intercept going 32.6 g/t gold from 104m. Another previous 1m hit came in at an \\nimpressive 14.72 g/t gold and notably, was from surface, demonstrating the potential range of mineralisation.\\nAbout 600m north of the old pit, Javelin has even more impressive numbers to follow up on like 4m at 135 g/t gold \\nfrom 53m and 4m grading 11 g/t gold from 42m.\\nIn fact, the entire area is littered with old drill numbers that are begging to see the drill bit again. For example, \\ndirectly under the old pit a 23m hit going 3.32 g/t gold from 112m and another 5m hit further up from 33m going an \\nimpressive 25.6 g/t gold both need more attention.\\nThere are even hints of mineralisation about 300m to the south of Eureka which include 13m at 2.22 g/t gold from \\n51m and 6m at 13.88 g/t gold from 38m.\\nWhilst some of the drill intersections that require follow up may seem remarkable in grade, they are perhaps not all \\nthat remarkable when considering the project was first mined from 1897 up to 1940 for a total 809 tonnes averaging \\na crazy 27.8 g/t gold - no doubt Javelin will be counting on some of that dirt being left behind by the old-timers.\\nNotably, Eureka is not Javelin's first rodeo and is an extension of the same near mine exploration theory it is \\nemploying at its Coogee gold project at the north end of Lake Lefroy, just east of Kambalda and about 55 km south-\\neast of Kalgoorlie.\\nThe Coogee gold deposit was discovered in the mid-1990s by Sovereign Resources next to Gold Fields' world-\\nclass St Ives gold mining complex.\\nJavelin acquired 100 per cent of the Coogee project in 2020 from Ramelius Resources and Serena Minerals for \\nequity and both companies are now major shareholders.\\nRamelius mined the Coogee open pit for gold to 70m depth until 2013, producing 20,400 ounces at a respectable \\naverage head grade of 4.7g/t gold. Ramelius subsequently became a major shareholder in Javelin.\\nThe Coogee mining lease has been a key focus for Javelin's since acquisition. The Coogee open pit and its \\nimmediate surrounds have not been subject to any systematic exploration drilling since Ramelius ended mining at \\nthe site.\\nWhen Javelin acquired the project, it contained an estimated 10,600 ounce gold resource at 3.4g/t gold which, after \\na 12-month drilling program, then jumped to 49,000 ounces at 1.07g/t gold in 2022.\\nIn August, Javelin announced the Coogee gold project hosts a recently upgraded JORC 2012 compliant mineral \\nresource amounting to 3.65 million tonnes at 1.08g/t gold for 126,685 ounces of gold and 1.01 million tonnes at \\n0.41 per cent copper for 4133t tonnes of the red metal in a separate inferred \\\"copper domain\\\", north of the old pit.Page 3 of 3\\nJavelin rolls dice to replicate Spectrum, Spartan success at Eureka\\nOnce again, modelling shows gold mineralisation extending north along strike for 1.2km at an average width of \\n350m and to more than 225m vertically under the old Coogee open pit and still open to the north and down-dip.\\nJavelin upped its drilling metreage for the greater Coogee area from 2500m to 3000m for a planned reverse-\\ncirculation and diamond drilling program set to be launched in mid-November.\\nThe decision came after the company identified several opportunities to extend known mineralisation below the old \\nopen pit and in extensions towards Coogee North and beyond to a pronounced magnetic high feature.\\nThe proposed drilling was prompted by results from Javelin's extensive reviews of reprocessed geophysical and \\nother data which had lifted Coogee's resource estimate to the current inventory figure of 126,685 ounces of gold.\\nJavelin's recent full data review and new magnetics reinterpretations and modelling have identified eight new \\ntantalising geophysical targets.\\nIt will now direct its focus toward testing five of the nearest priority walk-up targets at the Coogee mine - and also \\nnorth and west of the old mine - including a prominent and curious looking ovoid magnetic anomaly in the south-\\neast of its exploration licence, adjacent to the mining lease.\\nReview work has also identified a new 3km-long potential gold trend west of and parallel to the Coogee pit structure \\nand Javelin believes there is the potential there for a \\\"big gold-copper system\\\" that could lie at depth to the north-\\nwest.\\nJavelin says previous drillholes at Coogee North were also not deep enough to test the nearby screaming magnetic \\nanomaly which could represent a potential repetition of the historic Coogee lode and the company has earmarked \\nten drillholes for 1650m to test it.\\nSignificantly, once Javelin dials in the current Eureka gold mine resource and adds on its Coogee resource it will \\nnow have a total resource endowment of 238,700 ounces of gold in two of the best mining addresses in Australia.\\nIt is probably fair to say that Javelin has been in something of a slumber for a couple of years however since falling \\nunder the control of Executive Chairman and well known West Perth corporate finance player Brett Mitchell back in \\nFebruary, it has forged a new way forward and eked out a solid \\\"near mine exploration strategy.\\\"\\nHalf of that strategy came from a strategic review of Coogee instigated by Mitchell that ended in some screaming \\nnear mine targets that look like they are begging to be drilled. Eureka now gives Javelin a quinella of projects that \\nalmost look exactly the same that will likely both benefit from exactly the same brownfields near mine exploration \\nstrategy.\\nAnd who knows, maybe Javelin will complete the trifecta of companies that have successfully employed this \\\"old \\nriches left behind\\\" strategy if it can emulate the success of both Spartan and Spectrum.\\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

The drill intercepts reveal the possibility of an extensive \\nzone of shallow gold mineralisation on the western side of McNabs East, which at this stage remains open at depth \\nand along strike.\\nThe company completed the five hole, 426m diamond drilling program last December as part of an ongoing \\nprogram to systematically test the currently defined 2.5km strike extent of shallow gold mineralisation at Barimaia.\\nResults from the program confirm the existence of a shallow, coherent zone of potentially open-pittable gold \\nmineralisation on the western side of McNabs East, within an extensive gold system that remains untested at depth \\nand open along strike.\\nPage 2 of 4\\nOrdell locks onto new gold zone in Mt Magnet\\nOrdell's flagship Barimaia gold project is an advanced exploration project with significant historical drilling results. \\nOrdell acquired an 80.3 per cent interest in Barimaia from Genesis Minerals, which is now a major shareholder of \\nOrdell with an 8 per cent interest.\\nHowever, Barimaia was never fully explored by Genesis due to its other commitments, although the company \\nsuccessfully identified an extensive gold system at the project, supported by historical RC drilling results pointing to \\ngood shallow open pit potential.\\nThe project is strategically located within a stone's throw of at least three gold processing plants, including the \\nadjacent Ramelius Resources' Mt Magnet mill, 70km from Spartan Resources' Dalgaranga mill and 80km from \\nWestgold Resources' Tuckabianna mill.\\nThe company is planning to launch a more extensive program of about 5000m of reverse circulation drilling at \\nBarimaia in February. The upcoming program will include infill drilling at McNabs East to close up the current 100m \\ndrill section spacing and will also include first-pass extensional drilling in areas where previous air-core (AC) drilling \\nwas undertaken in 2019 and 2021.\\nAdditionally, the new program will test depths between 100m and 200m in selected areas and will also include \\nadditional AC drilling east and north of the currently defined mineralisation at McNabs.\\nOrdell says drilling of the McNabs East western zone will comprise a significant part of the company's big drilling \\nprogram slated for February.\\n------------------\\nSierra Nevada Gold (ASX:SNX)\\nHit: 4.88m at 481g/t silver, 0.61g/t gold, 0.6 per cent copper and 0.4 per cent antimony from 87.78m.\\nSierra Nevada Gold's Phase 1 reverse-circulation (RC) drilling at its Endowment Mine within the overall Blackhawk \\nepithermal project area pulled up a big silver hit while targeting a remnant ore position between the 3rd and 4th \\nmine levels on the historic Endowment Vein.\\nThe headline drill hit from the latest campaign is 4.88m at 481g/t silver, 0.61g/t gold, 0.6 per cent copper and 0.4 \\nper cent antimony from 87.78m\\nThe vein was targeted based on indications from historic mine records pointing to part of the vein not having been \\nmined, with drilling successfully spearing through an inter-stope zone to jag the vein which remains open down-\\nplunge to the east.\\nThe Endowment Mine is the biggest of the historic mines in the locality and was initially mined in the 1860s, with \\nmost mining completed by the 1880s and a total production being reported of 70,000 ounces of gold equivalent.\\nThe operation's inability to process sulphide ores and prevailing depressed economic conditions led to the \\ncessation of mining in the 1920s, although mineralisation remains within reach of current infrastructure.\\nNotably, the area has seen little modern-day exploration before Sierra Nevada Gold acquired the ground, with the \\nlatest prior exploration in the area being undertaken in the mid to late 1980s by American Gold Resources.\\nThe focus of recent exploration has been on defining shallow oxide gold and silver deposits, with two shallow oxide \\nresources being estimated by AGR at Silver Gulch and Morning Star, which also lie within the overall Blackhawk \\nproject\\nImportantly, before Sierra Nevada Gold's presence, no exploration drilling was recorded within 600m of the \\nEndowment Mine due to previous ownership issues.Page 3 of 4\\nOrdell locks onto new gold zone in Mt Magnet\\nThe company's other drilling at the adjacent near-surface South Vein turned up additional silver hits, including 6.1m \\ngoing 66.04g/t silver in one hole and 1.22m at 82.80g/t silver in a second hole.\\nGeochemically the South Vein is like the Endowment Vein, characterised by high silver, antimony, ore-grade lead, \\nzinc and elevated copper and manganese.\\nInterestingly, apart from its big hit in the Endowment Vein, the headline hole also punched through a 1.22m section \\nof the South Vein which assayed a serious 275g/t silver, 3.65 per cent lead, 6.47 per cent zinc, 0.40 per cent \\ncopper, and 0.21 per cent antimony from 37.79m.\\nSierra Nevada has identified a big high-grade intermediate sulphidation epithermal (ISE) silver-gold-lead-zinc vein \\nfield which is related to the adjacent big Blackhawk porphyry system just south of the epithermal field.\\nThe ISE vein system covers about 5 sq. km and is open under cover both to the north and north-east, with about \\n22.5 line kilometres of veins recorded so far.

The second zone comprises a net-textured 15.3m assaying 1.15 per cent copper, 0.79 per cent nickel, \\n0.35g/t 3E and 0.04 per cent cobalt from 104.3m.\\nThree of the last four drillholes analysed targeted electromagnetic (EM) conductors identified from downhole \\n(DHEM) responses, which the company believes could represent base metal mineralised targets.\\nThe headline hole probed a strongly conductive DHEM plate in the northern half of the Oval body, which is strongly \\nexpressed in high-resolution magnetics as a 500m long, 125m wide ovoid body oriented to the north-northwest.\\nThe hole successfully encountered low to highly mineralised gabbroic rock from 16m depth to 142.2m, including the \\nforegoing intercepts.\\nA second hole in the final suite of four was collared 35m east of and on an opposing azimuth to the headline hole.\\nIt targeted a separate DHEM conductor for which the source turned out to be a broad high-grade intersection in the \\nnorthern third of the Oval area that includes a massive sulphide intercept of 1.8m at 3.21 per cent copper, 3.32 per \\ncent nickel, 0.69g/t E3, and 0.14 per cent cobalt from 105m.\\nThe 1.8m at 3.21 copper intercept lies within a broader mineralised zone comprising 19.8m at 1.23 per cent copper, \\n0.98 per cent nickel, 0.36g/t 3E and 0.05 per cent cobalt from 91.2m.\\nThe 19.8m zone also includes three other significant intercepts of disseminated, semi-massive and massive \\nmineralisation in gabbro, the best of which are 6.6m going 1.56 per cent copper from 96.0m and 2.4m at 1.52 per \\ncent copper and 1.39 per cent nickel from 102.6m.Page 4 of 4\\nOrdell locks onto new gold zone in Mt Magnet\\nThe third drillhole targeted an off-hole conductor plate that had been determined by DHEM surveying of a nearby \\nprevious hole. It intercepted 18.5m of lower grade mineralised gabbro from 13.5m to 32m, although it includes 3.2m \\nrunning 0.50 per cent copper, 0.38 per cent nickel, 0.30g/t 3E and 0.02 per cent cobalt from 25m.\\nFurther support was lent to the intriguing possibilities presented by the Oval body, with the fourth drillhole testing \\nthe southern extremity of the Oval gabbroic intrusive and the zone of contact with its enclosing sediments.\\nThat hole was also intended to provide a vector for a subsequent DHEM survey to sniff out any new useful \\nconductors within range. It intercepted disseminated mineralised gabbro with 5m going 0.17 per cent copper, 0.17 \\nper cent nickel, 0.03g/t 3E and 0.01 per cent cobalt from 126m.\\nThe company's recent drilling has focused mainly on identifying high-grade mineralisation in the gabbro at the Oval \\nproject. It views the multiple intercepts of massive sulphide mineralisation with their varying ratios of metal \\nthroughout the Oval intrusion as encouraging for the possibility of finding one or more deeper sources of high-grade \\ncopper-nickel-platinum group mineralisation.\\nFor its follow-up 2025 exploration program, Asian Battery Metals plans to focus on scoping out the overall scale of \\nthe Oval mineralisation and to target possible deeper magmatic sources at the prospect. It also plans additional \\nexploration for potential extensions of Oval and nearby look-alike prospects.\\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

The project is situated in a highly fertile greenstone belt with numerous gold deposits and abundant \\ngold occurrences nearby. The Coogee, Salt Creek, Daisy-Milano and Lucky Bay gold deposits, plus the major St \\nIves gold camp are specifically relevant to exploration of the project. The project tenements have undergone \\nvarying levels of exploration with the discovery of gold in the 1800's at Hogans Find. Modern exploration \\ncommenced in the 1900's by BHP who discovered the Carnilya Hill Nickel deposit. The Coogee gold deposit \\nlocated within the project tenements was discovered in the mid-1990's by Sovereign Resources and was \\nsubsequently mined by Ramelius Resources (ASX : RMS) in 2013. Ramelius mined an open cut pit \\n(approximately 70m deep) at Coogee in 2013, with reported production of 147,400 tonnes at 4.7 g/t Au for a \\nrecovered 20,400 ounces of gold. Processing was at the Burbanks Mill (conventional carbon-in-leach processing \\nfacility), south of Coolgardie with metallurgical recovery of 96.4%\\nGeology and Prospectivity\\nThe project is located in the southern part of the Norseman - Wiluna Greenstone Belt within the Parker Domain of \\nthe Kalgoorlie Terrane (Griffin and Hickman, 1988a). The project is situated in a highly fertile greenstone belt with \\nnumerous gold deposits and abundant gold occurrences nearby. The Coogee, Salt Creek, Daisy-Milano and Lucky \\nBay gold deposits, plus the major St Ives gold camp are specifically relevant to exploration of the project. The \\nCoogee Deposit is hosted within a package of intermediate to felsic volcanics and volcaniclastics, comprising \\ndacite, andesite and rhyolite lithologies. The primary mineralised zone comprises a moderately southwest dipping \\nshear zone at the contact between the dacitic crystal tuff unit and a locally porphyritic andesite flow. Gold is directly \\nassociated with pyrite, which is frequently intergrown with magnetite and high gold values coincide with increased \\npercentages of pyrite and magnetite. Magnetite rich zones have also been intersected, but without pyrite, they do \\nnot host gold mineralisation.\\nCOOGEE WEST E26/177 GEOPHYSICS RESULTS AND TARGETS\\nLocated immediately west of M26/477 the southern half of this tenement covers Lake Lefroy with the northern half \\ncontaining widows of weathered outcrop and Cenozoic cover. Historically the Exploration Licence has been \\nsporadically explored with wide spaced reconnaissance aircore drilling across the salt lake completed by Ramelius \\nwith and RC and diamond drilling completed in the north by Terrain Minerals. The tenement is covered by 50m line \\nspaced aeromagnetic data and variable gravity on 100m to 400m spaced lines with 100m stations. The magnetic \\nimagery highlights variably magnetic northwest trending mafic and ultramafic units which are intruded by granitic \\nintrusions and surrounded by sediments and intermediate to felsic tuffs. Filtered gravity provides complimentary \\ninformation to the magnetics, displaying local gravity highs over ultramafic and mafic units and gravity lows over \\nsediments and granitic intrusions. CG-04 Target Zone discrete untested circular magnetic anomaly of approximately \\n700nT approx. 1.5km west of the Coogee Pit. This represents a higher priority drill target based on the stronger \\nmagnetic response compared to the CG-01 (400nT) target zone which is known to hosts gold-copper mineralisation \\nnorth of the Coogee Pit. The top of the anomaly starts from 300 vertical metres extending down to 1km in depth - no \\ndrilling has tested this anomaly and represents a high-order drill Au-Cu target.\\nContact:\\nBrett Mitchell Paul Armstrong\\nExecutive Chairman Investor Relations\\nJavelin Minerals Limited Read Corporate\\nEmail: info@javelinminerals.com.auPage 3 of 4\\n-Javelin Minerals Limited - Compelling gold-copper drill targets identified at Coogee Gold Project\\nCompetent Persons Statement\\nThe information in this report that relates to Exploration Targets and Exploration Results is based on information \\ncompiled by Pedro Kastellorizos.

Its total supergene and primary \\nindicated resource is 963,242 tonnes at 1.31g/t gold for 40,562 ounces, while the complementary copper resource \\nadds 4133 tonnes of the red metal.\\nPrevious operator Ramelius Resources' 2022 estimate for Coogee put the resource at 1.43 million tonnes at an \\naverage grade of 1.07g/t gold for 49,034 ounces, of which 614,000 tonnes at 1.43g/t gold for 28,252 ounces lay \\nwithin the total indicated category for supergene and primary ores.\\nA key consideration in the upgrade from the previous 2022 mineral resource estimate includes an increase in the \\ndepth of the overall resource envelope, taking it from 90m below surface - the original open-pit resource limit - to \\nnow include gold and copper mineralisation down to 225m. It is a significant depth increase of 135m.\\n'The scope for growth at Coogee is clearly immense. The mineralisation is open and we have numerous compelling \\ntargets.'\\nJavelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell\\nThe new estimate also considers a jump in the assumed rate of recovery from the 96 per cent experienced during \\nprevious treatment of open-pit ores, to 96.4 per cent following metallurgical testwork by Javelin, which it says is \\nconsistent with processing figures from the previous owner's open-pit operation in 2013.\\nJavelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell said: \\\"This is a strong result which provides a solid platform on \\nwhich to build a very substantial gold inventory on the doorstep of the world-class St Ives Goldfield. The scope for \\ngrowth at Coogee is clearly immense. The mineralisation is open and we have numerous compelling targets.\\\"\\nPage 2 of 2\\nJavelin rolls out 158 per cent increase in Coogee gold\\nThe company says gold mineralisation at Coogee extends along strike for 1.2km at an average width of 350m, \\nextends to more than 225m vertically and exhibits strong potential to extend along strike to the north-west and also \\ndown-dip.\\nNews of the upgrade comes hard on the heels of Javelin's recent revelation that it had identified eight copper-gold \\nexploration targets at its Coogee project after independent and collaborative reviews of reprocessed geophysical \\nand other data. Of key significance in the present resource upgrade context is that initial interpretations of two of \\nthose targets point to a prevailing trend of north or north-westerly and down-dip extension gold mineralisation \\npotential in the area immediately north of the old Coogee open pit.\\nThe two recently-identified targets include a big untested magnetic anomaly just 300m north/north-east from the \\nCoogee open pit, which management believes could host gold-copper mineralisation. It is the company's strongest \\nanomaly in its Coogee mining lease and is its first-priority target.\\nThe anomaly is modelled to lie at a depth of 175m below surface, directly below the main gold-copper \\nmineralisation defined by previous reverse-circulation (RC) and diamond drilling. The compnay says the target has \\nnever been tested and could be a deep gold-copper mineralised zone.\\nHistoric drilling within the Coogee mining lease area that also defined two magnetic mineralised copper-gold trends \\nnorth and west of the Coogee deposit and currently remain open along strike and at depth, also support the \\nmodelling.\\nJavelin recently engaged independent geological consultancy OmniGeoX to compile, review and interpret all \\nexisting project drilling and geophysical data to help plan an exploration drilling program, with a view to making the \\nearliest possible start on testing of priority targets.\\nThe Coogee gold project tenements are on the north side of Lake Lefroy in WA's Eastern Goldfields, about 20km \\nnorth-east of Kambalda, which is among the State's earliest nickel mining centres after the original deposit was \\ndiscovered in 1954. The mine opened in 1967 and was operated by WMC Resources, which was taken over by \\nBHP in 2005.\\nThe project lies within a highly-fertile greenstone belt with multiple gold deposits and abundant gold occurrences \\nnearby including Coogee, Salt Creek, Daisy-Milano and Lucky Bay, in addition to the major St Ives gold camp.\\nThe Coogee gold deposit was discovered in the mid-1990s by Sovereign Resources and was mined by Ramelius \\nin 2013 via an open pit about 70m deep, reporting 147,400 tonnes produced at 4.7g/t gold for 20,400 ounces. \\nRamelius treated its Coogee ore by conventional carbon-in-leach processing at the Burbanks Mill, south of \\nCoolgardie, reporting 96.4 per cent metallurgical recovery.\\nJavelin believes there is the potential for a \\\"big gold-copper system\\\" that could lie at depth to the north-west.\\nThat belief is further supported by company's third priority geophysical target that lies about 750m west of the \\nCoogee open pit and is also associated with a magnetic trend that is open to the north-west. The anomaly has not \\nbeen followed up, despite the encouragement of a single drillhole put in by Ramelius that jagged 23m going 0.38g/t \\ngold.\\nJavelin is now planning its next phase of extensional drilling to the west of the new resource envelope in a bid to \\nincrease the mineral resource estimate.\\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

The sentiment around the company is mixed, with a generally neutral to slightly positive tone, though some negative coverage emerged due to stock performance declines and production challenges. Spartan Resources is depicted as a rising gold explorer with strong acquisition interest, particularly from Ramelius Resources. The sentiment is predominantly positive, driven by its stock price surge and successful gold discoveries, positioning it as a key target in the ongoing industry consolidation. BHP, on the other hand, is portrayed with a more negative sentiment, largely due to its failed bid for Anglo American and stock price declines linked to broader commodity market challenges. While it remains a dominant force in the mining sector, recent media coverage highlights its struggles with trade concerns and fluctuating market conditions.",
