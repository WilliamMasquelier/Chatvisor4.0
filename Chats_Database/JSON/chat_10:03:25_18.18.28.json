By November 2021 FFI had inked \nagreements for hydrogen and renewable energy projects in more than 20 countries, and analysis by The Australian \nestimated that it would cost close to $200bn for Fortescue to make good on delivering just half of those projects.\nBy then FFI had more 700 staff, its own private jet to ferry energy boss Julie Shuttleworth around the world, and a \nvast portfolio of potential projects.\nBut even then cracks were appearing in Dr Forrest's green vision. An investigation by The Weekend Australian in \nlate 2021 revealed that the internal culture of FFI had become increasingly chaotic amid ruthless internal \ncompetition - so much so that insiders described its inner workings as being like the Hunger Games.\nAt the same time Dr Forrest's passion for Fortescue's project - which he genuinely believes is a key part of saving \nthe planet from the worst impacts of global warming - riled up the rest of Australia's mining industry, which until then \nhad been watching on with bemused fascination, after The Australian revealed the Fortescue founder was lobbying \nfor a phase-out of the federal government's diesel fuel rebate scheme, worth billions to the mining industry.\nBoiler room explosion It is bizarre to reflect that catalogue only reflects the first year of Fortescue's grand energy \nproject.\nEven close followers of the company amongst journalists and market analysts struggle to chronicle the bewildering \narray of announcements, promises and backflips - and executive departures - over the next few years.\nBut if there was a moment that sums up the chaos within the company, it is the complete implosion at the most \nsenior ranks in the company in September 2021.\nNewly appointed mining boss Fiona Hick left the company only days after Fortescue celebrated its 20th birthday \nwith a lavish bash in the Pilbara. She was quickly followed out the door by new chief financial officer Christine \nMorris, high-profile FFI recruit Guy Debelle. In an explosive interview with The Australian, Dr Forrest claimed the \nextraordinary events were sparked after he returned from an overseas trip to find the company's strategy had been \nhijacked by members of its executive team, over differences in opinion over Fortescue's green strategy. \"You put a \nlighthouse on a hill and aim at it (but) there was a feeling that another lighthouse was emerging and the \norganisation - particularly when the chairman was overseas for three months - was being pushed towards -another \nlighthouse,\" he said at the time.\nIs the dream over?\nThe spectacular departure of Hick and Morris did not end the upheaval in Fortescue's executive ranks, far from it. \nBut 10 months on, Fortescue now faces another round of major change as Dr Forrest this week reset the \ncompany's strategy - finally conceding that the company's most ambitious goal, of producing 15 million tonnes of \ngreen hydrogen a year by 2030, cannot be achieved in the face of soaring global energy costs.\nBut Dr Forrest rejects any suggestion the company's green energy dream is dead. Speaking to the Australian this \nweek, he said the company's commitment to decarbonise its own iron ore operations by 2030 is unwavering, and \nthe company will shift its green energy focus to building the massive amounts of wind and solar power needed to \nbring down energy costs and make hydrogen viable.\nAnd as for the 700 staff that will leave as part of the reset? Dr Forrest says that is \"heartbreaking\", but necessary as \nFortescue brings its iron ore and green energy arms back together.Page 3 of 3\nFortescue now marching 'to the one beat'\nBut the tension between those two arms has been at the centre of the chaos within Fortescue since the green \nenergy project first began - according to both former Fortescue employees and Dr Forrest's own words along the \nway.\nThe decision to build Fortescue Energy as a company within a company was a deliberate decision, the Fortescue \nfounder told The Australian this week, because it otherwise may not have happened at all.\n\"I had no choice. I tried for a couple of years to get green energy, and going green into the psyche of Fortescue. \nWe had a very good, very well run company, with shareholder returns which hit new records across Australia and \ntens of billions of dollars issued to shareholders. A super successful company - and strong resistance to change,\" \nhe said.\n\"And you can't have improvement without change. You can't be smug, fat and happy. And so as to not threaten the \niron ore sector at all with a major new initiative, we did it through a major startup. And that grew and grew.\" \nFortescue Energy had more than 1900 employees at the end of June 2023, according to the company's last annual \nreport. That may well be dramatically slimmed down by the latest restructuring.\nBut Dr Forrest says all of Fortescue is now \"all marching in the same direction, to the same drum beat\". \"There is \nno one else that is going to lead the world into a secure and non-fossil fuel future. It may as well be us, so it is us,\" \nhe said. And Dr Forrest rejects any suggestion that Fortescue's latest reset is a sign its green strategy is failing, \npointing to the green iron technology the company is developing, its acquisition of a role developing in the giant \nBelinga iron ore deposit in Gabon, its early stage green ammonia joint venture in Morroco, and its development of \nnew technology in shipping, trucking and rail. \"The failure here is a failure of your understanding - and I'm not being \nunkind here. We didn't just go after green hydrogen, we went after green technology - we went after what \nopportunities there could be in changing the world.That led to opportunities being offered to us,\" he said.\nLoad-Date: July 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Nick Evans\nDate: July 20, 2024\nTitle: Fortescue now marching 'to the one beat'\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: 'A political mischief': Forrest hits back at green hydrogen detractors\n## Media outlet: WA Today\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: July 20, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\n'A political mischief': Forrest hits back at green hydrogen detractors\n'A political mischief': Forrest hits back at green hydrogen detractors\nWA Today\nJuly 20, 2024 Saturday 12:36 AM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 667 words\nHighlight: Mining executive Andrew Forrest has denied he is abandoning his ambitions for green hydrogen, saying \nthe fuel is imperative for combating climate change.\nBody\nMining executive Andrew Forrest has described as \"a political mischief\" reports he is divesting from green \nhydrogen, declaring the energy form would be an \"absolutely imperative\" tool for combating climate change.\n\"We are producing green hydrogen as we speak,\" he said.\n\"It's a political mischief to say that the world's major green hydrogen champion is turning away from green hydrogen \n- it's completely untrue.\"\nForrest's Fortescue said on Wednesday it would slash 700 jobs in coming weeks, and merge its renewable energy \nand iron ore divisions, as it seeks to reduce duplication and costs.\nAsked several times on Wednesday whether he remained committed to his ambitious goal to produce 15 million \ntonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030, Forrest said he remained committed to 15 million tonnes a year in the \nfuture.\nThat sparked headlines claiming he was abandoning his ambitions for green hydrogen - which is produced through \na process of electrolysis and using renewable energies including wind and solar.\nForrest told this masthead he remained resolutely committed to green hydrogen, and described the shift as a policy \n\"broadening, not change\".\n\"We have to commit, across the world, to green electricity and green hydrogen. If you don't, you're basically giving \nup on the world,\" he said.\n\"For us to say we're giving up on green hydrogen, as some people have tried to twist it, is just like saying you're \ngiving up on your kids [and] giving up on the world.\"\nInternational conflicts including Russia's invasion of Ukraine had driven up the price of all fossil fuels, and dragged \ngreen electricity with it, Forrest said.\n\"And there's precisely nothing we can do about it, unless we invest upstream in generating very large quantities of \ngreen electricity ourselves, which is what the company announced,\" he said.\nPage 2 of 2\n'A political mischief': Forrest hits back at green hydrogen detractors\n\"We're consolidating by investing upstream so we can get the price of electricity down to a point where green \nhydrogen becomes more competitive.\"\nIn recent years, Forrest has toured the globe seeking opportunities to produce the huge amount of affordable, \nemissions-free electricity needed to separate hydrogen from water in commercially meaningful quantities.\nThe potential markets are in replacing hydrogen from gas and coal in the manufacture of fertiliser and chemicals, \nand providing an emissions-free fuel in applications where batteries may be impractical, such as long-distance \nshipping.\nHowever, Fortescue found the cost of that clean energy prohibitively high and now wants to focus on developing \nrenewable energy projects to drive down the major cost in producing green hydrogen.\n\"If the electricity cost is high, then we can't make hydrogen cheaply enough to compete with fossil fuels,\" Forrest \ntold Radio 6PR in Perth on Thursday.\nClimate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen defended the viability of green hydrogen projects, which are \nbeing developed by more than 50 companies in Australia at a cost of $225 billion.\n\"Green hydrogen will be one of the best ways Australia can decarbonise domestic heavy emitters and help develop \nrobust low-carbon manufacturing,\" he said.\nWhile Bowen said the federal government was committed to working with the project proponents, opposition energy \nspokesman Ted O'Brien said Fortescue's move had \"blown a gaping hole\" in Labor's renewables-focused energy \nplans.\n\"Labor thinks it's picking winners, but we now know they are picking losers, and it's Australian taxpayers who are \npicking up the bill,\" O'Brien said.\nThe federal government's $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program is its highest-profile backing of the nascent \nindustry. In December, six projects - none backed by Fortescue - were shortlisted for funding. Recipients will be \nannounced late this year.\nO'Brien said the Coalition had supported the hydrogen industry while in government, and it was optimistic the fuel \nwould have a long-term role in the energy mix.\nGet to the heart of what's happening with climate change and the environment.

I did both jobs. The weapon of choice was the L96A1,\" he writes on Instagram.\nBut what's a spy without another identity? According to Lancaster's prolific social media posts and interviews, he \nhas also purchased properties in France, including a chateau, which he developed into successful business for \ntourists looking to travel the countryside.\nLancaster has not returned The Weekend Australian's requests for comment, which have been left via social media \nchannels and with a call to his office.\nDetails about the PI can be revealed after Fortescue sensationally alleged Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-\nJensen stole the would-be green energy giant's intellectual property to launch their own start-up, Element Zero.\nPage 2 of 3\nMeet the veteran PI hired by Twiggy\nAlong with long term lieutenant of Dr Forrest, Michael Masterman, Fortescue has claimed that after the three men \nleft the company's green iron project between 2021 and 2022, the only way they could have rapidly developed their \nown way to process iron ore into metallic iron without burning fossil fuels is by stealing Fortescue's secrets.\nThe iron ore giant's suspicions prompted the company to launch an urgent court case in May, seeking permission to \nlaunch raids on properties of Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen to collect evidence in support of their case. In \norder to work out when to launch the raids, Fortescue was required to determine if children under 18-years-old or \nfemale occupants would be in the properties identified in search orders and when they would be there.\nHe took the job seriously, with a court hearing he or his company conducted \"19 days of surveillance that was \nundertaken of all the respondents and their employees and some family members and wives following people to \nKmart, sifting through mail and the like\".\nLancaster produced a 600 page report, containing shots taken while undercover of Dr Kolodziejczyk's wife and five-\nyear-old son along with Dr Winther-Jensen's wife and 16-year-old daughter who had been watched as she left for \nschool and returned home on one day.\nWho is Robert Lancaster?\nLancaster has left a very public profile of himself across social media and online via interviews, and in old stories he \nwrote and published on his business website: Lancaster Global Risk.\nHe served in the British army, including the 22nd SAS and in Ireland during the Troubles, between 1977 and 1989 \nafter he joined the military at 16-years-old.\n\"When I was in the infantry I spent just under three years in Northern Ireland,\" he tells the Spycraft 101 podcast, \npublished about a month ago. \"A lot of that was intelligence gathering, a lot of surveillance. A lot of patrolling.\" In a \nsocial media post, that shows an old picture with Lancaster in camouflage, he says: \"Old school Australian SF. I \nserved in 22 SAS and later in the Australian Commandos. I remain a brother.\" In another, alongside a picture of two \nblokes arm-in-arm sitting in front of five dogs, Lancaster says: \"Catch up with Bill a mate from the Australian \nCommandos with his 'wolf pack' at one of his country estates. War stories and wine flowed freely.\" His time in the \nSAS set him up for a life in the private sector, Lancaster says. He left the military following a divorce and had just \n\"had enough\". In the early 1990s he moved to Australia following a job offer. He carried out a stint in the reserve \nspecial forces in Australia from 1990, and then undertook two months-long undercover operations in NSW, he tells \nthe Spycraft podcast.\nLancaster speaks highly of his track record as a PI. After he investigated a multimillion-dollar scam in NSW's Urban \nTransit Authority in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he claims 18 people were arrested. \"If I would have been found \nout there I'd have probably been disappeared. It was very unionised, it was quite a dynamic situation,\" he says. He \nsurvived, and moved on to another undercover gig three weeks later for the NSW State Rail Authority before \nlaunching what he says is a highly sought after PI business in Lancasters Global Risk based in Sydney. After he \nstarted off doing jobs for insurance companies investigating the veracity of disablement claims, business soared \nand he says he had about 100 investigations per week within a few years of setting up the company in 1991.\nIn another story, published on his company's website, he discusses Lancaster's role in one of Australia's most \nbruising industrial disputes: that between the Maritime Union of Australia and Patrick Stevedores in 1998.\nAfter Patrick's entire workforce was sacked and replaced with ex-military men, a month long picket disrupted \nmovements across major ports across the country. \"While the industrial clash intensified, with surging lines of \ndemonstrators, mass arrests, guards in balaclavas with dogs protecting strike breakers, there was another game \nbeing played behind the scenes,\" the article says. \"In the bush around the container port, hidden in the industrial \nsprawl of Sydney's Port Botany, Lancaster had his operatives, mostly former special forces soldiers, trained in the \nart of concealment and surveillance.Page 3 of 3\nMeet the veteran PI hired by Twiggy\n\"As Lancaster puts it, and talking only because the dispute is now some four years gone: 'We had people in camo \ngear dug into bushland watching where people gathered. We can take video images form up to a kilometre away as \nlong as the conditions aren't too hot \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and identify individuals.\n\"We clearly identified the ringleaders and documented instances of violence and intimidation. We also had people \ninfiltrate picket lines with miniature covert cameras, and had people at the front and rear gates and a roving patrol, \nall armed with cameras to record acts of violence and intimidation.\"\nDiversify your business Lancaster says he runs a pension fund and a property portfolio, including in France where \nhe says he ran an eight bedroom chateau with a Michelin star chef for guests. His Instagram profile, called \nPlantagenet Manor, is private but the name links to a chateau. It does not appear to be available for stays, although \nan old posting remains online.\n\"The chateau is located in the centre of historic Chalus on nearly two acres of private grounds, surrounded by high \nwalls and hedges and is within walking distance to restaurants, cafes, bars, shops and a lovely Health Spa,\" its \ndescription reads. \"Plantagenet Manor is a beautiful eight bedroom 'petit' chateau with a heated in-ground pool that \nhas gone through a complete renovation with five new bathrooms, gourmet commercial size kitchen (and) modern \nfour poster beds.",
