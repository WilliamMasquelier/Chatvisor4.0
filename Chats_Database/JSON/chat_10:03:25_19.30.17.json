Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Dino Otranto | Metals Chief Executive | \"Australia is uniquely positioned for its next boom beyond commodities ... that's why we're putting so much effort into our green iron plant in Christmas Creek.\" | N.A. |\n| Apple Paget | Group Chief Financial Officer | \"The strong balance sheet, with cash of $US4.9 billion and net debt of $US0.5 billion at June 30, supported growth projects, including green iron.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman | \"This is the first of more than one gigawatt of solar infrastructure that we will build before the end of the decade.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchison | Energy CEO | \"We will never make investments that are not economically viable.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
