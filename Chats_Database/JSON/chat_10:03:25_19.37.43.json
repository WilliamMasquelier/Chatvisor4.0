green energy momentum flatlines\nFortescue shipments fall in September quarter as costs rise sharply; green \nenergy momentum flatlines\n \nProactive Investors (AU)\nOctober 24, 2024 Thursday 01:50 AM EST\nCopyright 2024 Proactive UK Ltd All Rights Reserved\nLength: 390 words\nByline: Susanna Nelson\nBody\nFortescue Metals Group's earnings results are out for the first quarter of the current financial year and they point to \na failure to maintain momentum following the last quarter of 2024's strong finish.\nSlowing shipments\nIn particular, the Pilbara-based iron ore giant reported a considerable slowing of shipments - with just 47.7 million \ntonnes of iron ore shipped during the three months ending September 30, 2024, a 4% increase compared to the \nsame period last year but an 11% decline from the previous quarter.\nDespite the downturn, Fortescue argued that the shipment volume represented a record for the first quarter, \nsupported by a 1.6-million-tonne contribution from its Iron Bridge Magnetite Project.\nYet the company continues to face challenges at the project, which has experienced delays and operational issues \nin the past.\nInvestors underwhelmed\nAnalysts at Citi noted that Fortescue's shipment figures were in line with market expectations, but investors \nresponded negatively, sending the stock down 4% in early trading to A$18.98.\nFortescue also reported that its production costs for wet tonnes of haematite ore surged 12% over the quarter to \nUS$20.16.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue shipments fall in September quarter as costs rise sharply; green energy momentum flatlines\nThe company attributed the increase to inflationary pressures and a higher strip ratio at its mines.\nChief executive Dino Otranto said he was confident the company remained on track to meet its full-year shipment \nguidance of between 190 million tonnes and 200 million tonnes, with Iron Bridge expected to contribute between 5 \nmillion tonnes and 9 million tonnes.\nEnvironmentally conscientious investors were left disappointed by the lack of significant updates from Fortescue's \nrenewable energy division.\nFortescue Future Industries chief executive Mark Hutchinson reported only that the company continued to make \nprogress on its green energy projects across Australia, the US, Norway and Brazil.\nThe renewable division posted a loss of US$970 million at the end of the 2024 financial year, with further cost \nincreases expected this year, pushing combined net operating and capital expenditure to around US$1.2 billion.\nFortescue's cash reserves stood at US$3.4 billion as of the end of September, down from US$4.9 billion at the end \nof June.\nThe company's debt remains at US$5.5 billion after payouts of US$1.9 billion in dividends and investments of \nUS$780 million in capital expenditure.\nLoad-Date: October 23, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Dino Otranto | Chief Executive Officer | \"I was confident the company remained on track to meet its full-year shipment guidance of between 190 million tonnes and 200 million tonnes.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Chief Executive Officer of Fortescue Future Industries | \"The company continued to make progress on its green energy projects across Australia, the US, Norway and Brazil.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
