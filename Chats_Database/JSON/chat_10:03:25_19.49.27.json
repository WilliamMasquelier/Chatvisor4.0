Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 19\nLength: 482 words\nByline: Mark Wembridge\nBody\nIron ore miner Fortescue has added a second British establishment figure to its board by hiring former HSBC boss \nNoel Quinn as a non-executive director.\nThe Perth-based miner said Sir Noel, who retired as chief executive of the British bank in September after five \nyears at the helm, would bring almost four decades of experience to the role.\nThe Andrew Forrest-chaired group, whose board includes fellow Briton Lord Sebastian Coe, highlighted Sir Noel's \n\"industry-wide initiatives to facilitate public sector and private sector financing solutions for large infrastructure \nprojects, particularly sustainable infrastructure\".\n\"Noel is a highly respected leader who brings a wealth of international expertise and experience in finance and \ncapital markets,\" Dr Forrest said in a statement. \"His deep understanding of the complexities of the global financial \nlandscape will be invaluable as Fortescue continues to diversify into new markets and grow as a green technology, \nenergy and metals group.\"\nSir Noel, 63, switched HSBC's focus towards Asia during his leadership, selling parts of its operations to \nconcentrate on its most profitable region.\nHe first joined HSBC in 1987 and worked in various roles in the UK, the US, and Asia. During his time at the helm, \nSir Noel restructured the London-headquartered lender, axing 35,000 jobs and cutting costs.\nHe surprised investors a year ago with his abrupt retirement from HSBC, sparking a frantic search for a new leader. \nHe was knighted in the New Year's honours list for his services to financial services and net zero.\nSir Noel said he was pleased to join the board \"at a time when the company is pursuing its ambitious real zero \njourney, leading the way for industry to decarbonise and transition to a fossil fuel-free future\".\n\"I look forward to bringing my experience in global banking to assist the company in achieving its long-term growth \nobjectives and continuing to deliver on shareholder value.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue board hires former HSBC boss Quinn\nIt is the second high-profile HSBC recruit to an ASX company board this year after Nuno Matos was appointed \nShayne Elliott's successor as chief executive of ANZ Bank. Mr Matos ran HSBC's global wealth and personal \nbanking division.\nHe was a potential successor to Sir Noel but was passed over in favour of Georges Elhedery, who was promoted \nfrom chief financial officer and has announced a sweeping restructure of the international banking giant.\nFortescue bolstered its board last year with the addition of Indigenous leader Noel Pearson. Other members \ninclude ex-CSIRO boss Larry Marshall and former chief executive officer Elizabeth Gaines.\nFortescue has endured a series of leadership changes over the past year after the miner abandoned its 2030 \ngreen hydrogen target. These include the departure of Julie Shuttleworth, who headed Fortescue's fledgling iron \nore operations in Gabon, and green energy division chief financial officer Deborah Caudle.\nLoad-Date: February 15, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
