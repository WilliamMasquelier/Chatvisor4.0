The money for wind turbines has been agreed as part of a government \nauction for renewable energy contracts known as the allocation round 6 (AR6). Under this system, the Government \nencourages companies to build low-carbon energy plants such as solar and wind farms by offering a minimum price \nfor the electricity generated. The money for such subsidies is eventually added to bills. The UK's power grid \noperator, National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO), calculates \"budget impact\" of the subsidies for offshore \nwind and other renewables at \u00a34bn from 2026 to 2031, in today's money.\nThe costs given exclude the additional expense of transmission lines and the expansion of the national grid to \nhandle the extra power.\nIt means more than five gigawatts (GW) of new offshore wind power is now set for construction - a stark contrast to \nlast year's botched auction round when there were no bids. The Tories offered subsidies so low - at \u00a340 per \nmegawatt hour (MWh) - that no off- shore wind developers came forward.\nPage 2 of 2\nMiliband's wind farms to cost families \u00a3150; Households to pick up \u00a33bn bill as Energy Secretary oversees \nrecord expansion of renewables\nSubsidies under Mr Miliband will be more than doubled to over \u00a382 per MWh. Solar farms will get \u00a370/MWh, with \nnewer technologies such as floating wind handed \u00a3195/MWh and tidal stream projects given \u00a3239/MWh.\nA total of 131 clean energy projects have won state subsidies in this year's auction, including 115 solar projects \nacross England and onshore wind projects mainly in Scotland and Wales.\nMany of the onshore projects are likely to prove highly controversial, with homeowners and environmentalists \nobjecting to the industrialisation of landscapes with panels and turbines.\nHowever, Mr Miliband hailed the auction results as a triumph. He said: \"We inherited a broken energy policy. Today \nwe have a record-setting round for enough renewable power for 11m homes, essential to give energy security to \nfamilies across the country. It is another significant step forward in our mission for clean power by 2030.\"\nOrsted is one of the biggest winners.\nIt has been allowed to shunt much of its Hornsea 3 project out of contracts signed under previous allocation rounds, \nwhere lower subsidies were offered, into this year's auction. A spokesman for Mr Miliband said the move had been \npermitted because otherwise Hornsea 3 - potentially the world's largest wind farm at 3GW - might never have been \nbuilt.\nCritics will argue that such contracts become meaningless if companies can simply move them from one auction \nround if a subsequent one offers better terms. Orsted was also awarded a 2.4GW CfD for Hornsea 4. Rasmus \nErrboe, of Orsted, said: \"We look forward to delivering these landmark projects, which will supply renewable power \nat a large scale to UK consumers and businesses and help the UK Government achieve its target of quadrupling \noffshore wind capacity to 60GW by 2030.\"\nScottishPower has been offered contracts for another two large wind farms, East Anglia Two and East Anglia \nThree. As with Orsted, it was allowed to move its East Anglia Three project out of the contracts signed under a \nprevious and less lucrative auction.\nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesman said it did not recognise the costs per household, but \nrenewable energy remained essential to boost UK energy security.\nLoad-Date: September 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOnly output one of these values: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and nothing else.\n                ",
