Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Ramelius Resources based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Ramelius Resources is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Ramelius Resources.\n\nIf Ramelius Resources is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nRamelius may look to M&A if Rebecca-Roe project doesn't stack up - DATA ROOM\nRamelius may look to M&A if Rebecca-Roe project doesn't stack up - DATA \nROOM\nThe Australian\nNovember 28, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 14\nLength: 505 words\nByline: EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER\nBody\nA move by Ramelius Resources on its smaller rival Spartan could rest on the release of its feasibility study into its \nRebecca-Roe development, expected out in the near term.\nShould the results prove that the project will not be all that viable, it may propel the group more towards taking the \nmergers and acquisition route for growth.\nRamelius purchased 8.9 per cent of Spartan Resources in June and it is also known to have been eyeing up other \ntargets at a time it remains cashed up with the gold price hitting record highs this year.\nCurrently, the Ramelius market value is close to $2.4bn whereas Spartan's market value is almost $1.5bn.\nRamelius Resources chief executive Mark Zeptner earlier said that the Spartan Resources project was \"in our \nbackyard\".\nRamelius is developing both the Rebecca-Roe project and Cue Gold Project, 35km south of Mt Magnet, after \nbuying Apollo Consolidated in 2022 and Musgrave Minerals the following year.\nIt owns and operates two production and processing hubs at Mt Magnet and Edna May, in Western Australia.\nSpartan owns the Dalgaranga Gold Project, 65km northwest of Mt Magnet in Murchison, where Ramelius owns a \ngold processing hub. Part of that is its Never Never high-grade gold deposit on which the company is pinning its \nhopes for growth.\nSpartan was previously called Gascoyne Resources and collapsed after gold ore levels being processed through \nits mill were not profitable, and it was later recapitalised after its market value fell beneath $100m.\nRamelius purchased Spartan shares at 92c in June, and they are currently trading at about $1.33, while Ramelius \nshares are trading at $2.09.\nPage 2 of 2\nRamelius may look to M&A if Rebecca-Roe project doesn't stack up - DATA ROOM\nLate last year, it was known around the market that Ramelius was in search of an opportunity, preferably in WA, \nwhere it could add 100,000 ounces of gold per annum and wanted to add a third production hub to put its $261m \ncash pile to work.\nMr Zeptner said in August he did not feel an obligation to get bigger but was more focused on good margins and \ncashflow.\nThe focus on Ramelius comes after the results of Newmont's recent sales campaign shows corporate activity \nbooming in the gold mining space, with Newmont achieving over $US1bn more than the market had initially \nestimated for asset sales.\nNewmont has been selling assets in North America, Australia and Africa following its $24bn acquisition of Newcrest \nin 2023. Most recently, it agreed to sell its Eleonore mine in Quebec, Canada for up to $US795m to Dhilmar, which \nanalysts at Macquarie said was 62 per cent higher than its valuation.\nNewmont expects its final two non-core remaining assets, Porcupine and Cripple Creek & Victor Mine Gold Mine in \nColorado, to be sold in the first quarter of next year, and they are valued at about $US1.5bn.\nIt had targeted returns of $US2bn from assets sales and has realised $US3.6bn, excluding two others to go A share \nbuyback is expected to be on the cards. It sold its Akyem mine in Ghana to Zijin Mining for $US1bn in October and \nhas also sold the Telfer asset in WA in August for $714m to Greatland Gold.\nLoad-Date: November 27, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Ramelius Resources.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
