Please go ahead.\\nMark Zeptner\\nThank you, Travis. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to dial into Ramelius' December 2023 \\nquarterly conference call. I'm joined this morning for the first time in a speaking role that is by acting CFO, Ben \\nRingrose, who will provide some detail on the quarterly financials after I've run through the highlights.\\nAs usual, there will be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions before we finish up the call. As you will have \\nseen this morning we reported quarterly gold reduction of 68,524 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of AUD1,837 \\nper ounce which is towards the upper end of our quarterly guidance of 60,000 to 70,000 ounces, and also in line \\nwith internal forecasts that has production increasing over the course of the financial year. The increase in the \\nDecember quarter was primarily attributable to a greater contribution from Penny underground and also mining at \\nthe Symes' open-pit operation ramping up.\\nAs I said, Ben will delve into the financials further, but I wanted to highlight upfront that the increase in production, \\nwe saw a similar trend with cash generation. Operating cash flow was 68 million with underlying free cash flow \\ntotaling 45.7 million, our best performance on that front for several years. Further, we anticipate strong cash flows \\nwill continue over the rest of the financial year and beyond. Including the December quarter contribution, first half \\nproduction totaled 12447 ounces, at an all-in sustaining cost of just under $1,900 an ounce, again ahead of our \\ninternal budgets and at the upper end of guidance.\\nYou may have noticed we have upgraded second half guidance to 140,000 to 155,000 ounces and consequently \\nfull year guidance for this financial year has also increased to 265,000 to 280,000 ounces. By way of reminder, \\noriginal guidance was 250,000 to 275,000 ounces. In terms of all-in sustaining costs, the guidance range in the \\nsecond half is AUD1700 to AUD1800, which demonstrates a continuing downward trend and results in full year all-\\nin sustaining costs for FY24 of AUD1750 to AUD1850. This compared to our original all-in sustaining cost guidance \\nof AUD1550 to AUD 1750 with the higher costs attributable to CV01 conveyor appears carried out at Mt Magnet in \\nthe quarter, which I'll expand on shortly and also an increased production contribution from Edna May, which is the \\nhigher cost production hub of the two.\\nThe split in production from our two houses were relatively even this quarter with Mt Magnet producing just over \\n35,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of AUD1,668 and Edna May also producing just over 33,000 ounces as \\nan all-in sustaining cost up to over AUD2,000 per ounce. That breakdown gives an insight into the real impact of \\nPenny on costs at Mt Magnet. Although it should be noted that the Edna May all-in sustaining figure does include a \\nreasonably significant non-cash component, which relates to the drawdown of existing stockpiles. I'll let Ben to \\nexplain the actual unit cost detail later.\\nDuring the quarter, a total of 36,829 tonnes at 12.39 grams per tonne for 14,296 recoverable ounces was hauled \\nfrom Penny to Mt Magnet. At Penny with multiple stoping areas becoming available, production is expected to \\nincrease significantly in the second half. On the CV01, mill throughput at Mt Magnet was impacted by repairs to the \\nmain conveyor structure, which goes from the crusher to the course or stockpile referred to as CV01. They put it out \\nof action for approximately nine weeks. We were however able to maintain plant feed, albeit at a slightly lower rate \\nthrough the use of a mobile crushing solution. Thankfully, the conveyer outage didn't prevent us from meeting \\nproduction targets, as the site team and external contractors managed the situation very well, but we did incur some \\nextra costs, both sustaining capital for the repairs and operating costs associated with the mobile crushing and \\nhaulage operation, which added almost AUD180 per ounce to Mt Magnet's quarterly all-in sustaining costs. The \\nrepairs were completed by mid-December and we have reviewed our structural integrity regime, and have taken \\nsteps to reduce the likelihood of similar unplanned repairs being required elsewhere in the plant in the future.\\nThe quarter saw completion of mining operations in Marda, with rehab activities now being carried out while \\nremaining stockpiles have been hauled to Edna May. At the end of the period, there was almost 450,000 tonnes \\ngrading 1.71 grams per tonne in stockpiles at Marda. A similar situation is playing out at Tampia where mining \\noperations ceased in the middle of last year, and there we have just over 635,000 tonnes at a grade near to 1.5 \\ngrams per tonne in stockpiles at the end of the quarter.Page 3 of 8\\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\\nOn to exploration; highlights in the quarter include results from resource definition work undertaken at Eridanus \\ntargeting high-grade mineralization for potential underground mining below and outside their plant of a current open \\npit. Among the better intercepts from the [Indiscernible] RC program with 13 meters at 10.4, 12 meters at 12.8, and \\n10 meters at 18.1. Important to note, all significantly better grades than what we're seeing at depths previously at \\nEridanus.\\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\\nAt Galaxy underground diamond drilling targeting the Mars ore body produced results including two meters at 28.9 \\nand four meters at 17.8, whilst diamond drilling at the Bombora deposit, part of the Roe Project acquired from \\nBreaker Resources produced first results, which included 4.5 meters at 18.7 and 4.2 meters at 11.1, which were \\nfrom the Tura underground Lode.\\nLastly, in terms of the highlights, we wrapped up the acquisition of Musgrave Minerals in October having reached \\nthe compulsory acquisition threshold of 90% acceptances. Infill and extensional diamond and RC drilling is \\nunderway at the key project targeting the high-grade Break of Day resource, but also the nearby Waratah \\nProspect. We've only received limited results at this stage. Further information on the expiration program, there's \\nplenty of detail in the quarterly itself.\\nNow that covers the highlights for me. So I'll now hand over to Ben.\\nBen Ringrose\\nThank you, Mark, and it's a pleasure to be here with you all today. December quarter was indeed a very strong one \\nfinancially for Ramelius with sales revenue of 194.5 million and an associated underlying free cash flow of 47.5 \\nmillion, which is after growth and exploration investment. On both metrics, the December quarter was our best since \\nJune 2020. During the quarter we sold just over 68,000 ounces at an average realized gold price of AUD2,855 an \\nounce, which includes a mix of spot and committed forward sales.\\nAs Mark mentioned, the all-in sustaining costs for the December quarter was AUD1,837 per ounce. Pleasingly both \\nproduction centers reported a low all-in sustaining cost than the prior quarter. At Mt Magnet, 8% reduction in all-in \\nsustaining costs was achieved despite the increased costs associated with the one-off CV01 repairs, which, as a \\nreminder, added AUD179 per announced to the Mt Magnet all-in sustaining costs for the quarter. Impact of Penny is \\nevident here along with the increased tonnages and grades from Mt Magnet's own open pit operations.\\nMoving on to Edna May, the improved all-in sustaining costs was the result of increased throughput and grades, \\nmost notably the introduction of the high-grade ore from Symes'. Whilst Edna May is reporting a higher all-in \\nsustaining costs than Mt Magnet, it is important to note that this includes a AUD227 per ounce non-cash charge for \\nthe drawdown of existing Tampia stockpiles. This non-cash component of the Edna May all-in sustaining costs will \\nincrease over the second half of FY24, as the existing Tampia, Marda and Symes' stockpiles continue to be drilling \\ndown and monetized.\\nThe resulting operating cash flow from the business was AUD68 million, from which AUD20.9 million was invested \\nin growth capital exploration and resource definition. The quarter also saw Ramelius return AUD17.3 million in \\ncash to shareholders by our via FY23 dividend paid in October 2023, as well as complete the Musgrave Minerals \\nacquisition with a final consideration payment of AUD2.1 million. AUD10.5 million investment in growth capital for \\nthe quarter mainly related to the Galaxy underground mine and the AUD10.4 million spent on exploration and \\nresource definition in the quarter focused on the Rebecca and Roe Gold Project and the recently acquired Cue \\nGold Project. Both capital and exploration spent is in line with our forecast and we have maintained our full-year \\nguidance on capital and project development expenditure of AUD50 million to AUD60 million and exploration and \\nresource definition expenditure of AUD30 [Phonetic] million.\\nThe closing cash and gold position of AUD281.8 million was our best on record leaving Ramelius in a very healthy \\nfinancial position. Further to this, a total of AUD9.2 million was received from the -- was due from the ATO in \\nDecember. However, the late payment of this by the ATO meant these funds were only received by Ramelius in Page 4 of 8\\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\\nthe first week of January. Notionally, including this, the reported cash and gold at 31 December would have been \\nAUD291 million. In addition to the strong cash and gold position is our AUD100 million debt facility, which remains \\nin place and undrawn.\\nThe Aussie dollar spot price increased 5% over the December quarter, finishing at just under AUD3,030 an ounce. \\nIn fact, the Aussie dollar gold price has had a daily closing price above AUD3,000 every day since the 12th of \\nOctober 2023, a trend that is continuing into the March 2024 quarter. What is even more encouraging about this is \\nthat this AUD3,000 plus gold price was maintained despite the strengthening Aussie dollar pointing to a \\nfundamental increase in the US dollar gold value.\\nDuring the quarter, we continued to gradually rundown our fixed price contracts delivering 30,000 ounces into \\nmaturing contracts and replacing 24,000 of these at an average price of AUD3,259 an ounce. At the end of the \\nquarter, forward gold sales consisted of 192,000 ounces at an average price of AUD2,918 an ounce over the period \\nJanuary 2024 to June 2026. As you will note, our committed ounces have decreased over the financial year and we \\nexpect this trend to continue for the remainder of FY24. A disciplined hedge book maintenance over the past 12 \\nmonths leaves the book in a very healthy position.\\nLastly to note on gold sales is that with the increased production forecasted for H2, our exposure to the spot price \\nwill increase in the second half of FY24.\\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\\nWith that I'll now hand back to Mark.\\nMark Zeptner\\nThanks Ben. Travis, if we could please open the line up for questions.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Hayden Bairstow from Argonaut. Please go \\nahead.\\nHayden Bairstow\\nHi, good morning guys. Pretty impressive results at Magnet mining wise. I mean just get a field of view to the \\nsecond half and obviously you push guidance a bit higher about Edna May, I mean despite that mill shut down, and \\nwhat -- how are we looking second half on ounces into Magnet, looks like it's going to be a pretty sizable increase.\\nMark Zeptner\\nYeah. Good morning, Hayden. It's Mark. I don't have the numbers off top my head but it's driven obviously by \\nincreases at Penny combined with the gradual ramp up at Galaxy but probably more importantly at Magnet is \\nreducing strip ratio at Eridanus and improving grades at depth. We're saying that back into it as there was a bit of a \\nlower grade section that we mined through for 12 months, but we're back into much better grades at Eridanus. So \\nthe combination of those three things leads to a very strong second half at Magnet. I'm not sure if you've got the \\nnumbers Ben but I won't put you on the spot with that. But yeah, we can provide some numbers Hayden.\\nHayden Bairstow\\nYeah, okay. And just on -- I guess more beyond 2025, just given you locking in hedging, almost 3300 an ounce and \\nthen does that start to make the stage very cut back at Magnet look like a more attractive option for you guys to sort \\nof deliver to production decline there?\\nMark ZeptnerPage 5 of 8\\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\\nPotentially, you're a little bit ahead of where we're focused on right at the moment. We will be putting out this \\nquarter a new Mt Magnet mine plan and then probably turning our attention to see sort of 12 months on from when \\nwe made the decision to defer stage three where we stand. We're obviously seeing some things in the market labor \\nwise that are starting to ease. Unfortunately, that's brought about by some closures of operations, but we think, in a \\ncouple of months time, we will dust that off and see where we're at, Hayden.\\nHayden Bairstow\\nAnd the Magnet mine plan, that obviously incorporates all the key stuff, I presume, is that going to come with an \\nupgrade to that -- or an update to that three year guidance?\\nMark Zeptner\\nYeah, the idea with the Mt Magnet mine plan is obviously, including any Penny extensions, which we've already \\nflagged, the Q project in its entirety and then obviously, the portfolio of projects at Mt Magnet itself, including \\n[Indiscernible] et cetera. There's a whole list of names there, so everything that goes into Mt Magnet out for the \\nforeseeable future.\\nHayden Bairstow\\nAlright. Perfectly alluded. Thanks, guys.\\nMark Zeptner\\nThanks, Hayden.\\nOperator\\nThank you. The next question comes from Alex Barkley from RBC. Please go ahead.\\nAlex Barkley\\nThanks. Good morning Mark and Ben. Question on that strong Edna May production this year. Is that mostly \\naround accelerated mining and haulage? Does that mean, it might get pulled forward from FY25 or is there some \\nother component to the strong result this year? Thanks.\\nMark Zeptner\\nIt is Mark again. Alex, good morning. Stronger performance out of the underground definitely. Since we've \\naddressed the water issues, which were prominent mid-to-late last year, the team out there has really hit some \\ndecent production numbers. It's a small underground, but they are pushing towards 30,000 ton a month there. So \\nthat may bring forward some production there into 2024. The haulage, I think, has been pretty consistent. The \\nramping up and the inclusion of Symes' sort of has added to that. And I think some of the Symes' grades are \\nprobably a little better than we might have expected in certain areas of the pit as well. So I don't think we're robbing \\nPeter to pay Paul at the Edna May. I think it's better performance, the underground with better grades, and sort of \\nconsistent haulage like in summer.\\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\\nAlex Barkley\\nOkay. That's very helpful. Thanks very much, guys.\\nMark Zeptner\\nThanks, Alex.Page 6 of 8\\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\\nOperator\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Dr. Richard Hatch from Topwheel [Phonetic]. \\nPlease go ahead.\\nRichard Hatch\\nHello, Mark, and Ben. Happy New Year to you and thanks for another great performance. I thought a brilliant \\nperformance, particularly with the conveyor belt problems. Obviously, I had a question about it, and may everybody \\ndoes about what happens next, but I'll leave that one alone. One thing I remember talking about, I think last time \\nwas your hedging of oil and I see you have hedged 5 million liters. I just wondered, how does that 0.991 price \\nhedge diesel compare -- beware, I won't judge you because I'm all for hedging for insurance, but how does it \\ncompare with current price?\\nBen Ringrose\\nHi, Richard, and thanks for the question. It's Ben here. We put that diesel hedging program in place probably 12 \\nmonths ago, and it's served us quite well, I guess over the last 12 months and continue to do so and we have had \\nsome cash returned on those hedges, which is good. That 91 cents, the price we're paying today is 98 cents, so it's \\nmarginally in the money. It has been more in the money over the past 12 months but, yeah, it is getting closer.\\nMark Zeptner\\nIt's the rebated figure to have [Multiple Speakers].\\nBen Ringrose\\nThat's right, yeah.\\nMark Zeptner\\nYeah, it is not the price you see at the service station.\\nBen Ringrose\\nYeah.\\nRichard Hatch\\nNow I understand that. Well, again, congratulations. That's an interesting area for you to go into but well done being \\nwinners again. Anyway, thanks for all you've done.\\nMark Zeptner\\nThanks, Richard.\\nOperator\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Ashley Chen from shareholder. Please go ahead.\\nAshley Chen\\nHi, Mark. Hi, Ben. Thanks again for a nice quarter and your hard work for it. I just have a question on the -- also on \\nthe diesel hedging strategy. Can you give some more details on your thinking now for the next two, three, four years \\nin regards to hedging? I can see production -- if production were to be 550,000 over two years, your current hedge \\nbook is about 33% hedged? Are you expecting to reduce that to 25%, 20%? That is my first question. And second \\nquestion are something completely different. As you probably know, the government has put a positive duty on \\nemployers to prevent harassment, sexual harassment, at work and the Australian Human Rights Commission Page 7 of 8\\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\\nprobably spot the iron ore industry, Rio Tinto, BHP, and its sights at the moment, but eventually you'll come around \\nto the gold industry. What programs or what anti-harassment programs Ramelius Resources is planning to \\nimplementing or planning to implement over the next couple of years?\\nBen Ringrose\\nThanks, Ashley. I will take those ones. It's Ben. In terms of hedging policy, I think Tim Manners late last year \\nreported that the Board is in the process of reviewing our policy and if there are any changes -- obviously, there's \\nnot a lot of Board meetings through December, January, but if there is any change, then we'll obviously inform the \\nmarket on that one. In the meantime, we are gradually running off our book, as we have been for some time. In \\nterms of our duty to prevent harassment, it's not something that we've waited to be told that we should look at it or \\nare we planning to. We've been reasonably proactive in that area. When people start with the company, they run \\nthrough workplace behavior training, we have a whistleblower line. I think a lot of the goldies have a lot of these \\nthings in place, we've assessed our sites for the safety and security, and we're basically taking a no tolerance \\napproach to those who crossed the line. Unfortunately, there've been a few cases and those people are no longer \\nworking for us or the contractors associated with that. So we've done a lot in that area and we continue to try to \\nimprove.\\nAshley Chen\\nThank you.\\nBen Ringrose\\nThanks, Ashley.\\nOperator\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for a moment to allow parties to enter the queue. The next question \\ncomes from Steven Goranson [Phonetic] from RE Funds Management. Please go ahead.\\nUnidentified Participant\\nHi, guys. Just a quick question around Musgrave. What have you seen to date since the acquisition and when do \\nyou expect to -- for us to start thinking about when we should be seeing Musgrave coming through the mill?\\nMark Zeptner\\nThanks for the question, Steve. I will answer that. It's Mark. Look, what we're saying is that the team at Musgrave \\ndid an excellent job in terms of drilling the ore body out and preparing resources and mine plans that are pretty \\nclose to production ready. Our optimizations and reruns of [Indiscernible] are very similar and very close, which is \\nalways company. It's not what you'll always find, I have to add. In terms of production, we hope to be developing in \\nthe second half of this calendar year with -- I'd say, or first or sort of September, August, September, obviously \\nramping up through that period. So perhaps, I sent it earlier than some expect. We've already submitted our mining \\nproposal and we're on like the third back and forwards with the department on that. So assuming we get approvals \\nprior to June, then we should be ready to go from July onwards.\\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\\nUnidentified Participant\\nThat's an great sign. Thanks very much for that, Mark.\\nMark Zeptner\\nThanks, Steve.Page 8 of 8\\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\\nOperator\\nThank you. The next question comes from Andrew Bowler from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\\nAndrew Bowler\\nHello, gents. Quick one from me. Obviously, handy tax refund post quarter end. Just wondering if you're expecting \\nany more over the remainder of the financial year or is that what you're expecting to say?\\nBen Ringrose\\nHi, Andrew. It's Ben here, I'll take that one. No, that tax refund related to the 2023 tax term, it is a one-off, I guess, \\nand we don't expect that to be a recurring throughout the financial year.\\nAndrew Bowler\\nAlright. Thanks.\\nBen Ringrose\\nThanks, Andrew.\\nOperator\\nThank you. At this time, we're showing no further questions. I'll hand the conference back to Mark for closing \\nremarks.\\nMark Zeptner\\nThank you, Travis. I'd just like to make two points to wrap up. Ramelius is one of the few Aussie gold producers \\nactually upgrading guidance and therefore we are expecting to deliver a very strong cash flows in the second half of \\nFY24. I mean, as already mentioned, we are on track to deliver our new Mt Magnet mine plan this current quarter, \\nwhich promises to include Penny, Cue, as well as all the portfolio of projects at Mt Magnet itself. Thank you for \\nlistening in this morning. Enjoy the rest of your day.\\nLoad-Date: January 30, 2024\\nEnd of Document\",\n      \"Page 1 of 2\\nRamelius in exclusive talks to buy Canada-listed gold miner; Street Talk\\nRamelius in exclusive talks to buy Canada-listed gold miner; Street Talk\\nAustralian Financial Review\\nMarch 8, 2024 Friday\\nPrint & First Editions\\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Street Talk; Pg. 14\\nLength: 452 words\\nByline: Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood and Emma Rapaport\\nBody\\nRamelius Resources is in exclusive due diligence to acquire Toronto-listed West Australian gold miner Karora \\nResources, which it hopes will add a new production centre to replace its ageing Edna May asset.\\nStreet Talk can reveal Ramelius boss Mark Zeptner will spend $700 million to $1 billion for the acquisition. Karora \\nwill bring new production hubs with mills, and could help the company consolidate its position in the region. A \\nRamelius spokesperson declined to comment.\\nKarora's portfolio, located 60 kilometres from Kalgoorlie, includes 100 per cent ownership of the Beta Hunt mine, \\nHigginsville gold operations and Spargos gold mine. It is expected to produce 170,000 to 195,000 ounces gold in \\n2024. By contrast, Ramelius has told shareholders it would hit 272,500 ounces production this financial year.\\nZeptner and his team are chasing the acquisition after a period of solid performance and perky gold prices. \\nRamelius shares have risen nearly 48 per cent in the past year, giving it a $1.8 billion market capitalisation and a \\nstrong balance sheet.\\nIn particular, it has benefited from high-grade Penny ore being fed into the Mt Magnet Mill. Cash and gold reserves \\nare expected to hit $400 million by year-end, while about $100 million in undrawn debt would further boost its \\nliquidity profile.\\nRamelius reported a 14 per cent increase in revenue to $348.5 million at its half-year results on February 20. \\nEBITDA shot up 39 per cent to $140.2 million, thanks to a 12 per cent jump in realised gold price.\\nRamelius' biggest asset is the Mt Magnet production centre, which it started building via a $40 million acquisition in \\n2010. Now, 14 years on, Mt Magnet speaks for 62 per cent of the group's gold reserves.\\nWhen combined with the Vivien gold deposit and Penny gold mine, it is 53 per cent of the total net present value, \\naccording to Macquarie Capital analysts.

Lawson is the managing director of Spartan Resources.\\nSpartan shares soared from 22\\u00a2 to as high as $1.33 in the past 12 months on the back of the Never Never \\ndiscovery about 800 kilometres south of their emergency landing. Bellevue has been as high as $2.10, although it \\nnow hovers near a 12-month low of $1.25.\\nLawson and Stralow were two of the star attractions at the Diggers & Dealers mining conference in Kalgoorlie, \\nwhere gold was centre stage. The critical minerals presenters did their best to sound upbeat but were a reminder of \\nfickle commodity markets and how quickly high-flyers can crash.\\nKalgoorlie is relying on gold as it deals with the fallout from the collapse of the nickel industry and failures to launch \\nin lithium in the wider Goldfields region.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nGold saves the day as Diggers deals with the rout\\nSmoke still pours from the 150-metre-high main chimney stack at the BHP nickel smelter outside the town, but it will \\nstop soon after 51 years.\\nAbout 10 kilometres away, on the edge of town, Northern Star is investing $1.5 billion on a giant crusher to boost \\noutput from the fabled Superpit and underground mines. Those operations cover ground that has already produced \\nabout 65 million ounces of gold worth about $222 billion at today's spot price of $US2398 ($3700) an ounce.\\nStralow reminds everyone of how tough it can be to get new mines into production and running, even with price \\ntailwinds.\\nHe needed to do so as an explanation of Bellevue's decision to raise $150 million last month, a move that caught \\nthe market by surprise. At least Bellevue could raise money. Commodity analysts Citi and others have predicted the \\ngold price could reach $US3000 an ounce by this time next year under a bullish scenario.\\nRaising money appears a forlorn hope for lithium projects, with benchmark prices for the concentrate produced in \\nWA slumping to $US870 a tonne this week. Liontown Resources managing director Tony Ottaviano, who has just \\ndefied the odds to bring the Kathleen Valley mine to life, told the conference it was now impossible to fund a lithium \\nproject with equity alone.\\nLithium veteran Ken Brinsden, who piloted Pilbara Minerals through near ruin, suggested the federal government \\ncreate something akin to the former Australian Wheat Board to help fund strategically important rare earths \\nprojects.\\nWhile the Kalgoorlie pubs did a roaring trade, the BHP stand inside the conference's main marquee stood almost \\nempty. All it had to offer was advice on where there might be other jobs after the mothballing of the nickel smelter \\nand mines that were the lifeblood of towns such as Leinster and Kambalda.\\nLawson brought his gold company back to life after a triple bypass. It failed twice when known as Gascoyne \\nResources. He was sacking workers two years ago but has had remarkable success with the drill bit since then \\nunder the Spartan moniker.\\nSpartan's most exciting discovery is Never Never, part of the Dalgaranga project. And it is one reason that mid-tier \\nminer Ramelius Resources has grabbed a near 18 per cent stake in the company amid a flurry of M&A in the WA \\ngold sector. The Diggers organisers showed a sense of theatre when Spartan boss Lawson and Ramelius boss \\nMark Zeptner spoke back-to-back on Wednesday. Lawson has stirred the pot by suggesting that with a market \\ncapitalisation of $1.2 billion, Spartan might now be too much to bite off for $2.16 billion Ramelius.\\nLess than a year ago, he was hoping Ramelius, Westgold or Silver Lake would come knocking about a deal and \\nbemoaning a timid approach to M&A in the gold sector.\\n\\\"I stand by that,\\\" Lawson said this week. \\\"There was a little confusion about why no one had moved on me earlier. \\nWhy did [Ramelius] wait until it cost them $185 million to get less than 20 per cent of my company? I'm still \\nconfused as to why cashed-up gold producers, who are actually running at a pretty good premium and with \\npremium gold prices, are not more active in that M&A space.\\\"\\nNorthern Star, valued at $16.3 billion, made many of its acquisitions at times when the gold price was in the \\ndoldrums.\\nBoth Northern Star boss Stuart Tonkin and Evolution Mining executive chairman Jake Klein said this week that they \\nwere less inclined to make acquisitions at a high gold price.\\nDespite the impressive size and grade of Never Never, one hurdle for Lawson has been the stigma associated with \\nGascoyne. \\\"One particular fund manager said he hated Gascoyne, it had torched $35 million of his fund and that it \\nreally left a bad taste in his mouth,\\\" Lawson says. \\\"He said he wasn't interested in hearing our story, but he turned \\nup, sat in a corner and pretended not to listen. Eight minutes later he wanted 5 per cent.\\\"Page 3 of 3\\nGold saves the day as Diggers deals with the rout\\nLawson is also backing his mate Stralow to deliver with Bellevue despite some grumblings about the capital raising \\nat a big discount. \\\"There's more money in the tank now [at Bellevue], and he's running the highest-grade gold mine \\nin Australia. It's going to be very profitable,\\\" he adds.\\nLast year at Diggers, lithium was all the rage, with Albemarle about to up its bid for Liontown to $6.6 billion and Gina \\nRinehart and Chile's SQM working up to a joint $1.7 billion takeover offer for explorer Azure Minerals.\\nAndrew Forrest-backed Wyloo had just completed its $760 million acquisition of nickel miner Mincor. BHP was \\nplanning to build a 1000-bed village at Kalgoorlie to accommodate the workforce needed for a major overhaul and \\nupdate of its nickel smelter.\\nA year later, the Wyloo mines are mothballed and BHP has written down the value of its nickel business by $5.4 \\nbillion. Glencore and IGO Limited have the only nickel mines still standing in WA - and they are just hanging on.\\nIGO sold its 30 per cent stake in Tropicana, one of WA's biggest gold mines, to Regis Resources in 2021 as part of \\na big punt on battery minerals that involved acquiring stakes in the Greenbushes lithium mine and a still mis-firing \\nlithium hydroxide refinery.\\nThe same green metals strategy led to the disastrous acquisition of nickel miner Western Areas.\\nThose deals were done before Ivan Vella arrived as chief executive. He remains optimistic on lithium but isn't so \\nsure about a nickel revival in the face of growing supply from Chinese-backed producers in Indonesia.\\n\\\"What we do know is a lot of WA nickel mines are actually quite old.

Please go ahead.\\nMark Zeptner\\nThank you, Sigar. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to dial in this morning to our FY '24 \\nresults call. Alongside me is Chief Financial Officer, Darren Millman, who will drill down into the financials after I've \\ncovered off on the highlights. This morning, we have uploaded to the ASX platform, along with our website a \\nPage 2 of 5\\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\\nnumber of documents, including our FY '24 financial results summary and the presentation, which we'll be largely \\nspeaking to you this morning, and also our audited statutory financial report.\\nAs mentioned initially discussed the high-level FY '24 results, then Darren will dive into a bit more detail, and then \\nwe'll talk about the FY '25 outlook and also the dividend that we announced this morning. Once we have done that, \\nthere will also be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions. So, in terms of the presentation, if we only hopefully \\ngot that handy, we jump to Slide 3, with our mining and production highlights.\\nAlthough we mined less ore tonnes in FY '24 compared to the previous year, the contained gold mined, which is \\nwhat counts, was up on the prior year due to a higher mine grade. The primary driver of the lower tonnes was the \\ncompletion of mining activities across the Edna May hub, most notably at Tampia, where mining activities were \\ncompleted last year.\\nIncreased ore from Eridanus and the introduction of Symes offset the stocking tonnes in part. The improved mine \\ngrade was driven by 2 factors: increased tonnages and grade from Penny, which reported a mine grade just over 12 \\ngrams per tonne for the year, and also a strong performance from Eridanus, which saw open pit tonnages at Mt \\nMagnet increased 50%, but at a 60% higher grade than the prior year. If we move on to our processing activities, \\ntonnes milled were up on the prior year, mainly as a result of additional haulage capacity across the Edna May hub.\\nPleasingly, this increase in tonnes milled for the group was achieved despite the interruptions to the CV01 conveyor \\nrepairs carried out in November, December last year at Mt Magnet. This increased throughput, combined with \\nimproved milled grade resulted in a 22% increase in gold production to the record number of 293,000 ounces, \\nwhich was at the upper end of our upgraded production guidance for FY '24.\\nOn cost sales and sustaining costs as reported in the June quarterly was $15.83 an ounce, which is one of the best \\nwithin our industry and something we're pretty proud of here at Ramelius. It is also most pleasing that we're able to \\ndeliver these results with a declining TRIFR or total recordable injury frequency rate across the year and also \\nachieved a 12-month LTI-free milestone in May 2024.\\nBefore I hand over to Darren, I'd just like to note this is the second year in a row where I've been able to comment \\nthat the annual results on just about every metric are an improvement on the prior year. And importantly, these \\nresults have not only been driven by the A dollar gold price, but also our low-cost base, which I believe distinguish \\nus from our peers, and we do anticipate that the positive results will continue into FY '25. Over to you, Darren.\\nDarren Millman\\nThanks, Mark. For those following on the presentation, I'll initially speaking to Slide 4. Before moving on to the \\ndiscussion of earnings, I'd like to highlight that I will be talking to our underlying earnings. When we refer to \\nunderlying earnings, we are essentially backing out the large nonrecurring items in an attempt to communicate what \\nwe believe is the most reflective results from our operations for the year and appropriate comparative to the prior \\nyear. The main difference between our underlying earnings and our statutory net profit after tax earnings for the \\ncurrent year relates to acquired tax losses.\\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\\nIn our underlying earnings, we removed the tax benefit of $23.9 million associated with the recognition of tax losses \\nthat was acquired as part of the Musgrave and Brake acquisitions made in FY '23 and early FY '24, respectively. Of \\nthis, $14.6 million remains on our balance sheet for utilization on future periods. Indeed, since FY '19, Ramelius \\nhas acquired tax losses over the years to the tune of $24.5 million. This is a true realized savings in cash tax \\npayment savings.\\nLastly, before moving on to the financials, we have for reference, provided a few appendices in this presentation, \\nwhich reconciles the underlying earnings and cash flow for the statutory reports for the financial statements.Page 3 of 5\\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\\nI trust you'll find this useful. As a reminder for FY '24, the company achieved record production, record earnings, \\nrecord cash flow and a record dividend with the backdrop, happy to discuss the numbers in a little bit more detail. \\nWe achieved a top line revenue of $882.6 million, which was 40% up from the prior year with gold sales of 293,966 \\nounces at a realized price of 2,995 per ounce, a 16% increase on the prior year.\\nThe increased revenue was not only due to higher gold price, which added $119 million, but also increased gold \\nproduction, which added $131 million when compared to FY '23. EBITDA of $462.2 million was up 67% on the prior \\nyear and represents a margin of 52%, a $1,573 per ounce sold.\\nOn both metrics, we continue to be at the top of our peer group. Net profit after tax of $200.3 million was up 166% \\non prior year, with earnings being driven by improved grades, with lower cost of production per ounce and a strong \\ncurrency of AU gold price. Statutory earnings per share of $19.5 were up 181% on the prior year. Further analysis \\non EBITDA can be found on Slide 6, which shows the positive trend from H1 to H2 with the EBITDA margin \\nincreasing 40% in H1 to 60% in H2.\\nIn addition to this, the earnings profile for Mt Magnet and Edna May can be seen with Mt Magnet being the clear \\ndriver in earnings recording EBITDA margin of 79% in H2.\\nLooking at Mt Magnet in isolation on Slide 7 shows EBITDA margin for FY '24 of 2,121 per ounce. This earning \\ncapacity of Mt Magnet bodes well for the future with the production center poised of further growth in FY '25.\\nThis will be driven by increased production from Penny, the introduction of Q and the exciting upside potential from \\nEridanus to be open pit or underground. Indeed, we see FY '25 as another very strong year of cash build and \\nearnings. It's worth highlighting in FY '25, we are guiding to a 50% increase in production at the Mt Magnet hub.\\nMoving to cash. We believe it is important -- one of the most important financial measures of our business, and \\nSlide 8 and 9, you will see our key cash metrics. Our operating cash flow for the year was $445 million or 1,515 per \\nounce. Investing cash flow totaled $242.7 million, which includes investments into our existing business for plant \\nequipment, mine development and exploration of $123.1 million, our acquisition of Musgrave and our strategic \\ninvestment in Spartan.\\nThe free cash flow being the net of operating and investing cash flow was $212.1 million after returning $17.3 \\nmillion to shareholders via our FY '23 dividend and lease payments, total cash inflow for the year was $173.3 \\nmillion.\\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\\nOur low-cost production, coupled with our strong Australian gold price resulted in Ramelius returning $315.8 million \\nin underlying free cash flow for FY '24. Once again, one of the best returns amongst our peers. The resulting cash \\nand gold at the end of the year was $446.6 million. Turning now to Slide 10 and our cash balance sheet, which we \\nconsider to be one of our key strengths. Our cash and gold bullion on hand are complemented with a further 65,000 \\nounces of gold contained in current stockpiles and within circuit, which we will monetize in the coming 12 months, \\nleaving Ramelius with excellent liquidity.\\nIn addition to this, in July, we executed a new finance facility for $175 million, which is an upsized replacement of \\nour previous $100 million facility. Facility was undrawn at the reporting date remains as of the same to this day. As \\nwe mentioned in the past, we're in the process of progressively reducing our hedge book, which at 30 June 2024, \\nsat at 155,000 ounces at an average price of $3,081 per ounce. The only new hedging put in place recently was \\nthat we put hedges of 41,500 ounces at Edna May production out to January 2025, ensuring that the cost will not be \\nsold below 3,400 per ounce, locking in meaningful cash flow from the remaining Edna May stockpiles. With that, I'll \\nhand it back to Mark.\\nMark ZeptnerPage 4 of 5\\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\\nThanks, Darren. So, if we can jump to Slide 11 to 13 now touching on our portfolio and guidance for FY '25. On gold \\nproduction, you will see we expect a higher margin that Magnet operation to make up a higher proportion of gold \\nproduction with Edna May to be placed in care and maintenance once the existing stockpiles across that hub are \\nprocessed. Overall, group production for FY '25 is expected to be comparable to FY '24. Our all-in sustaining cost is \\nalso expected to be largely in line with FY '24, but with a higher gold price, which we have assumed at $3,500 per \\nounce as per the chart on Slide 12, plus our existing hedge book, will see us deliver some 92,000 ounces at $29.45 \\nper ounce in FY '25.\\nWe'll see a further increase in cash margins. Production and the result in lower all-in sustaining cost is expected to \\nbe weighted to H2 of FY '25. And finally, on our guidance for FY '25, I'd like to make 2 points, which we have made \\nbefore. Whilst Edna May does have a higher all-in sustaining cost, there is approximately $500 an ounce of this -- \\nthat relates to noncash drawdowns of existing stockpiles. And secondly, we are expecting a notable reduction in our \\ngrowth capital spend in FY '25, particularly in the second half.\\nWith the development of leveraging off in the first half, leveraging off our existing Magnet plant, infrastructure, such \\nas airstrips and camps, realizing true regional synergies there. We like to think we have a good reputation in the \\nmarket for doing what we say and delivering on our promises. We see no reason for this not to continue into FY '25 \\nand also look forward to presenting a revised Mt Magnet mine plan in the new year once we have the optimal \\ndesign for Eridanus open pit or underground. Turning to Slide 14. Perhaps the highlight, our declared dividend for \\nFY '24.\\nWe're proud of our track record on dividends. And today, we are not only declaring our sixth consecutive dividend \\nabout 150% increase in the prior year to $0.05 per share fully franked. This represents a payout ratio of 27% of free \\ncash flow. In approving the final dividend, the Board gave consideration to the additional strategic investment in \\nSpartan, internal growth opportunities at Eridanus, and potential mill expansions at Mt Magnet as well as potential \\ncapital commitment requirements for Rebecca Roe. The dividend represents a yield of 2.6% based on 30 June \\nshare price and a total shareholder return over the last 5 years of 21% per annum.\\nOur dividend reinvestment plan has now been in place for a couple of years now with last year's participation at \\n22%. It is pleasing to see an increasing number of shareholders opting to take up the opportunity to use their \\ndividends to purchase additional Ramelius shares. That opportunity will again be available with the price of shares \\nto be calculated at a 2% discount to the 10-day VWAP from the date of election. Last year's dividend payment \\namounted to $22.3 million in cash and reinvestment this year. The return will be up to $57.2 million, which will be \\npaid in October.\\nLast slide, moving on to Slide 15, where we're looking at our focus areas, I'll skip to the final 2 areas being \\nexploration opportunities and near-term catalysts. We have budgeted to invest another $40 million to $50 million in \\nexploration this year, with opportunities at Mt Magnet, Penny and Rebecca Roe areas shaping us having high \\npotential to deliver additional resource ounces and further bolstering reserves. There are a number of near-term \\ncatalysts that we see, including the progression of drilling at Eridanus and Galaxy, which will culminate more likely \\nin an upgraded Mt Magnet mine plan.\\nIn addition to this, we look forward to providing updated mineral resource inventory for Roe, and ultimately, the \\npublication of the associated PFS for the combined Rebecca Roe project. That concludes the presentation.\\nI'll now hand back to the operator, Sigar, you can open the line for questions, please.\\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Paul Kaner from Ord Minnett.Page 5 of 5\\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\\nPaul Kaner\\nCouple here, if I may. So firstly, on tax, thanks for giving that income tax guidance for FY '25. But how should we \\nthink about cash tax paid for FY '24?\\nDarren Millman\\nYes. Thanks, Paul. As I noted in the numbers there, we had that advantage in 2024, in 2025 -- or 2025 and beyond, \\nwe serve approximately $25 million available. In 2025, we're probably expecting around $15 million to have a \\nsimilar tax cash benefit is our expectations for 2025.\\nPaul Kaner\\nYes, that's great. And then maybe one for you, Mark. Just on capital returns. I think your payout was about 27% of \\nfree cash flow and your policy allows for up to 30%. I guess, any thoughts on changing this policy?\\nOr are you sort of happy capping at 30% and then, I guess, using the remainder of the free cash flow on sort of \\norganic and inorganic opportunities?\\nMark Zeptner\\nYes. We obviously had a lengthy discussion at Board level. To summarize, we're happy with our policy. We didn't \\nquite go all the way to 30%. But we like -- we have got a number of internal projects coming up.\\nAnd we felt that we struck a balance between returns to shareholders and providing cash for those projects.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand back to Mr. Zeptner for closing \\nremarks.\\nMark Zeptner\\nThank you, Sigar. I can't remember the last time we only had one question, but we must have covered everything. \\nSo, to wrap up, just 3 points, a record year for earnings and cash generation in FY '24 for Ramelius, a similarly \\nstrong outlook for FY '25 and beyond. And a $0.05 fly-free dividend announced today being the sixth consecutive \\nyear of dividend payments, a 150% increase on the prior year with over $130 million potentially returned to \\nshareholders.

In addition to the \\nquarterly report, we've also released a presentation that we'll largely speak to during the call. Both documents have \\nbeen uploaded on the ASX platform and will be available on the website shortly.\\nPage 2 of 6\\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\\nOnce again, I'm joined by our CFO, Darren Millman. Darren will provide some detail on the financials after I've run \\nthrough the highlights and touched on the operational performance and our development projects. As always, there \\nwill be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions at the end.\\nFor those who have downloaded the presentation deck, I'll be initially speaking to Slide 3. I'll focus on the highlights \\nand key achievements for the quarter. I would like to point out that there is a large amount of detail on exploration, \\noperations and project development within the quarterly report itself.\\nSo on Slide 3, operationally and financially, the December quarter was exceptionally strong, with the business \\ngenerating a record and also sector-leading AUD 174.5 million in underlying free cash flow. After considering our \\nadditional investment in Spartan during the quarter of AUD 68 million and the payment of our FY '24 AUD 0.05 per \\nshare dividend, our closing cash and gold position was just over AUD 500 million.\\nOur quarterly gold production was 85,311 ounces, which was a 37% increase on the prior quarter, noting also just \\nshy of our record production, which occurred in the March 2024 quarter. The increase in production was mainly due \\nto the introduction of ore from Cue, which performed extremely well during the quarter and also improved grades \\nfrom Penny. I'll talk to these points in more detail shortly.\\nLooking at the costs, we saw a 25% decrease in our all-in sustaining costs down to AUD 1,491 for the quarter. Now \\nwhilst we were guiding for a reduction in all-in sustaining costs across the year, the all-in sustaining cost for the \\nquarter was below our expectations and obviously benefited from the outperformance of Cue. Importantly, our \\nguidance for FY '25 remains unchanged at 270,000 to 300,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of AUD 1,500 to \\nAUD 1,700 an ounce.\\nWhilst we are encouraged by the indicative overperformance of Cue grades, it is still relatively early days, and we \\nwill continue to assess this during the March quarter as more data becomes available as mining and milling \\nprogresses.\\nUnfortunately, during the quarter, we did record our first LTI since May 2023. Whilst this is extremely disappointing, \\nthe incident itself, which is detailed in the quarterly report, was not of a serious nature. We do strive to ensure that \\nall employees and contractors remain healthy -- safe and healthy under our watch. The total recordable injury \\nfrequency rate, or TRIFR, at the end of December was 8.33, which was only marginally higher than that recorded \\nlast quarter.\\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\\nThere were several milestones and advancements in our key projects across the quarter with haulage to [Cue] \\ncommencing mid-November following the completion of the Great Northern Highway intersection upgrade and also \\ndelivery of the Rebecca Roe PFS, which is demonstrating strong economic returns.\\nFor the immediate future, our focus is on delivery of the Eridanus and Mt Magnet mill upgrade studies and \\nassociated mine plan in this quarter and the Rebecca Roe DFS, which is targeting a final investment decision in the \\nSeptember quarter. Exploration and resource definition activities during the quarter were largely focused on \\nEridanus, Penny West and the Lena pit at Cue.\\nOn Slide 4, I will draw your attention on -- sorry, we're looking here at the quarterly production breakdown for the \\nlast 12 months. If you look at the yellow Mt Magnet bars, you can see the previous September quarter, we focused \\nlargely on the development of Cue. And now we see that asset in production, along with improved grades at Penny, \\nhas been the main driver of increased production in the December quarter. As expected, Edna May production is \\nslowly winding down.\\nOn to Slide 5, which references quarterly production stats. The standout here is the mine grade for the quarter of \\n7.3 grams per tonne, which is more than double that of the September quarter and has been driven once again by \\ngrades at Cue and Penny, which were 7.4 and 17.9 grams per tonne, respectively.Page 3 of 6\\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\\nNow whilst the ore tonnes mined reduced, it needs to be highlighted that there still is a fair amount of pre-strip and \\ndevelopment taking place at Cue. We expect comparable mined ore tonnes to continue into the March quarter as \\nwe progress development before we start to see an increase in these ore tonnes in the June 2025 quarter. Mill \\nthroughput levels were maintained during the quarter with the drawdown of existing stockpiles across Edna May \\nand also the Eridanus stockpile at Mt Magnet.\\nOn to Slide 6, we're showing Mt Magnet's highlights. Production from Mt Magnet totaled just over 67,000 ounces at \\nan all-in sustaining cost of AUD 1,277. Open pit mining at Mt Magnet is now solely focused at Cue, with the Break \\nof Day, Waratah and White Heat pits all being mined during the quarter. Productivities increased during the quarter \\nwith the introduction of a third excavator, which resulted in a 44% increase in material movement quarter-on-\\nquarter. Underground operations continue to focus on Galaxy and Penny. At Galaxy, mining was largely in line with \\nthe prior quarter, whilst at Penny, both tonnages and grade increased, most notably the mine grade, which is \\nattributable to stoping on the 1252 level, which is central to the high-grade plunge of the Penny North load.\\nI would also like to highlight, the overall mill grade at Mt Magnet in the quarter was 5.1 grams. This is the highest \\ngrade seen under Ramelius ownership at the Mt Magnet mill. It has to be pointed out, the processing team did \\nexceptionally well in managing these higher grade of ores with met recovery levels being maintained above 96%.\\nBefore I move on from this slide, if I refer you to the pie chart, we only incorporated 20% of the high-grade material \\nfrom Cue and Penny into Mt Magnet to generate AUD 161.3 million in cash flow at Mt Magnet, quite amazing, with \\nplenty more to come.\\nOn to Penny, Slide 7. We mined 48,000 tonnes, average grade of 17.9, as mentioned. We milled 39,000 tonnes at \\n20.5 grams and produced a little over 18,000 ounces of gold. The mine itself generated operating cash flow of AUD \\n73.1 million at a very nice all-in sustaining cost of AUD 790 per ounce.\\nOur exploration last quarter was focused on the Penny West ore body beneath the original pit with some extremely \\nhigh-grade hits in this area, as noted on the slide. The drilling to date pretty much confirms the location and \\nthickness of this load, with the additional drilling information to be used to refine stoping blocks.\\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\\nOn to Cue, Slide 8, the graphic shows the Break of Day pit Starlight load, which is where most of Cue's production \\nfrom the -- in the quarter came from. A total of 101,000 tonnes was mined across Cue in the quarter at a grade of \\n7.4. However, we were able to selectively stockpile and allow processing to focus on the highest grade material, \\nwith 48,000 tonnes being milled at an excellent grade of 15.8.\\nThe free cash flow from Cue alone in the quarter after growth capital spend of 4.4 was AUD 56 million and an all-in \\nsustaining cost actually below that of Penny of AUD 723 per ounce. The high-quality blend of Penny and Cue has \\ngenerated these great results at Mt Magnet this quarter.\\nSlide 9 on Edna May. Gold production at Edna May totaled 18,261 ounces in the quarter at an all-in sustaining cost \\nof AUD 2,209, which, as you can appreciate, is highly cash generative. And indeed, across operations at Edna May, \\nwe reported free cash flow of AUD 32.5 million. The all-in sustaining cost was lower than the previous quarter, with \\nthe three carried low-grade stockpiles currently being processed exceeding grade expectations.\\nIn our mind, there is no reason to think that this outperformance on grade won't continue through to the end at Edna \\nMay. At the end of the quarter, there remained approximately 400,000 tonnes at a grade of 0.8 grams per tonne, \\nwhich will provide feed for the Edna May mill through the bulk of the March 2025 quarter.\\nSlide 10 on guidance. We note both production cost and also capital guidance for FY '25, where there has been no \\nchange since our initial guidance issued in August, and we are tracking well to achieve these targets for FY '25, \\nhaving produced a little over 50% of the ounces required in the first half.Page 4 of 6\\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\\nSlide 11 doesn't normally appear in our quarterly presentation deck, but I think we needed it in this time around. \\nAnd there's probably two key points to make on this slide.\\nFirstly, at Penny, we passed an important milestone in the quarter. The operation has effectively paid back our \\ninitial investment plus the capital and is effectively AUD 31 million in the black, courtesy of AUD 71 million in free \\ncash flow, generated by that operation in the quarter.\\nSecondly, if you include stockpiles at the mine, Cue generated AUD 83 million in cash flow in the quarter, which \\nrepresents an excellent start to paying back the initial investment in Cue of approximately AUD 206 million. At \\ncurrent gold prices, we expect that initial investment to be paid back in the second half of this calendar year.\\nThat covers the highlights and operations from me. I'll hand over to you, Darren.\\nDarren Millman\\nThank you, Mark, and it's a pleasure to be here today. I will be initially speaking to Slide 12. On Slide 12, we show \\nfinancial highlights for the quarter.\\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\\nFrom a financial point of view, it was an exceptional strong quarter for Ramelius with AUD 174.5 million of free \\ncash flow being generated, our best on record by quite a margin. This demonstrates the increasing margins of the \\nbusiness, not only due to the gold price, but also improved mill grades. These high cash flow generating ounces will \\nnot only continue for the remainder of FY '25, but also into FY '26.\\nDuring the quarter, we sold 80,000 ounces at an average realized price of AUD 3,683 per ounce, which included a \\nmix of spot and committed forward sales. This results in total sales revenue for the quarter of AUD 295 million. The \\nAustralian gold price continues to increase over the quarter, reporting 11% increase from the September 2024 \\nquarter. We further unwound our forward contract hedge book, which now sits under 100,000 ounces or less than 6 \\nmonths production at an average price of AUD 3,183 per ounce.\\nThe all-in sustaining cost for the quarter was AUD 1,491 per ounce, which was down on the prior quarter, mainly \\ndue to the impact of stronger grades from Cue and Penny in the quarter. The resulting all-in sustaining cost margin \\nof AUD 2,192 per ounce, which is the realized gold price of AUD 3,383 per ounce, less the all-in sustaining cost of \\nAUD 1,491; represents an all-in sustaining cost margin of 60%.\\nCost guidance for FY '25 remains unchanged at AUD 1,500 to AUD 1,700 per ounce. While this reduction in cost \\nwas expected, the overperformance of Cue grades did have an impact on reducing the all-in sustaining costs for the \\nquarter.\\nAs Mark mentioned earlier, it's early days at Cue. Our geological and operational teams at Mt Magnet are \\nperforming their reconciliations of both tonnes and grade that have been mined and milled to date at Cue \\nincorporating recent grade control drilling, with final results during the March 2025 quarter.\\nLooking at Mt Magnet in isolation, the all-in sustaining cost was AUD 1,277 per ounce. Whilst total cost did increase \\nwith the planned maintenance shutdown and increased open pit mining activities, this was more than offset by \\nimproved grades and production. At Edna May, the all-in sustaining cost was AUD 2,209 per ounce, which is a \\ndecrease from the prior quarter and better than expected with the overperformance of low-grade stockpile grades.\\nIn the past, we have made the point that Edna May all-in sustaining cost includes a noncash charge for the \\ndrawdown of existing stockpiles. For this quarter and going forward, this was not the case with the mill feed now \\nbeing made up of largely low-grade stockpiles, which carry no cost on our balance sheet.\\nOn Slide 13 and 14, we show a breakdown of free cash flow metrics for the quarter and historically. Gold sales of \\n80,000 ounces generated operational cash flow of AUD 193.6 million and AUD 161.1 million coming from Magnet Page 5 of 6\\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\\nand AUD 32.5 million from Edna May. A total of AUD 15.9 million was reinvested into mine development, resource \\ndefinition and exploration in the quarter, which focused on Eridanus, Cue and Penny West.\\nThe resultant free cash flow for the quarter was AUD 174.5 million or over AUD 2,000 per ounce produced. During \\nthe quarter, we had two material cash flows outside operations. Firstly, Ramelius participated in the Spartan capital \\nraise, increasing our position to 19.9% with the additional AUD 68 million invested.\\nAnd secondly, we paid our FY '24 final dividend of AUD 0.05 per share, which after taking into account our dividend \\nreinvestment plan resulted in a cash payment of AUD 43.4 million to our shareholders. The resultant cash and gold \\nposition was AUD 501.7 million, which coupled with AUD 175 million debt facility and value of listed investment held \\nleaves us with over AUD 1 billion in available liquidity.\\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\\nOn Slide 15, we summarized our key focus areas in FY '25. We want to continue to improve safety performance \\ngroup-wide and deliver FY '25 guidance in line with our value -- our core value of we deliver and do it safely. We \\nwant to complete the Eridanus underground open pit studies, the Mt Magnet processing facility study on mill \\nupgrades and also update our Mt Magnet mine plan, which will be delivered in the March quarter.\\nAt Roe Rebecca, we combined definite feasibility study to be delivered in the September '25 quarter and increase \\nexploration programs at Mt Magnet, Cue, Penny and Rebecca Roe.\\nOperator, with that, we'll now open the line for questions, if you could, please.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Alex Barkley from RBC.\\nAlex Barkley\\nA question on the Cue pits. I get reconciliation is high, and that's a positive. How long do those high-grade pits \\nBreak of Day and White Heat last, if you could remind me? And then has that understanding changed at all since \\nlast year's integrated Mt Magnet plan?\\nMark Zeptner\\nAlex, it's Mark. Just looking at the -- I suppose on the Cue, we possibly flagged that we might get a bit of \\noutperformance on grade or maybe words to the effect of if we're going to get outperformance anywhere, it will be \\nCue, especially in the top parts of the pits. And the reason why we do reconciliation and we do additional work \\nbefore jumping to conclusions that the whole camp is going to overperform is because you potentially have \\nsupergene enrichment in some areas.\\nBut just looking at Break of Day, we've got 130,000 ounces, and White Heat in reserve has got 40,000 ounces. So \\nwe should be enjoying these grades. There's higher grades. Obviously, we're mining the highest-grade pits first for \\nsome time. But mind you, we are in that oxide zone. How the grades perform in the fresh rock? We're not jumping \\nto conclusions on that just yet. But no, we'll be in very good grade at Cue for some time.\\nDarren Millman\\nAnd just adding to that, Alex, so we're looking to update the Mt Magnet entire plan, so in March. So that will also \\nincorporate any changes we feel appropriate in timing of the release of that ore in that plan as well.\\nAlex BarkleyPage 6 of 6\\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\\nOkay. Just one more question on your quite ample cash and liquidity you called out. Is there any consideration to \\nbuying back your hedges? Or would that pend your project studies or potentially approval? Is there just a time \\nframe or parameters around how you think around the hedges?\\nDarren Millman\\nYou thankfully answered my question. So yes, that's right. When we put out the Mt Magnet, obviously, potential \\nEridanus larger open pit, we've got the Mt Magnet mill upgrade. And obviously, we've also got the FID decision \\naround Rebecca Roe, and that's all coming in the first half of the calendar FY '25.\\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\\nSo I think once we have that full picture, then we'll be looking at all capital allocations and obviously, something that \\nwe may consider is reducing this hedge book. But at the moment, we're producing margins of over 60% with having \\nthis hedge book. So it's not a high priority, but it's definitely something we will look at, but it's coming off pretty quick \\nat the back end of this year.\\nMark Zeptner\\nYes, we're below 100,000 ounces now. But at the moment, we're not currently minded to write a big check and buy \\nit out, but we need to see the capital profile for the business, particularly over the next few years, to make good \\ndecisions on that, Alex.\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] At this time, we're showing no further questions. I'll hand the conference back to Mark for \\nany closing remarks.\\nMark Zeptner\\nThank you, Travis. One question, some sort of record. 22 minutes past the hour. Everyone must be happy with the \\ninformation we've provided. Thank you for listening in.

This week, it crashed through a historic high of \\n$US2200 ($3325) an ounce. Bullion is pure gold, different from 24-carat or 18-carat gold which has other alloys \\nadded to strengthen if for jewellery making, diminishing its value.\\nGold's almost daily ascent since mid-February has left many analysts and other market watchers looking for \\nexplanations, as there is no clear catalyst for the rally.\\nGold tends to spike in response to globe-shaking geopolitical or economic events, but nothing earth-shattering has \\nhappened in the past few months to justify the latest surge.\\nBut people are cashing in, says Michael Pepper, Bullion Now's owner. He, and other traders in the city's golden \\ntower, say record high prices are prompting customers to sell rather than buy.\\nPage 2 of 4\\n'Speculate in bitcoin, hoard gold': Precious metal's value soars\\n\\\"We're seeing a large number of sell backs coming through the doors at the moment.

Gold, by contrast, moved from $US1500 to $US2200 over the same \\ntimeframe.\\nThe gold traders' clientele range from self-managed super funds owners, they often buy the largest sums, to people \\nselling homes who want to transfer their equity into gold.\\nFarmers, who understand of commodity markets, are also frequent buyers, as are migrants from Asia, India and \\nEast Europe, the traders say.\\n\\\"Most people do keep it under the bed, so to speak, or leave it here,\\\" Kay says, noting that many dealers provide \\nsecure storage for a fee. \\\"People are maybe questioning the high price. Is it going to remain here? Will it keep \\ngoing? I'm pretty bullish. Gold always shines with inflation,\\\" he says.\\nPrices didn't have to move far before they hit record territory.\\nGold has been trading for months at around the $US2000 mark. That level was viewed by many as stratospheric \\njust a few years ago, but the metal pushed through the barrier in 2020 as the pandemic stormed across the globe.\\nUnusually, prices are trading at elevated levels despite sky-high interest rates that are typically bad for gold, which \\ndoesn't pay interest, and in defiance of a strong US dollar, which tends to keep the price of gold lower and more \\ncontrolled.\\nHowever, big geopolitical factors are underpinning the precious metal's stellar performance: Speculation over the \\nUS Federal Reserve's pivot to looser monetary policy, Israel's unravelling Gaza crisis, the disastrous Russia and \\nUkraine war, and buying by central banks, led by China, are helping spur momentum.\\nLink to Image\\nTrevor Collens\\nGold is frequently viewed as an inflationary hedge.\\n\\\"The reality is gold is a hedge against uncertainty. Over the last few years, that uncertainty is creeping in across a \\nmyriad of factors,\\\" says Cameron Alexander, general manager of commercial development at The Perth Mint, one \\nof the world's biggest gold refineries and mints.\\n\\\"A combination of banking crisis, economic concerns, and geopolitical factors are driving investors to gold,\\\" \\nCameron maintains.\\nFormer US President Donald Trump's trade war with China, and the weaponizations of the US dollar following the \\nWest's freeze of Russia's offshore assets, incentivised some wary central banks to buy heavily.Page 3 of 4\\n'Speculate in bitcoin, hoard gold': Precious metal's value soars\\nYoutube link\\n\\\"China, over the last couple of years, has been very aggressive in building their own reserve, diversifying and \\nmoving away from the US dollar,\\\" Cameron said. They are not alone. Other South East Asian bankers are doing the \\nsame, albeit on a much smaller scale.\\nThe World Gold Council's Gold Demand Trends January report shows the central bank buying streak continues at a \\n\\\"blistering\\\" rate. Demand reached 1037 tonnes last year - the second-highest on record and down just 45 tonnes on \\nthe previous year, it said.\\nMichael Scantlebury, a resource analyst at Perth-based ASX listed broker and investment bank Euroz Hartleys, \\nsays the share price of Australia's gold producing miners and ASX-listed gold-focused exchange traded funds are \\nlagging gold's soaring price.\\n\\\"It doesn't make any sense, right? We aren't too surprised, given the lack of interest over the last three years in the \\ngold equities,\\\" he says.\\n'We're very confident that this gold price increase will convert to proper margin and proper cash flow.'\\nMichael Scantlebury, from investment bank Euroz Hartleys\\nGold's last big run started after the pandemic's mayhem primed the world's latest inflationary surge, but investors \\nwho expected gold miners' profit margins to follow the gold price upwards were disappointed.\\n\\\"Cost inflation for gold producers basically squeezed that margin to the point where gold producers were breaking \\neven, essentially, despite the gold price increases,\\\" Scantlebury says.\\nGold equities in Australia underperformed as a result, and investors still remain sceptical. However, Scantlebury \\nsays discussions with mining contractors and industry suppliers shows pressures are easing, be it wage rises or \\nfuel prices.\\n\\\"The rate of cost inflation has definitely come off, so we're very confident that this gold price increase will convert to \\nproper margin and proper cash flow,\\\" he says.\\nThat's a shift Euroz Hartleys expects to show up in the March quarterly reports of miners like Northern Star \\nResources, Evolution, Ramelius, Perseus, West African and Gold Road Resources. Euroz Hartleys would expect \\ninvestors to then focus on smaller producers and explorers after a re-rate in these larger miners occurs.\\n\\\"Assuming the gold price stays equal, gold producers in Australia should definitely re-rate,\\\" Scantlebury says.\\nANZ commodity strategists Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari said gold's latest rally isn't being derailed by the \\nmarket's expectation that the Fed may push back expected cuts in interest rates, delaying a move that would signal \\nit has US inflation under control.\\n\\\"While speculators have increased their bullish bets recently, positions are not matching the intensity of the latest \\nprice rally. Moreover, disinvestment in gold-backed exchange-traded funds has been continuing,\\\" they said in a \\nresearch note last week.\\n\\\"A pull-back in gold prices is likely in the short term, as [the] recent rally has surpassed macroeconomic and \\ngeopolitical developments,\\\" they maintain.\\nAt Bullion Now, Pepper also anticipates things to calm down. \\\"We're expecting a pullback in the shorter-term,\\\" he \\nsays.

He is frequently described as a strategic deal-maker, guiding Ramelius Resources through acquisitions and financial growth. The sentiment around him is largely favorable, emphasizing his role in expanding the company's portfolio and financial performance. Donald Trump, on the other hand, is covered with a predominantly neutral to negative sentiment, with discussions centering on his trade policies, election impact, and geopolitical influence on gold prices. His return to the White House is framed as a source of market uncertainty, with concerns about inflation and trade wars. Jerome Powell receives a mixed portrayal, with a balance of positive and neutral sentiment. His comments on monetary policy and interest rate expectations are closely analyzed, with some skepticism about his ability to control inflation. However, his statements on potential rate cuts are seen as market-moving, influencing investor sentiment and financial markets.",
