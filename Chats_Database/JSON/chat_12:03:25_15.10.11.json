Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 313 words\nHighlight: Cisco will reportedly eliminate 4000 jobs in a second round of layoffs this year, as it moves its focus to \nareas such as cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.\nBody\nCisco Systems plans to eliminate thousands more jobs in a second round of layoffs this year, Reuters reported, as \nthe networking equipment maker shifts its focus to faster-growing businesses such as cybersecurity and artificial \nintelligence.\nThe news follows Cisco's move to cut about 4000 jobs in February after a slowdown in corporate tech spending \nwiped out its sales growth. The company had almost 85,000 workers at the end of fiscal 2023, which ran to July of \nthat year.\nCisco joins other tech companies in paring jobs as they cope with uneven demand. Though AI spending has \nhelped fuel growth in some areas, traditional information technology giants have not benefited as much.\nIntel announced plans this month to slash 15,000 jobs as it contends with sluggish sales. Dell Technologies is also \ncutting positions as part of a reorganisation of its sales teams.\nCisco shares fell as much as 1.3 per cent to $US45.24 in New York. They were down 9.3 per cent this year \nheading into Friday's session.\nThe latest job cuts could be announced as early as Wednesday when the company reports fourth-quarter results, \naccording to Reuters.\nThree months ago, an upbeat Cisco forecast sparked hope that IT customers had picked up spending again. But \nthe broader tech industry has been dogged by more recent concerns about the economy - and the idea that AI \nspending might not have a near-term payoff.\nA representative for Cisco declined to comment on layoff plans.\nOver the longer term, chief executive Chuck Robbins has been trying to transform Cisco into a provider of \nnetworking services and software, rather than a company focused on one-time sales of hardware.\nIt also looks to capitalise more on the AI boom that has fuelled sales for companies such as Nvidia. Last year, the \ncompany made a big move into the cybersecurity market with the $US28 billion acquisition of software firm Splunk.\nPage 2 of 2\nCisco plans thousands of jobs cuts in cyber, AI shift\nLoad-Date: October 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nBased on the content of the article, choose the most appropriate category from the following list: ['Technological Innovation and Patents', 'Artificial Intelligence and Market Adoption', 'Privacy, Security, and Trust in Technology', 'Corporate Strategy and Business Restructuring', 'Market Position and Industry Partnerships', 'Global Market Challenges and Geopolitical Factors', 'Financial Performance and Investment Considerations']\nYour output should solely be the name of the category chosen and nothing else.\n            ",
