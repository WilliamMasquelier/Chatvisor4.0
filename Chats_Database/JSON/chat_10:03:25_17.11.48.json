It operates in the Mining, exploration and drilling of gold, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Ramelius Resources based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Ramelius Resources is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Ramelius Resources.\n\nIf Ramelius Resources is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nHaywood tapped for Karora-Ramelius tie-up - DATA ROOM\nHaywood tapped for Karora-Ramelius tie-up - DATA ROOM\nThe Australian\nMarch 8, 2024 Friday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 319 words\nByline: Edited by Bridget Carter\nBody\nThe $C840m Canadian listed gold miner Karora Resources has tapped Haywood Securities for a mergers and \nacquisition deal with the $1.8bn Australian listed gold miner Ramelius Resources, say sources.\nIt is understood Karora has been on offer for about two years, with talks held with various miners around the \nAustralian market, including the $1.8bn Bellevue Gold.\nRamelius is also understood to have held talks with Karora before, but the pair could not agree on price.\nWhile listed in Canada, it is understood that Karora has aspirations to be listed in Australia, where its portfolio of \nassets is located.\nExpectations are that should a deal be agreed, it will likely be a scrip transaction, valued at somewhere between \n$700m and $1bn.\nRamelius Resources remained in a trading halt on Thursday, pending an announcement, which is expected to \neither relate to a transaction involving Karora or a statement saying talks between the pair have ended.\nAs previously reported by DataRoom, Ramelius has the shortest mine life of all of the major Australian gold \nproducers.\nIts market value has held up because it has a reasonable track record with mergers and acquisitions, where it \nacquires mines and extends their life.\nKarora has the Beta Hunt Mine, with the underground operation 600km from Perth in Kambalda, the Higginsville \nGold operations in Higginsville, Western Australia, and the Lakewood Mill, located outside Kalgoorlie and about \n60km from the Beta Hunt Mine.\nIt comes as M&A activity ramps up in Western Australia among gold and lithium miners at the smaller end.\nPage 2 of 2\nHaywood tapped for Karora-Ramelius tie-up - DATA ROOM\nGold miners are cashed up on the back of the buoyant gold price, although there is said to be a gap between gold \nproducers and developers, which remain in search of capital, with De Grey being the exception. Among the \nRamelius Resources assets are its Mt Magnet Gold and Edna May production hubs, and its plan has been to add \n100,000 ounces of gold a year.\nLoad-Date: March 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Ramelius Resources.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
