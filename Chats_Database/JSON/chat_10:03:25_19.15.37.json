It's common sense \nthat we bring them together.\n\"Any nut can complicate something. It takes a genius to simplify it.\n\"I'm no genius but I do my best.\"\nScrapped target sparks questions\nPage 2 of 3\nAndrew Forrest downplays hit from Fortescue job cuts, saying 'Twiggy is not walking back from hydrogen'\nThe cuts had raised questions about whether Fortescue was slowing its push into green hydrogen, which is \nproduced from clean energy sources, after the company also flagged it was abandoning its target to produce 15 \nmillion tonnes of green hydrogen a year.\nMr Forrest has spent the last few years selling the idea to governments around the world as a future fuel source for \nindustry as it decarbonises.\n\"We're not pulling back. This is something which I genuinely believe in,\" he said today.\n\"It's a bit like, I don't know \u2026 antibiotics or penicillin. The world has to have it.\n\"We just have to work out now how to produce it cheaply enough.\"\nBringing down energy prices was a key challenge to achieving that, Mr Forrest said, adding he was still committed \nto eliminating all fossil fuels from Fortescue's operations by the end of the decade, which would help lower costs.\n\"So what we're doing is investing upstream, investing now into the generation of green electricity, pushing down the \nprice of power for the benefit of every punter in Australia,\" he clarified later in the day.\n\"And of course at the end of it when power prices really do come off then we'll have a very commercial form of \ngreen hydrogen which is absolutely essential to get into the world.\"\nRoy Green from the University of Technology Sydney said he was not surprised by Fortescue's decision to scrap \nthe target.\n\"While hydrogen as a technology \u2026 ultimately will have commercial application, it will certainly be part of our \nenergy mix, it may have been hyped up too much in the beginning in the sense that its costs were underestimated,\" \nhe said.\nRenewable energy expert and founder of clean technology news website Renew Economy, Giles Parkinson, said \nthose factors could lead to shareholder pressure.\n\"This is one of the problems about the whole sort of green energy transition is that [shareholders] say, 'OK great, \nyou're a leader but don't go so far out in front that we can't see you anymore, because then we kind of get worried \nabout returns,'\" he said.\n\"Investors and institutional shareholders unfortunately are so obsessed with returns and profits over the short \ntimeframe.\"\nRenewables crucial\nSunshine Hydro executive chairman Michael Myer says producing green hydrogen can be viable when it's done \nwith low-cost renewable energy.\nHe's told The Business his company is producing green hydrogen from wind, solar and pumped hydro, which is \nviable without the need for tax credits the government has on offer.\n\"I noted the commentary from the chairman of Fortescue saying that they're focusing now on the production of \nrenewable and clean energy, and that's the right place to start,\" Mr Myer said.\n\"But what you need to do is you need to be able to produce 24/7 carbon free energy.\n\"If you do that first and then you use that energy to produce hydrogen you can produce it very competitively.\"\nLabor's energy plan attackedPage 3 of 3\nAndrew Forrest downplays hit from Fortescue job cuts, saying 'Twiggy is not walking back from hydrogen'\nLiberal MPs have used Fortescue's decision to attack the federal government's support for green hydrogen, with \nthe opposition's spokesperson for climate change and energy, Ted O'Brien, declaring it blew \"a massive hole in \nLabor's energy plan\".\n\"Labor isn't interested in hydrogen. They want only green hydrogen \u2026 which basically means all eggs in one \nbasket,\" he said.\n\"We cannot as a nation put all our eggs in one basket. We need to have a balanced energy mix.\n\"Today's decision also points to the need for more gas. Labor says 'green hydrogen it will do everything'. Well, we \nnow know today that the biggest investor in it is saying it's not going to do everything, and in fact he's pulling back.\n\"Labor has to stop its anti-gas crusade. We need more gas. We need it immediately.\"\nMr O'Brien said the government had been \"picking winners\", and that \"some of those winners are turning out to be \nlosers\".\nMr Forrest disagreed.\n\"He got it completely wrong,\" was his response.\n\"We streamlined our company so we can start investing billions into green electricity, into green iron.\"\nBut the government was not backing down from its support of the technology.\n\"The fact is that green hydrogen does have an important role to play in our future,\" Prime Minister Anthony \nAlbanese said.\n\"We have seen investment and we're seeing that occurring right around the world, and Australia is in a position to \ntake advantage of that.\"\nMr Albanese said much of what Mr Forrest had said about his decision related to factors overseas.\nIn a statement, Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said Australia had more than 50 companies \npursuing renewable hydrogen.\n\"Green hydrogen will be one of the best ways Australia can decarbonise domestic heavy emitters and help develop \nrobust low carbon manufacturing and energy,\" he said in a statement.\n\"The government is committed to working alongside commercial interests to deliver on this potential.\"\nWestern Australia's Deputy Premier, Rita Saffioti, was similarly optimistic.\n\"There has been a lot of demand for hydrogen. In relation to the future, I think the work will continue on providing \nthe technology and making sure it is viable in the future,\" Ms Saffioti said.\nLoad-Date: July 18, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's Executive Chairman | \"Twiggy is not walking back from hydrogen.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's Executive Chairman | \"We're not pulling back.
