Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 20\nLength: 3488 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nNews feature The next time a big miner such as BHP, Rio Tinto or Fortescue lobs a takeover bid for a small \nexplorer, the target will probably be one of the companies on this list, writes Peter Ker.\nWhen BHP launched a $3.2 billion takeover bid for copper explorer Filo Corporation in July, it was a reminder that \nmergers and acquisitions don't always involve the element of surprise.\nJust as South32 had done with Toronto-listed junior Arizona Mining in 2018, BHP had conspicuously sat on Filo's \nshare register for more than two years before it pulled the trigger, and the smart money was always expecting the \nAustralian company to launch a takeover bid for Filo's Argentinian asset.\nWhen the BHP bid finally came on July 30, Filo shares surged more than 10 per cent, suggesting there was still \nupside for speculators who bet in line with market expectations. Filo shares finished 2024 a solid 41 per cent higher \nthan they started the year.\nSo who's next? Here's a list of junior explorers that have a big miner such as Fortescue, BHP, Rio Tinto or South32 \nlurking on their register.\nSovereign Metals\nBig suitor: Rio Tinto\nCommodities: Rutile, graphite\nCountry: Malawi\nThere's an intriguing time limit buried in the commercial arrangement between Sovereign Metals and Rio Tinto \nwhich could tempt the big miner to move sooner rather than later on the rutile and graphite aspirant.\nPage 2 of 9\nWhere mining giants are ready to pounce\nRio and Sovereign signed an investment agreement in July 2023 which outlined the terms under which they would \njointly progress the Kasiya deposit that Sovereign found in Malawi. Rio has spent about $60 million so far \naccumulating a 19.9 per cent stake in Sovereign.\nOne of the clauses provides Rio with a host of exclusivity benefits for a period that expires 180 days after Sovereign \npublishes a definitive feasibility study (DFS) into the construction of a mine at Kasiya.\nThose benefits include anti-dilution rights if Sovereign launches a share issuance and matching rights if Sovereign \ntried to sell the asset. Sovereign is due to publish a DFS by October, which means Rio has the inside running on a \ntakeover offer until about March or April 2026.\nBeyond that time, the exclusivity benefits lapse and Sovereign can sell a stake in the project to help fund itself.\nAt stake is a rare piece of geology that can support production of rutile without having to go through the carbon- and \nenergy-intensive process of extracting it from ilmenite sands.\nRutile contains titanium dioxide, which goes into consumer products such as paint and toothpaste, as well as high-\nend steel production. Rio is already one of the world's biggest producers of titanium dioxide from South Africa and \nMadagascar. But Kasiya presents a way of making titanium dioxide with a much lower carbon footprint.\nKasiya will also produce graphite as a byproduct. While weak graphite prices are hurting incumbent producers such \nas Syrah Resources, the graphite made at Kasiya will effectively be a bonus - most of the production costs will be \ncovered by the rutile production.\nRio wants exposure to battery minerals such as graphite, and ownership of Kasiya will get it closer to that goal.\nAlta Copper\nBig suitor: Fortescue\nCommodities: Copper and gold\nCountry: Peru\nFortescue flexed its muscle at the Alta Copper annual meeting in June, voting four of the seven directors off the \nboard in a bid to \"accelerate\" development of the company's Canariaco copper and gold project in Peru.\nAlta's founder and former chief executive Joanne Freeze was among those removed and the new board has \nalready approved a placement of shares to Fortescue, suggesting the Perth company holds significant sway.\nBut Fortescue will need to influence the hearts and minds of local communities in Peru if it is to make a success of \nits investment.\nAlta's most recent study suggests the Canariaco mine would cost $US2.2 billion ($3.5 billion) to build. It would \nproduce an average of 134,000 tonnes of copper per year over its 27-year life.\n\"All in\" costs would be below $US2 per pound of copper, and if the copper price averages $US4 per pound, the \nmine would pay for itself in just over three years.\nDespite those robust economics and an obvious suitor such as Fortescue on the register, Alta's market \ncapitalisation remains small at just $C37 million ($41.4 million).\nThat's because many investors believe Alta will struggle to win support from local communities who fear Canariaco \nwill damage local forests, watersheds and farmlands. About 400 people blockaded the road into Canariaco 12 years \nago and the deposit has not been drilled since 2013.Page 3 of 9\nWhere mining giants are ready to pounce\nAlta told investors in October that dialogue with the community was \"frequent and continuous, which was not the \ncase during the period 2016 to 2022\".\nIf Fortescue and its talismanic leader Andrew Forrest can convince those Peruvian communities to host a copper \nmine, the Perth company might be on to a bargain.\nLifezone Metals\nBig suitor: BHP\nCommodities: Nickel, cobalt, copper\nCountry: Tanzania\nIt would be a bold call for BHP to launch a nickel acquisition barely a year after mothballing its nickel mines in \nWestern Australia, but that's the dilemma that could come within months when New York-listed Lifezone Metals is \ndue to deliver the contractual trigger that permits BHP to take majority control of Tanzania's Kabanga nickel project.\nKabanga has been on BHP's radar for more than 30 years. The Australian company drilled the high-grade nickel \nsulphide deposit between 1991 and 1995 before deciding to walk away.\nIt took until December 2021 for BHP to return to a project that is built on a new low-carbon method of processing \nnickel ores.\nBHP owns 1.5 per cent of Lifezone's New York-listed shares, but the Australian giant's exposure to Kabanga is \nmuch bigger at project level.\nThe asset is owed by a Tanzanian group of companies called Tembo, which is 16 per cent owned by the host \nnation and 84 per cent owned by a privately held British company called Kabanga Nickel (KNL).\nBHP owns 17.8 per cent of KNL, with Lifezone owning the rest.\nBHP has a deal with Lifezone that, under certain circumstances, would allow BHP to grow its shareholding in KNL \nto about 61 per cent, thereby giving the Australian giant a 51 per cent ownership of Tembo and the Kabanga mine.\nThe trigger for BHP to take that step to majority control is the delivery by Lifezone of a DFS into the mine and an \nagreed financial model for development.\nLifezone promised to deliver that study in the \"second half of 2024\" but failed to do so. Delivery is expected soon. \nLifezone continues to garner support for the project from governments in Japan and the United States, who are \nkeen to ensure some of Africa's critical minerals are developed by non-Chinese companies.\nAt a time when Indonesian miners are flooding nickel markets and BHP is preoccupied with its pursuit of Anglo \nAmerican, it would not be a surprise to see BHP walk away. Watch this space.\nAldebaran Resources\nBig suitors: South32, Rio Tinto\nCommodities: Copper, gold, silver\nCountry: Argentina\nCould Argentina's Altar copper project be the scene of the first bidding war between 10-year-old South32 and 151-\nyear-old Rio Tinto?\nRio has a special connection to the project, having discovered Altar's big copper resource between 1995 and 2004. \nBut it walked away in 2005 in the belief the copper grades weren't good enough.Page 4 of 9\nWhere mining giants are ready to pounce\nBy 2019 the Toronto-listed explorer Aldebaran Resources had stepped into the void, agreeing to gradually buy 80 \nper cent of Altar from its former owner Sibanye-Stillwater.\nAustralia's connection to the asset was revived in 2022 when South32 spent $C11 million buying 9.9 per cent of \nAldebaran's shares. South32 raised its stake to 14.8 per cent in 2023 with a further $C9 million.\nSince then, the pathway for South32 to acquire majority control of Aldebaran has looked achievable; 44 per cent of \nAldebaran shares are held by San Francisco hedge fund Route One Investment Company.\nA further 14.4 per cent are held by Sibanye, which is struggling under big debts and weak earnings at its flagship \nAfrican platinum mines.\nCash-strapped Sibanye would presumably welcome an offer for its Aldebaran shares.\nBut just when it looked like South32 was in pole position, Rio signalled in November that it still holds a candle for \nthe Altar copper mine.\nRio offered to pay Aldebaran $US250 million for a 20 per cent stake in the Altar project - as opposed to buying \nAldebaran shares.\nRio's money would be provided in increments over two years and Rio has already agreed to pay two increments \ntotalling $US30 million.\nThe Rio deal effectively values the Altar project at $US1.25 billion.\nWhere does this leave South32? Well, shares in Aldebaran have more than doubled over the past four months, so \nit's not all bad for the Perth company.\nSouth32 is also well aware that Rio is investing in neighbouring copper projects, meaning Aldebaran and Altar \nmight be just the start of a broader province play.\nMcEwen Copper\nBig suitor: Rio Tinto\nCommodity: Copper\nCountry: Argentina\nThe closest copper discovery to Aldebaran's Altar copper project is about 40 kilometres north at Los Azules.\nLos Azules is owned by private unlisted company McEwen Copper, which counts Rio Tinto as a 14.2 per cent \nshareholder and Melbourne's Victor Smorgon Group as a 3.2 per cent shareholder.\nIt is no coincidence that the Rio subsidiary that holds the stake in McEwen also struck the deal with Aldebaran in \nNovember.\nThe subsidiary, called Nuton, holds intellectual property specialising in the extraction of copper from mineralisation \nthat is relatively low grade. While Nuton will likely want to study the rocks at Los Azules and Altar before Rio does \nanything big, it's hard to resist the conclusion that Rio is building a province play in this part of the Andes.\nMagmatic Resources\nBig suitor: Fortescue\nCommodities: Copper, gold\nCountry: AustraliaPage 5 of 9\nWhere mining giants are ready to pounce\nA funny thing seems to happen to small companies once Fortescue gets on their share register: the resolutions at \nannual shareholder meetings become far more contested.\nSo it was for NSW copper explorer Magmatic Resources, which suffered a first strike against its remuneration \nreport in November. Almost 36 per cent of votes were cast against the report, up from less than 1 per cent in 2023.\nSome Magmatic directors saw opposition to their candidacy rise from less than 1 per cent last year to almost 27 per \ncent in November.\nWhat changed in the intervening 12 months to swing sentiment? We can't be sure, but one thing that did change \nwas 19.9 per cent of Magmatic shares falling into the hands of Fortescue in March 2024.\nIf more than 25 per cent of votes are cast against the remuneration report in November, Magmatic will be forced to \nhold a resolution over a boardroom spill. As discussed in the case of Alta Copper, Fortescue is not shy about \nthrowing its weight around in boardrooms of its target companies.\nAlthough in the case of Magmatic, it's not clear that Fortescue needs to play hardball. By simply spending $14 \nmillion on exploration drilling over six years, Fortescue will eventually take 75 per cent ownership of Magmatic's \nMyall exploration project near Narromine in NSW.\nMaybe Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest doesn't want to wait.\nBrixton Metals\nBig Suitor: BHP\nCommodities: Copper, gold\nCountry: Canada\nThe world's biggest miner does plenty of exploration partnerships with small companies, but it's not often BHP buys \nlisted shares in a small explorer.\nBrixton Metals was an exception in November 2022 when BHP paid $C13.6 million for 19.9 per cent of its shares.\nThe excitement around that transaction took Brixton shares as high as C30\u00a2, but the stock has slipped back to C6\u00a2 \nas the long process of drilling and appraisal has got under way.\nBHP's main interest is Brixton's huge land parcel of almost 3000 square kilometres in British Columbia. The land \nparcel is north of the \"golden triangle\" copper and gold province, which Newmont was keen to consolidate when it \nacquired Newcrest in 2023.\nBrixton's latest batch of drilling results from its flagship Thorn project didn't set the world on fire, but it is still early \ndays.\nBHP's purchase of Brixton shares in 2022 was done at C18\u00a2, well above the C6\u00a2 the stock was fetching this week. \nThat means BHP can dramatically lower its average entry price should it choose to double down on Brixton in 2025.\nAmerican Eagle Gold\nBig suitors: South32, Teck\nCommodities: Copper, gold\nCountry: Canada\nSouth32 joined BHP in British Columbia in November when it paid $32.7 million for a 19.9 per cent stake in \nAmerican Eagle Gold.Page 6 of 9\nWhere mining giants are ready to pounce\nThe deal allows South32 to leapfrog Teck Resources, which was sitting on more than 15 per cent of American \nEagle's shares.\nThe two big miners are focused on the NAK exploration project in the province, which has delivered impressive hits \nof copper, gold and molybdenum. It's early days, but with two big miners on your register, things can happen fast.\nLiontown Resources\nBig suitor: Hancock Prospecting\nCommodity: Lithium\nCountry: Australia\nIf Gina Rinehart liked the look of Liontown shares at $3 a pop barely 15 months ago, then surely she can see merit \nin paying the market price of 52\u00a2 a share now.\nHancock has bided its time while Liontown has valiantly brought Kathleen Valley into production amid very weak \nlithium prices.\nDespite the good work of the Liontown team, if prices for spodumene concentrate stay at current levels, the \ncompany could be broke within a year.\nPerhaps Mrs Rinehart thinks she can wait and buy the company cheaper off the liquidators? But that's a risky \nstrategy; lenders such as Ford have security over Liontown's Kathleen Valley mine in the event of default, and \nlithium prices have a habit of turning hard and fast when the boom times return.\nWhat Liontown needs is a patient owner who can absorb the near-term pain and take a long-term view of \ndevelopment at Kathleen Valley to ensure it is built right to vomit cash when the next lithium boom comes.\nIn Mrs Rinehart, Liontown has found the perfect owner; just as she did with Atlas Iron, she can wait for the cycle to \nturn and harvest profits.\nSo what exactly is Australia's richest person waiting for?\nWestern Copper and Gold\nBig suitor: Rio Tinto\nCommodities: Copper, gold\nCountry: Canada\nRio collected a bunch of rights as it was building its 9.7 per cent stake in Western Copper and Gold over five \ntransactions in the past four years.\nSome of those rights ensure Rio can't be diluted in share issuances, while others give Rio the right to have \nobservers sit in on the company's board meetings and technical committee meetings.\nBut those rights will expire in May 2025, meaning the dual-listed miner has some degree of incentive to move fast if \nit wants to own the Casino copper and gold project that Western has found near the border of Alaska and the \nCanadian Yukon territory.\nCasino would cost more than $4 billion to build; a near-impossible task for an explorer with a market capitalisation \nof $337 million.\nRio is not the only cashed-up global player sitting on Western's register; Japanese firm Mitsubishi owns 4.1 per cent \nof the explorer and has similar rights, which will expire in March.Page 7 of 9\nWhere mining giants are ready to pounce\nRio has spent about $44 million buying shares in the explorer and no one will be surprised if it buys more in 2025.\nTrilogy Metals\nBig suitor: South32\nCommodities: Zinc, copper\nCountry: USA\nOne interpretation of the 230 per cent rise in Trilogy Metals shares since Donald Trump won November's US \npresidential election is that South32 missed a chance to acquire the explorer while it was cheap.\nSouth32 owned 11.6 per cent of Trilogy shares and 50 per cent of its flagship Ambler exploration project in Alaska \nduring Joe Biden's presidency, meaning the Perth company was close to the action as Biden's blocking of a road to \nthe Ambler site triggered a collapse in Trilogy's share price.\nA more philosophical way of looking at Trilogy's Trump bump is to say that South32 is historically willing to pay \nmore for something that it has greater certainty about.\nThat was true for Arizona Mining, the copper explorer South32 acquired over two years between 2017 and 2018, \nwith little concern about whether it was telegraphing its intentions to the market too clearly.\nIn the case of Trilogy, South32 wants to see more progress made in Alaska before it considers stepping up its \ninvestment. It will want to see all the region's First Nations groups express their support for the project.\nIt will want to see political change in the White House manifest in more permitting access to the Ambler region.\nSouth32 will also want to see further drilling to better understand the geology.\nThe Trump bump has taken Trilogy's market value to about $300 million - almost three times higher than a year ago \n- but still small enough that South32 can afford to wait for all the Alaskan ducks to be in a row.\nEntree Resources\nBig suitor: Rio Tinto\nCommodities: Copper, gold\nCountry: Mongolia\nSome type of deal will happen between Entree and Rio, the only question is whether Rio buys Entree's stake in \ntenements adjacent to its Oyu Tolgoi copper mine, or whether it buys Entree outright.\nRio has owned 16.1 per cent of Entree shares for more than a decade, but it needs to act soon because the \ntenements that are minority-owned by Entree are scheduled to be mined by Oyu Tolgoi within the next 12 to 18 \nmonths.\nUnder that schedule, preparatory work should be happening on the Entree tenements right now, but it is being \nfrustrated by the need to strike a commercial deal first.\nEntree had a win over Rio on December 19 when an independent arbitration tribunal adopted Entree's \ninterpretation of how certain transactions between the two companies should be struck.",
