Notoriously private, Creasy wouldn't respond when we asked.\nAnd it isn't the only late-life change for the legendary digger. As we reported two years ago, he and partner Annie \nGuo welcomed a baby, which, arriving now at the age of tantrums and bitter defiance, should make running a \nremote mine in the kiln of WA's northwest seem like a refreshing vacation.\nOverpriced Libs Prices are clearly booming on the rubber-chicken circuit.\nWe're at a loss to explain why, but the expense of attending a Liberal Party fundraiser is getting way out of hand.\nPage 2 of 2\nProspector Creasy gets his mine\nA private dinner scheduled with John Howard for October 15 was originally priced at $10,000 a pop - that was \nhalved two weeks later, presumably because the expense was exorbitant. The same event (on Lygon Street, \nMelbourne) is now being offered for 20 people, instead of 10, at a cost of $5000. Cheaper, but hardly a steal.\nDinner with Peter Dutton isn't much more affordable. He's down for an event in Canberra next month where tickets \nare selling for $10,000, or roughly double what Anthony Albanese and members of his cabinet charge. Dutton has a \nsecond event in the offing, also $10,000, to be held in Melbourne around the same time.\nAre we to take this jacked-up pricing as a signal of Liberal confidence in their own polling numbers?\nFor an example of just how inflated this fundraising bubble has become, take a look at Liberal hopeful Tim Wilson.\nHe's not even a member of parliament (anymore) yet he's charging $10,000 \"per plate\" for a lunch with New \nZealand's Regulation Minister David Seymour, someone who, according to Wilson, \"is coming to Melbourne to do \none lunch in support of my campaign to take back Goldstein\".\nUnexpected, too, that a conservative-minded Seymour, leader of the right-wing ACT Party, would be embraced so \nwholly by a moderate like Wilson, whose invitation says: \"It will truly be a wonderful lunch with robust and enlivening \ndiscussion.\" No doubt. But for ten large?\nThe market for bloviating is definitely due for a correction.

He held the role of chief technology officer at Fortescue Future \nIndustries from late 2019 until his resignation in October 2021, at which time \"concerns\" were raised over his \nqualifications and experience \"as represented on his resume\".\nThat much has been reported. The short version of the story is that Fortescue alleged Kolodziejczyk - coldly \nreferred to by the investigation as \"the Subject\" - misrepresented his CV and the former chief scientist, in his own \naffidavit, denied ever doing so.\nLesser known until now is that Fortescue was sufficiently miffed about these \"numerous gaps\" that it hit up \nrecruitment firm Gerard Daniels - two years after it recommended Kolodziejczyk for the job - asking for its money \nback.\nGerard Daniels, it said, had \"admitted in writing that they had failed to manage the reference check process \nproperly\", resulting in a Fortescue claim for $67,000. \"The employee due diligence had effectively been outsourced \nby FMG (Fortescue Metals) to Gerard Daniels,\" the report said.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL For $5000, a cut-price dinner with John Howard\nLoad-Date: September 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Yoni Bashan, Nick Evans\nDate: September 27, 2024\nTitle: Prospector Creasy gets his mine\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Miner's ex-staff defend disputed tech after court loss\n## Media outlet: AAP Newsfeed\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: October 04, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nFED:Miner's ex-staff defend disputed tech after court loss\nFED:Miner's ex-staff defend disputed tech after court loss\nAAP Newsfeed\nOctober 4, 2024 Friday 3:10 PM AEST\nCopyright 2024 Australian Associated Press Pty.

The Federal Court on Friday \ndismissed attempts by Element Zero to have the search-and-seizure tactics ruled invalid.\nFortescue's use of private investigators was described by Element Zero as a \"massive overreach\" because the \nsurveillance reports included photographs of children and private homes, and details obtained by rifling through mail \nand following family members.\nIn July, Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest distanced himself from the use of private investigators and reports of \nspying on the children of the Element Zero founders, saying that the surveillance and search raids did not align with \nthe \"values\" of the mining giant.\nBut Friday's ruling means evidence seized during the searches that followed the surveillance campaign may be \nadmissible in court when the matter goes to trial. Fortescue can also order Element Zero to pay costs.\nFederal court judge Brigitte Markovic's reasons for judgment will not be published until next week.\nElement Zero is developing a low-carbon method for turning iron ore into higher-value green iron.\nAll three of the Element Zero founders previously worked in Fortescue's clean energy division, with Dr \nKolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen involved in the scientific work to develop green-iron manufacturing methods.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue can use controversial surveillance to sue former execs Mining technology\nDr Kolodziejczyk has insisted Element Zero's manufacturing methods were developed after he left Fortescue, but \nthe miner believes important information was taken from its laboratories. \"Fortescue remains committed to \nprotecting its intellectual property and investment in green technologies, and looks forward to progressing the \nmatter to a final trial,\" a Fortescue spokesman said on Friday.\nA spokesman for Element Zero said the company still believed Fortescue had over-reacted by ordering the \nsurveillance. \"Element Zero will review the judgment before determining whether to appeal today's decision,\" he \nsaid.\nSeparately, Fortescue has told shareholders Dr Forrest will cast his substantial vote in favour of his re-election - \nand that of other incumbent directors - if investors vote to spill the miner's board next month.
