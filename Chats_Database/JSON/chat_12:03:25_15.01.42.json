Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Cisco based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Cisco is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Cisco.\n\nIf Cisco is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nNvidia plummets in what could be a market 'pullback'\nNvidia plummets in what could be a market 'pullback'\nAFR Online\nMarch 9, 2024 Saturday 4:53 AM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 546 words\nHighlight: How the $US200 billion intraday tumble in market value is met could prove key as to how fast a pullback \nin US equities is approaching.\nBody\nAfter having leapt higher in early trading in New York on Friday (Saturday AEDT), Nvidia's stock just as swiftly \nreversed direction to end the day 10.1 per cent from its session peak, yet still higher than its close on Tuesday.\nAt 4.02pm, Nvidia was 5.6 per cent lower to $US875.28; it earlier reset its record high at $US974. It closed on \nTuesday at $US855.11.\nFriday's intraday swing represented a more than $US200 billion shift in market cap in a matter of hours for a \ncompany valued at $US2.19 trillion as of Friday's closing bell.\nTwitter link\n\"For us, looking at the charts on the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, the SMH semiconductor ETF, and individual stocks \nlike Nvidia, we can see a very overbought condition in general,\" Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak \n+ Co, said ahead of the opening bell.\n\"Therefore, we believe that the stock market is becoming quite ripe for some sort of meaningful pullback back that \nbegins at some point in March.\"\nThe reversal in Nvidia's stock on Friday at least temporarily slows its move towards overtaking Apple as the second \nmost valuable publicly listed company. Apple rallied 1 per cent on Friday, lifting its market cap to $US2.64 trillion.\nSo far this calendar year, Apple has shed a little more than 10 per cent of its value. In contrast, Nvidia has surged \nmore than 75 per cent. Apple has been hurt by concerns about falling iPhone sales in China and the perception that \nit's lagging in the artificial intelligences race.\nNvidia's parabolic stock surge is continually being checked by bulls' reading of the company's quarterly results.\nJoel Lim, a financial analyst at Trading.Biz, said: \"while some investors have doubted Nvidia's ability to stay on top \nof AI and tech, there is no denying its current momentum.\"\nYet BCA Research argues that the S&P 500 is overvalued and the optimism about profit margins is overly optimistic \ntoo. It pointed to Cisco as a warning for Nvidia investors.\nPage 2 of 2\nNvidia plummets in what could be a market 'pullback'\n\"Cisco was the world's most valuable listed company in 2000, trading at over 30-times sales (a similar multiple to \nNvidia today). Yet, despite growing earnings-per-share nearly tenfold since then, Cisco's stock price is still 39 per \ncent below its 2000 peak.\n\"Will Nvidia share Cisco's fate? Our guess is yes.\"\nStill, Nvidia for now has captured the attention of smaller investors, who are turning to it and away from Tesla, \naccording to Vanda Research's latest report on February 28.\n\"Nvidia looks every day more like the new bellwether of general retail sentiment. The \"'scary' part is that despite the \nrecent hype around anything AI and semiconductors, current retail flows into Nvidia shares have merely matched \nthe lowest point seen in Tesla stocks during 2023.\"\nThere are reports that the stunning rally in Nvidia could prompt the company to split its stock as it did in 2021.\nTwitter link\nIn a note, Bespoke Investment said coming into today, Nvidia was up 17 per cent over the last week and more than \n40 per cent above its 50-day moving average.\nAfter gapping up another 5 per cent, Nvidia \"is finally experiencing gravity with an intraday drop\", Bespoke said. \"As \nwe've been mentioning recently, the type of upside moves we've seen in some areas of the market can't go on \nforever, and traders are finally seeing what 'red' looks like again.\"\nLoad-Date: March 11, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Cisco.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
