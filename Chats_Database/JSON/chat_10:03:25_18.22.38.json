Please go ahead.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Travis. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to dial in this morning. In addition to the \nquarterly report, we've also released a presentation that we'll largely speak to during the call. Both documents have \nbeen uploaded on the ASX platform and will be available on the website shortly.\nPage 2 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nOnce again, I'm joined by our CFO, Darren Millman. Darren will provide some detail on the financials after I've run \nthrough the highlights and touched on the operational performance and our development projects. As always, there \nwill be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions at the end.\nFor those who have downloaded the presentation deck, I'll be initially speaking to Slide 3. I'll focus on the highlights \nand key achievements for the quarter. I would like to point out that there is a large amount of detail on exploration, \noperations and project development within the quarterly report itself.\nSo on Slide 3, operationally and financially, the December quarter was exceptionally strong, with the business \ngenerating a record and also sector-leading AUD 174.5 million in underlying free cash flow. After considering our \nadditional investment in Spartan during the quarter of AUD 68 million and the payment of our FY '24 AUD 0.05 per \nshare dividend, our closing cash and gold position was just over AUD 500 million.\nOur quarterly gold production was 85,311 ounces, which was a 37% increase on the prior quarter, noting also just \nshy of our record production, which occurred in the March 2024 quarter. The increase in production was mainly due \nto the introduction of ore from Cue, which performed extremely well during the quarter and also improved grades \nfrom Penny. I'll talk to these points in more detail shortly.\nLooking at the costs, we saw a 25% decrease in our all-in sustaining costs down to AUD 1,491 for the quarter. Now \nwhilst we were guiding for a reduction in all-in sustaining costs across the year, the all-in sustaining cost for the \nquarter was below our expectations and obviously benefited from the outperformance of Cue. Importantly, our \nguidance for FY '25 remains unchanged at 270,000 to 300,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of AUD 1,500 to \nAUD 1,700 an ounce.\nWhilst we are encouraged by the indicative overperformance of Cue grades, it is still relatively early days, and we \nwill continue to assess this during the March quarter as more data becomes available as mining and milling \nprogresses.\nUnfortunately, during the quarter, we did record our first LTI since May 2023. Whilst this is extremely disappointing, \nthe incident itself, which is detailed in the quarterly report, was not of a serious nature. We do strive to ensure that \nall employees and contractors remain healthy -- safe and healthy under our watch. The total recordable injury \nfrequency rate, or TRIFR, at the end of December was 8.33, which was only marginally higher than that recorded \nlast quarter.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nThere were several milestones and advancements in our key projects across the quarter with haulage to [Cue] \ncommencing mid-November following the completion of the Great Northern Highway intersection upgrade and also \ndelivery of the Rebecca Roe PFS, which is demonstrating strong economic returns.\nFor the immediate future, our focus is on delivery of the Eridanus and Mt Magnet mill upgrade studies and \nassociated mine plan in this quarter and the Rebecca Roe DFS, which is targeting a final investment decision in the \nSeptember quarter. Exploration and resource definition activities during the quarter were largely focused on \nEridanus, Penny West and the Lena pit at Cue.\nOn Slide 4, I will draw your attention on -- sorry, we're looking here at the quarterly production breakdown for the \nlast 12 months. If you look at the yellow Mt Magnet bars, you can see the previous September quarter, we focused \nlargely on the development of Cue. And now we see that asset in production, along with improved grades at Penny, \nhas been the main driver of increased production in the December quarter. As expected, Edna May production is \nslowly winding down.\nOn to Slide 5, which references quarterly production stats. The standout here is the mine grade for the quarter of \n7.3 grams per tonne, which is more than double that of the September quarter and has been driven once again by \ngrades at Cue and Penny, which were 7.4 and 17.9 grams per tonne, respectively.Page 3 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nNow whilst the ore tonnes mined reduced, it needs to be highlighted that there still is a fair amount of pre-strip and \ndevelopment taking place at Cue. We expect comparable mined ore tonnes to continue into the March quarter as \nwe progress development before we start to see an increase in these ore tonnes in the June 2025 quarter. Mill \nthroughput levels were maintained during the quarter with the drawdown of existing stockpiles across Edna May \nand also the Eridanus stockpile at Mt Magnet.\nOn to Slide 6, we're showing Mt Magnet's highlights. Production from Mt Magnet totaled just over 67,000 ounces at \nan all-in sustaining cost of AUD 1,277. Open pit mining at Mt Magnet is now solely focused at Cue, with the Break \nof Day, Waratah and White Heat pits all being mined during the quarter. Productivities increased during the quarter \nwith the introduction of a third excavator, which resulted in a 44% increase in material movement quarter-on-\nquarter. Underground operations continue to focus on Galaxy and Penny. At Galaxy, mining was largely in line with \nthe prior quarter, whilst at Penny, both tonnages and grade increased, most notably the mine grade, which is \nattributable to stoping on the 1252 level, which is central to the high-grade plunge of the Penny North load.\nI would also like to highlight, the overall mill grade at Mt Magnet in the quarter was 5.1 grams. This is the highest \ngrade seen under Ramelius ownership at the Mt Magnet mill. It has to be pointed out, the processing team did \nexceptionally well in managing these higher grade of ores with met recovery levels being maintained above 96%.\nBefore I move on from this slide, if I refer you to the pie chart, we only incorporated 20% of the high-grade material \nfrom Cue and Penny into Mt Magnet to generate AUD 161.3 million in cash flow at Mt Magnet, quite amazing, with \nplenty more to come.\nOn to Penny, Slide 7. We mined 48,000 tonnes, average grade of 17.9, as mentioned. We milled 39,000 tonnes at \n20.5 grams and produced a little over 18,000 ounces of gold. The mine itself generated operating cash flow of AUD \n73.1 million at a very nice all-in sustaining cost of AUD 790 per ounce.\nOur exploration last quarter was focused on the Penny West ore body beneath the original pit with some extremely \nhigh-grade hits in this area, as noted on the slide. The drilling to date pretty much confirms the location and \nthickness of this load, with the additional drilling information to be used to refine stoping blocks.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nOn to Cue, Slide 8, the graphic shows the Break of Day pit Starlight load, which is where most of Cue's production \nfrom the -- in the quarter came from. A total of 101,000 tonnes was mined across Cue in the quarter at a grade of \n7.4. However, we were able to selectively stockpile and allow processing to focus on the highest grade material, \nwith 48,000 tonnes being milled at an excellent grade of 15.8.\nThe free cash flow from Cue alone in the quarter after growth capital spend of 4.4 was AUD 56 million and an all-in \nsustaining cost actually below that of Penny of AUD 723 per ounce. The high-quality blend of Penny and Cue has \ngenerated these great results at Mt Magnet this quarter.\nSlide 9 on Edna May. Gold production at Edna May totaled 18,261 ounces in the quarter at an all-in sustaining cost \nof AUD 2,209, which, as you can appreciate, is highly cash generative. And indeed, across operations at Edna May, \nwe reported free cash flow of AUD 32.5 million. The all-in sustaining cost was lower than the previous quarter, with \nthe three carried low-grade stockpiles currently being processed exceeding grade expectations.\nIn our mind, there is no reason to think that this outperformance on grade won't continue through to the end at Edna \nMay. At the end of the quarter, there remained approximately 400,000 tonnes at a grade of 0.8 grams per tonne, \nwhich will provide feed for the Edna May mill through the bulk of the March 2025 quarter.\nSlide 10 on guidance. We note both production cost and also capital guidance for FY '25, where there has been no \nchange since our initial guidance issued in August, and we are tracking well to achieve these targets for FY '25, \nhaving produced a little over 50% of the ounces required in the first half.Page 4 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nSlide 11 doesn't normally appear in our quarterly presentation deck, but I think we needed it in this time around. \nAnd there's probably two key points to make on this slide.\nFirstly, at Penny, we passed an important milestone in the quarter. The operation has effectively paid back our \ninitial investment plus the capital and is effectively AUD 31 million in the black, courtesy of AUD 71 million in free \ncash flow, generated by that operation in the quarter.\nSecondly, if you include stockpiles at the mine, Cue generated AUD 83 million in cash flow in the quarter, which \nrepresents an excellent start to paying back the initial investment in Cue of approximately AUD 206 million. At \ncurrent gold prices, we expect that initial investment to be paid back in the second half of this calendar year.\nThat covers the highlights and operations from me. I'll hand over to you, Darren.\nDarren Millman\nThank you, Mark, and it's a pleasure to be here today. I will be initially speaking to Slide 12. On Slide 12, we show \nfinancial highlights for the quarter.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nFrom a financial point of view, it was an exceptional strong quarter for Ramelius with AUD 174.5 million of free \ncash flow being generated, our best on record by quite a margin. This demonstrates the increasing margins of the \nbusiness, not only due to the gold price, but also improved mill grades. These high cash flow generating ounces will \nnot only continue for the remainder of FY '25, but also into FY '26.\nDuring the quarter, we sold 80,000 ounces at an average realized price of AUD 3,683 per ounce, which included a \nmix of spot and committed forward sales. This results in total sales revenue for the quarter of AUD 295 million. The \nAustralian gold price continues to increase over the quarter, reporting 11% increase from the September 2024 \nquarter. We further unwound our forward contract hedge book, which now sits under 100,000 ounces or less than 6 \nmonths production at an average price of AUD 3,183 per ounce.\nThe all-in sustaining cost for the quarter was AUD 1,491 per ounce, which was down on the prior quarter, mainly \ndue to the impact of stronger grades from Cue and Penny in the quarter. The resulting all-in sustaining cost margin \nof AUD 2,192 per ounce, which is the realized gold price of AUD 3,383 per ounce, less the all-in sustaining cost of \nAUD 1,491; represents an all-in sustaining cost margin of 60%.\nCost guidance for FY '25 remains unchanged at AUD 1,500 to AUD 1,700 per ounce. While this reduction in cost \nwas expected, the overperformance of Cue grades did have an impact on reducing the all-in sustaining costs for the \nquarter.\nAs Mark mentioned earlier, it's early days at Cue. Our geological and operational teams at Mt Magnet are \nperforming their reconciliations of both tonnes and grade that have been mined and milled to date at Cue \nincorporating recent grade control drilling, with final results during the March 2025 quarter.\nLooking at Mt Magnet in isolation, the all-in sustaining cost was AUD 1,277 per ounce. Whilst total cost did increase \nwith the planned maintenance shutdown and increased open pit mining activities, this was more than offset by \nimproved grades and production. At Edna May, the all-in sustaining cost was AUD 2,209 per ounce, which is a \ndecrease from the prior quarter and better than expected with the overperformance of low-grade stockpile grades.\nIn the past, we have made the point that Edna May all-in sustaining cost includes a noncash charge for the \ndrawdown of existing stockpiles. For this quarter and going forward, this was not the case with the mill feed now \nbeing made up of largely low-grade stockpiles, which carry no cost on our balance sheet.\nOn Slide 13 and 14, we show a breakdown of free cash flow metrics for the quarter and historically. Gold sales of \n80,000 ounces generated operational cash flow of AUD 193.6 million and AUD 161.1 million coming from Magnet Page 5 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nand AUD 32.5 million from Edna May. A total of AUD 15.9 million was reinvested into mine development, resource \ndefinition and exploration in the quarter, which focused on Eridanus, Cue and Penny West.\nThe resultant free cash flow for the quarter was AUD 174.5 million or over AUD 2,000 per ounce produced. During \nthe quarter, we had two material cash flows outside operations. Firstly, Ramelius participated in the Spartan capital \nraise, increasing our position to 19.9% with the additional AUD 68 million invested.\nAnd secondly, we paid our FY '24 final dividend of AUD 0.05 per share, which after taking into account our dividend \nreinvestment plan resulted in a cash payment of AUD 43.4 million to our shareholders. The resultant cash and gold \nposition was AUD 501.7 million, which coupled with AUD 175 million debt facility and value of listed investment held \nleaves us with over AUD 1 billion in available liquidity.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nOn Slide 15, we summarized our key focus areas in FY '25. We want to continue to improve safety performance \ngroup-wide and deliver FY '25 guidance in line with our value -- our core value of we deliver and do it safely. We \nwant to complete the Eridanus underground open pit studies, the Mt Magnet processing facility study on mill \nupgrades and also update our Mt Magnet mine plan, which will be delivered in the March quarter.\nAt Roe Rebecca, we combined definite feasibility study to be delivered in the September '25 quarter and increase \nexploration programs at Mt Magnet, Cue, Penny and Rebecca Roe.\nOperator, with that, we'll now open the line for questions, if you could, please.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Alex Barkley from RBC.\nAlex Barkley\nA question on the Cue pits. I get reconciliation is high, and that's a positive. How long do those high-grade pits \nBreak of Day and White Heat last, if you could remind me? And then has that understanding changed at all since \nlast year's integrated Mt Magnet plan?\nMark Zeptner\nAlex, it's Mark. Just looking at the -- I suppose on the Cue, we possibly flagged that we might get a bit of \noutperformance on grade or maybe words to the effect of if we're going to get outperformance anywhere, it will be \nCue, especially in the top parts of the pits. And the reason why we do reconciliation and we do additional work \nbefore jumping to conclusions that the whole camp is going to overperform is because you potentially have \nsupergene enrichment in some areas.\nBut just looking at Break of Day, we've got 130,000 ounces, and White Heat in reserve has got 40,000 ounces. So \nwe should be enjoying these grades. There's higher grades. Obviously, we're mining the highest-grade pits first for \nsome time. But mind you, we are in that oxide zone. How the grades perform in the fresh rock? We're not jumping \nto conclusions on that just yet. But no, we'll be in very good grade at Cue for some time.\nDarren Millman\nAnd just adding to that, Alex, so we're looking to update the Mt Magnet entire plan, so in March. So that will also \nincorporate any changes we feel appropriate in timing of the release of that ore in that plan as well.\nAlex BarkleyPage 6 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nOkay. Just one more question on your quite ample cash and liquidity you called out. Is there any consideration to \nbuying back your hedges? Or would that pend your project studies or potentially approval? Is there just a time \nframe or parameters around how you think around the hedges?\nDarren Millman\nYou thankfully answered my question. So yes, that's right. When we put out the Mt Magnet, obviously, potential \nEridanus larger open pit, we've got the Mt Magnet mill upgrade. And obviously, we've also got the FID decision \naround Rebecca Roe, and that's all coming in the first half of the calendar FY '25.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nSo I think once we have that full picture, then we'll be looking at all capital allocations and obviously, something that \nwe may consider is reducing this hedge book. But at the moment, we're producing margins of over 60% with having \nthis hedge book. So it's not a high priority, but it's definitely something we will look at, but it's coming off pretty quick \nat the back end of this year.\nMark Zeptner\nYes, we're below 100,000 ounces now. But at the moment, we're not currently minded to write a big check and buy \nit out, but we need to see the capital profile for the business, particularly over the next few years, to make good \ndecisions on that, Alex.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] At this time, we're showing no further questions. I'll hand the conference back to Mark for \nany closing remarks.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Travis. One question, some sort of record. 22 minutes past the hour. Everyone must be happy with the \ninformation we've provided. Thank you for listening in.

We note both production cost and also capital guidance for FY '25, where there has been no \nchange since our initial guidance issued in August, and we are tracking well to achieve these targets for FY '25, \nhaving produced a little over 50% of the ounces required in the first half.Page 4 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nSlide 11 doesn't normally appear in our quarterly presentation deck, but I think we needed it in this time around. \nAnd there's probably two key points to make on this slide.\nFirstly, at Penny, we passed an important milestone in the quarter. The operation has effectively paid back our \ninitial investment plus the capital and is effectively AUD 31 million in the black, courtesy of AUD 71 million in free \ncash flow, generated by that operation in the quarter.\nSecondly, if you include stockpiles at the mine, Cue generated AUD 83 million in cash flow in the quarter, which \nrepresents an excellent start to paying back the initial investment in Cue of approximately AUD 206 million. At \ncurrent gold prices, we expect that initial investment to be paid back in the second half of this calendar year.\nThat covers the highlights and operations from me. I'll hand over to you, Darren.\nDarren Millman\nThank you, Mark, and it's a pleasure to be here today. I will be initially speaking to Slide 12. On Slide 12, we show \nfinancial highlights for the quarter.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nFrom a financial point of view, it was an exceptional strong quarter for Ramelius with AUD 174.5 million of free \ncash flow being generated, our best on record by quite a margin. This demonstrates the increasing margins of the \nbusiness, not only due to the gold price, but also improved mill grades. These high cash flow generating ounces will \nnot only continue for the remainder of FY '25, but also into FY '26.\nDuring the quarter, we sold 80,000 ounces at an average realized price of AUD 3,683 per ounce, which included a \nmix of spot and committed forward sales. This results in total sales revenue for the quarter of AUD 295 million. The \nAustralian gold price continues to increase over the quarter, reporting 11% increase from the September 2024 \nquarter. We further unwound our forward contract hedge book, which now sits under 100,000 ounces or less than 6 \nmonths production at an average price of AUD 3,183 per ounce.\nThe all-in sustaining cost for the quarter was AUD 1,491 per ounce, which was down on the prior quarter, mainly \ndue to the impact of stronger grades from Cue and Penny in the quarter. The resulting all-in sustaining cost margin \nof AUD 2,192 per ounce, which is the realized gold price of AUD 3,383 per ounce, less the all-in sustaining cost of \nAUD 1,491; represents an all-in sustaining cost margin of 60%.\nCost guidance for FY '25 remains unchanged at AUD 1,500 to AUD 1,700 per ounce. While this reduction in cost \nwas expected, the overperformance of Cue grades did have an impact on reducing the all-in sustaining costs for the \nquarter.\nAs Mark mentioned earlier, it's early days at Cue. Our geological and operational teams at Mt Magnet are \nperforming their reconciliations of both tonnes and grade that have been mined and milled to date at Cue \nincorporating recent grade control drilling, with final results during the March 2025 quarter.\nLooking at Mt Magnet in isolation, the all-in sustaining cost was AUD 1,277 per ounce. Whilst total cost did increase \nwith the planned maintenance shutdown and increased open pit mining activities, this was more than offset by \nimproved grades and production. At Edna May, the all-in sustaining cost was AUD 2,209 per ounce, which is a \ndecrease from the prior quarter and better than expected with the overperformance of low-grade stockpile grades.\nIn the past, we have made the point that Edna May all-in sustaining cost includes a noncash charge for the \ndrawdown of existing stockpiles. For this quarter and going forward, this was not the case with the mill feed now \nbeing made up of largely low-grade stockpiles, which carry no cost on our balance sheet.\nOn Slide 13 and 14, we show a breakdown of free cash flow metrics for the quarter and historically. Gold sales of \n80,000 ounces generated operational cash flow of AUD 193.6 million and AUD 161.1 million coming from Magnet Page 5 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nand AUD 32.5 million from Edna May. A total of AUD 15.9 million was reinvested into mine development, resource \ndefinition and exploration in the quarter, which focused on Eridanus, Cue and Penny West.\nThe resultant free cash flow for the quarter was AUD 174.5 million or over AUD 2,000 per ounce produced. During \nthe quarter, we had two material cash flows outside operations. Firstly, Ramelius participated in the Spartan capital \nraise, increasing our position to 19.9% with the additional AUD 68 million invested.\nAnd secondly, we paid our FY '24 final dividend of AUD 0.05 per share, which after taking into account our dividend \nreinvestment plan resulted in a cash payment of AUD 43.4 million to our shareholders. The resultant cash and gold \nposition was AUD 501.7 million, which coupled with AUD 175 million debt facility and value of listed investment held \nleaves us with over AUD 1 billion in available liquidity.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nOn Slide 15, we summarized our key focus areas in FY '25. We want to continue to improve safety performance \ngroup-wide and deliver FY '25 guidance in line with our value -- our core value of we deliver and do it safely. We \nwant to complete the Eridanus underground open pit studies, the Mt Magnet processing facility study on mill \nupgrades and also update our Mt Magnet mine plan, which will be delivered in the March quarter.\nAt Roe Rebecca, we combined definite feasibility study to be delivered in the September '25 quarter and increase \nexploration programs at Mt Magnet, Cue, Penny and Rebecca Roe.\nOperator, with that, we'll now open the line for questions, if you could, please.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Alex Barkley from RBC.\nAlex Barkley\nA question on the Cue pits. I get reconciliation is high, and that's a positive. How long do those high-grade pits \nBreak of Day and White Heat last, if you could remind me? And then has that understanding changed at all since \nlast year's integrated Mt Magnet plan?\nMark Zeptner\nAlex, it's Mark. Just looking at the -- I suppose on the Cue, we possibly flagged that we might get a bit of \noutperformance on grade or maybe words to the effect of if we're going to get outperformance anywhere, it will be \nCue, especially in the top parts of the pits. And the reason why we do reconciliation and we do additional work \nbefore jumping to conclusions that the whole camp is going to overperform is because you potentially have \nsupergene enrichment in some areas.\nBut just looking at Break of Day, we've got 130,000 ounces, and White Heat in reserve has got 40,000 ounces. So \nwe should be enjoying these grades. There's higher grades. Obviously, we're mining the highest-grade pits first for \nsome time. But mind you, we are in that oxide zone. How the grades perform in the fresh rock? We're not jumping \nto conclusions on that just yet. But no, we'll be in very good grade at Cue for some time.\nDarren Millman\nAnd just adding to that, Alex, so we're looking to update the Mt Magnet entire plan, so in March. So that will also \nincorporate any changes we feel appropriate in timing of the release of that ore in that plan as well.\nAlex BarkleyPage 6 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nOkay. Just one more question on your quite ample cash and liquidity you called out. Is there any consideration to \nbuying back your hedges? Or would that pend your project studies or potentially approval? Is there just a time \nframe or parameters around how you think around the hedges?\nDarren Millman\nYou thankfully answered my question. So yes, that's right. When we put out the Mt Magnet, obviously, potential \nEridanus larger open pit, we've got the Mt Magnet mill upgrade. And obviously, we've also got the FID decision \naround Rebecca Roe, and that's all coming in the first half of the calendar FY '25.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nSo I think once we have that full picture, then we'll be looking at all capital allocations and obviously, something that \nwe may consider is reducing this hedge book. But at the moment, we're producing margins of over 60% with having \nthis hedge book. So it's not a high priority, but it's definitely something we will look at, but it's coming off pretty quick \nat the back end of this year.\nMark Zeptner\nYes, we're below 100,000 ounces now. But at the moment, we're not currently minded to write a big check and buy \nit out, but we need to see the capital profile for the business, particularly over the next few years, to make good \ndecisions on that, Alex.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] At this time, we're showing no further questions. I'll hand the conference back to Mark for \nany closing remarks.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Travis. One question, some sort of record. 22 minutes past the hour. Everyone must be happy with the \ninformation we've provided. Thank you for listening in. Have a great day, guys.\nLoad-Date: January 29, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nOrganization Context: The Australian Securities Exchange where Ramelius Resources uploaded their quarterly report and presentation.\n\nOutput ONLY a number from -5 to 5 and nothing else.\n",
