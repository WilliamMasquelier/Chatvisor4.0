Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 21\nLength: 1208 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nBarely three years ago, hydrogen seemed to be the panacea for all the world's problems.\nIt was touted as the next clean fuel for passenger cars, the chemical catalyst that would decarbonise the steel and \nalumina industries, an ingredient for clean fertiliser and maybe even the replacement for methane gas in kitchen \nstoves.\n\"People thought it was a floor wax and a dessert topping, and it was good for everything,\" recalls Peter Barrett, the \nfounder of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Playground Global.\n\"But it ain't.\"\nBarrett isn't a hydrogen sceptic; as a director of Californian company Universal Hydrogen, he believes the \n\"incredibly useful\" molecule can cure the carbon footprint of the aviation and maritime industries plus work for \nfertiliser. But he doesn't hesitate to use the \"b\" word - bubble - when asked to explain the capitulation in most listed \nhydrogen stocks over the past three years.\n\"Some of the valuations were chasing applications that didn't necessarily make sense,\" he says. \"We see bubbles \nlike that, we are seeing one in AI today. People pile in, and they put money into silly shit.\"\nThe euphoria in hydrogen stocks peaked between Joe Biden winning the Democratic Party nomination in mid-2020 \nand his inauguration as president in January 2021.\nThe prospect of a green political wave at a time of ultra-low interest rates led investors toward riskier investments, \nparticularly those with a decarbonisation theme.\nBut three years on, the hydrogen tide has receded.\nThe 97-year-old Norwegian company Nel belongs to the \"sensible\" end of the hydrogen spectrum; it has \nmanufactured the electrolysers that turn water into hydrogen for decades, and Australian companies like Woodside \nand Viva Energy have its order book bursting at the seams.\nPage 2 of 3\nShould Fortescue buy its way to supremacy in hydrogen? Due Diligence\nBut Nel shares are down 86 per cent over the past three years as it endures short-term pain (investment in extra \nmanufacturing capacity) to underwrite a long-term strategy.\nThe silly end of the hydrogen spectrum was best represented by Nikola Motors, the hydrogen truck aspirant that, \namong other sins, was forced to admit to US regulators that it had rolled its prototype truck down a hill to make it \nappear functional for promotional videos.\nThe incident was one of several lies or exaggerations told to investors about Nikola's progress, and late last year its \ntalismanic founder Trevor Milton was sentenced to jail for fraud.\nNikola shares peaked at $US65.90 in 2020 but were just US62\u00a2 last week.\nAnother hydrogen truck aspirant, Hyzon, has lost 96.5 per cent of its value since February 2021 after it, too, fell foul \nof regulators for misleading investors over its sales performance.\nThe irregularities found by US regulators in the accounts of Plug Power - a manufacturer of hydrogen-powered \nforklifts, electrolysers and other components - were less serious than those at Nikola and Hyzon.\nBut they haven't helped investor confidence; Plug shares are down 96 per cent over the past three years, and the \ncash-strapped stock lost almost 12 per cent on Thursday when it revealed plans to issue $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) \nof new shares.\nWhile each stock is affected by individual factors, David Tuckwell from GlobalX says the common thread has been \nhigher interest rates making future cash flows seem less attractive; a painful blow for a sector where almost all cash \nflows are far from being realised.\nTuckwell manages a hydrogen exchange-traded fund.\nAside from interest rates, he says investors have been scared away from the hydrogen sector by frequent dilutive \nshare issuances and the threat that Donald Trump could scrap President Joe Biden's hydrogen incentives if he \nregains power.\nAmid this market carnage, the International Energy Agency still reckons global demand for hydrogen will more than \ntriple by 2050 if nations keep to their \"announced pledges\". The IEA believes demand for \"low-emissions\" hydrogen \nwill rise 25-fold by 2030 if those announced pledges are kept intact, and 246-fold by 2050.\nThe hard part is determining which of hydrogen's many uses will be adopted at scale, and then how to invest in \nthose applications.\nAsset manager Mirova's sustainability equity fund took its first cautious steps into hydrogen last year when it \npurchased shares in Euronext company Air Liquide.\nAir Liquide makes a range of industrial gases, and its hydrogen is made from both fossil fuels and renewable \npower.\nMirova analyst Cindy Huang reckons investing in incumbents like Air Liquide is the best way to get insights into how \nthe hydrogen sector will evolve, even if that means investing in a stock that currently has a big carbon footprint and \ndoes not offer pure exposure to hydrogen.\n\"We try to learn first from the individual company, and then through that company understand that part of the value \nchain,\" she says.\nAir Liquide and the other industrial gas producers that dabble in hydrogen, like Linde and US company Air \nProducts, have delivered much better returns for investors over the past three years than pure hydrogen stocks.\n\"Hopefully over time [we can] expand downwards through the value chain and hopefully identify more investment \ntargets,\" says Huang, adding that electrolyser makers could offer exciting, medium term growth.Page 3 of 3\nShould Fortescue buy its way to supremacy in hydrogen? Due Diligence\nBut Huang believes companies producing hydrogen fuel cells, or hydrogen for power generation, will require much \nmore patience and risk tolerance from investors.\nA separate Mirova fund has bypassed stocks to make direct investments in hydrogen businesses like Parisian taxi \ncompany Hype, which runs 400 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles refuelling at Hype's own stations.\nNo conversation about hydrogen is complete - in Australia at least - without mentioning Fortescue, the iron ore \nminer whose founder Andrew Forrest is the nation's biggest hydrogen bull.\nFortescue has built an electrolyser factory in Gladstone and has sanctioned its first green hydrogen project, a \n$US550 million hub in Arizona that will make low carbon hydrogen and offer refuelling services to hydrogen trucks.\nFortescue would need 1363 projects the size of that $US550 million hub to achieve its goal of producing 15 million \ntonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030.\nThe hub was acquired from Nikola and the two companies are working on a long-term supply agreement. \nFortescue's North America boss and former AGL chief executive Andy Vesey is now a director of Nikola.\nFortescue is also close to Hyzon, having acquired hydrogen-powered buses from the struggling company.\nBut Fortescue's most interesting relationship is with Plug; the iron ore miner has ordered electrolysers from Plug, \nand has floated the idea of giving Plug a stake in its Arizona hub under an equity swap that would give Fortescue a \nshareholding in one of Plug's projects in Texas.\nWhen Plug boss Andy Marsh updates investors on Tuesday, it will be exactly one year since he bruised Fortescue \nby suggesting the economics of the Gladstone electrolyser factory were not attractive enough for him to invest.\nPlug shares have since slumped 84 per cent for a market capitalisation of $US1.46 billion. Fortescue's shares \nhave risen 22 per cent over the same period for an $85 billion valuation.\nWith a power imbalance like that, perhaps it is time for Fortescue to consider buying its way to hydrogen \nsupremacy, rather than building.\nLoad-Date: January 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Peter Ker\nDate: January 22, 2024\nTitle: Should Fortescue buy its way to supremacy in hydrogen?\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Davos speed-dating for Forrest recruit\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Hans van Leeuwen\n### Date: January 23, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 3\nDavos speed-dating for Forrest recruit Analysis\nDavos speed-dating for Forrest recruit; Analysis\nAustralian Financial Review\nJanuary 23, 2024 Tuesday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 21\nLength: 938 words\nByline: Hans van Leeuwen\nBody\nAt the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, only one Australian company had its own office in the \njamboree's central hotel, sitting cheek-by-jowl with those of the big global banks and accounting firms.\nOccupying a prime corner, with a big placard warning about lethal humidity at the door, is Fortescue Metals Group. \nAndrew Forrest has become a highly visible Davos regular, and for the past two years has been joined by \nFortescue Future Industries chief Mark \"Hutch\" Hutchinson.\nThis year, though, they brought a third Fortescue exec with them: Robert Tichio, who has been part of Team \nTwiggy for all of eight weeks.\nIt wasn't the Wall Street financier's first time at Davos, but on this trip he had a new mission: to speed-date \ninstitutional investors, educating them about Forrest's latest initiative: Fortescue Capital, which Tichio has been \nrecruited to run.\nTaking a breather in the Fortescue office, he describes to The Australian Financial Review what the Fortescue \nmaster schedule might look like on a given day at Davos.\n\"Andrew Forrest is Andrew Forrest - his calendar is like nobody else's, and it involves extraordinary visits with \npeople who are shaping the way that, frankly, the world will move over the next decade,\" he says.\n\"Hutch will spend an incredible amount of time working with project partners and large corporates - whose identities \nwouldn't surprise you - who may be partners, who may be suppliers, who may be governments, who are going to be \ninstrumental in helping Fortescue projects achieve escape velocity. And then I've been spending my time entirely \nwith allocators ... sovereigns, pensions, endowments, global investment banks.\"\nA lot of northern hemisphere financial giants don't really know Fortescue well. And even if they do, they certainly \nneed a steer on Fortescue Capital - because Forrest, Hutchinson and Tichio are trying to do something that \nnobody else has quite done before.\nPage 2 of 3\nDavos speed-dating for Forrest recruit Analysis\nEssentially, not everything in Forrest's vastly ambitious slate of green energy projects can be funded from the iron \nore miner's balance sheet. But rather than send Fortescue Metals Group to the private markets, Forrest has \ndelegated the job of finding the funds to Tichio and his rapidly growing team.\nFortescue Capital has a foot in both camps: it works inside the company to get projects ready to pitch for external \nfunding; and then it raises and manages those funds. It's like an in-house asset manager or investment bank.\nBut this puts Tichio in an interesting position. From the outside, it looks very much like Forrest exercises pretty \nunfettered authority inside Fortescue. Shareholders can either like that or lump it.\nThose shareholders who have stuck with Forrest have been amply rewarded. But he can't take that attitude with the \nprivate markets. Institutional investors, running the risk-o-meter over specific Fortescue projects, will demand a \ntighter straitjacket.\nAnd Fortescue Capital, as the middle man, serves two masters. It raises the capital for its parent company, but it \nhas fiduciary duties to its investors. It looks as if Tichio is a man who might sometimes have to say \"no\" to Forrest. \nOr at least \"yes, but\".\nIt's a role he acknowledges is \"delicate\". \"No one will unmoor the chairman, he's an extraordinary visionary. I \nwouldn't have come to do this if I didn't believe in the way that he sets out a vision, particularly in categories that are \nunmarked, that are uncharted,\" Tichio says.\n\"He has an extraordinary ability to see long-term vision and make decisions that oftentimes really require the \neducation of the market versus the other way around. And we're not going to change that.\"\nHe rejects the idea that he will be some kind of Dr No. He describes Fortescue Capital as \"a voice in the room \nabout what third-party capital will want to see in a project\", helping decide whether a project is best suited to \nexternal or internal funding.\n\"Those are conversations we're having now daily. And I think it has been a really remarkable early series of \nexchanges, robust exchanges, on this,\" he says.\nTichio has spent his early weeks visiting various parts of the Fortescue empire, learning about the projects that \nmight ultimately come to his unit for funding. He was in Norway before Davos, and heads to the WAE operation in \nBritain afterwards.\n\"This has been a ramp period for us to work with the industrial teams, particularly on the energy side, to ensure that \ndecisions that are getting made around how these projects are being framed, sized, de-risked ... [are made] with \nthird-party equity investors in mind,\" he says.\nAlthough, of course, not every project will end up going externally for funding - some \"just may not be ready or \nappropriate\".\nMeanwhile, back at Fortescue Capital in New York, his colleagues are assembling \"a Wall-Street-deep team\" of \npeople from the likes of JPMorgan, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs.\nThe plan is not to raise capital for a pooled fund, in the style of Brookfield or Macquarie Asset Management, where \nthe money manager gets wide discretion about what to do with the cash.\nInstead, Tichio and his team will hawk \"diligenced, ringfenced assets or investment offerings\" for investors to \nconsider on an individual basis. Those offerings will come in the next three years, although probably not in 2024.\n\"If you were a fly on the wall of this room in Davos, there have been a lot of conversations with allocators to start to \nintroduce to them what they might expect to see from us, because of what we know is coming in the pipeline.\"Page 3 of 3\nDavos speed-dating for Forrest recruit Analysis\nIf Tichio can navigate his tricky job successfully, it sounds like he will be finding his way back to Davos again next \nyear.\nLoad-Date: January 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Hans van Leeuwen\nDate: January 23, 2024\nTitle: Davos speed-dating for Forrest recruit\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Turnbull quits Fortescue boardroom\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Peter Ker\n### Date: January 24, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nTurnbull quits Fortescue boardroom\nTurnbull quits Fortescue boardroom\nAustralian Financial Review\nJanuary 24, 2024 Wednesday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
