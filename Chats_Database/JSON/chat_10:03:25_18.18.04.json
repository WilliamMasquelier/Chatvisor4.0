We need gigawatts of our own (renewable -energy) first, and \nFortescue will be now looking at opportunities across Western Australia, across the eastern states, to generate \nelectricity,\" he said.\n\"Our purpose is always to value-add. So if we can go to carbon-free iron ore, and carbon-free metals, we will make \nmuch, much better returns on this sunk capital we already have than just selling into the National Electricity Market \non the east coast - but if those opportunities arise, we're going to take them.\" Building solar and wind to power the \ncompany's Pilbara iron ore operations is a key part of Fortescue's goal of achieving \"real zero\" emissions by 2030 - \na goal Dr Forrest says the company is \"absolutely\" committed to.\nBut even that will require substantial capital spending and, while Fortescue's retreat from its hydrogen ambitions \nwas welcomed by market analysts on Thursday, MST Marquee analyst Saul Kavonic said the company might also \nbe forced to accept its 2030 zero-emissions target is unrealistic.\n\"This signals Fortescue Future Industries has failed.

We remain optimistic about the success of hydrogen in the long-term playing a role in our \nfuture energy mix, but we will not follow Labor's mistake.\"\nWhile Dr Forrest is the highest-profile advocate for green hydrogen, the government points out he was not the only \nplayer, with more than 100 clean hydrogen projects in Australia, including 13 already operating and 17 under \nconstruction.\n\"Australia has more than 50 companies actively progressing renewable hydrogen project investment, making our \ncurrent clean hydrogen pipeline amongst the largest globally, valued at more than $225 billion,\" Climate Change \nMinister Chris Bowen said.\n\"This underpins strong collaborative relationships with export partners who are keen to receive Australia's green \nhydrogen in coming years.\nPage 2 of 2\nPM stays with hydrogen despite Fortescue retreat\n\"Green hydrogen will be one of the best ways Australia can decarbonise domestic heavy emitters and help develop \nrobust low carbon manufacturing, and industry.\n'The government is committed to working alongside commercial interests to deliver on this potential.\"\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese insisted his government's energy plan remained on track.\n\"We want to make sure that we deliver the clean energy that Australia needs and that when coal-fired power \nstations close, as they've announced their closure, there isn't a gap in the energy security that Australia needs,\" he \nsaid. \"That's why we need a real plan that's fully costed, and that's being rolled out with the certainty being provided \nfor investment.\"\nClimate Energy Finance director Tim Buckley said Dr Forrest was not alone in betting big on green hydrogen as \npart of the energy transition but costs had, in fact, gone up instead of following the usual pattern of better \naffordability for clean technology such as batteries, solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\"Twiggy went way too hard, way too fast and way too hyped about hydrogen,\" Mr Buckley said.\n\"Australia put out like 50 per cent of the world's press releases of hydrogen in the last five years but none of them \nhave come to fruition.\"\nWith Australian coal and gas exports to decline as the world decarbonises, Mr Buckley expressed doubt green \nhydrogen would be able to fill the void, pointing out the first ship capable of transporting chilled hydrogen at scale \nwas at least 10 years away.\nHe said green hydrogen's value was helping Australian resources companies to pivot to value-adding, such as \nprocessing critical minerals and producing strategic metals such as green steel.\nThe Superpower Institute, led by Rod Sims and Ross Garnaut, has warned it will be difficult for Australia to become \na major player in green iron production without a green hydrogen industry.\nThe institute estimates the annual export value of green iron to be $295 billion, or three times the current value of \niron ore exports.\n\"Green aluminium exports could be worth an additional $60 billion, compared with the current value of bauxite and \nalumina exports of $10 billion,\" it said in a report now sitting with the Department of Industry.\nMr Sims argues the government should double down on the hydrogen production tax incentive by introducing \ncapital grants of 50 per cent or equivalent tax credits for the first movers who build green iron plants.\nThe former ACCC boss had no issue if that meant Fortescue qualified for green iron support on top green \nhydrogen handouts.\n\"He could be helping Australia to start a $300 billion industry,\" Mr Sims said. \"And yet, if we don't help him, he won't \ndo it. So this isn't just money for someone who's going to do something anyway.\"\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Andrew Tillett, Brad Thompson\nDate: July 19, 2024\nTitle: PM stays with hydrogen despite Fortescue retreat\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Element Zero execs burnt bridges: Forrest\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Peter Ker\n### Date: July 19, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nElement Zero execs burnt bridges: Forrest\nElement Zero execs burnt bridges: Forrest\nAustralian Financial Review\nJuly 19, 2024 Friday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The lawsuit made headlines when it was revealed \nFortescue had hired private investigators to follow and photograph the Element Zero executives and their families.\nThe stakes are high for Fortescue, which even after this week's austerity drive and 700 job cuts, has a bevy of \ntrials and projects under way into various embryonic clean energy technologies.\nDr Forrest has denied prior knowledge of the plan to use private investigators, and said Fortescue directors had \nstruggled to align the surveillance tactics with the company's values.\nGeneral counsel Phil McKeiver offered his resignation over the incident, but has been retained by Fortescue, albeit \nwithout his previous responsibility as company secretary.\nBut despite distancing himself from the private investigation tactics, Dr Forrest endorsed the decision to pursue \nElement Zero through the courts.\n\"There is an overarching message here: you're not going to be paid to develop technology with a whole heap of \nother people, at really serious risk and cost to the entire company and your workmates ... and then send that \ntechnology to another email address and think that's OK,\" he said.\n\"That's not OK.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nElement Zero execs burnt bridges: Forrest\nDr Forrest appeared to reference evidence tendered to the Federal Court in Fortescue's June 17 claim, where it \naccused Dr Winther-Jensen of sending technical documents about green iron research from his Fortescue email to \na personal email account.\nDr Forrest said the Element Zero team had burned the bridges behind them \"like the Nazis pulling out of Poland\".\n\"You want to send emails full of our data over there then eliminate it, you'll be held to the full responsibility of the \nlaw,\" he said.\nDr Kolodziejczyk was born in the Polish city of Rzeszow, according to Australian Securities and Investments \nCommission filings.\nA spokesman for Element Zero declined to comment on Dr Forrest's warning.\n\"We are not going to be drawn into responding to these comments. We look forward to these matters being \ndetermined through the court process,\" he said.\nMr Masterman has been one of Dr Forrest's closest allies over the past quarter of a century, working for both \nFortescue and some private entities linked to the Forrest family.\nMr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk were among the inner circle of trusted executives who travelled around the \nworld with Dr Forrest in 2020 collecting rights to clean energy projects.\nThe fight with Element Zero over \"green iron\" technology is timely, given Dr Forrest's latest long-term vision for \nFortescue is to eventually cease selling hematite iron ore, and instead use green hydrogen and other techniques to \nstrip out impurities and sell only the pure \"green iron\" left behind.\n\"We're getting out of iron ore, which is very interesting because we're going, as soon as we can ... to green metal,\" \nDr Forrest said on Wednesday, when Fortescue conceded it would not achieve his previous goal of producing 15 \nmillion tonnes of hydrogen a year by 2030.\nFortescue will start construction this year on a $US50 million ($74.2 million) green iron facility at its Christmas \nCreek iron ore hub in the Pilbara.\nDr Forrest said such projects would consume green hydrogen in the future, even if demand for the commodity as a \nfuel source from other companies was not as strong as Fortescue had hoped.\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Peter Ker\nDate: July 19, 2024\nTitle: Element Zero execs burnt bridges: Forrest\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Green dream on empty\n## Media outlet: Townsville Bulletin\n### Author: Joanne Williamson\n### Date: July 19, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nGreen dream on empty\nGreen dream on empty\nTownsville Bulletin (Australia)\nJuly 19, 2024 Friday\nTownsville Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 35\nLength: 385 words\nByline: Joanne Williamson\nBody\nThe Prime Minister says his government's clean energy plan is \"on track\" despite mining magnate Andrew Forrest \nsuffering a major setback in his green energy ambitions.\nBut the opposition used the announcement that Mr Forrest's company, Fortescue Mining, was restructuring its \nmining and energy divisions, with a direct impact on its green hydrogen ambitions to say it showed the \nGovernment's renewables plan was a \"super-flop\".\nFortescue had sets its sights on producing cheap renewable energy at scale, but some believe Wednesday's \nannouncement means its goal of producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030 is unlikely to be \nachieved.\nAnthony Albanese, who was in northern Queensland on Thursday, said the Fortescue announcement did not worry \nhim.\n\"Our energy plan is on track,\" he said in Winton.\n\"We want to make sure that we deliver the clean energy that Australia needs and that when coal-fired power \nstations close, as they've announced their closure, there isn't a gap in the energy security that Australia needs.\n\"That's why we need a real plan that's fully costed, and that's being rolled out with the certainty being provided for \ninvestment.\" Fortescue said it remained \"resolute in its commitment to be the world's leading green technology, \nenergy and metals company with a laser focus on achieving Real Zero by 2030\".\nBut opposition energy spokesman Ted O'Brien said the Fortescue move showed \"Labor's 'green hydrogen \nsuperpower' vision is quickly turning into a 'super-flop'.\" \"Twiggy's abandonment of green hydrogen has blown a \ngaping hole in the Albanese Labor Government's energy plans,\" Mr O'Brien said.\n\"The collapse of this project is symptomatic of Labor's failing all-eggs-in-one-basket 'renewables only' plan which is \neating away at Australia's energy future.

Andrew Forrest removed one of \nthem, yet no one's paying attention.\nThe most surprising thing on the ASX yesterday was the way investors overlooked Fortescue's big news. Its \npromise to get back to its leaner and meaner roots and ease off its green energy expansion had the stock down 1.2 \nper cent in afternoon trade, while brokers barely mentioned it in their morning notes.\nHaving heard sell-side analysts consistently poke holes in the hydrogen story - the technology, the rollout, the cost - \nand listened to fund managers talk about Fortescue spending iron ore cash flows on an unproven business and \nwatching its cost base grow, we thought the wind-back would be welcome.\nIn theory, it's a reset that could return Fortescue to its glory days in 2018 and 2019, when just about every extra $1 \nmillion in revenue fell through to the earnings before interest and tax line and its dividend machine started.\nThe job cuts and statement could also dispel fears about Fortescue's energy unit spending $1 billion or so a year in \nthe near term with no clear path to revenue or earnings.\nInstead, it was met with crickets and yesterday's share price drop. There were nervy buyers in early trade, and no \ninstant gratification for what we thought was a pretty significant announcement.\nPerhaps the most telling thing was the way sell-side analysts largely ignored the news. Macquarie's team had a \nclose look, and upped its near-term earnings per share forecasts by 20 er cent, but none of the other 15 analysts in \nBloomberg's survey had re-cut the numbers by lunchtime. UBS, not in Bloomberg's survey for the past few years \nand which called the hydrogen news \"unsurprising\", published a brief 1-pager.\nSo what's going on? It's either something simple or much more serious, depending on who you ask.\nThe simple theory is that the school holidays have sucked plenty of money managers and analysts away from their \ndesks, significantly cutting active fund domestic institution trading volumes and quant money that factors in things \nsuch as broker earnings upgrades/downgrades.\nPage 2 of 2\nNo sugar hit from Fortescue backflip Closing Bell\nThat is true, but we still see share prices go up and down on small volumes, so while it may explain the lack of \nanalyst interest, we're not sure if it explains the muted share price response.\nWorse for Fortescue would be if it shows institutional investors and all those analysts with hold/sell \nrecommendations (all 16 of them in Bloomberg's survey) are materially more concerned by the company's other big \nissues.

[The Australian, Nick Evans, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s green energy division has accumulated more than $2.1 billion in losses over the past four years with little commercial return, raising concerns about the financial viability of its clean energy strategy. [The Australian, Nick Evans, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue announced it will cut 700 jobs globally as part of a major restructure, citing the need to remain \"lean\" and efficient, but the move raises concerns about the company's financial health, workforce morale, and the impact on its green energy transition. [The Australian, Nick Evans, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue Zero, the company's green energy technology arm, delivers only a small revenue stream, while none of its other energy investments have yet delivered a commercial return, highlighting the slow progress and financial risks of its renewable energy strategy. [The Australian, Nick Evans, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s green energy ambitions have been severely impacted by high energy costs, with the global surge in electricity prices after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and post-pandemic cost inflation making hydrogen production economically unfeasible. [The Australian, Nick Evans, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s failure to meet its green hydrogen targets undermines the Australian government\u2019s $8 billion investment in hydrogen production, raising concerns about the effectiveness of government subsidies and the broader impact on the renewable energy sector. [The Australian, Nick Evans, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s retreat from its green hydrogen ambitions has caused significant reputational damage, as the company had spent years making big promises to developing nations about the economic transformation green hydrogen would bring, many of which will now go unfulfilled. [The Australian, Nick Evans, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Investors and analysts have criticized Fortescue for ignoring warnings about the feasibility of its hydrogen plans, with many experts, including its own staff, having raised concerns about the strategy before the company was forced to scale back its ambitions. [The Australian, Nick Evans, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s failure to deliver on its green hydrogen promises has damaged its credibility, with Andrew Forrest\u2019s reputation taking a major hit after years of dismissing internal and external warnings about the challenges of commercializing green hydrogen. [The Australian, Eric Johnston, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s lack of transparency regarding the financial costs of its green hydrogen venture has left investors uncertain about the true impact of its failed energy strategy, raising concerns about corporate governance and accountability. [The Australian, Eric Johnston, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s chaotic approach to green hydrogen, marked by shifting deadlines, surging electricity costs, and a revolving door of executives, has left investors in the dark about financials and the future of its energy division. [The Australian, Eric Johnston, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s failure to secure a viable energy source at scale for its hydrogen projects, combined with surging power prices, made its green hydrogen ambitions economically unfeasible, raising questions about the company\u2019s strategic planning. [The Australian, Eric Johnston, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s green hydrogen collapse has set back the global push for hydrogen development, as its failure to commercialize the technology may discourage other investors from pursuing similar projects. [The Australian, Eric Johnston, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s retreat from its hydrogen ambitions was welcomed by market analysts, but MST Marquee analyst Saul Kavonic stated that \"Fortescue Future Industries has failed,\" arguing that the company ignored overwhelming evidence that green hydrogen was unviable and spent hundreds of millions before finally admitting defeat. [The Australian, Nick Evans, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue executives who raised concerns about the company\u2019s green hydrogen ambitions and were pushed out for telling the truth deserve an apology, according to analyst Saul Kavonic, highlighting internal resistance to criticism and potential mismanagement. [The Australian, Nick Evans, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw noted that Fortescue\u2019s hydrogen retreat was necessary, as the strategy would have drained cash while iron ore prices were expected to decline, raising concerns about the company\u2019s financial discipline. [The Australian, Nick Evans, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s decision to scale back its hydrogen ambitions has \"blown a gaping hole\" in the Australian government\u2019s energy plans, according to opposition energy spokesman Ted O'Brien, raising concerns about the broader impact on national energy policy. [Australian Financial Review, Andrew Tillett, Brad Thompson, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s legal pursuit of former executives over alleged intellectual property theft has raised concerns about its corporate governance and employee relations, as the accused executives argue that their green metals technology was developed independently. [Australian Financial Review, Peter Ker, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue hired private investigators to follow and photograph former executives and their families as part of a legal dispute, a move that executive chairman Andrew Forrest admitted did not align with the company\u2019s values, raising serious ethical and reputational concerns. [Australian Financial Review, Peter Ker, July 19, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue\u2019s restructuring and job cuts were met with a muted response from investors, with analysts suggesting that institutional investors remain more concerned about the company\u2019s broader strategic and financial issues.
