It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nGreen dream on empty\nGreen dream on empty\nTownsville Bulletin (Australia)\nJuly 19, 2024 Friday\nTownsville Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 35\nLength: 385 words\nByline: Joanne Williamson\nBody\nThe Prime Minister says his government's clean energy plan is \"on track\" despite mining magnate Andrew Forrest \nsuffering a major setback in his green energy ambitions.\nBut the opposition used the announcement that Mr Forrest's company, Fortescue Mining, was restructuring its \nmining and energy divisions, with a direct impact on its green hydrogen ambitions to say it showed the \nGovernment's renewables plan was a \"super-flop\".\nFortescue had sets its sights on producing cheap renewable energy at scale, but some believe Wednesday's \nannouncement means its goal of producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030 is unlikely to be \nachieved.\nAnthony Albanese, who was in northern Queensland on Thursday, said the Fortescue announcement did not worry \nhim.\n\"Our energy plan is on track,\" he said in Winton.\n\"We want to make sure that we deliver the clean energy that Australia needs and that when coal-fired power \nstations close, as they've announced their closure, there isn't a gap in the energy security that Australia needs.\n\"That's why we need a real plan that's fully costed, and that's being rolled out with the certainty being provided for \ninvestment.\" Fortescue said it remained \"resolute in its commitment to be the world's leading green technology, \nenergy and metals company with a laser focus on achieving Real Zero by 2030\".\nBut opposition energy spokesman Ted O'Brien said the Fortescue move showed \"Labor's 'green hydrogen \nsuperpower' vision is quickly turning into a 'super-flop'.\" \"Twiggy's abandonment of green hydrogen has blown a \ngaping hole in the Albanese Labor Government's energy plans,\" Mr O'Brien said.\n\"The collapse of this project is symptomatic of Labor's failing all-eggs-in-one-basket 'renewables only' plan which is \neating away at Australia's energy future. Despite offering billions in taxpayer funds these projects are still failing to \nget off the ground.\" Mr O'Brien said the Coalition was taking a \"sensible technology agnostic approach\" to energy - \nPage 2 of 2\nGreen dream on empty\nincluding hydrogen and its controversial nuclear reactor policy. Mr Forrest launched a sweeping restructure at For-\ntescue in the face of the company's failure to deliver on its green-energy -promises. Up to 700 jobs will go in the \nmassive cutbacks after the iron ore mogul pulled back from the company's green hydrogen goal.\nLoad-Date: July 18, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
