Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 24\nLength: 1326 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nKalgoorlie postcard The high hopes of last year have faded.\nDarren Stralow and Simon Lawson shook hands and said their goodbyes. The young gold bulls had just met and \nthought they were about to die together in a plane crash.\nIt was 2011, the gold price was about $1300 an ounce and Northern Star Resources was starting its rise from the \nranks of penny dreadful to where it sits today, the biggest ASX-listed producer.\nThe plane, its engines dead after sucking in dirty fuel, eventually glided to an emergency landing in Paraburdoo, \nWestern Australia.\n\"Everyone was looking out of the window, you could see the fire engines rushing to the side of the runway for the \nlanding to make sure that we weren't going to burst into flames,\" recalls Stralow.\nLawson and Stralow, working for Northern Star at the time, bonded over the near-death experience and shared a \nfew cold beers that night in town.\nThese days, Stralow is chief executive of Bellevue Gold. Lawson is the managing director of Spartan Resources.\nSpartan shares soared from 22\u00a2 to as high as $1.33 in the past 12 months on the back of the Never Never \ndiscovery about 800 kilometres south of their emergency landing. Bellevue has been as high as $2.10, although it \nnow hovers near a 12-month low of $1.25.\nLawson and Stralow were two of the star attractions at the Diggers & Dealers mining conference in Kalgoorlie, \nwhere gold was centre stage. The critical minerals presenters did their best to sound upbeat but were a reminder of \nfickle commodity markets and how quickly high-flyers can crash.\nKalgoorlie is relying on gold as it deals with the fallout from the collapse of the nickel industry and failures to launch \nin lithium in the wider Goldfields region.\nPage 2 of 3\nGold saves the day as Diggers deals with the rout\nSmoke still pours from the 150-metre-high main chimney stack at the BHP nickel smelter outside the town, but it will \nstop soon after 51 years.\nAbout 10 kilometres away, on the edge of town, Northern Star is investing $1.5 billion on a giant crusher to boost \noutput from the fabled Superpit and underground mines. Those operations cover ground that has already produced \nabout 65 million ounces of gold worth about $222 billion at today's spot price of $US2398 ($3700) an ounce.\nStralow reminds everyone of how tough it can be to get new mines into production and running, even with price \ntailwinds.\nHe needed to do so as an explanation of Bellevue's decision to raise $150 million last month, a move that caught \nthe market by surprise. At least Bellevue could raise money. Commodity analysts Citi and others have predicted the \ngold price could reach $US3000 an ounce by this time next year under a bullish scenario.\nRaising money appears a forlorn hope for lithium projects, with benchmark prices for the concentrate produced in \nWA slumping to $US870 a tonne this week. Liontown Resources managing director Tony Ottaviano, who has just \ndefied the odds to bring the Kathleen Valley mine to life, told the conference it was now impossible to fund a lithium \nproject with equity alone.\nLithium veteran Ken Brinsden, who piloted Pilbara Minerals through near ruin, suggested the federal government \ncreate something akin to the former Australian Wheat Board to help fund strategically important rare earths \nprojects.\nWhile the Kalgoorlie pubs did a roaring trade, the BHP stand inside the conference's main marquee stood almost \nempty. All it had to offer was advice on where there might be other jobs after the mothballing of the nickel smelter \nand mines that were the lifeblood of towns such as Leinster and Kambalda.\nLawson brought his gold company back to life after a triple bypass. It failed twice when known as Gascoyne \nResources. He was sacking workers two years ago but has had remarkable success with the drill bit since then \nunder the Spartan moniker.\nSpartan's most exciting discovery is Never Never, part of the Dalgaranga project. And it is one reason that mid-tier \nminer Ramelius Resources has grabbed a near 18 per cent stake in the company amid a flurry of M&A in the WA \ngold sector. The Diggers organisers showed a sense of theatre when Spartan boss Lawson and Ramelius boss \nMark Zeptner spoke back-to-back on Wednesday. Lawson has stirred the pot by suggesting that with a market \ncapitalisation of $1.2 billion, Spartan might now be too much to bite off for $2.16 billion Ramelius.\nLess than a year ago, he was hoping Ramelius, Westgold or Silver Lake would come knocking about a deal and \nbemoaning a timid approach to M&A in the gold sector.\n\"I stand by that,\" Lawson said this week. \"There was a little confusion about why no one had moved on me earlier. \nWhy did [Ramelius] wait until it cost them $185 million to get less than 20 per cent of my company? I'm still \nconfused as to why cashed-up gold producers, who are actually running at a pretty good premium and with \npremium gold prices, are not more active in that M&A space.\"\nNorthern Star, valued at $16.3 billion, made many of its acquisitions at times when the gold price was in the \ndoldrums.\nBoth Northern Star boss Stuart Tonkin and Evolution Mining executive chairman Jake Klein said this week that they \nwere less inclined to make acquisitions at a high gold price.\nDespite the impressive size and grade of Never Never, one hurdle for Lawson has been the stigma associated with \nGascoyne. \"One particular fund manager said he hated Gascoyne, it had torched $35 million of his fund and that it \nreally left a bad taste in his mouth,\" Lawson says. \"He said he wasn't interested in hearing our story, but he turned \nup, sat in a corner and pretended not to listen. Eight minutes later he wanted 5 per cent.\"Page 3 of 3\nGold saves the day as Diggers deals with the rout\nLawson is also backing his mate Stralow to deliver with Bellevue despite some grumblings about the capital raising \nat a big discount. \"There's more money in the tank now [at Bellevue], and he's running the highest-grade gold mine \nin Australia. It's going to be very profitable,\" he adds.\nLast year at Diggers, lithium was all the rage, with Albemarle about to up its bid for Liontown to $6.6 billion and Gina \nRinehart and Chile's SQM working up to a joint $1.7 billion takeover offer for explorer Azure Minerals.\nAndrew Forrest-backed Wyloo had just completed its $760 million acquisition of nickel miner Mincor. BHP was \nplanning to build a 1000-bed village at Kalgoorlie to accommodate the workforce needed for a major overhaul and \nupdate of its nickel smelter.\nA year later, the Wyloo mines are mothballed and BHP has written down the value of its nickel business by $5.4 \nbillion. Glencore and IGO Limited have the only nickel mines still standing in WA - and they are just hanging on.\nIGO sold its 30 per cent stake in Tropicana, one of WA's biggest gold mines, to Regis Resources in 2021 as part of \na big punt on battery minerals that involved acquiring stakes in the Greenbushes lithium mine and a still mis-firing \nlithium hydroxide refinery.\nThe same green metals strategy led to the disastrous acquisition of nickel miner Western Areas.\nThose deals were done before Ivan Vella arrived as chief executive. He remains optimistic on lithium but isn't so \nsure about a nickel revival in the face of growing supply from Chinese-backed producers in Indonesia.\n\"What we do know is a lot of WA nickel mines are actually quite old. As you get further into the mine life, it does get \nharder and more costly,\" he says.\nGlenn Wilson, the mayor of Kalgoorlie, says the town is feeling the impact of the nickel collapse and BHP workers \nleaving.\n\"We're starting to see houses hit the market. We're starting to see some of the effect of people moving on to \ndifferent roles with BHP [BHP has offered workers redundancies or jobs in its iron ore and copper mines elsewhere \nin Australia],\" he says.\nBut Wilson, who is chairman of the Australian Mining Cities Alliance that includes places like Broken Hill, Mount Isa \nand Karratha, says the strong gold sector was a saving grace for Kalgoorlie.\n\"There is a silver lining to nickel ... the gold sector now can have a workforce ready to go in some instances,\" he \nsaid.\nLoad-Date: August 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nBased on the content of the article, choose the most appropriate category from the following list: ['Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Activity', 'Financial Performance and Market Valuation', 'Gold Price Impact on Business', 'Exploration and Resource Development', 'Asset Sales and Divestments']\nYour output should solely be the name of the category chosen and nothing else.\n            ",
