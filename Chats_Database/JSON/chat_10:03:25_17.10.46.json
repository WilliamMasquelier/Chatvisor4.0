Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Ramelius Resources based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Ramelius Resources is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Ramelius Resources.\n\nIf Ramelius Resources is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nJavelin tags new non-exec as Eureka gold acquisition finalised\nJavelin tags new non-exec as Eureka gold acquisition finalised\nThe Age (Melbourne, Australia) - Online\nDecember 13, 2024 Friday 4:22 AM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 689 words\nByline: Doug Bright\nHighlight: Javelin Minerals completes its heralded acquisition of the brownfields Eureka gold project, 54km \nnorthwest of Kalgoorlie, and recruits an experienced non-exec.\nBody\nJavelin Minerals has slotted the next golden arrow into its quiver with the completion of the much-heralded \nacquisition of the brownfields Eureka gold project, just 54km northwest of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia.\nEureka's current mineral resource estimate remains at 2.45 million tonnes at an average grade of 1.42 grams per \ntonne (g/t) gold for a total of 112,000 ounces, as announced by a previous owner TNT Mines in June 2021.\nThe indicated resource comprises 62,000 ounces of gold with a further 50,000 ounces inferred, which was \ndetermined using a 0.5g/t gold lower cut-off grade.\nMost of the current gold resource lies within granted mining leases immediately along strike and down-dip of the \nshear-hosted mineralisation mined from the now partially flooded Eureka open pit.\nThe gold resides in multiple shear zones which dip eastwards at about 75 degrees.\nThe consummation of the Eureka acquisition from Delta Lithium came with shareholder approval at Javelin's annual \ngeneral meeting (AGM) in Perth on November 29 for the issuance of share tranches in consideration of the \nacquisition.\nJavelin acquired Eureka for an up-front $3 million cash consideration and shares, along with a further $1m in \ndeferred consideration shares.\nFinance and corporate executive Peter Gilford was also appointed at the AGM as a non-executive director with \nimmediate effect. Gilford is the chief financial officer and company secretary at Delta, having been appointed to the \ncompany in June last year.\nHe has more than 20 years' experience in financial management, mergers and acquisitions, debt and equity \nfunding, accounting, treasury, insurance, taxation, ASX compliance and investor relations.\nJavelin announced in mid-November that it had identified at least 12 promising and untested structural and \ngeochemical gold targets during re-processing of aeromagnetic data from the Eureka ground that warrant \nimmediate follow-up drilling.\nPage 2 of 2\nJavelin tags new non-exec as Eureka gold acquisition finalised\nThe company also noted past drilling had reported massive gold results including 4m going 134g/t gold, 3m at \n48.75g/t and 4m at 32g/t gold. However, there had been no follow-up drilling.\nJavelin would have likely seen Eureka's nearology as another bonus when it was running the rule over its potential \nacquisition. Eureka is only 22km north/northwest of and in the same greenstone sequence as Zijin Mining's \nrenowned 3-million ounce Paddington gold mine. Eureka is also just 14km north of the historic mining area of Broad \nArrow and 1.4 km west of the 530,000-ounce Zoroastrian gold deposit at Bardoc.\nEureka was last mined in the early 1990s and was subject to tribute mining in 2018. The deposit exhibits strong \npotential for significant northward and depth extensions of gold mineralisation that Javelin plans to test in a drilling \nprogram it has slated early next year.\nThe Eureka acquisition handsomely complements Javelin's 126,685-ounce Coogee gold project at the northeast \nend of Lake Lefroy, near Kambalda in WA, where the company is now running its maiden drilling campaign.\nCoogee was last mined as an open pit to about 70m depth by Ramelius Resources in 2013, yielding a reported \n147,400 tonnes gold averaging 4.7g/t gold for a recovered 20,400 ounces\nJavelin recently extended the first phase of its combined reverse circulation and diamond drilling assault on Coogee \nby a further 30 per cent to more than 3000m. It will now test several strong gold copper targets close to the original \nCoogee deposit.\nThe overall program initially seeks to confirm potential extensions of the known gold-copper mineralisation below \nthe level of the current shallow open pit. It will then look to extend mineralisation north and northwest from the old \nCoogee deposit to explore up to five more compelling and largely untested geophysical targets.\nWith a combined total of about 239,000 ounces of gold in its inventory for Coogee and Eureka and remarkably \nsimilar areas of extension and depth potential in northward extensions and beyond at both of its old open pits, \nJavelin appears to have plenty to keep it occupied in the near future.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?
