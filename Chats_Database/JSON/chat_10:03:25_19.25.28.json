Pg. 18\nLength: 751 words\nByline: NICK EVANS\nBody\nFortescue has successfully fended off a move by former executives to win access to the instructions given to \nprivate investigators who followed the men around for weeks ahead of raids on their homes and offices, amid \nallegations of intellectual property theft.\nFortescue is suing the directors of would-be green steel rival Element Zero over allegations the three - former \nFortescue chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk, former Fortescue staff member Bjorn Winther-Jensen and long-term \nAndrew Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman - launched their own business using technology they helped develop \nat Fortescue.\nThe three men deny the allegations, saying Element Zero's technology was developed separately from their former \nwork at Fortescue.\nIn May the Federal Court issued orders allowing raids on the offices of Element Zero, and the homes of Dr \nKolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen, to seize the contents of computers and other electronic devices to help \nprovide evidence of the accusations.\nAhead of the raids Fortescue hired private investigation firm Lancasters Investigations to watch their houses and \nhelp find an appropriate time for the raids - a step required by courts ahead of the authorisation of such raids.\nBut the three men argue the surveillance went far beyond the requirements for the so-called Anton Pillar orders and \ntheir legal team sought orders for Fortescue to produce the instructions given to Lancasters in court on Thursday, \narguing the mining major may have had an \"ancillary\" purpose for hiring the -investigators.\nIn addition to following the three men and their families around for weeks - including following Dr Kolodziejczyk to a \nchildcare centre when he was dropping off his young child - the private investigators recorded details of business \nmeetings held by the three men, court records show, as well as using hidden cameras to record the inside of an \nElement Zero research facility unit in Perth.\nPage 2 of 2\nWin for Fortescue in private eye battle\n\"We were able to get a close internal view of the facility using a minute covert camera during the surveillance \nperiod,\" says one report sent to Fortescue executives by Lancasters investigators.\n\"Covert video of Element Zero industrial internal space and machinery was obtained.\" The documents released by \nthe court also show Fortescue and its lawyers instructed Lancasters to search through a Pilbara industrial estate \nlooking for -information on whether Element Zero was building a pilot plant in the area to test its green steel \ntechnology.\nDespite not being a target of the secret search orders, Mr Masterman was also watched at his Sydney home and \nwas followed on business trips, while investigators rifled through his rubbish and mail.\nFortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest has said neither he or any other member of the Fortescue board \nhad any knowledge of the lengths taken by Fortescue's investigators to spy on its former employees, and \nthreatened to review the contract of one of the law firms overseeing the case - Davies Collison Cave Law.\nFederal Court documents show senior internal Fortescue lawyers Phil McKeiver and Adrian Huber were directly \ninvolved in issuing instructions to Lancasters. And the documents also show that a second law firm, Seyfarth Shaw, \nwas also involved in overseeing the investigator's work.\nSeyfarth Shaw was first hired by Fortescue in early 2023 to investigate an anonymous complaint to the company's \nboard that Dr Forrest had had an inappropriate relationship with a Fortescue staff member.\nOn Thursday Justice Brigitte Markovic rejected the orders sought by Element Zero for the instructions issued to \nLancasters, saying they were likely the subject of legal professional privilege and the concerns aired by the three \nmen about the conduct of Fortescue's investigators could be dealt with at a hearing later this month, when Element \nZero will seek to set aside the original search orders and argue for the return of their data.\nLawyers for Element Zero also lost an application to cross-examine Davies Collison Cave lawyer Paul Dewar over \nallegations the law firm's initial evidence to the court to win the secret search orders made material omissions that \nmight have damaged its -application.\nWhile arguing that the cross-examination should not be allowed, Fortescue lawyer Julian Cooke SC also flagged a \ndesire to cross-examine Mr Masterman and Element Zero lawyer Michael Williams, if the Element Zero application \nwas successful. \"I'd seek to cross-examine Mr Masterman and Mr Williams, about their so called privacy concerns,\" \nhe said.\nLoad-Date: August 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue executive chairman | \"Neither I or any other member of the Fortescue board had any knowledge of the lengths taken by Fortescue's investigators to spy on its former employees.\" | N.A. |\n| Phil McKeiver | Senior internal Fortescue lawyer | \"We were able to get a close internal view of the facility using a minute covert camera during the surveillance period.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke SC | Fortescue lawyer | \"I'd seek to cross-examine Mr Masterman and Mr Williams, about their so called privacy concerns.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
