All Rights Reserved\nSection: AUSTRALIA NEWS; Version:1\nLength: 896 words\nByline: Sarah Collard\nHighlight: Yindjibarndi people allege mining giant did not get permission from native title holders, while company \nsays community \u2018disharmony\u2019 is not its faultFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updatesGet our breaking \nnews email, free app or daily news podcast\nBody\nTraditional owners in Western Australia are seeking more than $1bn in compensation for the Solomon Hub iron ore \nmine, but mining giant Fortescue Metals Group and the WA government say their claim is worth less than $10m.\nThe federal court justice Stephen Burley is hearing final submissions this week in the long-running legal dispute  \nbetween the Western Australian government, Fortescue (FMG) and the Yindjibarndi people over the multibillion-\ndollar iron ore mine in the Pilbara region.\nYindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation is seeking a collective $1.8bn in compensation for economic, cultural, \nspiritual and social losses and harm since mining operations began almost a decade ago with state government \napproval, which it argues was given without its consent.\nIn its most recent budget, the WA government estimates it will garner more than $9bn in royalties  from mining with \nabout a quarter of that coming from iron ore.\nIt has been reported that the Solomon Hub iron ore mine has generated an estimated $80bn in revenue for \nFortescue since 2013.\nYindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation alleged that Fortescue began mining in 2013 without any permissions \nor discussions with native title holders but with state government approvals under the then Barnett government.\nPage 2 of 3\nFortescue and WA government say traditional owners\u2019 $1.8bn compensation claim is worth $8m\nLawyers acting for the Yindjibarndi applicants told the court last week that complex relationships nurtured from birth \nuntil death, through marriages, funerals, lore and oral traditions, had been severely impacted through Fortescue\u2019s \nmining operations.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email\n\u201cThis has made very strong emotions and created much, effectively, bereavement in the community, because it was \nso, so important,\u201d Tina Jowett SC, said, referring to a detailed anthropological report conducted by Kingsley Palmer \non behalf of the claimants.\n\u201cRelationships that should have been there very strong and enforced through birth, death, marriage, men making \nceremonies have collapsed since 2007.\u201d\nFortescue argued in its submission  filed last week that traditional owners are not entitled to compensation for any \nalleged discord, saying that disagreements and disputes arose from different views among Yindjibarndi and the \nmining company\u2019s activities on the land.\n\u201cPart of that dispute was about whether (and on what terms) the YP should agree with FMG to land access. \nBecause different YP [Yindjibarndi people] members within the YP had different views about whether an agreement \nshould be made, it cannot be said that FMG caused the alleged disharmony.\u201d\nFortescue claimed any acrimony within community was not within the purview of current legislation, with the mining \ncompany writing in court documents published last week: \u201cSuch \u2018social division\u2019 or \u2018disharmony\u2019 is not compensable \nunder the [Native Title Act].\n\u201cA sum of no more than $8 million for the YP\u2019s non-economic loss would reflect Australian standards that are \nappropriate, fair and just. Such a sum involves a very generous assessment.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Brahma Dharmananda SC, acting for Fortescue, argued that cultural and spiritual loss must be \nconsidered appropriately and in line with public sentiment in society.\n\u201cValue judgment, in our submission, should not be coloured by false questions about the preparedness of mining \ncompanies in other cases, to share a royalty percentage of their gains from minerals.\n\u201cOur submission, properly focused on the impact of the attachment to the land and or connection to Country, \ncultural loss cannot include a claimed loss if it does not show an impact on the Native Title holders spiritual \nconnection to the land.\u201d\nIn its final submission to the federal court earlier this month, the WA government argued compensation for cultural \nlosses under current legislation was not a \u201cmathematic equation\u201d but should be in line with community expectations \nwith the compensation valued at between \u201c$5-10 million\u201d.\nCompensation for economic loss of the land loss \u201camounts to $92,957.31,\u201d it said.\nThe WA government, in its statement also argued that the arguments for compensation were \u201cfundamentally \nflawed\u201d, with compensation being sought under grounds that were not covered by native title legislation.\nThe Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation chair and lead applicant, Michael Woodley, told Guardian Australia \nthat he believed the case was a landmark in that it had the power to reshape how mining\u2019s cultural, social and \neconomic impacts on First Nations people are understood.\nWoodley said that mining companies could pay a far greater share of their profits to traditional owners if they were \nsuccessful in their claim: \u201cIf resource developments are coming on to our land, then they\u2019ll have to acknowledge \nthat now the courts have established there is a certain percentage of royalties or resource benefit [to traditional \nowners].\u201dPage 3 of 3\nFortescue and WA government say traditional owners\u2019 $1.8bn compensation claim is worth $8m\nBut he said that as outlined in court, the impact on the once pristine lands, waters and hundreds of important \ncultural sites had taken a psychological toll on him and the Yindjibarndi people: \u201cThe emotion of the land being \npicked up, blown up and exploited, impacted on \u2026 That\u2019s a heavy burden for us to carry, both in a physical and a \nspiritual sense.\u201d\nThe Yindjibarndi people were awarded exclusive native title rights to their land, including where Solomon Hub sits, \nin 2017.\nThe final submissions were continuing this week with a judgment expected later this year.\nLoad-Date: February 25, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Tina Jowett SC | Lawyer for Yindjibarndi applicants | \u201cThis has made very strong emotions and created much, effectively, bereavement in the community, because it was so, so important.\u201d | N.A. |\n| Michael Woodley | Chair and lead applicant of Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation | \u201cIf resource developments are coming on to our land, then they\u2019ll have to acknowledge that now the courts have established there is a certain percentage of royalties or resource benefit [to traditional owners].\u201d | N.A. |\n| Michael Woodley | Chair and lead applicant of Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation | \u201cThe emotion of the land being picked up, blown up and exploited, impacted on \u2026 That\u2019s a heavy burden for us to carry, both in a physical and a spiritual sense.\u201d | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
