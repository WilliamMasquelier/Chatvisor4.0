Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: CHANTICLEER; Pg. 32\nLength: 1282 words\nByline: MARK DI STEFANO and HANNAH WOOTTON\nBody\nBusiness figures and lobbyists filed down Melbourne's Bourke Street last week for a closed-door fundraiser with Jim \nChalmers. It was at SEC Newgate's office and billed as a private dinner with the federal treasurer, with proceeds \nflowing to Victorian Labor.\nBefore the event, Responsible Wagering Australia's Kai Cantwell got a call telling him he wouldn't be allowed in the \nroom despite paying for a ticket.\nSure, Cantwell is a former Nationals adviser (and his boss is Liberal greybeard Nick Minchin) but lobbyists across \nthe party divide attend these cash-for-access do's. That's what the money is for.\nCould it be because the RWA's key client is Sportsbet, the foreign-owned bookmaking giant sweating the most on \nmooted changes to gambling advertising laws?\nTo be blackballed from one event might be seen as unlucky. But word's gotten out among gossip-hungry lobbyists \nthe RWA has been shut out of several Federal Labor Business Forum events. One featuring Prime Minister \nAnthony Albanese, another starring Communications Minister Michelle Rowland.\nHow both parties run their business forums is a galling exercise in regulatory runaround. Annual disclosures \nreleased this week plainly show the individuals like billionaire Anthony Pratt who stump up large party donations.\nBut business donations through annual subscriptions to the forums are kept fuzzy. Millions of dollars in cash \ndumped into a washing machine. It's up to journalists to piece together exactly who is forking over the suitcases \nthat give them privileged access to the country's elected officials.\nRWA is a paid subscriber of Labor's forum. Those subscribers usually pay something like $60,000 annually, and in \nreturn get a wad of tickets to budget night and passes to other talkfests. That's a fair wedge, to not be getting \nanything for it.\nOne possible reason for its exclusion is that, given the government is apparently at the pointy end of developing its \nbookmaker ad ban policy, it would be inappropriate for RWA to be in the room.\nPage 2 of 3\nREAR WINDOW Chalmers, Labor leave bookmaking giant in cold\nAnd that sounds well and nice, but what of all the other blue-chip companies whose commercial futures are \ninfluenced by any pending government policy? Do you reckon Resources Minister Madeleine King is being shielded \nfrom BHP and Rio's lobbyist operations? Does Chalmers have the discipline to screen late-night calls from CBA's \nMatt Comyn? Of course not.\nPerhaps they have wised up to the not-a-good-look factor of going off-record with bookmakers.\nIn 2023, this masthead revealed the RWA (then on behalf of Sportsbet and Entain) picked up the tab for a private \nsteak dinner for Rowland the year prior. This was later excused as a \"policy briefing\", which coincidentally fell on \nher birthday. She faced calls to resign.\nIn 2022, Sportsbet also footed a $8960 bill for a dinner to support Rowland's election campaign at Rockpool. She \nwas then the shadow minister in charge of online betting. The Minister for Sportsbet tag has stuck.\nAny wonder Labor is running around blacklisting the bookmakers. If it is serious, it can give the subscription money \nback.\nTech visa lobby foots bill for Bragg's bash\nLiberal senator Andrew Bragg's 2023 Christmas party was a glitzy affair, sponsored by Sydney's billionaire party \nking Justin Hemmes. It had the venue (not disclosed), drinks and canapes you'd expect of a Merivale shindig.\nHis 2024 Christmas bash was a less glamorous affair, according to Bragg. The venue (not disclosed, again) was \nsomewhere in Barangaroo and the senator's parliamentary disclosures show the sponsor was the Australian \nComputer Society.\nWho doesn't want to talk about IT over an eggnog margarita?\nGiven the ACS's financial stake in several policies that could become key election issues, footing the bill for a \nChristmas party for Liberal Party operatives may prove a smart investment.\nThe organisation pitches itself as a \"leading professional association representing Australia's technology \ncommunity, across industry, government and education\". It has nearly 50,000 members and releases reports on \nprofessional skills and trends.\nBut it is also an accredited provider of skilled migrant assessments for IT professionals hoping to move to Australia.\nAnother revenue stream is its \"ACS Professional Year\", which it pitches as \"a job-readiness program that bridges \nthe gap between full-time study and employment in Australia's tech sector\". Graduates can claim an additional five \npoints towards visa applications.\nIf only there was an event where the ACS could speak to politicians about the important issues of skilled migration \nand international student caps in the lead-up to Christmas ...\nOn the ACS front, a spokesman says the party was \"part of our regular government relations outreach program\". It \nspreads its Christmas cheer without partisanship too: \"We do it with politicians from all parties and the \nindependents as well,\" he says.\nFrom Bragg's end, he says he was just keen to celebrate Christmas in Sydney as, in his view, the city's Lord Mayor \nClover Moore had tried to shut it down. \"Clover Moore hates Christmas, I love Christmas,\" he says. \"I think it's good \nto celebrate, and I'm grateful to the ACS for putting on a nice event where I can thank my long-suffering \nsupporters.\"\nAt Fortescue, you really can ask anythingPage 3 of 3\nREAR WINDOW Chalmers, Labor leave bookmaking giant in cold\nAll-staff meetings are fertile ground for workplace drama, especially when the floor is opened for questions to \nmanagement. Never one to back down from a fight, Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has instituted a permanent \"Ask \nUs Anything\" portal.\nRank-and-file staff post anonymous questions to management, which are then posted in a public forum. They can \nbe \"liked\", with the most popular then answered in a weekly meeting. It also includes any written responses from \nthe bosses.\nUnsurprisingly, some silliness has ensued. In one post, an employee asks for an in-house lottery; 81 staffers back \nthe request, which bears a striking resemblance to Gina Rinehart's in-house loyalty program. \"For each year with \nFMG, can we be given a token that is placed into a barrel and have ten tokens drawn out yearly with the winners \nget [sic] 100k prize,\" the Fortescue workers asked.\nGiven Twiggy is convinced Rinehart has spent her life copying his ideas, we don't reckon there is much chance he \nwill return the favour by replicating her annual Christmas cash giveaway, in which random staff members are gifted \n$100,000.\nOther requests included table tennis and a pool for FMG's new corporate digs on St Georges Terrace in Perth. \n\"Would be lovely to have a quick dip during breaks or after a hard day's work,\" one staffer said.\n\"Can males wear formal shorts to the office on hot summer days please?\" was another plea. Some decorum, \nplease!\nThe raffle may not be flying, but other FMG \"troops\", as Twiggy calls them, have had more luck in getting action \nfrom managers. Some correspondents used it to complain that FMG's recent austerity drive had robbed them of \nbiscuits and fruit in staff kitchenettes, and tampons in the toilets. The tampon question was especially popular, with \n184 likes.\nA Fortescue spokesman assured us that those essentials were on the way back, with an alternating roster between \nfruit and biscuits. Tampon dispensers are also in the works.\nSome of the questions have a lot more edge. A common theme in many submissions has been frustration at \nFortescue's diversity policies. The company has been an industry leader in improving diversity within its workforce \nand is one of the few ASX20 companies to publicly stand by its approach since Donald Trump's anti-inclusion push.\nYet many of the questions posed on the Ask Us Anything portal suggested that women and ethnic minorities were \nwinning promotions undeservedly. Those questions have upset some staff.\nLoad-Date: February 7, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
