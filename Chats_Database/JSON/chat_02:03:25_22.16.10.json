The company had been consistently increasing shareholder payouts since 2016, but due to financial struggles, it has decided to halt these payments to focus on investments without raising additional capital. This move could negatively impact investor confidence and stock performance, as dividends are a key attraction for shareholders. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company has suffered a major financial setback, reporting an EBITDA of 18.7 billion Danish kroner (\u20ac2.5 billion) for 2023, which is below its projected range of 20-23 billion kroner. A significant portion of this shortfall is attributed to a 9.6 billion kroner provision for cancellation costs related to the termination of the Ocean Wind 1 project in the U.S. This financial underperformance highlights the challenges \u00d8rsted faces in managing its offshore wind projects profitably. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has decided to cut its renewable energy project targets by at least 24%, reducing its planned capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This reduction signals a retreat from its previous ambitious expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The company is also exiting several emerging offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, limiting its future growth opportunities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company is implementing significant job cuts, with up to 800 positions being eliminated globally. The first phase will see 250 layoffs in the coming months. These job losses reflect the financial strain \u00d8rsted is under and could have negative social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s market capitalization has plummeted by more than 70% since its peak in early 2021, when it was valued at over \u20ac76.5 billion. The company, once the third-largest utility in Europe, now ranks 14th in the sector, with a market value of just \u20ac16 billion. This dramatic decline underscores the financial instability and investor concerns surrounding the company. [El Economista, Violeta N. Qui\u00f1onero, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has incurred massive financial losses, posting around \u00a32.2 billion in losses for 2023. The company has also written off \u00a33.3 billion from its wind farm business, reflecting the severe financial difficulties it faces. These losses are largely due to the abandonment of several offshore wind projects in the U.S., which resulted in billions in impairments. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s financial struggles have forced it to scale back offshore wind projects, which could result in the construction of 1,500 fewer wind turbines than originally planned. This reduction in capacity could slow the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure and impact global climate goals. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, is stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company\u2019s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company has faced significant challenges in the U.S. market, particularly in securing tax credits for its offshore wind projects. Last year, \u00d8rsted canceled two major offshore wind projects, Ocean Wind I and II, due to rising costs, resulting in a financial hit of 28.4 billion Danish kroner (\u00a33.3 billion). These cancellations highlight the financial and regulatory difficulties of expanding renewable energy in the U.S. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for the company to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s financial troubles have led analysts to speculate that it may need to seek additional funding from investors. However, instead of raising capital, \u00d8rsted has opted for cost-cutting measures, which could prolong financial uncertainty and increase risks for the company\u2019s future stability. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to implement a drastic austerity plan, including a comprehensive review of its project portfolio. The company is prioritizing projects with the highest potential returns while reducing risks in development and execution. This shift in strategy indicates a retreat from aggressive expansion and a more cautious approach to investment. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024]\n\n- The company\u2019s decision to exit key offshore wind markets, including Spain, Portugal, and Norway, as well as to deprioritize certain activities in Japan, represents a significant contraction of its global footprint. This retreat could weaken its competitive position in the rapidly growing offshore wind sector. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024] - \u00d8rsted has suffered a massive financial loss, reporting a net loss of 2.7 billion euros for 2023. This marks a significant downturn from the previous year when the company had recorded a profit of approximately 2 billion euros. The losses stem largely from the cancellation of major offshore wind projects in the U.S., including Ocean Wind 1 and 2, which resulted in impairments of 3.8 billion euros. Additionally, the company has set aside 1.5 billion euros in provisions for potential compensation payments related to these canceled projects. This financial instability raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to sustain its aggressive expansion strategy in the renewable energy sector. [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to implement drastic cost-cutting measures, including the elimination of 600 to 800 jobs worldwide. This decision is part of a broader austerity plan aimed at reducing fixed costs by 130 million euros by 2026. The job cuts will have significant social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities, further highlighting the financial strain the company is under. [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]\n\n- The company has announced a suspension of dividend payments until at least 2025, a move that could negatively impact investor confidence. \u00d8rsted had previously been a reliable dividend payer, making this decision a major shift in its financial strategy. The suspension reflects the company\u2019s urgent need to preserve capital amid mounting financial losses, but it may also deter investors who rely on dividends for returns. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s market value has plummeted by 70% over the past three years, reflecting a severe loss of investor confidence. The company, once a leader in the offshore wind sector, has seen its stock price decline sharply due to financial struggles, project cancellations, and rising costs. This decline in market capitalization raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s long-term viability and its ability to attract new investments. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]\n\n- The company has been forced to scale back its renewable energy ambitions, reducing its planned offshore wind capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This represents a significant retreat from its previous expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The reduction in capacity means fewer wind turbines will be built, potentially impacting the broader offshore wind industry. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has exited several key offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, as part of its cost-cutting strategy. This retreat limits the company\u2019s future growth opportunities and weakens its competitive position in the rapidly expanding offshore wind sector. The decision to withdraw from these markets reflects the financial pressures \u00d8rsted is facing and its need to focus on more profitable projects. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024]\n\n- The company has incurred significant financial losses due to the cancellation of major offshore wind projects in the U.S. The abandonment of Ocean Wind 1 and 2 alone resulted in a financial hit of 3.7 billion euros. These cancellations were driven by rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and higher interest rates, which made the projects financially unviable. The failure to complete these projects raises concerns about \u00d8rsted\u2019s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. [de Volkskrant, Marc van Den Eerenbeemt, February 08, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles have forced it to sell off assets worth 15 billion euros in an effort to stabilize its balance sheet. This asset divestment strategy indicates the severity of the company\u2019s financial difficulties and its need to generate liquidity. However, selling off key assets could weaken \u00d8rsted\u2019s long-term growth potential and reduce its influence in the offshore wind sector. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]\n\n- The company has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have significantly increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for \u00d8rsted to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively.

Stonepeak will receive 80% of the cash distributions, while \u00d8rsted continues to operate the \nportfolio. \u00d8rsted, retaining a unilateral call option, plans to recycle capital for future renewable energy projects. The \ndeal underscores \u00d8rsted's flexible approach to divestments and capital redeployment.\nThe wind farms include Ford Ridge Wind (Illinois), Helena Wind, and Western Trail Wind (Texas), and Sunflower \nWind (Kansas), collectively providing 957 MW across ERCOT, MISO and SPP markets. All projects have \noperational power purchase agreements. \u00d8rsted manages the partnership and offers asset management services.\nDavid Hardy, EVP and CEO of Region Americas at \u00d8rsted, highlighted the deal's significance in delivering value to \ninvestors and funding projects aligning with \u00d8rsted's growth in the renewable energy sector. The divestment allows \n\u00d8rsted to maximize capital redeployment while maintaining operational control and long-term flexibility.\nStonepeak's View: Anthony Borreca, Senior Managing Director at Stonepeak, expressed confidence in \u00d8rsted's US \nonshore assets, emphasizing their potential positive impact on communities. Stonepeak, with approximately \nUSD61.1bn in assets under management, aims to contribute to the energy transition through strategic investments \nin hard-asset businesses.\nPage 2 of 2\n~rsted divests stake in US onshore wind farms to Stonepeak in USD300m deal\nThe value of the deal is approximately USD300m, with \u00d8rsted having previously raised USD700m in tax equity \nproceeds for the portfolio. The transaction aligns with \u00d8rsted's farm-down approach, optimizing capital utilization \nfor future projects.\n\u00d8rsted's extensive portfolio, comprising nearly 6 GW of onshore wind, solar, and battery storage projects in the US, \ncontributes to the company's vision of a world running entirely on green energy. The renewable energy giant \nmaintains its position as a global leader in climate action, evident through its validated science-based net-zero \nemissions target.\nHeadquartered in Denmark, \u00d8rsted had a revenue of DKK 79.3bn (EUR10.6bn) in 2023.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul  will be on Long \nIsland Thursday to announce that the turbines are delivering clean power to the local electric grid. Interior Secretary \nDeb Haaland  is expected to attend. \nAchieving commercial scale is a turning point for the industry, but what's next? Experts say the nation needs a \nmajor buildout of this type of clean electricity to address climate change. \nOffshore wind is central to both national and state plans to transition to a carbon-free electricity system. The Biden \nadministration has approved six commercial-scale offshore wind energy projects, and auctioned lease areas for \noffshore wind for the first time off the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico coasts. New York picked two more projects last \nmonth to power more than 1 million homes. \nThis is just the beginning, Hochul said. She said the completion of South Fork shows that New York will \naggressively pursue climate change solutions to save future generations from a world that otherwise could be \ndangerous. South Fork can generate 132 megawatts of offshore wind energy to power more than 70,000 homes. \n\u201cIt\u2019s great to be first, we want to make sure we\u2019re not the last. That\u2019s why we\u2019re showing other states how it can be \ndone, why we're moving forward, on to other projects,\u201d Hochul told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview \nbefore the announcement. \n\u201cThis is the date and the time that people will look back in the history of our nation and say, \u2018This is when it \nchanged,\u2019\u201d Hochul added.\nPage 2 of 2\nThe United States has its first large offshore wind farm, with more to come\n\u00d8rsted CEO Mads Nipper called the opening a major milestone that proves large offshore wind farms can be built, \nboth in the United States  and in other countries with little or no offshore wind energy currently. \nWith South Fork finished, \u00d8rsted and Eversource are turning their attention to the work they will do offshore \nbeginning this spring for a wind farm more than five times its size. Revolution Wind will be Rhode Island and \nConnecticut\u2019s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes next year. \nThe site where the cable will connect in Rhode Island is already under construction.\nIn New York, the state said last month it would negotiate a contract with \u00d8rsted and Eversource for an even larger \nwind farm, Sunrise Wind, to power 600,000 homes. The Norwegian company Equinor was picked for its Empire \nWind 1 project to power more than 500,000 New York homes. Both aim to start providing power in 2026. \nAfter years of planning and development, 2024 is a year of action\u2014 building projects that will deliver sizeable \namounts of clean power to the grid, said David Hardy, group executive vice president and CEO Americas at \n\u00d8rsted.\n\u00d8rsted, formerly DONG Energy, for Danish Oil and Natural Gas, started aggressively building wind farms off the \ncoast of Denmark, the U.K. and Germany in 2008. The company sold off the North Sea oil and gas assets on which \nit had built its identity to focus on clean energy, becoming \u00d8rsted. It\u2019s now one of the biggest wind power \ndevelopers.\nThe first U.S. offshore wind farm was supposed to be a project off the coast of Massachusetts known as Cape \nWind. A Massachusetts developer proposed the project in 2001. It failed after years of local opposition and \nlitigation. \nTurbines began spinning off Rhode Island\u2019s Block Island as a pilot project in 2016. But with just five of them, it\u2019s not \na commercial-scale wind farm.\nLast year brought challenges for the nascent U.S. offshore wind industry, as \u00d8rsted and other developers canceled \nprojects in the Northeast that they said were no longer financially feasible. High inflation, supply chain disruptions \nand the rising cost of capital and building materials were making projects more expensive as developers were trying \nto get the first large U.S. offshore wind farms opened. \nIndustry leaders expect 2024 to be a better year, as interest rates come down and states ask for more offshore \nwind to meet their climate goals. \nThe nation's second large offshore wind farm, Vineyard Wind, is expected to open later this year off the coast of \nMassachusetts, too. The first five turbines are providing power for about 30,000 homes and businesses in \nMassachusetts. When all 62 turbines are spinning, they'll generate enough electricity for 400,000 homes and \nbusinesses. Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners are the joint owners of that project.\nThe Biden administration wants enough offshore wind energy to power 10 million homes by 2030. Interior Secretary \nHaaland said in a statement that \"America\u2019s clean energy transition is not a dream for a distant future\u2014 it's \nhappening right here and now.\u201d \n___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private \nfoundations.

Increasingly, \nthese are getting paired with solar and wind projects, like in Arizona. The agencies that run electric grids, utility \ncompanies and developers of renewable energies say combining technologies is essential for a green energy \nfuture. \nBatteries  allow renewables to replace fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, while keeping a steady flow of power when \nsources like wind and solar are not producing. For example, when people are sleeping and thus using less \nelectricity, the energy produced from wind blowing through the night can be stored in batteries \u2014 and used when \ndemand is high during the day. \nJuan Mendez, a resident of Tempe, Arizona, gets power from local utility Salt River Project, which is collaborating \nwith \u00d8rsted on the Eleven Mile Solar Center. As a state senator, Mendez pushed SRP to move to renewable \nenergies.\nHe thinks the power company is still investing too much in gas and coal plants, including a major expansion \nplanned for a natural gas plant in Coolidge, Arizona, near the solar center.\nPage 2 of 3\nAcross the US , batteries and green energies like wind and solar combine for major climate solution\n\u201cThis solar-plus-storage is a good step, but SRP needs to do more to provide clean energy and clean up our air and \nhelp address climate change,\" Mendez said. \nThe utility said it\u2019s adding more renewables to its energy mix and recently pledged to zero out its emissions by \n2050. \nThe U.S. has the second most electrical storage in the world, after China. In 2023, the U.S. added an estimated 7.5 \ngigawatts \u2014 62% more than in 2022, according to the BloombergNEF and the Business Council for Sustainable \nEnergy factbook. That amount can power 750,000 homes for a day and brings the total amount of installed capacity \nnationwide to nearly enough for 2 million homes for one day, according to BloombergNEF.\nIn the U.S., California  leads in energy storage as it aggressively cuts greenhouse gas emissions. It has twice as \nmuch as any other state. Residential, commercial and utility-scale battery installations increased by 757% there \nover just four years, meaning there's now enough to power 6.6 million homes for up to four hours, according to the \nCalifornia Energy Commission. \nThat's partly because in 2013, the California Public Utilities Commission told utilities to buy energy storage with a \ntarget to be met by 2020. Since then, power companies have continued to add more batteries to help the state meet \nclean electricity requirements. \nSouthern California Edison is one utility adding thousands of hours of energy storage. It is putting in solar-plus-\nbatteries to replace some power plants that burn natural gas and would typically supply electricity in the evening. \n\u201cIf it\u2019s just clean and not reliable, you really don\u2019t have anything,\u201d said William Walsh, vice president for energy \nprocurement and management. \u201cWe need both.\u201d\nIn California, batteries proved their value in September 2022, as the West was experiencing a long heat wave that \nsent temperatures into the triple digits. Electricity demand reached the highest the state had ever seen on Sept. 6, \n2022, as people cranked up air conditioners. \nWalsh credits the batteries added to the grid between 2020 and 2022 with helping to avoid blackouts. Two years \nearlier, there were rolling electricity outages in California during a similar extreme heat wave.\nTexas has the second-most battery storage after California. Last month, Schneider Electric  announced it's teaming \nup with energy company ENGIE North America on solar and battery systems in Texas to get closer to the French \nmultinational\u2019s 100% renewable energy goal in the U.S. and Canada. Before the Inflation Reduction Act, a major \nclimate law passed in 2022, the deal and the necessary $80 million investment would not have been possible, said \nHans Royal, Schneider Electric's senior director for renewable energy and carbon advisory. \nRoyal is advising other global Fortune 500 companies it works with to get into the market.\n\u201cThe industry needs that, the grid needs it,\" said Royal. \nBack in Arizona, \u00d8rsted\u2019s Eleven Mile Solar Center covers 2,000 acres in rural Pinal County. It has 857,000 solar \npanels and more than 2,000 cubes that look like large shipping containers but contain battery modules. \u00d8rsted also \nhas large solar and storage projects in Texas and Alabama, and in Europe.\nWhen the Arizona facility opens this summer, most power from the solar farm will go to Facebook owner Meta's \ndata center in Mesa. The solar power not needed by Meta, in addition to the power stored in the batteries, will go to \nthe local utility's customers. The new batteries can ensure power to roughly 65,000 homes during peak hours of \ndemand.\n\u201cWhat I think is exciting is just how rapidly this market is moving,\" said Yayoi Sekine, head of energy storage at \nBloombergNEF. \u201cThere's so much pressure for the U.S. and different regions to decarbonize, and storage is one of \nthe major technologies to enable that. There's a lot of momentum.\" Page 3 of 3\nAcross the US , batteries and green energies like wind and solar combine for major climate solution\n___\nThe Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private \nfoundations.

The company suffered a massive loss of \u20ac2.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to high write-offs from abandoned offshore wind projects on the U.S. East Coast. This leadership shake-up reflects the severity of \u00d8rsted\u2019s financial struggles and raises concerns about stability at the top levels of management. Frequent executive turnover can disrupt strategic planning and investor confidence. [Energie & Management, Volker Stephan, February 27, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted has been forced to divest a significant stake in its U.S. onshore wind farms, selling off equity ownership in four wind farms with a total capacity of 957 MW for approximately $300 million. This marks the company\u2019s second major asset divestment in the U.S., highlighting its need to generate liquidity amid financial difficulties. While \u00d8rsted retains operational control, the sale indicates that the company is struggling to maintain its ambitious renewable energy expansion without offloading assets. Such divestments could weaken its long-term market position in the U.S. renewable energy sector. [Nordic Business Report, Anonymous, March 13, 2024]\n\n- \u00d8rsted and other offshore wind developers faced significant financial challenges in 2023, leading to the cancellation of multiple projects in the U.S. Northeast. High inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising costs of capital and building materials made these projects financially unviable. These cancellations represent a major setback for \u00d8rsted\u2019s U.S. expansion strategy and could slow the overall growth of offshore wind energy in the country. The inability to complete these projects raises concerns about the company\u2019s financial resilience and its capacity to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably.
