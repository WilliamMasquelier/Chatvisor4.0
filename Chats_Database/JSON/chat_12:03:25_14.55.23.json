You'll find that at the heart of Tipo 00 The Pasta Cookbook too.\nLobster risotto with zucchini flowers Ingredients\n1 live or cooked lobster, about 600-800g 1/2 brown onion, finely diced 3 tbsp olive oil 320g carnaroli rice 80ml (1/3 \ncup) dry white wine 60g cold unsalted butter, diced 60g nely grated parmesan 8 female zucchini (courgette) flowers, \nwith baby zucchini attached finely grated zest of 1 lemon squeeze of lemon juice sea salt For the yellow tomato \nbisque\n100g unsalted butter 1 tsp fennel seeds 500g yellow tomatoes, grated on a box grater 1.5 litres (6 cups) fish stock 1 \nsprig of lemon thyme Method\n1. If you're using a live lobster, chill it in the freezer for one hour to \"put it to sleep\". Meanwhile, bring a large \nsaucepan of well-salted water to the boil. Take the lobster out of the freezer, lay it on a chopping board and insert a \nknife between the eyes to kill it, cutting right down through the head. Put the lobster into the boiling water and cook \nfor seven to eight minutes, then take it out and let it cool.\n2. To prepare the lobster, twist and pull the lobster head away from the tail. With kitchen scissors, cut down either \nside of the belly shell and carefully remove the tail meat from the shell. Keep the lobster meat in the fridge and \nreserve the shell (including the head) for the bisque.\n3. For the bisque, take the lobster shell and separate the top part of the head from the bottom. Wash off all the \nimpurities under cold water, then use a heavy knife to break the shell into smaller pieces. Melt the butter in a \nsaucepan over low heat and saute the lobster shells and fennel seeds for about 10 minutes. Add the tomatoes, \nPage 2 of 4\nLearn how to cook Italian from a celebrated Greek chef\nstock and lemon thyme and bring to a simmer, then cover with a lid and cook gently for 45 minutes. Strain the \nbisque through a colander into a clean container, using the back of a ladle or a big wooden spoon to press down on \nthe shells and extract all the juices. Let it cool for 10 minutes and blend with a stick blender until smooth. Pass \nthrough a sieve again, then set aside - you'll need about 1.5 litres (6 cups) of bisque.\n4. To make the risotto, bring 1 litre (4 cups) of the bisque to the boil and keep warm. Place a wide pan over \nmedium-low heat and saute the onion in the olive oil until translucent. Add the rice and lightly toast for two minutes, \nthen season with a pinch of salt. Pour in the white wine and let it evaporate completely. Continue to cook the rice, \nadding the bisque one ladle at a time and stirring every couple of minutes.\n5. When almost all of the bisque has been absorbed, about 15 minutes in, the rice should be 90 per cent cooked. If \nnot, add some more bisque or water and cook it for a little longer - you want the rice to have a good bite without \nbeing crunchy. Now proceed with the \"mantecatura\" (to make the risotto creamy), stirring in the cold butter one \npiece at a time. Once that's done, add the parmesan a handful at a time and keep stirring until the risotto is creamy \nand smooth. If it seems dry, add a little more stock or water. Thinly slice the baby zucchini, saving the flowers for \ngarnish, and stir through the risotto, then add the lemon zest and lemon juice and check for seasoning. Cut the \nlobster in half lengthwise and remove the dark digestive tract. Cut the lobster meat into large chunks and gently \nwarm in the remaining 500ml (2 cups) of the bisque, along with the zucchini flowers. Serve the risotto on warmed \nplates, topped with the lobster and zucchini flowers.\nLuke's wine matches\nA decadent seafood risotto with earthy notes calls for an equally powerful wine. Think lean, flinty chardonnay from \nChablis, or richer vintages from Puligny Montrachet and Chassagne Montrachet. Of course there are alternatives to \nburgundy - try whites from the Collio region of north-eastern Italy, bordering Slovenia, or seek out a cool-climate \nVictorian or Tasmanian chardonnay.\nServes 4\nPappardelle with braised wagyu and confit chilli Ingredients\n225g quality dried pappardelle - or 1/2 quantity master pasta dough, rolled out to 3mm thickness, then cut into strips \n30cm long and 2cm wide, lightly dusted with semolina flour For the braised beef\n750g beef neck or shin, trimmed of the majority of excess fat and cut into 6-8cm chunks 2.5 tbsp olive oil 1 small \nbrown onion, diced 2 cloves of garlic, crushed 1 small bay leaf 1 sprig of rosemary 2 sprigs of thyme 2 sprigs of \nsage 200ml dry white wine 400g tin of peeled tomatoes, preferably Italian sea salt and freshly ground pepper For \nthe confit chilli\n100g shallots, finely diced 75ml vegetable oil or olive oil 50g long red chillies, coarsely chopped into 1cm pieces \n40g tomato paste (concentrated puree) To finish\n50g unsalted butter 1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely chopped 30g (1/3 cup) finely grated parmesan Method\n1. Preheat the oven to 150 to 160&#xB0;C (300 to 315&#xB0;F) fan-forced. For the braised beef, season the meat \nwith salt and pepper. Place a heavy-based saucepan over medium heat and saute the meat in the olive oil until \ngolden brown on all sides, then transfer to an ovenproof braising pan. Next add the onion, garlic and herbs to the \nsaucepan and cook for four to five minutes until the onion is soft and translucent. Pour in the wine and stir to \ndeglaze, then simmer until reduced by half. Add the tomatoes, bring to a simmer and season with salt.\n2. Pour the contents of the saucepan over the beef, cover really tightly with foil and cook in the oven for 2.5 to three \nhours, or until the meat is falling apart. Meanwhile, make the confit chilli. In a very small heavy-based saucepan, \nsweat the shallot with a third of the oil for about three to four minutes until soft. Add the chillies and tomato paste \nand cook for one more minute, then add the remaining oil, season with salt and cook on the lowest possible heat \nfor 20 to 30 minutes - the time needed will depend on how low the heat on your stove goes. When it's ready, it \nshould have a relish-like consistency.Page 3 of 4\nLearn how to cook Italian from a celebrated Greek chef\n3. Let the meat cool down in the ragu, then lift it out and break it down into smaller, bite-size pieces. Remove the \nherb stalks from the ragu and discard. Return the meat to the ragu and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. Cook the \npappardelle in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, according to the instructions on the package for dried, or \nabout three to four minutes for fresh.\n4. To finish, put a third of the ragu into a large frying pan and bring to a simmer, then stir in the butter 2 to 3 \ntablespoons of the confit chilli, depending on how hot the chillies are. Drain the pasta and toss with the ragu in the \nfrying pan for one minute, adding the parsley and most of the parmesan. Taste for salt and toss again until the ragu \nthickens and coats the pasta. Serve in warmed bowls, finishing with the remaining parmesan.\nServes 2\nRigatoni pomodoro Ingredients\n5 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to serve 1 small clove of garlic, finely grated 200ml Napoli tomato sauce (see below) \n225g quality dried rigatoni 2 tbsp finely grated parmesan 4-5 basil leaves Method\n1. Warm the olive oil in a pan over medium-low heat, add the garlic and cook gently until the garlic has just \nsoftened but not coloured. Add the tomato sauce and bring to a slow simmer.\n2. In the meantime, cook the rigatoni in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, according to the instructions on \nthe package. Drain the pasta (reserving some of the pasta water) and add to the sauce, then toss everything \ntogether for 30 seconds until the pasta is well coated. Add the parmesan and basil and toss a couple more times, \nadding a little of the reserved pasta water to adjust the consistency of the sauce, if needed. Serve in warmed bowls \nand finish with a drizzle of olive oil.\nServes 2\nNapoli tomato sauce\nIngredients\n80ml (1/3 cup) olive oil 1 brown onion, finely diced 2 cloves of garlic, crushed 3 x 400g tins of peeled tomatoes, \nideally San Marzano basil leaves from 2-3 sprigs sea salt Method\nHeat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat, then add the onion and garlic and cook until soft and \ntranslucent, around six to eight minutes. Add the tomatoes and stir well, then bring to a slow simmer. Turn the heat \ndown to low and cook for one hour, stirring occasionally to make sure the sauce doesn't catch on the bottom. Taste \nand season with salt, then take off the heat and let the sauce rest for 15 minutes before you add the basil. We \nnormally pass this sauce through a vegetable mill while it's still hot. If you don't have one, you can just use a whisk \nto crush the tomatoes - don't be tempted to blitz the sauce with a blender, or you'll lose its pleasingly rustic texture.\nSpaghetti with king prawns and cavolo nero Ingredients\n4 large or extra-large king prawns, 400 to 500g in total 150g cavolo nero (Tuscan kale) 225g quality dried spaghetti \n- or 1/2 quantity master pasta dough (cut into strips 30cm long and 2mm wide) olive oil sea salt For the sauce\n50ml olive oil prawn heads and shells (from preparing the prawns) 1 sprig of thyme 1 sprig of sage 300ml Napoli \ntomato sauce (see above) To finish\n1 large clove of garlic, finely chopped 1/2 long red chilli, finely chopped, or more to taste 100ml dry white wine \nsqueeze of lemon juice fennel fronds, to garnish - optional Method\n1. To prepare the prawns, take the head off the body, remove the livery parts under cold running water and reserve \nthe head for the sauce. Peel the shell off the body, leaving only the tail segment, then remove the dark digestive \ntract that runs the length of the body. Reserve the shells for the sauce as well.Page 4 of 4\nLearn how to cook Italian from a celebrated Greek chef\n2. For the sauce, place a saucepan over medium heat, add half the olive oil and the reserved prawn heads and \nshells and cook really well for five to six minutes, stirring so they colour evenly. Add the herbs and Napoli tomato \nsauce and bring to a slow simmer. Add the remaining olive oil, cover the pan with a lid and cook the sauce over the \nlowest possible heat for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn't catch on the bottom. Pass through \na colander with large holes, pushing with the back of a ladle to squeeze the juices out of the prawn heads.\n3. Strip the leaves of the cavolo nero from the stalks and discard the stalks. Wash the leaves and coarsely chop into \nlarge pieces, then blanch in boiling salted water for two minutes. Drain well and set aside. To cook the prawns, \nplace a frying pan over medium-low heat. Season the prawns with salt, drizzle with olive oil and cook for 1 minute \non each side until just cooked. Remove from the pan and keep warm.\n4. To finish, in the same frying pan, briefly saute the garlic and chilli in olive oil. Deglaze with the wine and simmer \nuntil reduced by half, then add the sauce and cavolo nero and bring to a simmer. Season with salt and cook for two \nminutes. In the meantime, cook the spaghetti in plenty of boiling salted water until al dente, according to the \ninstructions on the package for dried, or three to four minutes for fresh.\n5. Drain the spaghetti (reserving some of the pasta water) and add to the sauce. Remove from the heat and toss for \none minute to coat the pasta. Add the lemon juice and season with salt, if needed, then add just enough of the \nreserved pasta water to give you the perfect sauce consistency and toss again. Divide the spaghetti and sauce \nbetween warmed bowls. Briefly return the prawns to the frying pan, just to warm them through in the residual heat \nand coat them with the pan juices. Serve on top of the spaghetti and garnish with fennel fronds, if you like.\nServes 2\nTipo 00 The Pasta Cookbook, by Andreas Papadakis.
