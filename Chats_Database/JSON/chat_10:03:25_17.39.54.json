Please go ahead.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Sigar. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to dial in this morning to our FY '24 \nresults call. Alongside me is Chief Financial Officer, Darren Millman, who will drill down into the financials after I've \ncovered off on the highlights. This morning, we have uploaded to the ASX platform, along with our website a \nPage 2 of 5\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\nnumber of documents, including our FY '24 financial results summary and the presentation, which we'll be largely \nspeaking to you this morning, and also our audited statutory financial report.\nAs mentioned initially discussed the high-level FY '24 results, then Darren will dive into a bit more detail, and then \nwe'll talk about the FY '25 outlook and also the dividend that we announced this morning. Once we have done that, \nthere will also be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions. So, in terms of the presentation, if we only hopefully \ngot that handy, we jump to Slide 3, with our mining and production highlights.\nAlthough we mined less ore tonnes in FY '24 compared to the previous year, the contained gold mined, which is \nwhat counts, was up on the prior year due to a higher mine grade. The primary driver of the lower tonnes was the \ncompletion of mining activities across the Edna May hub, most notably at Tampia, where mining activities were \ncompleted last year.\nIncreased ore from Eridanus and the introduction of Symes offset the stocking tonnes in part. The improved mine \ngrade was driven by 2 factors: increased tonnages and grade from Penny, which reported a mine grade just over 12 \ngrams per tonne for the year, and also a strong performance from Eridanus, which saw open pit tonnages at Mt \nMagnet increased 50%, but at a 60% higher grade than the prior year. If we move on to our processing activities, \ntonnes milled were up on the prior year, mainly as a result of additional haulage capacity across the Edna May hub.\nPleasingly, this increase in tonnes milled for the group was achieved despite the interruptions to the CV01 conveyor \nrepairs carried out in November, December last year at Mt Magnet. This increased throughput, combined with \nimproved milled grade resulted in a 22% increase in gold production to the record number of 293,000 ounces, \nwhich was at the upper end of our upgraded production guidance for FY '24.\nOn cost sales and sustaining costs as reported in the June quarterly was $15.83 an ounce, which is one of the best \nwithin our industry and something we're pretty proud of here at Ramelius. It is also most pleasing that we're able to \ndeliver these results with a declining TRIFR or total recordable injury frequency rate across the year and also \nachieved a 12-month LTI-free milestone in May 2024.\nBefore I hand over to Darren, I'd just like to note this is the second year in a row where I've been able to comment \nthat the annual results on just about every metric are an improvement on the prior year. And importantly, these \nresults have not only been driven by the A dollar gold price, but also our low-cost base, which I believe distinguish \nus from our peers, and we do anticipate that the positive results will continue into FY '25. Over to you, Darren.\nDarren Millman\nThanks, Mark. For those following on the presentation, I'll initially speaking to Slide 4. Before moving on to the \ndiscussion of earnings, I'd like to highlight that I will be talking to our underlying earnings. When we refer to \nunderlying earnings, we are essentially backing out the large nonrecurring items in an attempt to communicate what \nwe believe is the most reflective results from our operations for the year and appropriate comparative to the prior \nyear. The main difference between our underlying earnings and our statutory net profit after tax earnings for the \ncurrent year relates to acquired tax losses.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nIn our underlying earnings, we removed the tax benefit of $23.9 million associated with the recognition of tax losses \nthat was acquired as part of the Musgrave and Brake acquisitions made in FY '23 and early FY '24, respectively. Of \nthis, $14.6 million remains on our balance sheet for utilization on future periods. Indeed, since FY '19, Ramelius \nhas acquired tax losses over the years to the tune of $24.5 million. This is a true realized savings in cash tax \npayment savings.\nLastly, before moving on to the financials, we have for reference, provided a few appendices in this presentation, \nwhich reconciles the underlying earnings and cash flow for the statutory reports for the financial statements.Page 3 of 5\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\nI trust you'll find this useful. As a reminder for FY '24, the company achieved record production, record earnings, \nrecord cash flow and a record dividend with the backdrop, happy to discuss the numbers in a little bit more detail. \nWe achieved a top line revenue of $882.6 million, which was 40% up from the prior year with gold sales of 293,966 \nounces at a realized price of 2,995 per ounce, a 16% increase on the prior year.\nThe increased revenue was not only due to higher gold price, which added $119 million, but also increased gold \nproduction, which added $131 million when compared to FY '23. EBITDA of $462.2 million was up 67% on the prior \nyear and represents a margin of 52%, a $1,573 per ounce sold.\nOn both metrics, we continue to be at the top of our peer group. Net profit after tax of $200.3 million was up 166% \non prior year, with earnings being driven by improved grades, with lower cost of production per ounce and a strong \ncurrency of AU gold price. Statutory earnings per share of $19.5 were up 181% on the prior year. Further analysis \non EBITDA can be found on Slide 6, which shows the positive trend from H1 to H2 with the EBITDA margin \nincreasing 40% in H1 to 60% in H2.\nIn addition to this, the earnings profile for Mt Magnet and Edna May can be seen with Mt Magnet being the clear \ndriver in earnings recording EBITDA margin of 79% in H2.\nLooking at Mt Magnet in isolation on Slide 7 shows EBITDA margin for FY '24 of 2,121 per ounce. This earning \ncapacity of Mt Magnet bodes well for the future with the production center poised of further growth in FY '25.\nThis will be driven by increased production from Penny, the introduction of Q and the exciting upside potential from \nEridanus to be open pit or underground. Indeed, we see FY '25 as another very strong year of cash build and \nearnings. It's worth highlighting in FY '25, we are guiding to a 50% increase in production at the Mt Magnet hub.\nMoving to cash. We believe it is important -- one of the most important financial measures of our business, and \nSlide 8 and 9, you will see our key cash metrics. Our operating cash flow for the year was $445 million or 1,515 per \nounce. Investing cash flow totaled $242.7 million, which includes investments into our existing business for plant \nequipment, mine development and exploration of $123.1 million, our acquisition of Musgrave and our strategic \ninvestment in Spartan.\nThe free cash flow being the net of operating and investing cash flow was $212.1 million after returning $17.3 \nmillion to shareholders via our FY '23 dividend and lease payments, total cash inflow for the year was $173.3 \nmillion.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nOur low-cost production, coupled with our strong Australian gold price resulted in Ramelius returning $315.8 million \nin underlying free cash flow for FY '24. Once again, one of the best returns amongst our peers. The resulting cash \nand gold at the end of the year was $446.6 million. Turning now to Slide 10 and our cash balance sheet, which we \nconsider to be one of our key strengths. Our cash and gold bullion on hand are complemented with a further 65,000 \nounces of gold contained in current stockpiles and within circuit, which we will monetize in the coming 12 months, \nleaving Ramelius with excellent liquidity.\nIn addition to this, in July, we executed a new finance facility for $175 million, which is an upsized replacement of \nour previous $100 million facility. Facility was undrawn at the reporting date remains as of the same to this day. As \nwe mentioned in the past, we're in the process of progressively reducing our hedge book, which at 30 June 2024, \nsat at 155,000 ounces at an average price of $3,081 per ounce. The only new hedging put in place recently was \nthat we put hedges of 41,500 ounces at Edna May production out to January 2025, ensuring that the cost will not be \nsold below 3,400 per ounce, locking in meaningful cash flow from the remaining Edna May stockpiles. With that, I'll \nhand it back to Mark.\nMark ZeptnerPage 4 of 5\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\nThanks, Darren. So, if we can jump to Slide 11 to 13 now touching on our portfolio and guidance for FY '25. On gold \nproduction, you will see we expect a higher margin that Magnet operation to make up a higher proportion of gold \nproduction with Edna May to be placed in care and maintenance once the existing stockpiles across that hub are \nprocessed. Overall, group production for FY '25 is expected to be comparable to FY '24. Our all-in sustaining cost is \nalso expected to be largely in line with FY '24, but with a higher gold price, which we have assumed at $3,500 per \nounce as per the chart on Slide 12, plus our existing hedge book, will see us deliver some 92,000 ounces at $29.45 \nper ounce in FY '25.\nWe'll see a further increase in cash margins. Production and the result in lower all-in sustaining cost is expected to \nbe weighted to H2 of FY '25. And finally, on our guidance for FY '25, I'd like to make 2 points, which we have made \nbefore. Whilst Edna May does have a higher all-in sustaining cost, there is approximately $500 an ounce of this -- \nthat relates to noncash drawdowns of existing stockpiles. And secondly, we are expecting a notable reduction in our \ngrowth capital spend in FY '25, particularly in the second half.\nWith the development of leveraging off in the first half, leveraging off our existing Magnet plant, infrastructure, such \nas airstrips and camps, realizing true regional synergies there. We like to think we have a good reputation in the \nmarket for doing what we say and delivering on our promises. We see no reason for this not to continue into FY '25 \nand also look forward to presenting a revised Mt Magnet mine plan in the new year once we have the optimal \ndesign for Eridanus open pit or underground. Turning to Slide 14. Perhaps the highlight, our declared dividend for \nFY '24.\nWe're proud of our track record on dividends. And today, we are not only declaring our sixth consecutive dividend \nabout 150% increase in the prior year to $0.05 per share fully franked. This represents a payout ratio of 27% of free \ncash flow. In approving the final dividend, the Board gave consideration to the additional strategic investment in \nSpartan, internal growth opportunities at Eridanus, and potential mill expansions at Mt Magnet as well as potential \ncapital commitment requirements for Rebecca Roe. The dividend represents a yield of 2.6% based on 30 June \nshare price and a total shareholder return over the last 5 years of 21% per annum.\nOur dividend reinvestment plan has now been in place for a couple of years now with last year's participation at \n22%. It is pleasing to see an increasing number of shareholders opting to take up the opportunity to use their \ndividends to purchase additional Ramelius shares. That opportunity will again be available with the price of shares \nto be calculated at a 2% discount to the 10-day VWAP from the date of election. Last year's dividend payment \namounted to $22.3 million in cash and reinvestment this year. The return will be up to $57.2 million, which will be \npaid in October.\nLast slide, moving on to Slide 15, where we're looking at our focus areas, I'll skip to the final 2 areas being \nexploration opportunities and near-term catalysts. We have budgeted to invest another $40 million to $50 million in \nexploration this year, with opportunities at Mt Magnet, Penny and Rebecca Roe areas shaping us having high \npotential to deliver additional resource ounces and further bolstering reserves. There are a number of near-term \ncatalysts that we see, including the progression of drilling at Eridanus and Galaxy, which will culminate more likely \nin an upgraded Mt Magnet mine plan.\nIn addition to this, we look forward to providing updated mineral resource inventory for Roe, and ultimately, the \npublication of the associated PFS for the combined Rebecca Roe project. That concludes the presentation.\nI'll now hand back to the operator, Sigar, you can open the line for questions, please.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Paul Kaner from Ord Minnett.Page 5 of 5\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\nPaul Kaner\nCouple here, if I may. So firstly, on tax, thanks for giving that income tax guidance for FY '25. But how should we \nthink about cash tax paid for FY '24?\nDarren Millman\nYes. Thanks, Paul. As I noted in the numbers there, we had that advantage in 2024, in 2025 -- or 2025 and beyond, \nwe serve approximately $25 million available. In 2025, we're probably expecting around $15 million to have a \nsimilar tax cash benefit is our expectations for 2025.\nPaul Kaner\nYes, that's great. And then maybe one for you, Mark. Just on capital returns. I think your payout was about 27% of \nfree cash flow and your policy allows for up to 30%. I guess, any thoughts on changing this policy?\nOr are you sort of happy capping at 30% and then, I guess, using the remainder of the free cash flow on sort of \norganic and inorganic opportunities?\nMark Zeptner\nYes. We obviously had a lengthy discussion at Board level. To summarize, we're happy with our policy. We didn't \nquite go all the way to 30%. But we like -- we have got a number of internal projects coming up.\nAnd we felt that we struck a balance between returns to shareholders and providing cash for those projects.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand back to Mr. Zeptner for closing \nremarks.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Sigar. I can't remember the last time we only had one question, but we must have covered everything. \nSo, to wrap up, just 3 points, a record year for earnings and cash generation in FY '24 for Ramelius, a similarly \nstrong outlook for FY '25 and beyond. And a $0.05 fly-free dividend announced today being the sixth consecutive \nyear of dividend payments, a 150% increase on the prior year with over $130 million potentially returned to \nshareholders. Thank you all for listening in today. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating.

Please go ahead.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Travis. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to dial in this morning. In addition to the \nquarterly report, we've also released a presentation that we'll largely speak to during the call. Both documents have \nbeen uploaded on the ASX platform and will be available on the website shortly.\nPage 2 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nOnce again, I'm joined by our CFO, Darren Millman. Darren will provide some detail on the financials after I've run \nthrough the highlights and touched on the operational performance and our development projects. As always, there \nwill be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions at the end.\nFor those who have downloaded the presentation deck, I'll be initially speaking to Slide 3. I'll focus on the highlights \nand key achievements for the quarter. I would like to point out that there is a large amount of detail on exploration, \noperations and project development within the quarterly report itself.\nSo on Slide 3, operationally and financially, the December quarter was exceptionally strong, with the business \ngenerating a record and also sector-leading AUD 174.5 million in underlying free cash flow. After considering our \nadditional investment in Spartan during the quarter of AUD 68 million and the payment of our FY '24 AUD 0.05 per \nshare dividend, our closing cash and gold position was just over AUD 500 million.\nOur quarterly gold production was 85,311 ounces, which was a 37% increase on the prior quarter, noting also just \nshy of our record production, which occurred in the March 2024 quarter. The increase in production was mainly due \nto the introduction of ore from Cue, which performed extremely well during the quarter and also improved grades \nfrom Penny. I'll talk to these points in more detail shortly.\nLooking at the costs, we saw a 25% decrease in our all-in sustaining costs down to AUD 1,491 for the quarter. Now \nwhilst we were guiding for a reduction in all-in sustaining costs across the year, the all-in sustaining cost for the \nquarter was below our expectations and obviously benefited from the outperformance of Cue. Importantly, our \nguidance for FY '25 remains unchanged at 270,000 to 300,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of AUD 1,500 to \nAUD 1,700 an ounce.\nWhilst we are encouraged by the indicative overperformance of Cue grades, it is still relatively early days, and we \nwill continue to assess this during the March quarter as more data becomes available as mining and milling \nprogresses.\nUnfortunately, during the quarter, we did record our first LTI since May 2023. Whilst this is extremely disappointing, \nthe incident itself, which is detailed in the quarterly report, was not of a serious nature. We do strive to ensure that \nall employees and contractors remain healthy -- safe and healthy under our watch. The total recordable injury \nfrequency rate, or TRIFR, at the end of December was 8.33, which was only marginally higher than that recorded \nlast quarter.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nThere were several milestones and advancements in our key projects across the quarter with haulage to [Cue] \ncommencing mid-November following the completion of the Great Northern Highway intersection upgrade and also \ndelivery of the Rebecca Roe PFS, which is demonstrating strong economic returns.\nFor the immediate future, our focus is on delivery of the Eridanus and Mt Magnet mill upgrade studies and \nassociated mine plan in this quarter and the Rebecca Roe DFS, which is targeting a final investment decision in the \nSeptember quarter. Exploration and resource definition activities during the quarter were largely focused on \nEridanus, Penny West and the Lena pit at Cue.\nOn Slide 4, I will draw your attention on -- sorry, we're looking here at the quarterly production breakdown for the \nlast 12 months. If you look at the yellow Mt Magnet bars, you can see the previous September quarter, we focused \nlargely on the development of Cue. And now we see that asset in production, along with improved grades at Penny, \nhas been the main driver of increased production in the December quarter. As expected, Edna May production is \nslowly winding down.\nOn to Slide 5, which references quarterly production stats. The standout here is the mine grade for the quarter of \n7.3 grams per tonne, which is more than double that of the September quarter and has been driven once again by \ngrades at Cue and Penny, which were 7.4 and 17.9 grams per tonne, respectively.Page 3 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nNow whilst the ore tonnes mined reduced, it needs to be highlighted that there still is a fair amount of pre-strip and \ndevelopment taking place at Cue. We expect comparable mined ore tonnes to continue into the March quarter as \nwe progress development before we start to see an increase in these ore tonnes in the June 2025 quarter. Mill \nthroughput levels were maintained during the quarter with the drawdown of existing stockpiles across Edna May \nand also the Eridanus stockpile at Mt Magnet.\nOn to Slide 6, we're showing Mt Magnet's highlights. Production from Mt Magnet totaled just over 67,000 ounces at \nan all-in sustaining cost of AUD 1,277. Open pit mining at Mt Magnet is now solely focused at Cue, with the Break \nof Day, Waratah and White Heat pits all being mined during the quarter. Productivities increased during the quarter \nwith the introduction of a third excavator, which resulted in a 44% increase in material movement quarter-on-\nquarter. Underground operations continue to focus on Galaxy and Penny. At Galaxy, mining was largely in line with \nthe prior quarter, whilst at Penny, both tonnages and grade increased, most notably the mine grade, which is \nattributable to stoping on the 1252 level, which is central to the high-grade plunge of the Penny North load.\nI would also like to highlight, the overall mill grade at Mt Magnet in the quarter was 5.1 grams. This is the highest \ngrade seen under Ramelius ownership at the Mt Magnet mill. It has to be pointed out, the processing team did \nexceptionally well in managing these higher grade of ores with met recovery levels being maintained above 96%.\nBefore I move on from this slide, if I refer you to the pie chart, we only incorporated 20% of the high-grade material \nfrom Cue and Penny into Mt Magnet to generate AUD 161.3 million in cash flow at Mt Magnet, quite amazing, with \nplenty more to come.\nOn to Penny, Slide 7. We mined 48,000 tonnes, average grade of 17.9, as mentioned. We milled 39,000 tonnes at \n20.5 grams and produced a little over 18,000 ounces of gold. The mine itself generated operating cash flow of AUD \n73.1 million at a very nice all-in sustaining cost of AUD 790 per ounce.\nOur exploration last quarter was focused on the Penny West ore body beneath the original pit with some extremely \nhigh-grade hits in this area, as noted on the slide. The drilling to date pretty much confirms the location and \nthickness of this load, with the additional drilling information to be used to refine stoping blocks.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nOn to Cue, Slide 8, the graphic shows the Break of Day pit Starlight load, which is where most of Cue's production \nfrom the -- in the quarter came from. A total of 101,000 tonnes was mined across Cue in the quarter at a grade of \n7.4. However, we were able to selectively stockpile and allow processing to focus on the highest grade material, \nwith 48,000 tonnes being milled at an excellent grade of 15.8.\nThe free cash flow from Cue alone in the quarter after growth capital spend of 4.4 was AUD 56 million and an all-in \nsustaining cost actually below that of Penny of AUD 723 per ounce. The high-quality blend of Penny and Cue has \ngenerated these great results at Mt Magnet this quarter.\nSlide 9 on Edna May. Gold production at Edna May totaled 18,261 ounces in the quarter at an all-in sustaining cost \nof AUD 2,209, which, as you can appreciate, is highly cash generative. And indeed, across operations at Edna May, \nwe reported free cash flow of AUD 32.5 million. The all-in sustaining cost was lower than the previous quarter, with \nthe three carried low-grade stockpiles currently being processed exceeding grade expectations.\nIn our mind, there is no reason to think that this outperformance on grade won't continue through to the end at Edna \nMay. At the end of the quarter, there remained approximately 400,000 tonnes at a grade of 0.8 grams per tonne, \nwhich will provide feed for the Edna May mill through the bulk of the March 2025 quarter.\nSlide 10 on guidance. We note both production cost and also capital guidance for FY '25, where there has been no \nchange since our initial guidance issued in August, and we are tracking well to achieve these targets for FY '25, \nhaving produced a little over 50% of the ounces required in the first half.Page 4 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nSlide 11 doesn't normally appear in our quarterly presentation deck, but I think we needed it in this time around. \nAnd there's probably two key points to make on this slide.\nFirstly, at Penny, we passed an important milestone in the quarter. The operation has effectively paid back our \ninitial investment plus the capital and is effectively AUD 31 million in the black, courtesy of AUD 71 million in free \ncash flow, generated by that operation in the quarter.\nSecondly, if you include stockpiles at the mine, Cue generated AUD 83 million in cash flow in the quarter, which \nrepresents an excellent start to paying back the initial investment in Cue of approximately AUD 206 million. At \ncurrent gold prices, we expect that initial investment to be paid back in the second half of this calendar year.\nThat covers the highlights and operations from me. I'll hand over to you, Darren.\nDarren Millman\nThank you, Mark, and it's a pleasure to be here today. I will be initially speaking to Slide 12. On Slide 12, we show \nfinancial highlights for the quarter.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nFrom a financial point of view, it was an exceptional strong quarter for Ramelius with AUD 174.5 million of free \ncash flow being generated, our best on record by quite a margin. This demonstrates the increasing margins of the \nbusiness, not only due to the gold price, but also improved mill grades. These high cash flow generating ounces will \nnot only continue for the remainder of FY '25, but also into FY '26.\nDuring the quarter, we sold 80,000 ounces at an average realized price of AUD 3,683 per ounce, which included a \nmix of spot and committed forward sales. This results in total sales revenue for the quarter of AUD 295 million. The \nAustralian gold price continues to increase over the quarter, reporting 11% increase from the September 2024 \nquarter. We further unwound our forward contract hedge book, which now sits under 100,000 ounces or less than 6 \nmonths production at an average price of AUD 3,183 per ounce.\nThe all-in sustaining cost for the quarter was AUD 1,491 per ounce, which was down on the prior quarter, mainly \ndue to the impact of stronger grades from Cue and Penny in the quarter. The resulting all-in sustaining cost margin \nof AUD 2,192 per ounce, which is the realized gold price of AUD 3,383 per ounce, less the all-in sustaining cost of \nAUD 1,491; represents an all-in sustaining cost margin of 60%.\nCost guidance for FY '25 remains unchanged at AUD 1,500 to AUD 1,700 per ounce. While this reduction in cost \nwas expected, the overperformance of Cue grades did have an impact on reducing the all-in sustaining costs for the \nquarter.\nAs Mark mentioned earlier, it's early days at Cue. Our geological and operational teams at Mt Magnet are \nperforming their reconciliations of both tonnes and grade that have been mined and milled to date at Cue \nincorporating recent grade control drilling, with final results during the March 2025 quarter.\nLooking at Mt Magnet in isolation, the all-in sustaining cost was AUD 1,277 per ounce. Whilst total cost did increase \nwith the planned maintenance shutdown and increased open pit mining activities, this was more than offset by \nimproved grades and production. At Edna May, the all-in sustaining cost was AUD 2,209 per ounce, which is a \ndecrease from the prior quarter and better than expected with the overperformance of low-grade stockpile grades.\nIn the past, we have made the point that Edna May all-in sustaining cost includes a noncash charge for the \ndrawdown of existing stockpiles. For this quarter and going forward, this was not the case with the mill feed now \nbeing made up of largely low-grade stockpiles, which carry no cost on our balance sheet.\nOn Slide 13 and 14, we show a breakdown of free cash flow metrics for the quarter and historically. Gold sales of \n80,000 ounces generated operational cash flow of AUD 193.6 million and AUD 161.1 million coming from Magnet Page 5 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nand AUD 32.5 million from Edna May. A total of AUD 15.9 million was reinvested into mine development, resource \ndefinition and exploration in the quarter, which focused on Eridanus, Cue and Penny West.\nThe resultant free cash flow for the quarter was AUD 174.5 million or over AUD 2,000 per ounce produced. During \nthe quarter, we had two material cash flows outside operations. Firstly, Ramelius participated in the Spartan capital \nraise, increasing our position to 19.9% with the additional AUD 68 million invested.\nAnd secondly, we paid our FY '24 final dividend of AUD 0.05 per share, which after taking into account our dividend \nreinvestment plan resulted in a cash payment of AUD 43.4 million to our shareholders. The resultant cash and gold \nposition was AUD 501.7 million, which coupled with AUD 175 million debt facility and value of listed investment held \nleaves us with over AUD 1 billion in available liquidity.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nOn Slide 15, we summarized our key focus areas in FY '25. We want to continue to improve safety performance \ngroup-wide and deliver FY '25 guidance in line with our value -- our core value of we deliver and do it safely. We \nwant to complete the Eridanus underground open pit studies, the Mt Magnet processing facility study on mill \nupgrades and also update our Mt Magnet mine plan, which will be delivered in the March quarter.\nAt Roe Rebecca, we combined definite feasibility study to be delivered in the September '25 quarter and increase \nexploration programs at Mt Magnet, Cue, Penny and Rebecca Roe.\nOperator, with that, we'll now open the line for questions, if you could, please.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Alex Barkley from RBC.\nAlex Barkley\nA question on the Cue pits. I get reconciliation is high, and that's a positive. How long do those high-grade pits \nBreak of Day and White Heat last, if you could remind me? And then has that understanding changed at all since \nlast year's integrated Mt Magnet plan?\nMark Zeptner\nAlex, it's Mark. Just looking at the -- I suppose on the Cue, we possibly flagged that we might get a bit of \noutperformance on grade or maybe words to the effect of if we're going to get outperformance anywhere, it will be \nCue, especially in the top parts of the pits. And the reason why we do reconciliation and we do additional work \nbefore jumping to conclusions that the whole camp is going to overperform is because you potentially have \nsupergene enrichment in some areas.\nBut just looking at Break of Day, we've got 130,000 ounces, and White Heat in reserve has got 40,000 ounces. So \nwe should be enjoying these grades. There's higher grades. Obviously, we're mining the highest-grade pits first for \nsome time. But mind you, we are in that oxide zone. How the grades perform in the fresh rock? We're not jumping \nto conclusions on that just yet. But no, we'll be in very good grade at Cue for some time.\nDarren Millman\nAnd just adding to that, Alex, so we're looking to update the Mt Magnet entire plan, so in March. So that will also \nincorporate any changes we feel appropriate in timing of the release of that ore in that plan as well.\nAlex BarkleyPage 6 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nOkay. Just one more question on your quite ample cash and liquidity you called out. Is there any consideration to \nbuying back your hedges? Or would that pend your project studies or potentially approval? Is there just a time \nframe or parameters around how you think around the hedges?\nDarren Millman\nYou thankfully answered my question. So yes, that's right. When we put out the Mt Magnet, obviously, potential \nEridanus larger open pit, we've got the Mt Magnet mill upgrade. And obviously, we've also got the FID decision \naround Rebecca Roe, and that's all coming in the first half of the calendar FY '25.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nSo I think once we have that full picture, then we'll be looking at all capital allocations and obviously, something that \nwe may consider is reducing this hedge book. But at the moment, we're producing margins of over 60% with having \nthis hedge book. So it's not a high priority, but it's definitely something we will look at, but it's coming off pretty quick \nat the back end of this year.\nMark Zeptner\nYes, we're below 100,000 ounces now. But at the moment, we're not currently minded to write a big check and buy \nit out, but we need to see the capital profile for the business, particularly over the next few years, to make good \ndecisions on that, Alex.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] At this time, we're showing no further questions. I'll hand the conference back to Mark for \nany closing remarks.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Travis. One question, some sort of record. 22 minutes past the hour. Everyone must be happy with the \ninformation we've provided. Thank you for listening in. Have a great day, guys.\nLoad-Date: January 29, 2025\nEnd of Document\n  Tone: Positive\n  Sentiment Score: 4\n\n2 most positive Journalist: Stockhead\nAverage Sentiment Score: 4.00\nArticles:\n- Content: Page 1 of 2\nHow to cash in as risk returns\nHow to cash in as risk returns\nThe Australian\nJanuary 13, 2024 Saturday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: WEALTH; Pg. 31\nLength: 659 words\nByline: STOCKHEAD\nBody\nHere are three beneficiaries of a new lower-rates environment Cash is king, right?\nAccording to Davide Bosio, director of corporate finance and West Australian state manager at Shaw and Partners, \nit's certainly had a good run in the sun. Inflation, recessions and stifled economic growth have dominated \ninvestment fundamentals, but given the swift increase of interest rates last year, Bosio reckons investors have been \nable to take advantage of cash as a genuine, no-risk investment class paying more than 5 per cent in some \ninstances.\nBut now there's a whiff of lower rates in the air, we may see investors adjust their asset allocation into higher \nrisk/return sectors.\nBeneficiaries? Bosio likes real estate investment trust funds (REITs) and listed investment companies (LICs) that \nmay have a funding cost (debt profile) that will improve in an environment where rates decline.\nAnd because he's dedicated gold bull, Bosio says the gold sector looks perfectly positioned for strength.\nHere are his three picks for the great unwind: Ramelius Resources: \"Strong balance sheet, new projects being \ndeveloped to drive production and acquisitive team/management who have executed a consistent strategy to \nacquire targets whereby they can leverage discovery success and production ounces.\" WAM Capital: WAM is a \nlisted investment company with a focus on small to medium-sized businesses and a large, diversified portfolio.\n\"Weak performance in the current environment has resulted in a lower share price. However, the yield has been \nhistorically high and a significant attraction to income-focused investors,\" Bosio says.\nCenturia Capital: An REIT with various listed alternatives including office and industrial companies. For Bosio, \nCenturia is a quality small-cap property company with a strong track record of acquiring and managing assets.\nBroker upgrades Ord Minnett likes the look of Dropsuite. Founded in Singapore in 2011, Dropsuite is a cloud-based \nsoftware platform offering back-up, archiving and recovery solutions for businesses.\nPage 2 of 2\nHow to cash in as risk returns\nThe company specialises in protecting critical data used by Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, QuickBooks and \nothers. Its products are distributed via a network of about 4000 IT reseller partners globally.\nAt the Inspire Conference 2023 in August, it copped a bit of a hit when Microsoft provided a first look at its 365 \nBackup and Archive solution. Dropsuite's price fell 22 per cent on the day and has not recovered since.\nOrd Minnett was not convinced. \"Based on our work and discussions with industry participants, we conclude that \nfears of any existential risk to DSE's business are overblown. Accordingly, we believe the market's scepticism is \nproviding an opportunity.\" Ords has initiated a buy rating on the stock with a price target of 33c, against about 28c \nat present.\nOrd Minnett believes DSE operates at the intersection of three mega-trends - the rise of cybercrime, the migration \nof on-premise hosting to the cloud, and managed service provider industry growth.\nIt is also impressed with the fact DSE management has built a $150m business on just $43m of outside capital (of \nwhich only about $18m has been spent), and delivered positive free cash flow in each of the past six quarters.\nOver at Taylor Collison, IPD Groupis on the radar.A distributor of electrical infrastructure products to major \nconstruction and renewables projects nationwide, IPD offers a \"picks and shovel\" exposure to the booming \nelectrical sector without taking on individual project or contract risks common to contractors and other listed players.\nThis is an industry that's booming, and Taylor Collison reckons there's a strong argument we are still in the early \nstages of a major infrastructure project upswing.\nIt's put a 12-month price target of $4.80 on IPD, versus a price of about $4.69 this week. \"Their capital allocation \nrecord is excellent, and there's a long runway to deploy capital to match the market leader's offering,\" it says.\nLoad-Date: January 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n  Tone: Positive\n  Sentiment Score: 4\n",

            "content": "Among the most positive journalists, SA Transcripts stands out due to the overwhelmingly favorable tone in earnings call transcripts, which emphasize Ramelius Resources' financial strength, operational efficiency, and strategic growth. The transcripts highlight record-breaking production, strong cash flow, and disciplined cost management, reinforcing a narrative of consistent success. The language used by company executives, as captured in the transcripts, is highly optimistic, with repeated mentions of \"record earnings,\" \"strong outlook,\" and \"sector-leading\" performance. Additionally, the focus on shareholder returns, including dividends and reinvestment strategies, further enhances the positive sentiment. Compared to other positive coverage, SA Transcripts' reporting is more detailed in showcasing financial achievements and future growth potential, making it the most positive journalist in sentiment scoring. Stockhead also presents Ramelius Resources favorably, particularly by positioning it as a prime beneficiary of a favorable economic environment. The article highlights the company's strong balance sheet, strategic acquisitions, and production growth, reinforcing a bullish outlook. However, Stockhead's coverage is less detailed and lacks the extensive financial performance breakdowns seen in SA Transcripts' earnings call reports, making it slightly less positive in sentiment.\n\nAmong the most negative journalists, Tom Richardson and Susanna Nelson both maintain a neutral tone, but their articles contribute to a lower sentiment score due to the lack of positive framing or emphasis on Ramelius Resources' strengths. Richardson's article mentions Ramelius Resources only in passing, focusing instead on broader market trends and other mining companies. The brief mention of Ramelius entering a trading halt due to a potential acquisition is presented without any positive or negative framing, but the lack of elaboration on potential benefits contributes to a neutral or slightly negative perception. Similarly, Nelson's article discusses Leeuwin Metals' acquisition of a Ramelius Resources asset without highlighting any benefits for Ramelius. The focus is entirely on Leeuwin's growth prospects, making Ramelius appear as a passive seller rather than an active, strategic player. Compared to other journalists, Richardson and Nelson are judged more negative because their coverage either omits positive aspects of Ramelius Resources or presents developments in a way that does not enhance the company's image.",
