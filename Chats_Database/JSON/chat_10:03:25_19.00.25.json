I think things will settle down.\" The comments came just weeks after Dr Forrest \nrejected suggestions the company has faced upheaval and the green agenda has been a catalyst for the exits.\n\"We employ 22,000 people. When you go from a fossil fuel-burning company to a green energy company, you're \ngoing to lose people who say, 'what are you doing? You've got this fantastic economic model. You have the most \nsuccessful company shareholder returns in decades in our company. Why are you fiddling around with it?' \" said Dr \nForrest.\nMr Otranto acknowledged the commitment to renewable energy had been a concern to many within the \norganisation.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue exodus blamed on culture\n\"Eighteen months ago when we announced the pivot into green energy, we were a bit anxious, to be honest,\" said \nMr Otranto.\nFortescue is aiming to capitalise on demand for zero-emission energy sources, but there is broad concern about \nthe capacity of many countries to meet emissions targets as new renewable energy generation projects take longer \nthan expected to materialise. The sluggish transition has fuelled fierce debate about the possibility of nuclear \nenergy.\nIt is currently banned in Australia, but the Coalition has proposed using small modular nuclear reactors to replace \ncoal-fired power.\nThe Coalition insists nuclear power is the only viable means to achieve Australia's 2050 net zero emission targets, \nbut federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen insists independent evidence shows the fuel source remains prohibitively \nexpensive.\nDr Forrest has rejected the nuclear plan, insisting it amounts to \"dividing us with the false hope that we can cling to \nfossil fuels forever\". Echoing his boss, Mr Hutchinson said nuclear power was \"not the answer\", and Australia \nshould instead focus on plentiful opportunities in renewable energy.\nLoad-Date: March 11, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
