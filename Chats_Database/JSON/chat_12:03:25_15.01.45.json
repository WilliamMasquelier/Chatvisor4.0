Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Cisco based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Cisco is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Cisco.\n\nIf Cisco is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nRay Dalio says magnificent seven are 'fairly priced'\nRay Dalio says magnificent seven are 'fairly priced'\nAFR Online\nFebruary 29, 2024 Thursday 9:53 PM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 599 words\nHighlight: While some of Bridgewater's readings look frothy, \"we do not see bubbly conditions in aggregate\", the \nbillionaire hedge fund founder said.\nBody\nRay Dalio says his simple answer for investors asking if US equities overall or the magnificent seven mega-cap \ntechnology stocks in particular are in a bubble is \"no\".\nIn a post on LinkedIn, the billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates said he used six criteria to define a market \nbubble, and while some of the criteria were elevated, most were not.\n\"When I look at the US stock market using these criteria, it - and even some of the parts that have rallied the most \nand gotten media attention - doesn't look very bubbly. The market as a whole is in mid-range (52nd percentile).\"\nLink to Image\nSam Mooy\nCurrent market levels, Mr Dalio also said, \"are not consistent with past bubbles\".\nMr Dalio said the magnificent seven had driven a meaningful share of the gains in US equities over the past year. \nThe market cap of the basket has increased by more than 80 per cent since January last year, and these \ncompanies now constitute more than 25 per cent of the S&P 500 market cap.\n\"The Mag-7 is measured to be a bit frothy but not in a full-on bubble. Valuations are slightly expensive given current \nand projected earnings, sentiment is bullish but doesn't look excessively so, and we do not see excessive leverage \nor a flood of new and na\u00efve buyers. That said, one could still imagine a significant correction in these names if \ngenerative AI does not live up to the priced-in impact.\"\nMr Dalio also said each of the six criteria he used was measured using a number of statistics, adding that he would \nnot detail how his indicator was constructed because that was proprietary.\nGrowth predictions\nStill, Mr Dalio said one key metric was assessing how high prices were relative to traditional measures.\nPage 2 of 2\nRay Dalio says magnificent seven are 'fairly priced'\n\"Looking at the Mag-7, we are reading Alphabet and Meta as somewhat cheap, and Tesla as somewhat expensive. \nWe'd call the group in aggregate fairly priced.\n\"This value read is partly based on analyst expectations for growth, so we are assuming that analysts are making \nreasonable predictions for growth driven by generative AI. This is an area where we have lower confidence \nbecause there is so much inherent uncertainty and because it is not our area of expertise.\"\nMr Dalio also said the indicator looked at whether prices were discounting unsustainable conditions, which \ncalculates the earnings growth rate that is required to produce equity returns in excess of bond returns.\n\"Currently, this indicator is just around the 67th percentile for the aggregate market - more elevated than some of \nour other readings. The earnings growth discounted in stocks is still a bit high.\"\nHowever, Mr Dalio pointed to Nvidia and compared it to Cisco during the dotcom bubble.\n\"Nvidia's two-year forward [price/earnings ratio] is around 27 today, reflecting that, even as the market cap has \ngrown about 10 times, earnings have also grown significantly and are expected to continue to grow over the next \nyear or two because of actual orders that we can validate. During the tech bubble, Cisco's two-year forward P/E hit \n100. The market was pricing in far more speculative/long-term growth than we see today.\"\nMr Dalio said that was generally true for the rest of the mega-cap techs: over the past couple of years, the market \ncap of these companies had grown largely in line with earnings, which had increased rapidly.\n\"Trading in the Mag-7 (based on turnover) remains near all-time highs in dollar terms, but as a share of the total \nmarket cap, it doesn't look like a speculative frenzy,\" he said.\nMr Dalio said in terms of sentiment, another criteria, \"the market is now neutral to slightly positive-not in bubble \nterritory\".\nGraphic\n \nRay Dalio sees no bubbles at current levels.\nLoad-Date: March 3, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Cisco.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
