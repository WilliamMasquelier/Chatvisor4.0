The oil price was meant to soar after the Middle East hostilities erupted, but the rally quickly fizzled \nbefore a late rally.\nThe bitcoin price was meant to either collapse or hit $US100,000, but did neither.\nLithium was mean to soar on the \"stronger for longer\" battery hype, but went flat as a nightman's hat in the last \nmonths of the year.\nMore predictably, the Ukraine war grinds on - and so does Vladimir Putin, who was meant to have been poisoned or \nhave succumbed to cancer or Parkinson's disease. (Alternatively, he has been dead for some time and his role as \nglobal villain has been fulfilled by a body -double.) The hazards of predicting the unpredictable were reflected in \nyour columnist's forgettable small-cap share tips for 2023, which resulted in some steep losses among industrial \npicks such as small retailers and even some sexy battery metal plays.\nBut we did find a winner in Vysarn (ASX:VYS), which provides pumping and aquifer management systems for the \nmining sector (the stock almost -doubled).\nUranium stock 92 Energy(92E) made a late play to lift our averages by agreeing to merge with Canada's Atha Corp, \na deal that sent 92E shares up 24 per cent. We also lucked it with Breaker Resources, taken over by Ramelius \nResources (RMS) at a 40 per cent premium.\nFollowing hours of due diligence with shady broker types at Melbourne's legendary Mitre Tavern, here are our wild \nstabs at glory for 2024.\nAcusensus (ACE) The camera road enforcement mob won't win any plaudits from libertarian motorists, but if they \ncan catch more mobile phone-using idiots then good on 'em, we say. Acusensus operates transportable mobile \nPage 2 of 3\nThe stocks to watch as new year dawns\nphone and seat belt detection cameras, based on its tech that enables the cameras to peep through tinted \nwindows.\nThe company has contracts with NSW, Queensland and ACT road authorities and recently won its first US phone-\nseatbelt contract in North Carolina. Acusensus cites $154m of contracted revenue since being founded in 2018, \nwith $40m of new and varied deals over the last year.\nManagement is vague about the outlook but promises increased revenue this year based on existing contracts. In \n2022-23 Acusensus posted revenue of $42m, up 46 per cent and a slender $400,000 net profit. The past year has \ngone relatively well, with September quarter revenue of $12.1m (up 22 per cent) and $2.9m of operating cash flow. \nAcusensus shares have lost 80 per cent of their value since listing last January. But they've gained about 16 per \ncent in the December half. The company's $100m market cap is supported by cash of $25m.\nCamplify (CHL) Does this sound familiar? Spend $100,000 on a recreational vehicle (RV) for the road trip of a \nlifetime, only for the jalopy to rust in the driveway.\nThe Airbnb of the campervan world, Camplify intermediates renting deals between van owners and users. Its \npremise is that 800,000 privately owned RVs in Australia and most of them sit in the driveway for 46 weeks of the \nyear. A year ago, Camplify acquired the Berlin-based equivalent PaulCamper, adding Germany, Austria and The \nNetherlands to its operations, which already covered the Britain, Spain and New Zealand. The $47m purchase \ndoubled the size of Camplify's business overnight and bolstered its position in specialist insurance products.\nCamplify recorded total transaction value (TTV) of $146m in the year to June 2023, up 172 per cent. Revenue \nclimbed 133 per cent to $38m, with turnover in NZ surging 1100 per cent. Camplify facilitates 81,933 bookings at an \naverage fee of $1733. Camplify's clip of the ticket last year declined to 26 per cent because of the PaulCamper \npurchase but management hopes to get it back over 30 per cent.\nThe site lists 15,000 RVs here and 18,000 in Europe, a fraction of the market relative to van ownership of 790,000 \nhere and 5.6 million on the continent.\nReckon (RKN) Shareholders in the accounting software veteran thought they had their payday when the company \nsold its accountant practice management arm for $100m in mid-2022 - more than the company's market cap at the \ntime.\nIn recent years Reckon has been overshadowed by the likes of \"cloud\" accounting innovator Xero in its traditional \nSME domain. But the company is migrating customers to its own cloud Reckon One platform, which could enhance \nReckon's value as a takeover target. In the meantime, Reckon has expanded into practice management systems \nfor law firms in the US and Britain, which broker Taylor Collison dubs a \"gem in the making\".\nReckon turned over $28m in the first (June) half, for a $4m net profit and a 2.5c per share dividend. The stock \ntrades on a current year multiple of 11 times and a 4.5 per cent yield, fully franked.\nHighcom (HCL) Formerly known as Xtek, ballistics maker Highcom should be shooting the lights out, but its shares \nhave lost more than a third of their value this year.\nHighcom also produces unmanned drones and body armour and helmets, based on its proprietary tech. It has an \nOhio-based ballistics division and the company is in the throes of moving its Adelaide-based R&D division to the \nUS. Highcom generated a record $98m of revenue and made a record $5.7m profit in the 2022-23 year. The recent \nAGM was replete with talk of new contracts - notably with the local Department of Defence - and an overall $375m \npipeline of opportunities \"at various stages\".\nAs with the company's ballistic vests, why have the shares copped such flak? The answer appears to be that \ncracking the US military establishment is a hard grind and sales have not been as good as expected. Inventories \ncrept up to $25.7m from $16.4m previously. By moving to the US, the company hopes to be seen as an apple-pie \nUS supplier. In fact, it must because by law all kit for the US military must be made there.Page 3 of 3\nThe stocks to watch as new year dawns\nDimerix (DXB) Having toiled away at a kidney drug for years, in October the drug developer hit the jackpot with a \npartnering deal for its yet-to-be-approved treatment for the rare disease focal segmental glomerulo-sclerosis \n(FSGS). Dimerix shares popped more than threefold after the news of the deal with Advanz Pharma Corp. The deal \nonly pertains to European and local regions and does not cover the US, so a follow-up deal is expected. And interim \nresults from the key two-year supporting Phase 3 study are slated for March 2024. The outcome, admittedly, is \nbinary: the drug will either be approved or it won't.\n4D Medical (4DX) The lung imaging house had a bonza end to 2023 on the back of contract wins, approvals and \nreimbursement deals in the US.\nThe final stanza was last month's $38.5m purchase of US med tech outfit Imbio, funded by a $35m placement. A \nleader in lung and heart artificial intelligence, Imbio is generating revenue and will expand 4D's product reach \nbeyond its four approved products. 4D's AI and cloud-based tech enables clinicians to detect fine particles in the \nlungs, especially for the millions of US veterans suffering the effects of toxic open-air \"burn pits\" in combat zones \nsuch as Iraq.\nKogan (KGN) The pure-play online retailer's shares have lost about 80 per cent of their value since peaking at \naround $25 in the peak pandemic times of October 2020. The return to normality left Kogan with excess inventory \nand a suspicion the best times were behind Ruslan Kogan's creation, which includes brands such as Kogan Mobile, \nKogan Travel, Kogan Money and Dick Smith.\nBut Kogan's 2022-23 results showed a decent sixfold bounce in underlying earnings, with the inventory position \n\"rightsized\" to $68m. The company also has no debt and cash of $65m to support its $540m valuation.\nAnalysts are tracking the rollout of the Kogan First loyalty program, which has attracted 401,000 subscribers in its \nearly days.\nDicker Data (DDR) Most tech companies pride themselves on cutting-edge innovation and start-ups wear persistent \nlosses as a badge of pride.\nBut for Dicker Data it's a case of sticking with the simple business of selling other parties' hardware and software \nand making money from it. Over 45 years, founder David Dicker has seen all the momentous advances - such as \nthe advent of the PC and the internet - as well as the IT fads. Over that time, the business has rarely failed to \nincrease year-to-year revenue and profitability.\nAumake (AUK) With China-Australia trade relations recovering from a dismal low, some investors are pondering \nhow to ride the theme beyond going long on Treasury Wine Estates (a key beneficiary of a soon-to-be abolished \nwine tariff).\nThe low-key, Parramatta-based Aumake sells products such as health supplements and wool and skincare items \ninto China, through both online and via physical stores. Having closed its 15 Australian stores during the pandemic, \nAumake is seeking to re-establish its local presence.\nAumake posted perkily higher September quarter receipts of $6.4m with cash outflows of $630,000. The company's \nsub $10m market cap reflects plenty of upside - and oodles of risk.\nTim Boreham is a columnist with Stockhead.\nLoad-Date: December 31, 2023\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Tim Boreham\nDate: January 01, 2024\nTitle: The stocks to watch as new year dawns\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: How to cash in as risk returns\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Stockhead\n### Date: January 13, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nHow to cash in as risk returns\nHow to cash in as risk returns\nThe Australian\nJanuary 13, 2024 Saturday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: WEALTH; Pg. 31\nLength: 659 words\nByline: STOCKHEAD\nBody\nHere are three beneficiaries of a new lower-rates environment Cash is king, right?\nAccording to Davide Bosio, director of corporate finance and West Australian state manager at Shaw and Partners, \nit's certainly had a good run in the sun. Inflation, recessions and stifled economic growth have dominated \ninvestment fundamentals, but given the swift increase of interest rates last year, Bosio reckons investors have been \nable to take advantage of cash as a genuine, no-risk investment class paying more than 5 per cent in some \ninstances.\nBut now there's a whiff of lower rates in the air, we may see investors adjust their asset allocation into higher \nrisk/return sectors.\nBeneficiaries? Bosio likes real estate investment trust funds (REITs) and listed investment companies (LICs) that \nmay have a funding cost (debt profile) that will improve in an environment where rates decline.\nAnd because he's dedicated gold bull, Bosio says the gold sector looks perfectly positioned for strength.\nHere are his three picks for the great unwind: Ramelius Resources: \"Strong balance sheet, new projects being \ndeveloped to drive production and acquisitive team/management who have executed a consistent strategy to \nacquire targets whereby they can leverage discovery success and production ounces.\" WAM Capital: WAM is a \nlisted investment company with a focus on small to medium-sized businesses and a large, diversified portfolio.\n\"Weak performance in the current environment has resulted in a lower share price. However, the yield has been \nhistorically high and a significant attraction to income-focused investors,\" Bosio says.\nCenturia Capital: An REIT with various listed alternatives including office and industrial companies. For Bosio, \nCenturia is a quality small-cap property company with a strong track record of acquiring and managing assets.\nBroker upgrades Ord Minnett likes the look of Dropsuite. Founded in Singapore in 2011, Dropsuite is a cloud-based \nsoftware platform offering back-up, archiving and recovery solutions for businesses.\nPage 2 of 2\nHow to cash in as risk returns\nThe company specialises in protecting critical data used by Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, QuickBooks and \nothers. Its products are distributed via a network of about 4000 IT reseller partners globally.\nAt the Inspire Conference 2023 in August, it copped a bit of a hit when Microsoft provided a first look at its 365 \nBackup and Archive solution. Dropsuite's price fell 22 per cent on the day and has not recovered since.\nOrd Minnett was not convinced. \"Based on our work and discussions with industry participants, we conclude that \nfears of any existential risk to DSE's business are overblown. Accordingly, we believe the market's scepticism is \nproviding an opportunity.\" Ords has initiated a buy rating on the stock with a price target of 33c, against about 28c \nat present.\nOrd Minnett believes DSE operates at the intersection of three mega-trends - the rise of cybercrime, the migration \nof on-premise hosting to the cloud, and managed service provider industry growth.\nIt is also impressed with the fact DSE management has built a $150m business on just $43m of outside capital (of \nwhich only about $18m has been spent), and delivered positive free cash flow in each of the past six quarters.\nOver at Taylor Collison, IPD Groupis on the radar.A distributor of electrical infrastructure products to major \nconstruction and renewables projects nationwide, IPD offers a \"picks and shovel\" exposure to the booming \nelectrical sector without taking on individual project or contract risks common to contractors and other listed players.\nThis is an industry that's booming, and Taylor Collison reckons there's a strong argument we are still in the early \nstages of a major infrastructure project upswing.\nIt's put a 12-month price target of $4.80 on IPD, versus a price of about $4.69 this week. \"Their capital allocation \nrecord is excellent, and there's a long runway to deploy capital to match the market leader's offering,\" it says.",
