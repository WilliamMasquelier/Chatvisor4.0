Not only was Hazard -ordered to immediately take down the \noffending tweet, but he was placed under investigation and instructed not to show his face in the office.\nA raft of Jewish employees at the firm raised a riot with executive partner Kristin Stammer and director of culture \nand inclusion Danielle Kelly alleging Hazard had a \"singular and obsessive focus on Israel\" and published posts \nthat displayed the \"classic traits\" of anti-Semitism.\nClearly outraged, and moving quickly to draw a line under the scandal, HSF chair and senior partner Rebecca \nMaslen-Stannage said the leadership council had voted to end Hazard's near-three-decade association with the \nfirm.\n\"The council of Herbert Smith Freehills has resolved today that Damien Hazard should be removed as a partner \nfrom our firm,\" Ms Maslen-Stannage said. \"We have issued him with the relevant notice.\" Numerous HSF clients \nwere privately making their displeasure known to management about the matter, and presumably these hints of \nreputational damage bore no small weight on the council's decision-making. Plus, the timing couldn't have been \nworse: HSF is in the middle of merging with Jewish law firm Kramer Levin, whose bosses in New York wouldn't \nhave looked kindly on the tweets either.\nHazard's back catalogue of online posting, according to the complaint letter from his colleagues, included \nexpressions that allegedly played on tropes of \"Jewish power\", \"Jews as murderous and blood thirsty\" and -invoked \n\"holocaust inversion\" and \"conspiracy theories\".\nPage 2 of 3\nFreehills partner given boot\nThe tweet that appears to have cost him his partnership took aim at Leibler for linking the arson attack on the Adass \nIsrael synagogue with the weekly Jew-hate parades that, as Leibler said, had been \"displayed on the streets of \nMelbourne every week for over a year\".\nHazard's response, amid the collective rage surrounding the anti-Semitic attack, was to accuse Leibler of \"cynically \npoliticising\" the crime and \"inventing a link\" with the anti-Israel protests, which, as a set-piece, often loudly and \nproudly call for an \"intifada\", or violent uprising, against Jews.\nSo in a sense Hazard was right: the need for invention was wholly unnecessary. The link was evident all along.\nAlbo's about-face And just on that - it was quite a sight to see Anthony Albanese attempting to warmly embrace the \nnation's Jewish community in the days after the terrorist attack on the Adass Israel synagogue.\nThe PM started by almost dancing a hora into that barmitzvah in Perth. Three days later he donned a kippah and \ntook a tour of the gutted Melbourne synagogue, and by Wednesday he was announcing an $8.5m upgrade to the \nSydney Jewish Museum.\nSuch a mensch! You might have almost forgotten that the funding became necessary because the government's \ndone such a lousy job of protecting the community.\nAnd yet, as he shook his head and his voice almost caught in his throat, Albanese always knew that Australia was \nabout to abandon the Jewish State - again - on two lopsided resolutions being thrown up at the UN - the first \nresolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza (no strings attached on the release of hostages), and the second in \ndefence of the criminally corrupt relief agency UNRWA.\nIt's strange how, on the one hand, Albanese insists that Hamas should play \"no role\" in any \"future Palestinian \nstate\", only to then, on the other hand, barrack for a ceasefire that will entrench the terrorists and grant them space \nto re-arm and resupply - to the detriment of Palestinians.\nIt's almost as though Albanese and his Foreign Minister, Penny Wong, both suffer from a weird, childish \nmisapprehension that the word \"ceasefire\" somehow equates to \"peace\". It doesn't, and it might be one reason why \nIsrael PM Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted his contempt for the Albanese government a week ago.\nSetback for MinRes A minor setback for Chris Ellison's Mineral Resources in its bitter legal dispute with fellow \nMinRes founder Steve Wyatt - but one that reveals more about Wyatt's viewing habits than the state of the lawsuit.\nMinRes has been in the courts for four years with Wyatt's rival mining services business, Destec, complaining that \nWyatt stole MinRes secrets ahead of setting up the company in 2015.\nThe latest legal skirmish saw WA Supreme Court judge Jenni Hill knock back a bit of legal overreach from MinRes, \nwhich claimed a forensic examination of Wyatt's former laptop showed he copied thousands of documents while \nworking for the company - some of which contained MinRes trade secrets later used to set up Destec to compete \nwith MinRes.\nJustice Hill struck out part of MinRes's statement of claim this week because it's not entirely clear what information \nWyatt is alleged to have stolen.\nProblem is the forensic examination doesn't show the contents of the files, just their names. And while some file \nnames suggest they probably relate to MinRes technology and pricing information, others clearly don't.\nAnd how do we know this? Well, as Hill pointed out in her decision, it's pretty unlikely that a set of files titled \"Game \nof Thrones Season 5\" includes any intimate details of the design mining machinery.\nMind you, given recent revelations about the internal workings of MinRes, you could probably mount an argument \nthat the bloody fantasy saga is a pretty good guide to the internal workings of the company - though not to the \nstandards required in a legal claim.Page 3 of 3\nFreehills partner given boot\nStill, it wasn't a major setback. The sloppy bit of legal argument only cost MinRes a couple of paragraphs from its \nclaims, with liberty to re-plead those aspects of its case.\nAnd it could have been worse. Rather than a fantasy epic, Wyatt could instead have been getting business advice \nfrom the final season of The Sopranos.\nGreen dreams Andrew Forrest has always run a pretty shameless line in self justification when things don't work out \nas planned. But this week's effort is pretty close to peak Twiggy.\nAsked by the Australian Financial Review whether Fortescue's grand promises on green hydrogen - such as a \n\"deal\" to deliver 5 million tonnes a year to Germany's E.ON Energy by 2030 - weren't perhaps a touch over-egged, \nForrest blamed the government for his failure.\n\"Governments were saying we need all this green hydrogen, [including] the government of Germany,\" he said. \n\"E.ON is a government instrumentality. And so they're telling us what they need, and we're believing them. Now, \nwhen they suddenly back out, we're high and dry.\" This from the man who spent years flying around the world \nhectoring governments and industry about the need to replace fossil fuel sources with green hydrogen. And is yet to \nproduce a single molecule of commercially viable hydrogen for sale, despite spending more than $2bn in \nshareholder money on the idea.\nSince Forrest floated his hydrogen balloon, governments have announced billions of dollars worth of hydrogen \nproduction credits and subsidies. Germany updated its hydrogen strategy only days after Forrest cut loose \nFortescue's hydrogen dreams in mid-July, and signed a $660m deal with Australia to encourage hydrogen \nproduction in September.\nForrest argues that Fortescue was forced to dump hydrogen because governments didn't act fast enough, and \ndidn't do enough to drive down energy costs to help make hydrogen viable.\nWhy would they? If you can get renewable power prices low enough to make hydrogen viable, you're probably \ngoing to use it to do something more useful - like deliver cheap power to households and businesses, perhaps.\nForrest was told this over and over again by experts, inside and outside of Fortescue, but kept making promises \nthat seemingly could never be delivered.\nBut it's OK, because green iron is now Fortescue's bright and shiny new thing. Rather than produce 15 million \ntonnes of hydrogen by 2030, Fortescue will be shipping 100 million tonnes of carbon-free iron by an unspecified \ndate.\nEarlier in Fortescue's history, plenty of people said this and were wrong - but we'll believe it when we see the first \nshipment leave Port Hedland.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Quite a sight seeing Albo embrace the Jewish cause\nLoad-Date: December 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | CEO of Fortescue | \"Governments were saying we need all this green hydrogen, [including] the government of Germany.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
