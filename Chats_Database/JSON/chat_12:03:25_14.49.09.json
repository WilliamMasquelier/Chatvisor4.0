Shell is pursuing legal action against Woodside and Paladin Resources in the WA Supreme Court, contesting an $86.5 million clean-up bill associated with the Northern Endeavour oil platform, which Shell argues should not be its responsibility.\n\n2. The clean-up costs stem from an offshore petroleum levy introduced by the federal government in 2022, aimed at addressing the financial burdens of decommissioning the unmanned Northern Endeavour vessel, which has faced safety and environmental concerns.\n\n3. Shell claims that a clause in the original share purchase agreement with Woodside and Paladin, established over a decade ago, holds the two companies liable for any claims related to the venture, including the current clean-up costs.\n\n4. The Northern Endeavour, which was part of a joint venture involving Shell, Woodside, and BHP, was decommissioned after safety warnings and subsequent financial collapse of the operating company, Northern Oil and Gas Australia, leading to significant government intervention in the decommissioning process. \n\n5. Shell is seeking not only reimbursement for the $86.5 million but also a court declaration that Woodside and Paladin are responsible for all future costs related to the ongoing decommissioning process, which is still in its initial stages.",
