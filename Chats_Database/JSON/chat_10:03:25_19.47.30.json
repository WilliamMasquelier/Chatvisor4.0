That may shave about $300m off the price but still, there's plenty of competitive tension at a \ntime when the gold price is at record prices and few top-quality mines of the commodity are for sale.\nAnd EMR Capital, being a private equity firm looking to return funds to investors, would be a keen seller.\nAs earlier reported by DataRoom, first-round bids are due in a few weeks for the mine that generates about 200,000 \nounces of gold annually.\nWorking on the sale are Azure Capital and UBS.\nFortescue Metals A decision by the multibillion-dollar listed iron ore miner Fortescue Metals to launch a takeover \nbid caught the market's attention and there's clear logic to its proposal to buy Red Hawk Mining because its assets \nare right next door.\nFortescue, run by billionaire Andrew Forrest, can extract synergies with Red Hawk Mining's Blacksmith Iron Ore \nproject in the Pilbara because of its proximity to the major's Solomon Iron Ore Hub.\nIt's structured in a way to get a deal done quickly - shareholders get $1.05 or $1.20 a share if its gets to 75 per cent \nin a move to convince major shareholders to divest their position.\nPage 2 of 2\nBidders emerge as Ravenswood gold mine auction heats up - DATA ROOM\nWorking for the $240m Red Hawk is Barrenjoey, while Fortescue is self-advised. The Todd Corp out of New \nZealand owns 61 per cent of Red Hawk and OCJ owns 21 per cent.\nPreviously known as Flinders Mines, Red Hawk was rebadged in 2023 after abandoning plans for a multibillion-\ndollar iron ore and infrastructure project in Western Australia, including a new rail corridor and a deepwater port at \nBalla Balla, south of Port Hedland. Fortescue's offer closes on March 3. Red Hawk shares closed 44.5 per cent \nhigher on Tuesday at $1.19. Fortescue edged up 0.4 per cent to $18.88.\nLoad-Date: January 28, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | CEO of Fortescue Metals | \"Fortescue Metals' decision to launch a takeover bid caught the market's attention and there's clear logic to its proposal to buy Red Hawk Mining because its assets are right next door.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
