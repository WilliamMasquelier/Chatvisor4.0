Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 27\nLength: 701 words\nByline: Alex Gluyas\nBody\nAnalysts are warning investors against jumping back into the beaten-up mining giants, given Beijing is offering little \nhope of stabilising China's property crisis, presenting a continuing headwind for commodity prices.\nThe red flag from Morningstar comes as iron ore's spot prices hover near a two-year low of about $US95 a tonne. \nPrices have plunged more than 30 per cent this year as weakness in China's construction activity hurts steel \ndemand, leaving mills unprofitable and unwilling to buy the commodity.\nThat has whacked the valuations of the sharemarket's largest mining stocks - BHP and Rio Tinto are down about \n20 per cent this year, and Fortescue has plunged more than 40 per cent.\nAlthough the Chinese government has increased support for its property sector, Morningstar believes much more \nneeds to be done to stabilise the industry and trigger a sustained rebound in mining shares.\n\"The price falls are justified in our view and are a rational reaction to demand headwinds from China. All three \nminers were overvalued. They are now fairly valued,\" said Morningstar equity analyst Jon Mills.\n\"There is little for an investor to do but hope for a turnaround in China. We think that is unlikely.\"\nThe bearish outlook chimes with that of the hedge fund industry, which has been targeting iron ore stocks. Short \npositions in Rio Tinto are sitting at the highest level in at least three years and bets against Mineral Resources have \nhit a record.\nIt's also been fuelled by a wave of short-sellers in Asia pulling money out of poor-performing Chinese equities and \nredirecting the funds into targeting Australian mining stocks.\n\"Asian hedge funds have been aggressively shorting Australian resource stocks as a proxy for what they expect to \nsee from China - weak growth,\" said Bell Potter strategist Richard Coppleson.\nAnalysts also agree that Fortescue is the most vulnerable to lower iron ore prices, given it is a pure-play producer \nand its margins sit well below rivals BHP and Rio Tinto. That is partly because Fortescue sells a lower-grade \nPage 2 of 2\nBHP, Rio Tinto still at risk from China crisis Iron ore\nproduct compared with the 62 per cent iron ore benchmark. This means it costs more for customers because of the \nwaste created when transporting and processing the ore, the additional energy/coal per unit of steel, and lower \nblast furnace productivity.\nThis results in a lower realised price compared with the benchmark. In the 10 years to June, Fortescue realised a \n23 per cent discount compared with the benchmark price.\nWhile the eventual ramp-up of Fortescue's higher-grade Iron Bridge joint venture will help, Morningstar warns that \nthe company's margins will fall more than its rivals if iron ore prices continue to decline.\nHowever, not everyone agrees. Some fund managers - including Ellerston Capital's Chris Kourtis - and brokers are \nturning bullish on Fortescue, citing its low share price as an attractive entry point for investors. Morningstar has \nalso flagged the risk from BHP's exposure to the Chinese economy, given the mining giant's earnings are \ndominated by iron ore and copper.\n\"With demand for many commodities likely to soften as the China boom ends, particularly iron ore... we think the \noutlook is for earnings to materially decline,\" Mr Mills said.\nBHP is regarded as the most resilient to weaker iron ore prices because of its low-cost and high-quality assets, \nmaking it one of the few miners that remains profitable through the commodity cycle.\nIt's why UBS has nominated it as the best option for investors amid weaker prices, but it also warns that the stock's \nprice-to-earnings ratio is trading up towards its long-term average.\n\"On a historical basis, BHP does not appear to be especially cheap currently,\" said UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw, \nwho has a \"neutral\" rating on the stock.\nThe broker has the same recommendation for Rio Tinto, and notes that both companies will derive about 30 to 40 \nper cent of their earnings outside iron ore in the next two years.\nThe share prices of both closely follow the iron ore price, given it is the core driver of earnings - a trend UBS \nexpects to continue until that equation changes.\nThat could spell further trouble for both stocks - some analysts predict that iron ore prices will drop below $US90 a \ntonne.\nLoad-Date: August 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
