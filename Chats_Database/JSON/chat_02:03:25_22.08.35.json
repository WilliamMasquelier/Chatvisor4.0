Overall, the company employs 6,000 people in the UK.\nThe company has other profitable divisions, including producing tech for gas generation and power grids.\nHowever, its business has struggled in the past year as a result of its troubled wind division, as faults in its 4X and \n5X onshore wind turbine models led to them being taken off the market.\nLoad-Date: February 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Orsted cuts jobs and scales back offshore wind projects\n## The Daily Telegraph\n### Jonathan Leake\n### February 08, 2024\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Orsted, to report.
