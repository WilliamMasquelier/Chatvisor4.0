Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW MAGAZINE; Pg. 12\nLength: 381 words\nBody\n7 | NICOLA FORREST | $16.92 BILLION | DEBUTANT | AGE: 63, PERTH\nThe announcement last July that Andrew Forrest would separate from Nicola, his wife of 31 years, has reshaped \nthe top of the Rich List. In fact, the terms of the separation make Nicola wealthier than her husband, given she now \nowns 50 million more shares than Andrew does in Fortescue, the iron ore miner he founded in 2003. But such \nintricacies are a moot point - the pair remain in furious agreement on their commitment to the Giving Pledge, set up \nby American billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, under which they have agreed to give away the \"vast \nmajority\" of their wealth.\nIt was to this end that last June the couple transferred one-fi fth of their Fortescue holding worth $5b to their \ncharitable Minderoo Foundation, knocking their combined wealth at the time down to $28b. Their fortune has since \nrebounded on a climbing share price for Fortescue, which ships about 180 million tonnes of hematite iron ore per \nyear from its Chichester, Solomon and Western mines in the Pilbara. Fortescue's fi rst mine for higher-grade \nmagnetite iron ore, the Iron Bridge operation 145km south of Port Hedland, had a slower-than-expected start but \nthe company remains confi dent it will eventually ship 22 million tonnes a year.\nFortescue also shipped its fi rst iron ore mined outside Australia, from the Belinga mine in Gabon, which Andrew \nhopes will eventually become globally signifi cant. However, Andrew is more likely to be heard discussing green \nenergy than iron ore these days. His dreams of making Fortescue a clean energy superpower are starting to take \nmaterial shape - this year Fortescue conducted the world's fi rst use of ammonia as a marine fuel onboard the \nSingapore-fl agged ammoniapowered vessel Fortescue Green Pioneer. Nicola is driving investment in Australian \nfashion with her half of the Forrest family's Tattarang investment vehicle. In April, she unveiled an $8m women's-\nboot-only production line at the Adelaide factory of R.M. Williams, the iconic footwear brand Tattarang bought in \n2020. Last year, it acquired the Akubra hats business and also bought a 25pc stake in the Camilla fashion brand, \nfamous for its kaftans .\n8 | ANDREW FORREST | $16.76 BILLION | LAST YEAR: $33.29 BILLION | AGE: 62, PERTH\nLoad-Date: June 2, 2024\nPage 2 of 2\nMining\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder of Fortescue | \"His dreams of making Fortescue a clean energy superpower are starting to take material shape.\" | N.A. |\n| Nicola Forrest | Shareholder of Fortescue | \"The pair remain in furious agreement on their commitment to the Giving Pledge.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
