The slip in exports also pushed up \naverage C1 cash costs by 7 per cent, to $US18.93 a tonne.\nAnd, while Fortescue said it still expected to meet its annual export guidance, the company said it would probably \ncome in -towards the bottom of its 192-197 million-tonne range.\nBut the company will need a heroic performance to meet even that expectation, needing to export 53.5 million \ntonnes in the June quarter, given it has only shipped 138.5 million tonnes in the first half of the financial year.\nFortescue Metals CEO Dino Otranto said Fortescue was confident it could hit that rate, despite needing to ship at \nnear record rates of about 18 million tonnes a month for the June quarter, after shipping 18.7 million tonnes in \nMarch.\n\"You can hold a lot of confidence in the performance that we've had over the last six weeks - March was an all-time \nrecord. So we're looking pretty good for the remainder of this quarter,\" Mr Otranto said.\nFortescue again downgraded expectations from its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project, saying it now only \nexpected to ship 2 million tonnes of high-grade concentrate from the massive mine and processing operations, \ndown from previous - and already substantially revised - guidance of 2-4 million tonnes.\nThe company shipped only 500,000 tonnes of concentrate from Iron Bridge in the March quarter as it struggles with \nwater supply to the operation. Fortescue is spending about $US100m ($140m) to fix flaws in the water pipeline, \nwhich is leaking in high-pressure sections.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue confident on export guidance\nThe Iron Bridge processing plant is water-hungry as it grinds hard magnetite ore into a fine paste, before separating \niron from waste rock using revolving magnetic drums. When running at its full rate, Iron Bridge will need 20 \ngigalitres of water a year to support its full production rate of 22 million tonnes of concentrate.\nMr Otranto blamed the pipeline issue on quality control issues with a 65km section of the pipeline that now leaks \nunder pressure.\nHe said Fortescue had elected to replace the pipeline section, but declined to comment on whether Fortescue \nwould be able to make an insurance claim for the replacement work or business interruption, or the status of any \nlegal claims against the manufacturer.\nMr Otranto said Fortescue expected to be able to replace the pipeline this year, and said he was confident the \ncompany would still be able to ramp Iron Bridge up to its nameplate capacity by September next year, as previously \nforecast.\n\"All our focus is on getting the water supply back. And our September quarter 2025 guidance that we gave before is \nstill unchanged,\" he said.\n\"However, it does depend on getting that water solution in play. \"The good news is that we've been able to identify \nsome other source of water - we're using our tailings facility to store some of the downpour that we have seen.\" \nFortescue also cut its capital spending guidance by $US300m-$US500m for the current financial year for its metals \ngroup, to $US2.5bn-$US2.7bn, and cut capital spending forecasts for its energy division by $US100m to $US700m. \nFortescue shares closed up 16c at $24.76 on Wednesday.\nLoad-Date: April 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
