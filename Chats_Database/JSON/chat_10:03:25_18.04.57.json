Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 519 words\nHighlight: Auric Mining has unveiled gold hits up to 1m at 6.08g/t from 82m at its Spargoville project in WA - at a \ntarget wedged between two known high-grade deposits.\nBody\nAuric Mining has uncovered an intriguing geological opportunity at its Spargoville project in Western Australia's \nGoldfields region after unveiling gold hits up to 1m at 6.08 grams per tonne from 82m at a target wedged between \ntwo known high-grade deposits.\nThe company has today revealed results from a six-hole drill campaign at its Fugitive prospect that sits between the \nsignificant Wattle Dam and Spargos Reward gold operations run respectively by Maximus Resources and Karora \nResources.\nThe reverse-circulation (RC) program also delivered a 3m hit going 1.18g/t gold from 69m from the same hole as its \npeak result, while additional highlights show a 2m intercept grading 3.82g/t gold from 96m and 2m at 2.78g/t from \n11m in a third hole.\nManagement says historic drilling by Ramelius Resources and Tychean Resources at Fugitive outlined a \nsignificant gold mineralisation zone with about 700m of strike length. Auric's latest 822m campaign followed up on a \nsignificant historic drillhole by Tychean that returned 25m grading 1.67g/t gold from just 44m.\n'The Fugitive Prospect is midway between two prominent, high-grade gold deposits; Wattle Dam and Spargos \nReward at Spargoville.'\nAuric Mining managing director Mark English\nThe prospect sits in a good neighbourhood with the 185,000-ounce Spargos Reward gold deposit just 8km to the \nnorth and the 266,000-ounce Wattle Dam gold deposit only 8km to the south-east.\nAuric Mining managing director Mark English said: \"The Fugitive Prospect is midway between two prominent, high-\ngrade gold deposits; Wattle Dam and Spargos Reward at Spargoville. Our first-pass drilling has highlighted \nsimilarities with both deposits. We're looking forward to the next phase when we will get the opportunity to test that \nmodel.\"\nThe company already has plans for air-core (AC) drilling towards the centre of the Fugitive target to infill the current \n100m spacing in the area. A follow-up RC campaign is also being planned beneath the historic and latest drillholes \nPage 2 of 2\nAuric to home in on intriguing gold target in WA Goldfields\nto target the mineralised zone in fresh rock at about 75m to 100m below surface - similar to where high grades \noccur at the nearby Wattle Dam deposit.\nJust last week, Auric netted nearly $4.46 million in gross revenue from its first mining campaign of the year at its \nJeffreys Find project in the Goldfields after selling 1256 gold ounces to the Perth Mint. As part of its latest mining \nprogram, more than 30,000 dry metric tonnes were processed for its joint venture (JV) partner BML Ventures at a \nreconciled head grade of 1.44g/t at the Greenfields Mill in Coolgardie.\nThe partnership produced more than 9740 ounces during two mining campaigns last year, returning a total gold \nrevenue of $29.28 million.\nAuric plans to put its surplus cash to work by continuing with the development of its nearby Munda gold deposit, \nalongside broader exploration.
