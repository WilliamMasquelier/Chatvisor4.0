Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1300 words\nByline: Andrew Todd\nHighlight: This week's Bulls N' Bears Runner of the Week is... Caprice Resources. Its share price rocketed on \ngold results at its Island Gold project in the Murchison.\nBody\nUp and up the mighty gold price goes. In a seemingly unstoppable price run for the yellow metal, record profits and \nendless gold news trickled into this week's ASX Runners of the Week list, with yet another three goldies featuring in \nBulls N' Bears top four.\nMajors such as Evolution and Northern Star Resources announced record profits and dividends, and Northern Star \ndeclared its Kalgoorlie super pit was on track to regain its title as Australia's biggest gold mine.\nCritical minerals and Chinese export controls are again on the menu, however, gold, particularly in Western \nAustralia's Murchison region, dominated this week's chart toppers.\nCaprice Resources Ltd (ASX:CRS) \n248pc up (from 2.1c to 7.3c)\nThis week's Bulls N' Bears ASX Runner of the Week is Caprice Resources, which surged back to life on \nWednesday after unveiling the results of its phase one drilling program at the company's Island Gold project outside \nof Mt Magnet in WA.\nDrilling at the project's Vadrians Hill prospect returned plenty of thick and shallow high-grade gold, including a \nmeaty 28 metres at 6.4 grams per tonne (g/t) from 114m downhole that featured a high-grade section of 4m running \n16.4g/t gold.\nThe response from a market hungry for all things gold was staggering as the company surged on the day trading \nsome $15 million of stock, which was not bad for a company valued at under $10m to start the week.\nThe frenzy didn't let up on Thursday as the company peaked at a high of 7.3 cents per share, up from a close of \n2.1c the week prior for a total gain of 248 per cent.\nThe Island Gold project lies buried within the burgeoning Murchison goldfields that is host to more than 15 million \nounces of gold and some of Australia's biggest gold producers in Westgold and Ramelius Resources.\nPage 2 of 3\nASX Runners of the Week: Caprice, EV Resources, Scorpion & Latitude\nCaprice says the project's gold corridor is up to 1 kilometre wide and contains multiple banded iron formations up to \n30m thick, which are the preferred host rock for gold mines in the Murchison.\nThe company is wasting no time capitalising on the results and the record high gold environment with a 30-hole \nphase two drilling program well underway at the project. Phase two is expected to churn through some 3500m of \nrock and is scheduled to wrap up by the end of this month.\nThis week's favourite goldie says it has plenty more where that came from, with assays due to the market by late \nnext month, a 248pc gain this week could be just the beginning of things to come for the revitalised Caprice.\nEV Resources Ltd (ASX:EVR)\n166pc up (from 0.3c to 0.8c)\nEV Resources charged into second place on this week's Runners list, after China retaliated against United States \ntariffs by banning molybdenum exports, which amount to almost half the world's molybdenum supply.\nThe Central and South American-based EV Resources has its toes wet in the critical minerals space, boasting \nsome of the highest-grade moly intercepts globally at its flagship Parag porphyry project in Peru.\nHigh-grade moly is generally considered to be ore containing metal concentrations above 0.2pc. The company says \nits Parag numbers far outstretch these, including a sizeable hit of 89.4m from just 6.5m below surface running a \nmassive 0.62pc molybdenum and 0.39pc copper.\nSince the US produces just 12pc of the global molybdenum supply compared to China's 45pc, American steel \nmanufacturers are now scrambling to secure alternative sources.\nEV Resources says analysts predict their reliance on producers in Latin America and other regions will increase \ndramatically. The price action the company experienced on the back of its moly announcement on Tuesday was \ndramatic indeed.\nLast Friday's closing price of 0.3c was left in the dust as the stock more than doubled on the day before peaking at \na top of 0.8c by Wednesday, as the company released even more critical minerals updates with high-grade \nsamples received from its recently acquired antimony project in Mexico.\nMore than 80 million shares traded across the two days, causing EV Resources share price to gain some 166pc, \nas the company looks primed to cash in on the latest critical minerals craze, all thanks to China and its continuing \nexport controls.\nScorpion Minerals Ltd (ASX:SCN) \n126pc up (from 1.5c to 3.4c) \nBulls N' Bears loves a late Friday Runner, and this week our Friday favourite is Scorpion Minerals, which has had a \nvery busy end to the week.\nThe company was suspended from quotation last week, but this week announced a strategic farm-in and \naccompanying capital raising to expand its exploration footprint in the previously mentioned hot property of the \nMurchison goldfields in WA.\nThe company has entered a binding agreement with E79 Gold Mines to acquire up to a 70pc of the Jungar Flats \ngold project, which lies immediately adjacent to its flagship Pharos project.\nScorpion now has the largest landholding in the region, with some 1600-square-kilometres of tenure along the \nDalgaranga-Big Bell shear corridor. The underexplored but highly prospective gold region of the Murchison features \nthe likes of Spartan Resources and Caprice.Page 3 of 3\nASX Runners of the Week: Caprice, EV Resources, Scorpion & Latitude\nThe latest tenure expansion was accompanied by a $1.5m placement to sophisticated and institutional investors at \n2c per share, a 33pc premium to the last traded price.\nA culmination of yet more prospective Murchison gold tenure and a capital raising at a premium saw the company's \nshare price soar today, capping out at 3.4c from a close last week of 1.5c for a 126pc gain.\nScorpion says its latest round of drilling is poised to kick off within weeks, ensuring plenty of near-term catalysts to \nflow from the flourishing Murchison gold province, which seems to be sending share prices running left right and \ncentre.\nLatitude 66 (ASX:LAT)\n120pc up (from 3.5c to 7.7c)\nFinnish-based gold and cobalt explorer Latitude 66 experienced a consistent run up this week to just miss out on a \npodium spot, as life returned to the high-grade gold hopeful.\nThe company had two pieces of news on Thursday. One was an innovative exploration initiative at its flagship \nKuusamo Schist Belt (KSB) gold-cobalt project in Finland and another from joint venture partner Carnaby \nResources at its Greater Duchess copper drilling in Mt Isa, Queensland.\nKSB is an advanced project in the throws of finalising a scoping study on its existing 650,000-ounce gold and 5840t \ncobalt mineral resource in northern Finland. The potentially open pittable deposits features some seriously \nimpressive grades of cobalt and more importantly gold at a respectable 2.7g/t for the 7.3 million tonne resource.\nLatitude says it has locked in plans to deploy reverse circulation drilling at KSB for the first time in the region's \nhistory, potentially significantly cutting costs and accelerating target testing across the broader project area.\nBack in Queensland, Carnaby Resources unveiled some shallow high-grade copper at the Burke and Wills, Lady \nFanny and Nil Desperandum prospects, which it shares with Latitude 66 through a joint venture.\nLatitude says the results from all three prospects continue to demonstrate the massive upside for resource growth \nat the Greater Duchess project, which is just 70km south of Mt Isa.\nThe steady flow of good news and the more than steady appreciation of both gold and copper prices saw the \nunloved goldie return to life, closing the week out at a high of 7.7c from a close of 3.5c last week for a 120pc gain.\nThe company says drilling will get underway next month with even more news yet to come from a couple of eagerly \nanticipated scoping studies at KSB and Greater Duchess, which are expected to drop by the end of this quarter.\nThe way copper and gold are surging the hardest thing for Latitude to predict may be just how high of a metal price \nto use when calculating projected revenues.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?
