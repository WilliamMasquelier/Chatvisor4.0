Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder of Fortescue | \"This lawsuit is no surprise and right out of the oil and gas industry playbook.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder of Fortescue | \"I am personally delighted Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-examination.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder of Fortescue | \"The fossil fuel industry is \u00adgetting increasingly desperate at maintaining its toxic grip on \u00adsociety. Their only priority is to maximise their profits and \u00adproduce as much oil and gas as possible.\" | N.A. |\n| Fortescue spokesperson | Not mentioned | \"Fortescue rejects the assertions that Exxon Mobil has made against Fortescue in the complaint, including the assertions that the Company has orchestrated litigation against Exxon to gain a competitive advantage.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
