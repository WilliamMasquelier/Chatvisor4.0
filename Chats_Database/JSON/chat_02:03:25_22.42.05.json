Orsted is a major player in the sector and is set to build an \u00a38bn offshore \nwind farm in the North Sea by the end of 2027 to power more than 3.3m UK homes.\nGraphic\n \nBlow: Orsted is the largest offshore wind developer\nLoad-Date: August 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**ENTITY**: [Organization Name]\n**TYPE**: [Type of organization - e.g., Company, Government Agency, NGO, etc.]\n**DESCRIPTION**: [Brief description of how the entity is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**ENTITY**: Tesla, Inc.\n**TYPE**: Company\n**DESCRIPTION**: Main subject of article, discussing Q4 earnings report\n\nOnly include entities that are meaningful to the article's content.
