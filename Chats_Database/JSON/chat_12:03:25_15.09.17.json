Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1282 words\nByline: Michelle Bowes\nHighlight: Set-and-forget investing can get good results over long periods, but you'll need to overcome the \ntemptation to trade.\nBody\nShani Jayamanne is a self-confessed \"lazy investor\". It's an unusual admission for someone whose day job is \ndirector and investment specialist at financial services firm Morningstar, but Jayamanne says she \"doesn't \nparticularly enjoy the art of investing\".\n\"I don't enjoy poring through company reports on a Friday night,\" she says.\nJayamanne learnt early in her investing journey that stock picking wasn't for her - owning shares directly in \nindividual companies made her \"incredibly nervous\".\n\"I tend to try to seek out as much information as I can, confirming that I've made the right decision all the time, and \nthat's quite exhausting,\" she says.\nInstead, she has adopted a no-hassles, \"lazy\" approach to her portfolio, investing in managed equity funds and \nexchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nLazy investors lean into diversification, low-cost products and a long investment horizon.\nAshley Owen, who runs a consulting business called Owen Analytics and writes a weekly newsletter about \ninvesting, says the biggest barriers to lazy investing are an inability to tune out noise and ignore emotions, and \navoiding the temptation to chase returns, all of which can be costly.\n\"Human nature is the killer of buy and hold,\" he says. \"You literally have to learn to control yourself to ignore \nfrenzied booms and the frenzied busts, and that's very hard to do. Controlling your emotions is the hardest part of \ninvesting.\"\nVanguard founder John Bogle and legendary investor Warren Buffett both advise that individual investors can get \nby with a simple portfolio consisting of just two index funds - one covering US shares and one covering US bonds.\nBut a lazy Australian investor might have 70 per cent invested in growth assets like Australian and global shares, \nwith the global shares usually 50 per cent hedged, Owen says.\nPage 2 of 4\nHow to become a lazy investor (and yes, it's a good thing)\nThe remaining 30 per cent could be in defensive assets such as Australian and global fixed rate investment grade \ngovernment or corporate bonds, with the global component fully hedged.\nOwen's own long-term investment portfolio features 10 ETFs, none of which are invested in long-duration bonds, \nwhich Owen believes won't deliver the same returns over the next 20 years as they have over the past 30 years.\nHe adds that if someone is establishing a set-and-forget portfolio today, they should also be aware that they're \n\"going to be buying shares at a very expensive point in the cycle\", with future returns to be lower than average.\nETFs and managed funds\nJayamanne isn't invested in bonds, either. Her portfolio consists of four managed funds and three ETFs tracking \nbroad market indexes across Australian and international equities.\nOwen says someone with a standard growth portfolio mix - 70 per cent invested in Australian and global shares and \n30 per cent in bonds - achieved a return of about 11 per cent after fees in the 2023-24 financial year. This is the \nasset mix most large superannuation funds use as their \"default\" option.\n\"Even after inflation of 4 per cent, a lazy return of 11 per cent is still a very healthy 7 per cent real return for the \nyear,\" he says. \"I say 'lazy' because any passive investor would have achieved these returns without trying to chase \nhot stocks or funds or themes or fads, or fiddle with opaque alternatives, or whacky 'new' asset classes, or listened \nto perennial doomsayers prattling on about recessions or political crises or world wars.\"\nInvestors using a buy-and-hold strategy need to accept that there will inevitably be periods of outperformance and \nunderperformance, Jayamanne says.\nBut on average, you will perform better compared to someone who tries to time the market by switching in and out \nof investments, she says.\nBesides incurring the transaction costs associated with buying and selling, market data for the past 30 years shows \nthat if you missed the S&P 500's 10 best days, your returns will be cut in half, Jayamanne says.\n\"And if you missed the best 30 days ... your return would be 83 per cent lower,\" she says.\nJayamanne takes the emotion out of her investment decisions by adhering to an investment policy statement, a \ndocument that outlines exactly what she's investing for and how her investments connect to her financial goals.\n\"Those sorts of guidelines allow you to sit back and think about why you're making a decision, whether it's \nemotionally driven, whether you're feeling like you're missing out on something, or you're doing it in line with your \nportfolio, your financial goals, and what will benefit you over the long term.\"\nJayamanne's investment policy statement also includes parameters for when she will buy and sell investments.\nBuying at the right price\nThese are the two most critical time points for lazy investors, Owen says. In particular, buying investments at the \nright price is key, as buying when investments are overvalued can destroy returns from a set and forget portfolio for \ndecades, he says.\nLink to Image\n\"You make your money when you buy. You've got to be aware of when things are expensive and you've got to be \naware of when things are cheap.\"\nEric Marais, an investment specialist at Orbis Investment Management, agrees that little matters more than the buy-\nin price.Page 3 of 4\nHow to become a lazy investor (and yes, it's a good thing)\nOrbis invests based on an active management philosophy of seeking out undervalued companies, and Marais \npoints to investors who bought into successful tech companies like Cisco Systems and Microsoft before the dotcom \ncrash of the early 2000s, as an example of those who got the buy-in price wrong.\n\"Cisco is a business that has actually been extremely successful. It's continued to grow its revenue and its profits, \nbut it has yet to recoup its peak price 25 years later.\" In the case of Microsoft, Marais says recovering to its pre-\ndotcom share price took 16 years.\nFor lazy investors who don't want to follow the markets closely enough to time their entry, the solution is dollar cost \naveraging, which is the approach Jayamanne uses. Dollar cost averaging is the process of investing the same sum \nat regular intervals, regardless of market movements.\n\"You're just putting $100 in every week, and you buy all the way through the booms and busts and that works quite \nwell,\" Owen says.\nWhen to review\nDespite her hands-off approach, Jayamanne does monitor her portfolio.\n\"You always have to monitor and maintain your portfolio because markets will always change, economic conditions \nwill change,\" she says. \"There's no set-and-forget portfolio that you can just leave and let it run and be confident \nthat it's still aligned with your goals over the long term.\"\nJayamanne reviews her portfolio every six months. \"I think that's a pretty good cadence for lazy investors,\" she \nsays.\nOwen agrees that some tweaking does make sense from time to time as conditions change, adding that \"about \nonce or twice per decade there is a major market rupture that requires some serious thinking and major changes\".\nYield Financial Planning managing director James McFall agrees staying invested when markets fall suddenly and \nwaiting for the recovery is part of a successful investor's mindset.\nHe advocates a more active approach, suggesting investors should \"actively switch among asset classes where the \ngreater risk or opportunity is at different points in the market cycle\".\nWhile the thesis that there are some companies that you can buy and hold forever might be considered central to \nlazy investing, Marais calls this idea \"dangerous\".\n\"Over time, it has tended to be the case that most businesses get disrupted, so the idea that there is a good-\nenough company that you can buy and hold forever is sort of redundant.\"\nHe says rather than an annual or biannual review, the right time to review your investments \"should be based on \nwhat's changing in the market\".\nGraphic\n \nInvestment specialist Eric Marais\nLoad-Date: January 25, 2025Page 4 of 4\nHow to become a lazy investor (and yes, it's a good thing)\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# How to become a lazy investor (and yes, it's a good thing)\n## AFR Online\n### Michelle Bowes\n### January 22, 2025\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Cisco, to report.
