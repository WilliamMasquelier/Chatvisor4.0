Shell previously expected LNG volumes of 6.7 million-\n7.3 million tonnes.\nGains from integrated gas trading are expected to be significantly higher quarter-on-quarter, while the trading result \nfrom chemicals and crude oil refineries is seen to be significantly lower. The former segment was expected to make \nan adjusted earnings loss, the company said.\nHowever, the expected uptick in fourth-quarter gas trading comes despite declining oil and gas prices throughout \nthe period, with oil hitting a five-month low in early December, reflecting supply and demand concerns despite \nsupport from geopolitical uncertainty.\nUpstream production - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - is expected to meet the guided range of 1.75 \nmillion to 1.95 million BOE a day at 1.83 million to 1.93 million a day. It reported 1.75 million BOE a day in the third \nquarter.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell takes earnings hit of up to $7.7bn in quarter\nElsewhere, Saudi Aramco said it would cut crude prices to all regions, including its largest market in Asia - a move \nthat comes amid weaker global oil prices and increased production by producers outside the Organisation of the \nPetroleum Exporting Countries.\nAfter a summer rally attributed in large part to Saudi Arabia's decision to implement a production cut of one million \nbarrels a day on top of existing cuts by other members of OPEC and its allies, including Russia, crude fell sharply in \nthe fourth quarter.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1207 words\nHighlight: The oil super majors are eyeing shifting their primary stock exchange listings to New York as a stronger \npush to reduce fossil fuels in their home markets weighs on their share prices.\nBody\nThere's a yawning gap between the valuations of US oil and gas majors and their UK and European counterparts. \nThat's prompted a debate over whether the more lowly rated energy giants should switch their primary stock \nexchange listing to New York.\nThe discussion was given a sharper edge late last month when the chief executive of France's Total Energies, \nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9, said the century-old super major, founded by the French government, was seriously considering \na shift of its listing, albeit not its headquarters.\nShell, which shifted its headquarters from The Hague and unwound its dual listing to base itself and its shares in \nLondon in 2022, is known to have also seriously pondered a shift in its primary listing three years ago.\nBP has said a move is not on its agenda but would inevitably have done some analysis on it. There's also been \nspeculation that its relatively low sharemarket valuation could make it a target for one of the more highly rated oil \ngiants, which could effectively produce a transfer of its listing.\nThe driver of the discussion is a significant disparity in the sharemarket valuations of European and UK energy \ncompanies relative to their US counterparts like Exxon and Chevron, which trade on cashflow multiples up to 50 per \ncent higher than their transatlantic rivals.\nNot only does that make their shareholders happier, but it lowers the US majors' cost of equity, enables them to \ninvest more productively and makes acquisitions more attractive. Exxon bought Pioneer Natural Resources for \n$US60 billion ($91 billion) last year, while Chevron announced an agreed all-share $US53 billion for Hess Corp.\nThe smaller strand in the explanation for the varying valuations relates to the markets themselves.\nThe New York stock market is much bigger and deeper than London and the fragmented European exchanges and \nis supported by a far larger pool of institutional and retail investors. Historically, that has produced higher valuations \nrelative to European peer companies.\nWith the US being the world's largest producer and exporter of oil and gas, there is also stronger interest in the \nsector there and better support from US and international investors.\nPage 2 of 3\nIt's not easy being green for UK and European oil giants\nWhile the market dynamics have seen some UK and European companies, particularly (but not exclusively) tech \nand biotech companies, shift their listings to the US, they are not the primary reason energy companies have \nconsidered the move.\nNor is the post-Brexit decline in the status of London's market a major factor, although what was once the global \nhub for resources investment has been fading as some of its larger listings, like BHP's UK listing, have disappeared \nor - as will happen if BHP succeeds with its Anglo-American bid -- London-listed miners have been acquired.\nThe US companies are pursuing growth strategies. Their trans-Atlantic competitors aren't.\nThe more material influence on the oil majors' valuations than the nature of their domestic markets is the extent to \nwhich policymakers and investors in the UK and Europe have responded to climate change and the way that has, \nand is, shaping the growth strategies of companies like TotalEnergies, Shell and BP.\nExxon and Chevron are aggressively growing their oil and gas production volumes and investing in increasing their \noutput even as, across the Atlantic, TotalEnergies, Shell and BP are pursuing carbon emissions reduction-related \nstrategies that will eventually see their volumes decline.\nThe US companies are pursuing growth strategies. Their transatlantic competitors aren't.\nShell and BP have received significant criticism recently for slowing the rate at which their fossil fuel volumes are \nscheduled to fall.\nBP, for instance, had a 2020 plan to cut its oil and gas production by 40 per cent by 2030 from 2019. Last year, the \ntarget was shifted to 25 per cent by 2030, with the 35 to 40 per cent target for its own carbon emissions revised to \nbetween 20 and 30 per cent.\nShell, which had said it would reduce its output by 1 or 2 per cent a year through to the end of the decade, last year \nrestated its plan.\nIt now expects flat volumes through to 2030 and, where it had planned to reduce investment in oil and gas and \nincrease its spending on low-carbon products, it will now invest $US40 billion in oil and gas by 2035, against the \n$US10 to $US15 billion it will spend in those low-carbon products.\nThe backlash against BP and Shell was strong because European and UK fund managers, retail investors and their \ngovernments are far more committed to environmental, social and governance policies than most US fund \nmanagers and other investors.\nIn the US, where President Joe Biden has presided over a massive increase in US oil and gas production and \nDonald Trump is promising to \"drill, baby, drill\" if he regains the presidency, there has recently been something of a \nbacklash against ESG investment policies.\nThe stronger emissions reduction frameworks in Europe and the UK (and successful legal actions by environmental \nactivists) have forced their oil and gas companies to pursue strategies that have resulted in them constraining their \noil and gas investment and production while building a presence in greener technologies and fuels.\nFrom the companies' perspective - and that of prospective investors less concerned about fossil fuels - the pressure \nto reduce their oil and gas production and invest in renewables and hydrogen will deliver lower returns than the \nmore aggressively pro-fossil fuel strategies pursued by Exxon and Chevron.\nWhen BP unveiled its new timetable for responding to climate change, it said that it generated returns on \ninvestment of 15 to 20 per cent from its fossil fuel projects. The returns from bioenergy were about 15 per cent, but \nthey were only 6 to 8 per cent from renewables like solar and wind. It's not surprising that it decided to invest more \nin oil and gas and biofuels than in renewables.Page 3 of 3\nIt's not easy being green for UK and European oil giants\nThere's a relatively recent view among the majors, one that arguably was held earlier and more strongly by the US \ncompanies, that the transition to cleaner energy is going to take longer and, if it is to be relatively smooth, will \nrequire more investment in fossil fuels to maintain energy supply than was once projected.\nThat view doesn't sit well with ESG-sensitive European or British investors. At the same time, the significant and \nstill-growing presence of lower-returning assets in their portfolios and the absence of the production growth \nstrategies of Exxon and Chevron deter those investors less fussed about investing in fossil fuels.\nTotalEnergies, which has far more US investors than Europeans and whose biggest exposure to oil and gas is in \nthe US, has less of a discount relative to Exxon and Chevron than the UK companies. But it believes that, if it were \nvalued in line with them, there would be a very substantial uplift.\nBut as a French national champion, TotalEnergies would face significant obstacles to moving its listing - as might \nShell and BP - from governments determined to retain their flagship companies, retain their corporate offices and \nmaintain the size and relevance of their equity markets.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

The sale of its final 13.3 per cent stake netted Shell about $3.5 \nbillion, but the commissioner of taxation ruled in February it had understated its profits from the sell-down.\nFederal Court filings obtained by The Australian Financial Review show the Tax Office believes the company \nshould have declared a capital gain $193.9 million higher than first flagged in the 2017 sale. It also took aim at a \n2014 share sale where it found the gain was $135.7 million higher than declared.\nShell has appealed the ruling, with a spokeswoman saying Shell \"complies with all its legal and taxation obligations \nand is committed to paying the right amount of tax in all countries in which we operate\".\n\"Shell has a co-operative relationship with the ATO, where we discuss business activity and taxation matters on a \nproactive, transparent basis,\" she said. \"It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.\"\nThe nearly $330 million in additional capital gains would, at the company tax rate of 30 per cent, mean Shell owes \nat face value $99 million to the Tax Office for the disputed years.\nThe major oil and gas producers are \"now among the largest taxpayers in Australia\", the ATO said last November.\n\"Payments from this sector have grown markedly in the 2022-23 income tax year to in excess of $11 billion,\" the \nATO said at the time. Receipts from the energy sector made up more than two-thirds of the $6.4 billion paid by \nmultinational companies in the period.\nAn ATO spokeswoman said: \"The ATO cannot comment on any current matter before the Federal Court,\" in \nresponse to Shell's appeal.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell sues ATO over disputed $99m tax bill Taxation\nThe Financial Review understands that Shell thinks its shares in Woodside should be treated at the lower amount \ndue to transitional changes to the capital gains regime that were introduced in 1997 following the acquisition of its \nstake in 1985. The matter is set for a case management hearing on July 29.\nShell is one of the world's largest oil and gas producers, and is involved in seven major domestic projects, including \nthe Gorgon natural gas project off the coast of Western Australia.\nThe Australian outpost posted a profit of $US632.7 million ($947 million) in the 2023 calendar year, filings to the \ncorporate regulator show, less than a third of the $US2.7 billion reported only a year prior.\nThe accounts also show Shell Australia paid $US37 million in tax last year.\nLoad-Date: May 20, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Lucas Baird\nDate: May 18, 2024\nTitle: Shell sues ATO over disputed $99m tax bill\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: The two major threats to a 'net zero' world\n## Media outlet: Brisbane Times\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: May 21, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 3\nThe two major threats to a 'net zero' world\nThe two major threats to a 'net zero' world\nBrisbane Times\nMay 21, 2024 Tuesday 2:22 AM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
