Baby-faced frontman, Jordi \nDavieson, is effortlessly cool with his cap backwards, sunglasses and lollipop protruding from his mouth.\nIt was a massive occasion for the Fremantle band, whose quirky brand of indie-pop had caught fire with their call-\nand-response single, Awkward, the title track of their second EP.\nSo 12 years and five albums later San Cisco were naturally ecstatic to be lining up for this year's Groovin The Moo \nas one of the Australian headliners to support their latest record Under The Light.\nNews last month that the touring regional music festival had been cancelled due to poor ticket sales naturally came \nas a body blow.\nGroovin The Moo's cancellation followed the demise of Newcastle's other major music festival, This That, last \nSeptember.\n\"I think it's really sad,\" Davieson tells Weekender from his home in Fremantle.\n\"Groovin The Moo has been such a big part of my generation's [culture of] going to festivals. Groovin The Moo, \nFalls, Splendour In The Grass are big Australian-wide festivals and they're slowly falling apart.\n\"We were asked recently why is it happening and how can you fix it? But I really don't know. I think it's a changing \nlandscape. The music industry is changing a lot.\n\"The price of everything is going up. Even to put a show on is extremely expensive now and there's huge risks \ntaken by promoters.\"\nRather than wallow in self-pity, San Cisco's Davieson (vocals, guitar), Scarlett Stevens (vocals, drums) and Josh \nBiondillo (guitar) moved quickly to find the positive in Groovin The Moo's cancellation.\nPage 2 of 3\nSan Cisco rocking on from 'really sad' Groovin' The Moo cancellation\nThe trio booked an 11-date east coast regional tour to support Under The Light, which includes a May 23 show at \nKing Street.\n\"Because of a lot of Groovin's exclusivity rules, it wasn't allowed to happen - we weren't able to book anything \naround it,\" Davieson says.\n\"So as soon as it got cancelled I was like, 'let's book a regional tour and a rather extensive one', because we \nhaven't done it for a while.\n\"It's fun to play smaller venues and get out to parts of Australia that you won't normally get to, and play more \nintimate shows, which are often very rowdy.\"\nDavieson says San Cisco, due to having more than a decade of music behind them and a well-earned fan base, \nare better placed than younger Australian bands who depend on the opportunities and the financial support of \nmusic festivals.\n\"I think you probably just have to be pumping social media,\" he says. \"That's the platform.\n\"It's probably one of the reasons festivals aren't doing what they need to because all the 17 to 23-year-olds are \nmainly absorbing their music through TikTok.\n\"That's a minute-long part of a song you fall in love with, as opposed to falling in love with an artist and an album \nand seeing them play live for the first time.\n\"It's a different way to access new music.\"\nSan Cisco's members, who are all in their early 30s, have grown up personally and musically since their Awkward \ndays. That maturation is clearly recognisable in the smooth dance sounds of Under The Light.\nSteven Schram (Paul Kelly, Little Birdy, Crowded House) produced their previous four albums, but for Under The \nLight Pond drummer James Ireland manned the sound desk.\nDavieson says Ireland's influence was most readily heard on the electronic-laden Honeycomb.\n\"We were like, 'let's make a UK G [garage] beat' and he just produced this UK G beat and we started playing the \nsong,\" he says.\n\"Whereas in the past, when we were trying to do something, it would fall somewhere quite different, which is a good \nprocess as well.\n\"It would end up a little different to where we were heading. But with James it's a very accurate representation of \nwhat we were looking for.\"\nThe circumstances during the recording of Under The Light couldn't have been more different from their 2020 \nalbum Between You and Me, which was tracked in a \"big blue shed\" crawling with \"insects, mice and snakes\" \noutside the northern NSW town of Mullumbimby.\nIt became so uncomfortable Stevens flew in and out during the sessions, leaving Davieson and Biondillo to finish \nthe tracks.\nUnder The Light was recorded in the comforts of home in Fremantle, which presented the band with the opportunity \nto get real time feedback on their half-finished songs from family and friends.\n\"It can be very confusing, but it can also be really good,\" Davieson says of getting feedback.\n\"The people who know you really well and them deconstructing what you're doing is quite an interesting thing to \nwatch.\"Page 3 of 3\nSan Cisco rocking on from 'really sad' Groovin' The Moo cancellation\nSan Cisco bring their Under The Light Tour to Newcastle's King Street Band Room on May 23.\nLoad-Date: March 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Cisco.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
