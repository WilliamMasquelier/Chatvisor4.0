These workforce reductions, aimed at shifting focus to cybersecurity and AI, have raised concerns about employee morale, operational disruptions, and uncertainty for remaining staff. Additionally, the company expects significant pre-tax charges related to these layoffs, impacting its financial outlook.\nDeclining Market Share in China: Cisco has been losing market share in China due to the Chinese government's push to replace foreign technology with domestic alternatives. This trend, ongoing since at least 2019, has led to declining orders and weakened Cisco\u2019s position in one of the world's largest technology markets, limiting its growth potential in the region.\nStock Price Decline and Investor Concerns: Cisco's stock price has declined significantly in 2024, reflecting investor concerns over its financial performance and ability to navigate economic uncertainties. Additionally, the company has struggled to recover its peak stock price from the dot-com era, raising doubts about its long-term investment value.\nSlow Sales Growth and IT Spending Slowdown: Cisco's revenue growth has been negatively impacted by a slowdown in corporate technology spending. This has forced the company to restructure and cut jobs, highlighting challenges in maintaining sales momentum amid shifting industry trends and broader economic uncertainties.\nChallenges in AI Adoption and Implementation: Cisco is facing significant difficulties in AI adoption, as its AI readiness index indicates that many companies are not seeing expected returns on AI investments. A large percentage of surveyed organizations report that AI-driven automation has not met expectations, and only a small fraction of companies are fully prepared to leverage AI. Additionally, mounting pressure from executives and boards to adopt AI, despite skepticism about its effectiveness, has created a challenging environment for AI implementation.\n\nClassify the following issue into one of these categories.
