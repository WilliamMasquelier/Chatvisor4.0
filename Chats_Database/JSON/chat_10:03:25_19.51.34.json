Ltd.\nSection: DOMESTIC NEWS\nLength: 482 words\nDateline: BRISBANE Feb 24\nBody\n  An iron ore miner accused of stoking division in a Western Australian community says it is not to blame for the \n\"internal disharmony\" among Traditional Owners.\n   Fortescue Metals Group argued the granting of its mining tenements did not cause community disharmony, as it \nbegan closing submissions in the long-running legal battle in the Federal Court on Monday.\n   Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation is seeking $1.8 billion compensation from Fortescue over cultural and \neconomic loss at the Solomon Mine Hub.\n   The Aboriginal corporation is also seeking compensation for specific destruction of sites and for the cost of \nhealing the trauma caused by social disruption.\n   Fortescue began mining at the hub in the Pilbara in 2013 without agreement from the Yindjibarndi Aboriginal \nCorporation, instead dealing with a breakaway group.\n   In its closing submissions, Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation said a \"remarkable document\" had been \ndiscovered in August, in the form of an invoice and corresponding purchase order from law firm Corser & Corser to \nFMG for $107,000.\n   The invoice refers to a meeting to be held on March 16, 2011, for more than 200 members of the breakaway \ngroup to be paid $500 expenses each, said the document, filed in the Federal Court.\n   \"This is a clear and significant measure of support for one side of what was already a serious division in the \ncommunity,\" the submission reads.\n   \"There should be no difficultly in inferring that FMG gave the support to further its own commercial interests.\"\n   Yindjibarndi lawyers said the community division had prevented the practice of cultural ceremony, and therefore \nhad impacts on Country.\n   But Fortescue barrister Brahma Dharmananda told the court on Monday the miner was not the cause of internal \ndisharmony, nor was the granting of its tenements.\nPage 2 of 2\nWA:Mine giant denies it's to blame for community division\n   \"The in-fighting arose because of difference of view about doing a deal with FMG,\" he said.\n   \"Any inability to regenerate the land was not caused by FMG. It arose because the Yindjibarndi were and \ncontinue to be in internal conflict about how to deal with FMG.\"\n   The court is considering how much compensation the Yindjibarndi native title holders should receive from \nFortescue.\n   Lawyers for Yindjibarndi argue compensation should take into account the amount the native title holders would \nhave been able to negotiate with Fortescue.\n   More than 200 sites have been damaged or destroyed, according to Yindjibarndi's closing submissions.\n   Yindjibarndi lawyer Vance Hughston previously told the court Yindjibarndi Country was being physically and \nculturally destroyed.\n   Fortescue is arguing compensation should be calculated without reference to the value of any minerals on or in \nthe ground.\n   \"Valuing spiritual or cultural loss by reference to the value of minerals never owned by the Yindjibarndi is not \ncorrect,\" Mr Dharmananda told the court on Monday.\nLoad-Date: February 24, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
