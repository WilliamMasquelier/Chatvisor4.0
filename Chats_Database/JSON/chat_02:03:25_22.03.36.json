All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Version:4\nLength: 816 words\nByline: Kiran Stacey and Fiona Harvey\nHighlight: J\u00fcrgen Maier\u2019s vision for company includes the potential to borrow its own money in order to rival \nmultinationals\nBody\nBritain\u2019s new national energy company will eventually become a major power generator, running its own windfarms \n, tidal power and carbon capture schemes and potentially borrowing its own money, according to its new chair.\nJ\u00fcrgen Maier , the chair of Great British Energy  (GBE), told the Guardian in an interview that his vision for the \ncompany far outstrips its current scope and would put it on a par with multinational firms such as Denmark\u2019s \u00d8rsted  \nor Sweden\u2019s Vattenfall.\nGovernment sources have indicated the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, aims to make \u00a340bn in tax rises and spending \ncuts  in the upcoming budget. Maier made a last-minute plea to keep his company\u2019s spending off the public balance \nsheet, which would allow it to borrow more in the long term.\nMaier told the Guardian: \u201cGreat Britain deserves a national champion, like an \u00d8rsted.\n\u201cWhat we want to do [now] is to invest and play in some of the less mature markets and then ultimately we would \nbecome a longer-term operator in some of those areas, such as floating offshore wind, etc. But that\u2019s going to take \na much longer period of time.\u201d\nOfficials say the company could eventually become an operator in offshore wind, tidal power, carbon capture and \nhydrogen power.\nHe added: \u201cThese journeys always start with a vision and with an idea. And that\u2019s exactly where \u00d8rsted and \nVattenfall started. We now have five years to build this company to co-invest. We will no doubt own some energy \nassets in that time.\nPage 2 of 3\nGreat British Energy can become a major power generator, says its chair\n\u201cBut ultimately, if you take the next five years beyond that, of course we want to become a larger energy company. \nThere is a long-term vision, and there\u2019s a pragmatic step-by-step approach of getting there.\u201d\n\u00d8rsted, formerly known as Dong Energy, is the world\u2019s largest offshore wind developer, with a valuation of about \n\u00a320bn. Vattenfall, which is solely owned by the Swedish government, owns some of the largest windfarms across \nnorthern Europe.\nGBE has been promised \u00a38.3bn to spend on energy schemes over the next five years, concentrating on offshore \nwind, hydrogen power, carbon capture and nuclear power.  The company will begin by taking minority stakes in new \nprojects, but will not immediately own or operate any itself.\nReeves had originally intended to invest \u00a328bn a year on green schemes but those plans were halved  this year, \nleaving GBE at the heart of the government\u2019s green industrial strategy alongside the \u00a37.3bn National Wealth Fund.\nMaier and the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, will travel on Thursday to Aberdeen, GBE\u2019s planned headquarters, \nwhere they will announce a deal to develop windfarms on land owned by the crown estate in Scotland. The deal \nmirrors a similar one  struck in England, which officials say will allow GBE to develop enough offshore wind turbines \nto power 20m homes.\nMiliband said: \u201cUnlike in the past we\u2019re working closely with the Scottish government with a new agreement to \nensure our publicly owned company Great British Energy is primed to accelerate clean energy investment in \nScotland.\u201d\nReeves has warned cabinet colleagues she faces a bigger funding gap than previously thought because of her \ndesire to increase departmental budgets by more than was assumed under Conservative spending plans.\nShe is drawing up plans to find \u00a340bn to avoid the real-terms cuts to departments that had been baked in under the \nprevious government\u2019s plans.\nHer attempts to fix the shortfall are causing angst in Whitehall, where ministers are complaining that they are being \nasked to cut major spending programmes, even though the government had promised an end to austerity.\nCabinet ministers have pushed back against some of the cuts, in particular to in-year capital spending.  Several \nhave written to Keir Starmer to contest them.\nIn the long term, Reeves is looking to buy herself more fiscal headroom by rewriting the official government \ndefinition of debt to allow her to borrow billions more for critical infrastructure.\nAsked whether he thought GBE should also be kept out of the debt figures, Maier, a former chief executive of \nSiemens UK, replied: \u201cCorrect.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s a huge investment. I\u2019ve been in this industry for 30 years in the UK and I\u2019ve always felt that we have \nsomewhat underinvested in our infrastructure. I\u2019m massively excited by the opportunity to be an investor [and] to \nreally reaccelerate our journey to clean power in the United Kingdom.\u201d\nMaier said he wanted ministers to remain open to the idea of allowing GBE to borrow its own money \u2013 a provision \nthat industry experts consider essential if it is to reach the kind of scale he would like.\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted that crown estate is able to borrow and therefore invest with us,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether in the future we \ncan borrow or not, I think is a discussion for later on.\u201d\n This article was amended on 17 October 2024. An earlier version misdescribed J\u00fcrgen Maier as the chief \nexecutive, rather than chair, of Great British Energy.\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2024Page 3 of 3\nGreat British Energy can become a major power generator, says its chair\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Orsted.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
