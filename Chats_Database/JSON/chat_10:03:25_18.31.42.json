Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Brett Mitchell | Javelin Minerals executive chairman | \"This is a strong result which provides a solid platform on which to build a very substantial gold inventory on the doorstep of the world-class St Ives Goldfield. The scope for growth at Coogee is clearly immense. The mineralisation is open and we have numerous compelling targets.\" | N.A. |\n| Not mentioned | Previous operator of Coogee project | \"Ramelius treated its Coogee ore by conventional carbon-in-leach processing at the Burbanks Mill, south of Coolgardie, reporting 96.4 per cent metallurgical recovery.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Ramelius Resources.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Ramelius Resources or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
