Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 819 words\nByline: Michael Bachelard\nHighlight: The iron ore giant says the public is being misled into believing that low-quality carbon offset schemes \nwill lead to net zero, despite evidence that only reducing fossil fuels will work.\nBody\nAustralians are being misled into believing that low-quality carbon offset schemes will lead to a net zero future, \ndespite evidence that only reducing fossil fuels will work, iron ore mining giant Fortescue says.\nThe federal government's Safeguard Mechanism forces companies to either begin decarbonising or buy carbon \noffsets to meet legislated net zero goals.\nLink to Image\nTrevor Collens\nBut Fortescue's chief climate scientist, Dr Shanta Barley, said in a speech in Canberra on Wednesday that many of \nthe offsets they were forced to buy were \"dodgy\", which had led to a lack of trust in the system. Their use in the \nSafeguard Mechanism must be capped, she said.\nBarley's comments, the strongest ones yet from Fortescue on carbon offsets and climate change, come as serious \nquestions are being raised by scientists about whether schemes such as Human Induced Regeneration (HIR) \nachieve any real carbon reduction in the atmosphere.\nThey also coincide with the publication of two major studies that say a record-hot 2024 suggests the globe has \nalready exceeded the 1.5 degree temperature increase limit laid out in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. \nMeanwhile, Australia's emissions continue to rise.\nFortescue has a policy of reaching \"real zero\" by building renewable energy and battery and storage schemes to \npower its multi-billion dollar Pilbara iron ore operations.\nBarley told the Climate Integrity summit, organised by the Australia Institute, that \"multiple, independent and peer-\nreviewed lines of evidence have now come to the same conclusion\" about carbon sequestration schemes in \nAustralia and around the world.\nPage 2 of 3\nAustralians are being misled by 'dodgy' offsets, say Fortescue\n\"Many offset projects are now known to be low quality and failing to deliver the emissions reductions they promised \n... We are, in other words, largely being duped.\"\nUnder the Safeguard Mechanism, companies that cannot meet legislated emissions reduction targets - by actually \nreducing their emissions or shutting down - are legally required to buy Australian offsets, including those generated \nby farmers allegedly growing forests on Australia's dry rangeland farms.\nThese HIR credits now make up about a third of the total Australian Carbon Credit Units available on the market \nand will grow to be around half in future years.\nAs a result of the Safeguard Mechanism policy, big mining companies such as Fortescue are required to spend \nmillions of dollars a year buying these offsets. Fortescue says this is a bridging issue until it can reach \"real zero\" in \n2030.\nBarley hinted in her speech that this might, in future, prompt legal action, as companies could explore the legal \nimplications of being required to buy products that \"aren't doing what they say on the tin\".\nA community group recently launched legal action in the Federal Court, alleging misleading and deceptive conduct \nagainst Energy Australia over its claim its power - generated largely by coal and gas - was carbon-neutral because \nit had bought offsets on the voluntary market.\nNo company has yet sued over the offsets they are forced to buy on the compulsory or \"compliance\" market.\nIn her speech, Barley drew particular attention to HIR offsets - including questions raised in a series of articles in \nthis masthead over recent days. She also said there were integrity concerns over other government-approved offset \nmethods, including landfill gas, carbon capture and storage and herd management.\nBarley said the answer was for the government to cap the number of offsets that companies could use in pursuit of \nreducing emissions. In Australia, there is no cap on the use of offsets, but in other territories' carbon reduction \nschemes, including in California and the European Union, the use of offsets is limited.\n\"If 90 per cent of our decarbonisation had to be real, a few dodgy offsets wouldn't matter. We would laugh them off,\" \nBarley said. \"The problem lies in the fact that there are currently no limits to using them.\"\nIn answer to questions from this masthead recently, a spokesperson for Environment Minister Chris Bowen said \ncarbon credits such as those derived from HIR - one-third of the total in Australia - were \"a critical part of the 'net' in \nnet zero\".\nAccording to Barley, with a profit of $9 billion per year, Fortescue could easily afford a few million for offsets to \nallow it to claim it has decarbonised.\n\"At the end of the day, the financial impost placed by offsets on big companies is water off a duck's back. To force \ncompanies to do the right thing, many countries have had to set strict limits on offset use. Australia should consider \ndoing the same.\"\nFortescue this week organised an open letter, signed by multiple companies, which now includes $49 billion \ntechnology company Canva, calling for \"real zero\" policy that would \"mandate clear phase-out timelines for fossil \nfuel use\".\nThe Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day's most important and interesting stories, analysis \nand insights.
