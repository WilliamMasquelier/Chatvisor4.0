Under this system, the Government encourages companies to build low-\ncarbon energy plants such as solar and wind farms by offering a minimum price for the electricity generated. The \nmoney for such subsidies is eventually added to bills.\nThe UK\u2019s power grid operator, National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO), calculates \u201cbudget impact\u201d of the \nsubsidies for offshore wind and other renewables at \u00a34bn from 2026 to 2031, in today\u2019s money. \nThe costs given exclude the additional expense of transmission lines and the expansion of the national grid to \nhandle the extra power. \nIt means more than five gigawatts (GW) of new offshore wind is now set for construction \u2013 a stark contrast to last \nyear\u2019s botched auction round when there were no bids.  The Tories offered subsidies so low \u2013 at \u00a340 per megawatt \nhour (MWh) \u2013 that no offshore wind developers came forward. Subsidies under Mr Miliband will be more than \ndoubled to more than \u00a382 per MWh.\nPage 2 of 3\nEd Miliband adds \u00a3150 to household bills with wind turbine building spree\nSolar farms will get \u00a370/Mwh, with newer technologies like floating wind handed \u00a3195/Mwh and tidal stream \nprojects given \u00a3239/Mwh.\nA total of 131 clean energy projects have won state subsidies in this year\u2019s auction, including 115 solar projects \nacross England and onshore wind projects mainly in Scotland and Wales. \nMany of the onshore projects are likely to prove highly controversial, with homeowners and environmentalists \nobjecting to the industrialisation of landscapes with panels and turbines. \nHowever, Mr Miliband hailed the auction results as a triumph. The Energy Secretary said: \u201cWe inherited a broken \nenergy policy ... Today we have a record-setting round for enough renewable power for 11m homes, essential to \ngive energy security to families across the country. \n\u201cIt is another significant step forward in our mission for clean power by 2030 \u2013 bringing Britain energy independence \nand lower bills for good.\u201d \nHowever, much will depend on the market value of electricity in coming years. If the market value rises above the \nvalues offered under the contracts for difference (CfDs), the energy companies could end up refunding part of the \nextra money.\nOrsted  is one of the biggest winners. It has been allowed to shunt much of its Hornsea 3 project out of contracts \nsigned under previous allocation rounds, where lower subsidies were offered, into this year\u2019s auction.\nA spokesman for Mr Miliband said the move had been permitted because otherwise Hornsea 3 \u2013 potentially the \nworld\u2019s largest wind farm at 3GW  \u2013 might never have been built.\nCritics will argue that such contracts become meaningless if companies can simply move them from one auction \nround if a subsequent one offers better terms. \nOrsted was also awarded a 2.4GW CfD for Hornsea 4. Rasmus Errboe, of Orsted, said: \u201cWe look forward to \ndelivering these landmark projects, which will supply renewable power at a large scale to UK consumers and \nbusinesses and help the UK Government achieve its target of quadrupling offshore wind capacity to 60GW by \n2030.\u201d\nScottishPower, owned by Spanish utility giant Iberdrola, has been offered contracts for another two large wind \nfarms, East Anglia Two and East Anglia Three. As with Orsted, it was allowed to move its East Anglia Three project \nout of the contracts signed under a previous and less lucrative auction into this year\u2019s round. \nKeith Anderson, the chief executive of ScottishPower, said: \u201cOffshore wind is back on track after last year\u2019s misstep.\n\u201cThis auction\u2019s success shows this tried and tested investment mechanism, replicated globally, delivers exactly the \nscale of action needed, with billions of pounds to be pumped into the British economy replacing ageing, polluting \ninfrastructure.\u201d\nHowever profits from ScottishPower\u2019s projects will go to Iberdrola\u2019s shareholders \u2013 largely in Spain.\nResponding to today\u2019s CfD auction AR6 results, Emma Pinchbeck, Energy UK\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cAR6 \nrepresents a crucial step in the journey to clean power by 2030. As we recover from an energy crisis caused by our \nexposure to international fossil fuel prices, it\u2019s more important than ever that we build a clean energy system that \ncan ensure our energy security and protect homes and businesses across the country from unaffordable energy \nbills.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThis is by far the cheapest way to power the UK.\u201d\nClaire Coutinho, the shadow energy secretary, said: \u201cI welcome the 5GW of offshore wind contracted in the latest \nrenewable auction which I started last year. Page 3 of 3\nEd Miliband adds \u00a3150 to household bills with wind turbine building spree\n\u201cUnder the Conservatives, Britain built more offshore wind than any other country bar China, thanks to the \ncompetition enabled by CfDs \u2013 which the Conservatives introduced in 2014.\u201d\nJohn Constable, director of Renewable Energy Foundation, a UK charity publishing data on the renewables sector, \nsaid: \u201cEd Miliband is spending consumer funds on a scale that is as reckless as it will be eye-wateringly painful. \nBillions in new subsidies on an offshore wind industry that was only recently claiming to have slashed costs, billions \nto make nuclear viable in markets distorted by wind and solar, and yet more in charges to pay for grid and \nconstraint payments.\u201d\nHe concluded: \u201cThis cannot end well.\u201d\nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesman said it did not recognise the costs per household, but \nrenewable energy remained essential to boost UK energy security. \n\u201cInvesting in renewables is crucial to reverse the legacy of a broken energy policy, so we are no longer reliant on \nvolatile fossil fuel prices which left us vulnerable to a cost of living crisis. These projects will help protect bill payers \npermanently.\u201d\nIndustry experts said the 3.4GW of generation capacity delivered by the auction was far short of what the \nGovernment needed \u2013 leaving a gap of 28GW to be filled by 2026. \nSam Hollister, of energy consultancy LCP Delta said: \u201cThis auction only delivered 3.4GW of new offshore wind \nprojects, with another 1.5GW already in the pipeline. This is well below the levels that were needed in this auction \nfor the UK to reach its target of 55GW of offshore wind by 2030.\u201d\nLoad-Date: September 3, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOnly output one of these values: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and nothing else.\n                ",
