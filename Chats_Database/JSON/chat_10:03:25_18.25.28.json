The latest development saw both \nof them abandon their torrid legal beef on Tuesday after White buckled and agreed to pay an undisclosed \nsettlement amount in the millions of dollars.\nFor that price, Rogan withdrew the raft of unpalatable allegations that she's levelled at the WiseTech founder, \nnamely that he invested in her wellness -business in exchange for sexual relations.\nSpurred by that glowing cinder of scandal, a parade of women have stepped forward to accuse White of \nungentlemanly conduct, including on social media.\nInstead of Instagram, White used LinkedIn to slide into the DMs of the women he fancied. One woman he met, \nJenna Riches, told The Australian that he presented her with a bunch of flowers, which is sweet enough \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 except \nthere was a dildo sticking out among the chrysanthemums. Or perhaps they were roses? Riches never confirmed \nthe genus of flower.\nMore material here is that the staggering drop in WiseTech's share price, the $2bn wipe-out to White's net wealth, \nand the reputational whacking he's received (top of low, bottom of medium on the public shaming scale) could have \nall been buried beneath a pile of NDAs for a fraction of the sum he's now agreed to pay.\nMargin Call has established with impeccable authority that Rogan made an attempt last year to settle her feud with \nWhite for a bargain basement price of about $400,000, or what White probably spends restringing his rare guitars \neach year.\nIt was an offer extended during the early months of 2023, at which point Rogan had been locked out of the \nVaucluse mansion that White had purchased for her - and at a time when Rogan was alleging that White owed her \nmore than $91,400 for the furnishings she had bought. It's that amount that she later successfully sought months \nlater to garnish from his bank account, setting the fuse on this palaver between them.\nPage 2 of 3\nCut price could have solved issue\nA Sydney solicitor (referred to Rogan by someone in the Cranbrook parent network) -approached White's camp \nwith the offer, which was refused, and which must now be regarded as one of the worst decisions ever made by a \nman with much, much more to lose than $400,000.\nWhite, clinging for life to what remains of his good name, chose not to comment on that.\nChange of address If British corporate regulators ever need to write to Fortescue, it's very important that they know \nthe company owns its own building.\nThat's the only conclusion that can be drawn from a bizarre little update to the company records in the UK this week \nof Fortescue Zero, which noted a change of address for the miner's UK subsidiary.\nAnother management shake-up? Or have they moved? Curious if so, given they only bought the \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a316m ($31.1m) \nbuilding a year ago, and moved in in April.\nBut no! On closer examination the address change is little more than a missive to Companies House to announce a \nrebrand had officially arrived in the village of Kidlington, just outside Oxford.\nIn future, rather than writing to Fortescue Zero at Oxford Spires Business Park, correspondence should be \naddressed Fortescue Zero, The Fortescue Building.\nStill, it cost the company a cool \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a38.8m to pay out the lease on its former HQ, according to its financial \nstatements, so you'd probably want to make sure you get full value from the branding where you can.\nFortescue Zero's annual accounts, released at the end of August, show a \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a322m loss for the year - on revenue \nup 45 per cent to \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a3112.6m.\nThe improvement, its directors say, is due to extra business coming in from Fortescue's own decarbonisation \nprograms in Australia. But the extent of Fortescue Zero's remaining outside business is, alas, not clear - the \ncompany has taken advantage of UK rules that allow it to duck reporting related-party transactions in wholly owed \nBritish subsidiaries of offshore companies.\nBlackwattle spray The danger of spraying your opinion around in the name of publicity is that you're always in \ndanger of making yourself look like a bit of a goose.\nTake Sydney investment house Blackwattle Partners.

Blackwattle mid-cap fund manager Tim \nRiordan rushed out a statement decrying the deal as soon as it hit the market, saying it would never, ever vote for \nthe bid without a substantial bump and expressing \"disappointment\" that the board and management had agreed to \nthe deal.\nThat, as an aside, was given short shrift by Arcadium chairman Peter Coleman, who told a Perth newspaper he'd \nnever heard of Blackwattle, hadn't received its letter, and was only taking it on faith that it was a shareholder. \nArcadium wasn't in Blackwattle's top five mid-cap fund holdings in September, by the way, according to its latest \nfund statement.\nBut then the weekend press brought out Blackwattle's Ray David on the subject of lithium, talking up Rio's offer as \npotentially one of the company's finest acquisitions.\n\"Buying low-cost lithium assets such as Arcadium at current lithium prices makes total sense to us as Rio Tinto \nshareholders,\" David said.Page 3 of 3\nCut price could have solved issue\nDavid manages a different Blackwattle fund, to be fair, so there's no suggestion of Takeovers Code breaches.

Some 1.8 \nmillion watched its videos in the past year alone. The courses are aimed at teenagers, those preparing for marriage, \nand couples trying to salvage or \"affair-proof\" their marriage. The courses also preach abstinence before marriage, \ntell married people to serve their partner's sexual needs even when they don't feel like it, and claim that prayer can \ncure illnesses such as cancer.\nMr Hutchinson does not appear in the video courses but is one of 17 directors of the global organisation. He is also \na director of Alpha International and Alpha Australia National Office.\nIn one episode of the Alpha Youth series, Canadian pastor Jason Ballard told his teenage audience that \"Jesus \nwants to guide us\" in our sexuality.\n\"Have you ever thought about the idea that God invented sex? The Bible is clear about it. Sex is designed for a \nman and a woman in the commitment of marriage,\" he said. \"God invented sex, and it has the power to bring \npeople together, build families and give life, and because it is powerful, it can also cause a lot of damage when it is \nmisused.\"\nMr Ballard's comments are one of several instances in Alpha video courses where sex is exclusively depicted as an \nact between a man and a woman.\nFortescue has positioned itself as a champion of sexual and gender diversity and supports this through a dedicated \nemployee group called Fortitude. The company won an award in July from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry \nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue boss leads anti-gay group\nof Western Australia for its diversity program, and in 2022 it painted one of its mining trucks in rainbow colours as a \nshow of support. Fortescue was a supporter of not-for-profit group PrideWA in 2021.\nMr Hutchinson did not respond for a fortnight when asked by The Australian Financial Review whether Alpha's \nmessages were at odds with Fortescue's stated values. He also declined to say whether he was happy for his \nteam at Fortescue to include people in same-sex marriages.\nAs a result of Mr Hutchinson's silence over the past two weeks, his views on same-sex marriage are not known.\nShortly after the Financial Review published this story online yesterday, a Fortescue spokesman issued a \nstatement saying the company was committed to diversity and encouraged people from different faiths and \nbackgrounds to join its workforce.\n\"All our staff live by the Fortescue values in every aspect of their employment, fostering an inclusive, safe working \nenvironment for all employees,\" said the Fortescue spokesman.\nFormer National Australia Bank head Andrew Thorburn was forced to step down as chief executive of AFL club \nEssendon in 2022 because the team believed his religious links clashed with its values.\nMr Thorburn was, at the time, the chairman of City on a Hill Church, which posted at least one sermon that \ncondemned abortion as murder and another that reportedly described homosexuality as a sin.\nThe board of Alpha International also includes British reverend Nicky Gumbel, who has raised concerns with \nChurch of England bishops about their plan to introduce prayers for same-sex couples.\nThe Alpha Youth course also tells its audience that illnesses can be cured by prayer. In one episode, a woman \nnamed Crystal expresses a belief that worship cured her cancer, rather than the chemotherapy she was receiving.\nIn the same episode, Mr Ballard said he watched a cross-eyed girl, Shannah, have her vision fixed by prayer.\n\"I noticed right away when she looked at me, she had been healed. I could see it in her eyes, they were working \ntogether perfectly ... God had healed her.\"\nIn the Alpha marriage course, the host Sila Lee said staying attractive after marriage is an act of kindness to one's \nspouse, encouraging her audience to service their spouse's sexual desires even when they don't feel like it.\n\"Being responsive may mean taking the initiative to make love as a deliberate choice, even though we may be tired \nor feeling stressed by work, or the circumstances don't match up to our highest expectations,\" Ms Lee said.\nThe Hutchinsons became directors of an Australian registered company, Alpha Australia National Office, in \nNovember 2021. A charity of the same name and company number has been registered with the Australian \nCharities and Not-For-Profits Commission since 2013. The charity reported more than $9 million of revenue in the \n18 months to December and donated more than $1 million to Alpha International, the UK company that has counted \nthe Hutchinsons as directors since last year.\nLoad-Date: October 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Peter Ker\nDate: October 24, 2024\nTitle: Fortescue boss leads anti-gay group\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Element Zero up for a fight in spy case\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Angelica Snowden\n### Date: October 24, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nElement Zero up for a fight in spy case\nElement Zero up for a fight in spy case\nThe Australian\nOctober 24, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 641 words\nByline: Angelica Snowden\nBody\nFortescue's would-be green steel competitor Element Zero is challenging a Federal Court's decision to side with \nthe mining giant after it gained legal permission to raid the homes and offices of former employees.\nFortescue got the green light in May to execute search orders on properties and offices linked with ex-Fortescue \nexecutives Bart Kolodziejczyk\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf and Bjorn Winther-Jensen over allegations they stole trade secrets to start their \nown business.\nThe executives, and Michael Masterman, were spied on by private investigators employed by Fortescue in the lead \nup to the raids. Element Zero had claimed the surveillance was excessive, but Federal Court judge Brigitte \nMarkovic accepted it was necessary in response to an application to have the search orders thrown out. Justice \nMarkovic ultimately decided Fortescue was legally -entitled to carry out the search -orders and seize millions of \ndocuments ahead of more court -action, but she acknowledged Andrew Forrest's company made a \"material non-\ndisclosure\" when it failed to alert the court about a commercial relationship between it and Mr Masterman.\n\"I am not satisfied that the EZ respondents have established that Fortescue had a weak prima facie case,\" she \nsaid.\n\"The question is whether evidence of Fortescue's relationship with Element Zero, through Mr Masterman, and the \ndiscussions it had about the different concerns it held in December to January 2024 was capable of having affected \nthe court's decision, in particular in relation to the consideration of the risk of -destruction.
