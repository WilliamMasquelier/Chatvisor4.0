Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 17\nLength: 803 words\nByline: Mark Wembridge\nBody\nFortescue is considering pausing almost $1 billion of approved hydrogen projects in Australia and the United \nStates as it assesses the second Donald Trump administration's attitude to clean energy.\nThe mining group, controlled by Andrew Forrest, cut its full-year capital expenditure forecast by one-fifth to $US400 \nmillion ($630 million) at its energy division, reflecting reduced spending on green fuel projects and their slow \nadoption.\nFortescue warned that Trump's return as US president has called into question the development timeline for its \n$US550 million green hydrogen project in Arizona, after grants promised under the Biden administration had been \nthreatened.\nThe miner is also considering the time frame for its $150 million electrolyser manufacturing facility in the \nQueensland city of Gladstone.\n\"For the Arizona project, the Trump administration has been a flurry of executive action around some sections of \nthe [Inflation Reduction Act] from the grants that come into question and including hydrogen production tax credits,\" \nsaid Fortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson.\n\"Until we have a much clearer view on that, we are being quite cautious about what we're doing. We've spent about \none-fifth of the capex on Arizona, so we're being very cautious, very disciplined about the money we spend. We're \nwaiting on the outcome of several elections globally.\"\nHe said Fortescue remained \"fully committed to hydrogen\", and that more clarity on the projects would be \nannounced at the financial year-end.\nLast July, Fortescue cut 700 jobs and slowed its push into green hydrogen and ammonia by pulling back from its \ncomplex at Gibson Island in Queensland. The miner declined to confirm how many of those job cuts were specific \nto its energy division.\nPage 2 of 2\nHydrogen rethink for Fortescue\nFortescue hopes its Arizona Hydrogen plant, scheduled to begin production in 2026, will spur the decarbonisation \nof heavy transport in southwestern US. Low-carbon \"green\" hydrogen is made by using renewable energy to split \nwater into its constituent parts.\nHowever, Fortescue and rival Woodside Energy have had their commitment to US hydrogen projects questioned \nafter new rules that made it tougher to access government tax credits.\nHutchinson also poured cold water on the outlook for Fortescue's green ammonia projects in Norway and Brazil, \nwhich may not be progressed unless customers are found. \"We're not going to bring [the projects] to the board until \nwe've locked in the buyers,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, South Australia has scrapped its plans to build a green hydrogen plant at Whyalla, marking a blow to \nthe Albanese government's vision for the energy source.\nYesterday's hydrogen setback came as Fortescue's interim profit fell by more than half, prompting the miner to \nslash its dividend. Its shares, which have lost more than one-third of their value over the past 12 months, ended \n6.22 per cent lower at $18.24.\nThe Perth-based Fortescue increased iron ore production to a record high during the December half, shipping 97.1 \nmillion tonnes, as commodity prices sagged.\nThe wobbling Chinese property sector has weighed on prices of the key steel-making ingredient, forcing Australian \niron ore miners to increase production to underpin revenues.\nFortescue posted net profit after tax of $US1.55 billion - less than half the $US3.3 billion reported a year ago and \n12 per cent lower than what analysts expected. Revenue during the final six months of 2024 was down by one-fifth \nat $US7.6 billion.\nInvestors will receive less than half the $1.08 payout they pocketed a year ago. Fortescue proposes to pay a fully \nfranked interim dividend of 50\u00a2 a share. The payout ratio of 65 per cent of Fortescue's net profit was unchanged.\nThe dividend is worth about $560 million to Andrew and Nicola Forrest, who separated in 2023 and collectively \ncontrol 36.7 per cent of the miner.\nFortescue reported higher costs at its troubled $US3.9 billion Iron Bridge project, which the miner warned was \nunlikely to reach its production capacity of 22 million tonnes by its September deadline. Guidance for Fortescue's \nfull-year iron ore shipments remained unchanged, despite disruptions from cyclones in the Pilbara region.\nJarden analyst Jon Bishop said the results undershot consensus expectations, and warned that the falling iron ore \nprice could place future dividends under pressure.\nThe miner did not offer an update on a native title claim that was filed against it and the state of Western Australia. \nThe claim has almost doubled to $1.8 billion.\nThe Yindjibarndi people have sued Fortescue and the state of WA to compensate for lost economic benefits and \ncultural and spiritual damage caused by its Solomon project in the Pilbara.\nFortescue mining boss Dino Otranto declined to discuss the claim, but said the miner had \"never shied away from \nthe right compensation outcome\".\nLoad-Date: February 23, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
