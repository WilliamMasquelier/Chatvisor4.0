While that predictive capability has \nbeen developing for some time, the company also plans to launch more capabilities that make use of generative AI \nto simplify their software and make it easier for people without technical training to operate the tools.\nSplunk, launched in 2003, developed a dashboard that allows users to search, monitor and analyse machine-\ngenerated data. It takes training to use it and generative AI helps reduce the learning curve, according to Mr Steele. \n\"Splunk has its own proprietary language, the way in which you issue commands, and you have to be reasonably \ntechnical to do that,\" he said.\n\"With the AI assistance that we've launched, you can use English language to automatically generate that \nproprietary language. You can get outcomes without having all the advanced knowledge.\" Splunk's AI would benefit \nfrom Cisco's massive amounts of data, not to mention its global presence and sales and marketing channels, Mr \nSteele said.\nGenerative AI will have other applications across Cisco's business, such as simplifying the complex task of setting \na configuration screen for a company's security policy, according to Mr Robbins. \"It's very technical. We're going to \nenable our customers to just use English language to describe what security capabilities they would like \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and \nthen we will translate that into a policy that they would review,\" he said.\nPage 2 of 2\nCisco finalises $42bn Splunk buy\nThe software will function as an assistant, simplifying and speeding up the deployment of security policy and other \nresources without replacing human operators, according to Mr Robbins.\nWhen the deal was announced in September 2023, the companies said it expected it to be completed by the end of \nSeptember 2024. The process was completed in roughly half a year. Last week, the European Union gave the deal \nunconditional antitrust approval, after regulators found it wouldn't pose barriers to competition.

}ell is drilling three appraisal wells in the area \"as part of early-stage exploration in the Bowen Basin\", a \nspokeswoman said. \"The data will be analysed and will inform any further exploration.\"\nThe apparent early success comes as output from the east coast's biggest supply source for the domestic market, \nthe mature Bass Strait petroleum fields held by ExxonMobil and Woodside Energy, has started to dive, risking \nshortfalls on gas on peak winter days, especially in Victoria.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes\nProduction from the Longford plant that processes Bass Strait gas plunged 18.2 per cent in the June quarter, \naccording to consultancy EnergyQuest, noting that peak supply shortfalls hit the east coast in 2022 and again this \npast winter.\nThe firm said that exploration and appraisal success by Elixir and Omega was raising hopes that the Taroom \nTrough could be \"a genuine new source of material supply to the east coast gas market and even backfill for \nQueensland LNG projects\".\nEnergyQuest CEO Rick Wilkinson said the flare reported at the Shell site \"seems to indicate more gas is flowing \nthan the vertical well tested recently by Elixir\", which he said was a \"good sign\" for the application of horizontal well \ntechnology.\nAccessing gas held in such deep sands typically requires the use of horizontal drilling - as used in the US shale \ngas industry - and fracking, a controversial process that helps gas to flow.\nElixir and Omega, between them, have almost 3 trillion cubic feet of \"contingent resources\" - an uncertain measure \nof resource - in \"tight\" sandstones in the Trough, while Shell advised the Queensland government in 2021 that its \nown acreage in the area could hold three tcf of gas resource, EnergyQuest said.\nIt said Shell's investment in a program of multiple, stimulated horizontal wells costing between $100 million and \n$200 million \"adds a lot of credibility\". Elixir, chaired by coal seam gas entrepreneur Richard Cottee, late last month \nreported a successful flow of gas to the surface from its Daydream-2 well in the area.\nOmega, which is backed by Queensland coal seam gas pioneer Tri-Star Group and Brian Flannery's Ilwella Group, \nis now moving the rig used by Shell for its wells to its Canyon site where it expects to start drilling a well on \nSeptember 20 to test the flow of gas in its acreage for the first time.\n\"If we're successful here this could be the next big wave of development post the coal seam gas wave,\" said \nOmega CEO Trevor Brown, a former vice president geoscience at Santos.\nHe said that while the Beetaloo Basin was more advanced in terms of proving up the flow of gas, the Taroom \nTrough had several compelling reasons that gave it a quantifiable commercial advantage.\nLoad-Date: September 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOrganization Context: Provides analysis on gas production and exploration success in the east coast gas market.\n\nOutput ONLY a number from -5 to 5 and nothing else.\n",
