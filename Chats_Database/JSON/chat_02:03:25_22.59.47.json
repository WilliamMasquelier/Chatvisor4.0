Brookfield is purchasing the stake from \ntroubled Danish energy giant \u00d8rsted.\nMr Carney, who was governor of the Bank of England  from 2013 to 2020, is now chairman of Brookfield Asset \nManagement, which has built up a \u00a360bn UK investment portfolio. He retains strong links with the Labour Party and \nespecially with Chancellor Rachel Reeves. \nThe deal, which was announced on the same day as Ms Reeves\u2019 inaugural Budget, marks Brookfield\u2019s first move \ninto the UK\u2019s offshore wind market.\nThe transaction includes stakes in the Hornsea 1 and Hornsea 2 wind farms , which are both in the North Sea, and \nthe Walney Extension and Burbo Bank Extension projects in the Irish Sea. The deal is expected to close by the end \nof this year.\nMr Carney has long been a strong supporter of investment in clean energy. He was instrumental in making the \nBank of England focus on the implications of climate change while at the institution.\nBrookfield\u2019s support for offshore wind comes as Energy Secretary Ed Miliband seeks to radically expand Britain\u2019s \nrenewable energy infrastructure in an effort to decarbonise the country\u2019s electricity grid by 2030. \nConnor Teskey, chief of Brookfield Renewable and president of Brookfield Asset Management, said the company \nwas \u201csupporting the country\u2019s decarbonisation objectives\u201d.\nPage 2 of 2\nMark Carney\u2019s investment group makes \u00a31.8bn bet on UK offshore wind\nHe added: \u201cThis is Brookfield\u2019s first investment in UK offshore wind, which will continue to be a critical part of the \nenergy mix and to support the growing demand we see for clean energy.\u201d\nWind farms are proving increasingly attractive for investors because the UK\u2019s Contract for Difference (CfD) system \nguarantees a minimum price for the power they generate, underwritten by consumer bills. All four farms Brookfield \nis investing in have CfD contracts.\nUnder the deal \u00d8rsted will retain a 37.55pc ownership interest in the wind farms and will operate and maintain \nthem.\nFor \u00d8rsted, the deal is part of a wider battle to restore investor confidence. Earlier this year it announced that it was \ntrimming its investment and capacity targets, pausing dividend payouts and divesting assets, as part of a major \nreview following a period of poor performance.\n\u00d8rsted has also kicked off a search to raise capital for Hornsea 3, a massive 2.9GW wind farm planned for the \nNorth Sea that is expected to cost about \u00a39bn. Options include selling a 50pc stake in advance of construction\nMads Nipper, group President and chief executive of \u00d8rsted, said: \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to welcome Brookfield, a leading \nrenewable energy investor with proven investment and operational expertise, as a partner in four UK offshore wind \nfarms in one of \u00d8rsted\u2019s core strategic markets.\n\u201cToday\u2019s transaction is an important milestone in the farm-down programme as part of our business plan, \nsupporting our significant re-investment in new assets.\u201d\nBrookfield\u2019s other UK holdings include Checkatrade, the online trade directory  connecting homeowners with \ntradespeople such as plumbers and electricians.\nIt also has a 25pc stake in First Hydro, which runs the pumped hydro storage system at Dinorwig in Snowdonia. \nWater is pumped uphill to a reservoir in the Welsh mountains during times of low electricity demand and then \nreleased to spin electrical turbines when demand surges.\nIt also has stakes in Westinghouse, a global nuclear business  that owns the Springfields site in Lancashire, the \nUK\u2019s only nuclear fuels manufacturing centre.\nBrookfield\u2019s backing of Britain comes as Mr Carney helps the new administration to attract international investment.\nThe former Bank governor made a star appearance in a video shown at Labour\u2019s 2023 conference praising Ms \nReeves, then the shadow chancellor, and subsequently advised her on setting up a National Wealth Fund.\nMore controversially, it recently emerged that he had used his connections to lobby ministers  to relax rules on heat \npump subsidies to the potential benefit of Homeserve, a heating and plumbing company also owned by Brookfield.\nBrookfield has said Mr Carney did not raise the issue in meetings where he was representing the company.\nLoad-Date: October 30, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOrganization Context: Operates the pumped hydro storage system at Dinorwig, in which Brookfield has a stake.\n\nDetermine if the portrayal of First Hydro is \"Positive\", \"Neutral\", or \"Negative\" in the article.\nOutput ONLY ONE of these three words and nothing else.\n",
