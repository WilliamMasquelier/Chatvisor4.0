Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Mauro Neves | Managing Director at Incitec Pivot | \"I'm sure they have been doing the numbers.\" | N.A. |\n| Mauro Neves | Managing Director at Incitec Pivot | \"We have been talking about our work with Fortescue on the Gibson Island ammonia plant.\" | N.A. |\n| Mauro Neves | Managing Director at Incitec Pivot | \"We depend on the principal partner FFI (Fortescue Future Industries) to make a decision of initial financial closure on their side.\" | N.A. |\n| Robin Griffin | Metals and Mining Research Head at WoodMac | \"Australian producers in the critical mineral space are likely to continue to need help from taxpayers to combat cheap credit, low energy costs, (and) supportive policies in other jurisdictions.\" | N.A. |\n| Robin Griffin | Metals and Mining Research Head at WoodMac | \"The green hydrogen production credit will be beneficial for project economics no doubt, but our current cost estimates are $US8.30 per kilogram for green hydrogen in Australia.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
