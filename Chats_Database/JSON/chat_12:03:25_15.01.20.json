Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Cisco based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Cisco is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Cisco.\n\nIf Cisco is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 1\nGroovin' on our own route\nGroovin' on our own route\nHobart Mercury (Australia)\nAugust 14, 2024 Wednesday\nHobart Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 19\nLength: 259 words\nByline: Simon McGuire\nBody\nSan Cisco have been a band since 2009, releasing five albums and has establishing themselves as an Australian \nindie pop mainstay.\nHowever, as part of their current tour, the Fremantle trio are visiting and performing in places they have never been.\n\"This is probably one of the most extensive regional runs that we've done,\" guitarist Josh Biondillo said.\n\"The Groovin' the Moo dates we were supposed to do were cancelled due to low ticket sales, and we decided to \nvisit those same areas. And we thought that while we were in those areas, we might as well expand it.\" As the tour \nreaches its tail end, Biondillo said he and bandmates Jordi Davieson and Scarlett Stevens had been thrilled with the \ncrowds they had played to.\n\"They don't get too many bands coming out that way, so when we rolled into the different towns, they really \nreciprocated with the enthusiasm and effort that it's taken for us to get there.\" San Cisco is playing three shows in \nTasmania - one at Lonnies in the state's North on August 22, another at the Uni Bar in Hobart on August 23, and a \nfinal gig at The Forth Pub on August 24.\n\"We love Tasmania. We haven't been down there since Party In the Paddock in February,\" Biondillo said.\n\"I wish Tasmania was my second home.\" The band, which released fifth album Under The Light in March, will return \nto the state in January for the Good Gumnuts Festival in Burnie.\nOther acts performing at the festival include Hockey Dad, Alex Lahey, Josh Pyke, Tia Gostelow and Pacific Avenue. \nTickets are available for the band's forthcoming Tasmanian shows.\nLoad-Date: August 13, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Cisco.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
