Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 5\nLength: 613 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nThe financial endowment behind Andrew and Nicola Forrest's philanthropic Minderoo Foundation is expected to \ngrow towards $40 billion by the end of the decade as the separated couple continue to hand over shares in iron ore \nminer Fortescue Limited.\nIt is understood the Forrests remain in lockstep when it comes to a commitment made in 2013 to give away the \nmajority of their wealth, with more large Fortescue share donations to Minderoo anticipated in the next five years.\nMinderoo Foundation has placed at No.1 on this year's Financial Review Philanthropy 50 list, spending $225 \nmillion. It marks the first time Minderoo has been Australia's biggest-spending foundation since the Philanthropy 50, \ncompiled by JB Were's John McLeod, was first published in 2017.\nMinderoo chief executive John Hartman said yesterday that it was humbling to reflect on how far the foundation had \ncome since it was founded by the Forrests as the Australian Children's Trust in 2001.\nThe Forrests signed up to Bill Gates' and Warren Buffett's The Giving Pledge in 2013, making a commitment to give \naway most of their wealth in their lifetimes. The first big step came in June when they handed over 220 million \nshares in Fortescue to the not-for-profit charity they founded and control. The shares represented about a fifth of \ntheir total shareholding in the Andrew Forrest-led Fortescue and were worth about $5 billion at the time, making \nMinderoo one of the world's largest philanthropic organisations.\nMinderoo shed about 100 jobs last week - roughly a third of its workforce - in a major reset that Mr Hartman said \nwas aimed at ensuring more of the money provided by the Forrests reached intended beneficiaries.\nHe has signalled Minderoo's annual expenditure could more than double in the next few years, with more money \ndirected into collaborations and partnerships as part of a focus on environmental protection and inequality.\n\"Minderoo's capacity to affect meaningful change dramatically increased when the Forrests became the first \nAustralians to sign The Giving Pledge, and generously donated an historic $5 billion to the foundation (last June),\" \nMr Hartman said. \"Such a generous flow of philanthropic capital alone does not guarantee results nor impact. We \nPage 2 of 2\nMinderoo charity heads for $40b as Forrests stump up Fortescue shares\nhave made a tangible difference in the lives of countless Australians and people around the world in the past 23 \nyears (and) we must continue to rigorously hold ourselves to account.\"\nIn making the giving pledge, the Forrests said: \"As a family we agreed many years ago to give away the majority of \nour wealth. We felt that if our children (Grace, Sophia and Sydney) were to inherit considerable wealth, it would only \nget in the way of them striving for and achieving their best, and truly making a positive difference in other people's \nlives.\"\nLast year's share donation took Minderoo's endowment to about $7.6 billion. The total endowment now stands at \nabout $10 billion based on increases in the Fortescue share price, dividends and other investments.\nMinderoo has in recent times focused its efforts on helping vulnerable communities, gender and equality, and \nprotecting oceans. Last year, the biggest-ever grant - $US100 million over nine years - went to a gender fund run by \nUS-registered public charity, Co-Impact, for work aimed at achieving a fairer world for women and girls.\nMr Hartman said Minderoo was going through a transformation as it tried to expose problems to the world and \nprovide solutions. \"It is part of our DNA to hold those responsible to account and use our platform to enable agency \nfor disempowered voices.\"\nThe Financial Review Philanthropy 50 appears in the May issue of AFR Magazine, inside Friday's newspaper.\nLoad-Date: April 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
