Pg. 16\nLength: 683 words\nByline: Angelica Snowden\nBody\nLawyers for Andrew Forrest's Fortescue are doubling down on their legal fight against the company's would-be \n\"green iron\" competitor, telling the Federal Court they were justified securing extraordinary orders to raid their rival's \nhomes and offices after an extensive surveillance operation.\nThe dispute broke out after Federal Court judge Melissa Perry granted search orders to Fortescue in May, allowing \nthe mining giant to take information including mobile phones, laptops and personal Google accounts belonging to \nformer Fortescue executives Bart Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn Winther-Jensen and long-term Forrest lieutenant Michael \nMasterman and their green iron start-up, Element Zero.\nFortescue alleged the three men who founded Element Zero stole the mining giant's confidential intellectual \nproperty; that being how to produce so-called green iron - a carbon dioxide-free technology - to launch their own \ncompany.\nOn Tuesday, Fortescue barrister Julian Cooke SC said the scope of items taken from Ele-ment Zero properties \nand businesses was necessary and the \"extent\" of a surveillance operation carried out by private investigator \nRobert Lancaster before the raids was a \"collateral issue\".\n\"(There was) a real risk if information (about the pending court case) was provided in advance, there was a real risk \nthat information might have been destroyed, hidden or squirrelled away,\" Mr Cooke said.\nLater, Mr Cooke said Element Zero's argument that Fortescue's surveillance - which included following the wives of \nDr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen to Kmart, rummaging through their mail and taking pictures of Element \nZero offices and plant - was conducted in \"bad faith\" should be rejected.\n\"It's true the private investigator reports are detailed, but so what?\" he said. \"They reflect the standard basis on \nwhich reports are commissioned.\" In their bid to have the search orders thrown out, Element Zero barrister David \nStuddy SC on Monday argued that Fortescue failed to tell Justice Perry that Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-\nJensen were instructed to work from home in the weeks before they left Fortescue, and since their IT access was \ncut off they were forced to work on their own devices and asked to delete some documents because there were \nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue insists spying on families wasn't inappropriate\ncopies. Mr Cooke said Element Zero's bid to have the search orders discharged was a \"cynical attempt\" to prevent \nhis client from viewing material seized in raids and to delay filing their defence.\n\"The discharge application has been a monumental waste of time and is a distraction from the real issues to be \ndecided,\" he said.\nDocuments and emails referred to intellectual property concepts about \"green\" projects, including the green iron \nconcept, the court was told. Mr Cooke said the evidence before Justice Perry supported her conclusion that \nFortescue had a \"strong prima facie case\" in favour of granting the search orders.\nSignificantly, he denied Ele-ment Zero's claim that Justice Perry should have been told they were co-operating with \nFortescue to allay the mining giant's concerns in December last year and January this year by meeting with it to \ndiscuss technical differences between the organisations' green technologies - before she approved the search \norders.\n\"Mr Masterman was co-operating because he wanted to persuade Fortescue there were no relevant similarities \nbetween the Element Zero electrochemical reduction process and the Fortescue electrochemical reduction process \nso that Fortescue would not bring a case on any such claim,\" Mr Cooke said.\n\"Fortescue's pleaded case \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is (not) that the Element Zero process is the same or similar to the Fortescue \nparticle process.\n\"Rather, the respondent misused what's defined as the Fortescue Confidential information - the ionic liquid \nresearch and development which is fundamentally different from the Fortescue particle process.\" Mr Cooke said \nFortescue also claims Element Zero misused its confidential plant information.\nMr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk were in court for Tuesday's hearing. Federal Court judge Brigitte Markovic has \nreserved her judgment in the interlocutory matter.\nLoad-Date: August 20, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's founder | \"Fortescue insists spying on families wasn't inappropriate.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke | Fortescue barrister | \"(There was) a real risk if information (about the pending court case) was provided in advance, there was a real risk that information might have been destroyed, hidden or squirrelled away.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke | Fortescue barrister | \"The discharge application has been a monumental waste of time and is a distraction from the real issues to be decided.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke | Fortescue barrister | \"Fortescue had a 'strong prima facie case' in favour of granting the search orders.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke | Fortescue barrister | \"Mr Masterman was co-operating because he wanted to persuade Fortescue there were no relevant similarities between the Element Zero electrochemical reduction process and the Fortescue electrochemical reduction process so that Fortescue would not bring a case on any such claim.\" | N.A. |\n| Julian Cooke | Fortescue barrister | \"Fortescue also claims Element Zero misused its confidential plant information.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Former Fortescue executive | \"Fortescue's pleaded case \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is (not) that the Element Zero process is the same or similar to the Fortescue particle process.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
