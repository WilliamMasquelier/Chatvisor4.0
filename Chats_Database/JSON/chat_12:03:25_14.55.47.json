Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: FEATURES; Pg. 36\nLength: 584 words\nByline: Michael Stutchbury\nBody\nLeaders Paul Keating reserves special praise for visionary change-makers in banking, mining and \nentrepreneurship, writes Michael Stutchbury.\nWhen asked to name the business people who impressed him the most during his long political career, Paul \nKeating starts with Keith Campbell, former head of the Hooker real estate company. Campbell's landmark financial \nsystem review in the late 1970s laid out the intellectual case for Labor's financial deregulation and the floating of the \ndollar.\nRod Carnegie, now 91, also draws praise from Keating in an exclusive interview with The Australian Financial \nReview to mark his 80th birthday. Carnegie set up McKinsey in Australia and sought to Australianise CRA, now \nknown as Rio Tinto, as CEO in the 1980s. \"He was a progressive thinking guy and an economic nationalist,\" \nKeating says.\nOn the other hand, it's hard to pick a banker given the banks hold public licences, Keating says.\nAnother on Keating's list of business greats is former BHP boss Marius Kloppers, who \"broke the back\" of \nnegotiating contract pricing in 2010 in favour of using market spot prices for Australia's iron ore exports. \"You've got \nto give him big, big marks for that,\" Keating says.\nPressed about his complaint about a lack of outward-looking entrepreneurs in the modern Australian economy that \nhe helped create, Keating accepts there are some. He points to Fortescue Minerals' Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest, \nalong with Atlassian founders Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, and Canva founders Melanie Perkins and \nCliff Obrecht.\nBut the business person that merits a story is Ian McLennan, general manager and chairman of BHP between 1967 \nand 1977. McLennan helped drive the company's search for oil in Bass Strait and gas in the North West Shelf.\nThe story takes place in 1975 - just after the defeat of the Whitlam government - when Keating was appointed \nshadow minister for minerals and resources.\nPage 2 of 2\nMovers, shakers caught PM's eye\nMcLennan caught a train to Keating's electorate office in Bankstown, a suburb in south-west Sydney, on a Saturday \nmorning. He told the young Labor frontbencher that BHP had a chance of buying the exploration leases of the \ntroubled British oil company, Burmah, in the highly prospective North West Shelf.\nBut with the prospect of a very long lead time for the major gas development, McLennan said BHP would not make \nthe investment if the Labor opposition held to the policy of its previous resources minister, Rex Connor, that the gas \nshould be controlled by the government and used for local industry rather than be exported to Japan.\n\"I said, 'Sir Ian, you will be very pleased with my answer',\" Keating said. \"I thought that Rex had made huge \nmistakes in this because this is a gas-prone continent. And anyone who puts a contract before us, we should sign \nand anyone who wants to capitalise on it, we should grab in a foot tackle and get their signature on the page.\"\nThat convinced BHP to buy part of Burmah's stake in what became Australia's biggest ever resource project. And \nso began the nation's liquefied natural gas export industry.\nKeating then wrote support for the North West Shelf project into the Labor Party's policy platform at its 1977 \nconference in Perth. The other part of the stake was bought by Shell, which played a big role in building the project. \nKeating recalls travelling to Tokyo three times with Shell's Ric Charlton to talk to Japanese bankers and gas \nbuyers. And he was impressed with Shell Australia boss and International Olympic Committee member Kevan \nGosper.
