BHP and Woolworths have also moved away from using carbon \noffsets.\nCompanies in the past have offered products which are \"carbon neutral\", based on the fact that consumers or the \ncompany itself have bought carbon offsets sufficient to offset the emissions impact of the product's production.\nThe trend now is to focus on reducing actual emissions rather than buying financial instruments to offset them, \nhowever for many companies there is a level beyond which it is difficult to abate, and for which offsets remain the \nmechanism by which this can be achieved.\nFortescue is aiming for what it calls Real Zero, which involves using no fossil fuels or offsets in its Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions profiles.\nPage 2 of 2\nAnother company ditches offsets\n\"Fortescue has a plan to decarbonise our Australian terrestrial iron ore operations (Scope 1 and 2) in the Pilbara \nby 2030,\" the company says.\n\"We have identified the solutions needed to eliminate approximately 90 per cent of terrestrial \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 emissions from our \nAustralian iron ore operations and are actively working to identify solutions for the final approximately 10 per cent.\" \nMacquarie, in a research note entitled \"Carbon neutral no more\", points out that Google recently announced it was \nno longer maintaining operational carbon neutrality, having bought three million tonnes of offsets in 2022, while \nShell has withdrawn its carbon offset targets, and several airlines, including Delta, Easy Jet and JetBlue, have \ncanned their carbon neutral schemes.\nMacquarie says this is being driven by both credibility concerns and regulatory scrutiny.\nMacquarie says there are particular quality concerns around international offsets, and says almost 80 per cent of \nthe offsets used by Australian listed companies under the Climate Active scheme were international. Last year, the \nfederal government announced a review of the Climate Active certification.\nLoad-Date: September 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\nNone\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
