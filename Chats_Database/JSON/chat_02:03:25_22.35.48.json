Orsted is a major player in the sector and is set to build an \u00a38bn offshore \nwind farm in the North Sea by the end of 2027 to power more than 3.3m UK homes.\nGraphic\n \nBlow: Orsted is the largest offshore wind developer\nLoad-Date: August 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOnly output one of these values: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and nothing else.\n                ",
