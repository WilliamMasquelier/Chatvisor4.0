Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's CEO | \"Fortescue are here when we have projects all over the world because we believed the IRA meant that the leadership of China [in decarbonisation] was going to be taken by North America, and North America would become the green energy nation of the world.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's CEO | \"But the fine print, which is known as 45V ... that's a really stupid name ... has been shoved into the IRA legislation to do everything it can to kill off what is the saviour in energy for humanity and every organic life on Earth, and that is green electrons and green hydrogen.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's CEO | \"You deserve much better than faceless people wandering around with chequebooks full of lobbying money putting a landmine into the law.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue's CEO | \"They masquerade as environmentalists, and they're not. I can tell you that it is paid for by the fossil fuel sector.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
