It's just a number that they can afford \nto get their ESG (environment, social and governance) approval under their belt.\n\"Pretty much anybody who has done a compensation deal is paying more than the Federal Court will award (in the \nYindjibarndi case).\nPage 2 of 3\nNative title surprise for WA miners\n\"There is a lot of water to go under this particular bridge, but if the court lands on a figure of $5m to $10m, then a lot \nof people are going to be needing to look very carefully at what they're offering moving forward.\n\"Because it's great to be a nice guy but if you're a director of a company, you've actually got to look after your \nshareholders as well.\" Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation boss Michael Woodley said the government's \nassessment was shameful and hypocritical.\nThe Yindjibarndi allege Fortescue destroyed more than 240 culturally significant sites - including rock shelters \nsimilar to those at the centre of Juukan Gorge debacle involving Rio Tinto - in building and operating the Solomon \nmine. The group's total claim, including factors like economic loss and community division, is $1.8bn.\nMr Woodley said that by devaluing Aboriginal heritage the WA government risked a backlash that could see \ntraditional owner groups withdraw from other negotiations with miners.\nNational Native Title Council president Kado Muir condemned the WA government and accused it of \"low balling\" \nthe deep pain and suffering caused by the destruction of important heritage and spiritual sites.\nThe WA government did not respond to questions from The Australian on the issue, including whether its position in \nthe Yindjibarndi case delegitimised the much larger sums of money it had paid out in striking far-reaching native title \nsettlements in the South West, Mid West and Goldfields regions of WA.\nFortescue and the WA government were left exposed to the Yindjibarndi compensation claim in 2020 when the \nHigh Court denied the Forrest-controlled mining company special leave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings that \nin effect meant a large part of Solomon was built without the permission of the traditional owners.\nThe Federal Court had granted the Yindjibarndi exclusive native title over 2700sq km in the iron ore-rich Pilbara, \nwhich in effect recognises them as private owners of the highest legal standing with a spiritual connection that \nallows them to decide who mines the land.\nMr Woodley, who has been leading the Yindjibarndi battle with Fortescue for about 18 years, said he was appalled \nthe WA government could argue the destruction of hundreds of heritage sites amounted to such a small financial \npenalty in terms of compensation.\n\"This position of the state government takes us back 50 years to that colonial mentality and attitudes that they can \ncome in and take what they want,\" Mr Woodley said.\nFortescue has exported more than $50bn of iron ore from Solomon since 2013 and the mine is expected to \ncontinue operating for decades. The WA government has pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties from \nthe mine.\nFortescue was granted approval to damage or destroy 249 sites across the area under section 18 of WA's \nAboriginal Heritage Act, the same legislation that gave Rio the legal authority to destroy the Juukan Gorge rock \nshelters in 2019.\nArchaeologists have told the court there were five rock-shelter sites within Solomon \"which by virtue of their great \nage and repeated occupation through time are, in our opinion, based on our study, training and experience as \narchaeologists, of national significance\".\nMr Woodley said: \"This is a big area of land that has been cleared for mining. There's been interference with river \nsystems and the environment, not to mention our heritage sites, some dating back 50,000 years, and that's worth \n$5m-$10m? Come on. The state government may as well say in its argument that we don't exist or shouldn't exist.\n\"There are implications on both sides. There is the miner who might think that he's paying too much now that the \nstate government has set a bar this low. Then there are implications for First Nations groups.\" Mr Woodley said \ntraditional owners might question their involvement in discussions and approval processes.Page 3 of 3\nNative title surprise for WA miners\n\"We might even use this as a gathering of First Nations to stand up now for our rights and say we're going to put a \nstop to all mining activities on our land and not partake in any form of approval process,\" he said.\nMr Muir accused the WA government of trying to cover its backside in terms of compensation, despite the royalty \nriches it reaped from mining on land covered by native title.\n\"It is just a poor reflection on their thinking and where they're at,\" he said. \"Low-balling the deep pain and suffering \nof spiritual value is poor form but not unexpected given the atrocious track record of this WA government approval \n(of) wanton section 18 destruction and desecration of sites, compounded by their ridiculous backflip in heritage \nprotection reform.\" The WA government spent five years working on new Aboriginal heritage laws that scrapped \nsection 18 powers to damage heritage sites without consent, but scrapped the legislation just five weeks after it was \nrolled out. Fortescue has argued any compensation due to the Yindjibarndi should be funded by the state because \nit granted the mining tenements covering the traditional lands of the Yindji-barndi. The WA government maintains \nFortescue should pay.\nThe Yindjibarndi rejected a Fortescue's offer of a $4m annual payment over the anticipated life of the Solomon \nproject, worth around $120m at one point in the long-running dispute. It is understood BHP and Rio pay royalties of \nabout 0.5 per cent of mining revenue to traditional owner groups in the Pilbara.\nThe WA government is liable to pay compensation to the Yindjibarndi under the terms of the Native Title Act but \nclaims any liability shifts to Fortescue under a provision in the WA Mining Act. Fortescue has said the relevant \nsection of the Mining Act is unconstitutional. Gilbert + Tobin's Mr McKenna said there were valid reason why \nresource companies would reach agreements with traditional owner groups that took into account more than just \nexposure to compensation claims, including the importance of social licence to operate and a desire to avoid \nlengthy delays.\nLoad-Date: February 23, 2025\nEnd of Document\n        ",
