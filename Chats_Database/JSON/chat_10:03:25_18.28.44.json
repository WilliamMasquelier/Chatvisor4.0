Traders have priced out the chance of a rate cut by the RBA this year, with \ninvestors instead expecting a 25-basis-point cut early next year.\nAmid a recent run of stronger than expected job numbers, HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham also cautioned that \nthe -labour market would probably have to loosen before the RBA would be confident it could move to cut interest \nrates. \"We've had a pick-up in wages growth, at the same time that we've had quite a weak productivity \nperformance,\" Mr Bloxham said On the local bourse, tech stocks were the top performers, rising 1.7 per cent, \nfollowing a rally on the Nasdaq. WiseTech jumped 2.7 per cent to $91.60 and Xero climbed 1.6 per cent to $121.57.\nResources stocks were mixed. Fortescue fell 0.8 per cent to $24.60 and Rio Tinto fell 0.2 per cent to $129.57, \nwhile BHP advanced 0.2 per cent to $45.50.\nPage 2 of 2\nASX up as investors look to CPI\nGold miners continued their sell-off as the appeal of the safe haven asset faded due to dissipating tensions \nbetween Israel and Iran.
