Suppression orders covering the case were only partially lifted by Justice Logan on Tuesday, \nbut the case centres around allegations made by Fortescue that Element Zero directors used confidential \nFortescue intellectual property about Fortescue's green iron - carbon-dioxide free - technology to found their own \ncompany.\nLoad-Date: June 6, 2024\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue launched raids\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder and CEO of Fortescue | \"Fortescue sought the co-called Anton Pillar orders after accusing all three men of taking Fortescue's intellectual property with them when they quit the iron ore and would-be green energy giant.\" | N.A. |\n| Bart Kolodziejczyk | Former Chief Scientist at Fortescue | \"Fortescue's claims were 'spurious' and 'entirely without merit'.\" | N.A. |\n| Michael Masterman | Long-term lieutenant of Andrew Forrest | \"Fortescue's claims were 'spurious' and 'entirely without merit'.\" | N.A. |\n| Bjorn Winther-Jensen | Former staff member at Fortescue | \"Fortescue's claims were 'spurious' and 'entirely without merit'.\" | N.A. |\n| John Logan | Federal Court Judge | \"Other affidavits \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 give pause for thought about whether, as the Fortescue parties have alleged, there was 'industrial scale misuse', or rather whether what occurred in the obtaining of the search orders, and the obtaining of material upon their execution, was what one might describe as an 'industrial-scale forensic debacle'.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
