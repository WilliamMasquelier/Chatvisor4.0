[Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has never had an Indigenous land use agreement with the Yindjibarndi people, despite mining on their land for over a decade, leading to a $500 million compensation claim for unpaid royalties, interest, and damages for cultural and spiritual losses, which could result in a significant financial and reputational impact on the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued in court that compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should not be based on the value of the minerals extracted from their land, despite industry standards where native title holders receive a percentage of royalties, raising concerns about the company's approach to Indigenous compensation. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest held private meetings in a Perth park with Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation leader Michael Woodley in an attempt to settle a billion-dollar compensation case, but the talks failed as the parties remain hundreds of millions of dollars apart, highlighting the ongoing dispute and lack of resolution. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue is facing a potential $1 billion compensation claim from the Yindjibarndi people, including $500 million for economic losses and an additional $500 million for the destruction of more than 240 culturally significant sites, which could have major financial and reputational consequences for the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue was left exposed to the Yindjibarndi compensation claim in 2020 after the High Court denied the company special leave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings, which found that a large part of its Solomon iron ore mining hub was built without permission from traditional owners, raising legal and ethical concerns about its operations. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued that any compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should be funded by the State of Western Australia because it granted the mining tenements, but the WA government maintains that Fortescue should pay, creating further uncertainty over the company's financial liability. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Institutional investors are increasingly avoiding Fortescue, making it the least-held stock among the 10 largest companies on the ASX, with concerns over its lower iron ore grades, high executive turnover, and heavy spending on unprofitable green hydrogen projects. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been ranked as the \"least-loved\" stock among major Australian companies in a JPMorgan survey of 50 fund managers, reflecting ongoing skepticism about its business strategy and financial stability. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Analysts and brokers have been bearish on Fortescue for an extended period, with most maintaining a sell rating on the stock since November 2022, in contrast to competitors BHP and Rio Tinto, which have never held a majority sell rating since at least 2009. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue lost its final buy rating in January after JPMorgan's head of Australian resources advised investors to take profits, with the stock subsequently falling more than 10% from its peak in early February, raising concerns about its valuation and future performance. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's unconventional management style under Andrew Forrest has left the investment community baffled, with concerns that the company's entrepreneurial approach lacks the structured management seen in competitors like BHP and Rio Tinto. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been criticized for its approach to Indigenous compensation, with an expert witness arguing in court that the company\u2019s attempt to exclude the value of minerals from compensation calculations is \"nonsensical\" and unfair to the Yindjibarndi people. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue began mining at the Solomon hub in 2013 without an agreement from the Yindjibarndi\u2019s registered native title body and instead dealt with a breakaway group, raising ethical concerns about its treatment of traditional owners. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has slammed the Biden administration\u2019s proposed hydrogen incentive rules, arguing that they could triple the cost of low-carbon hydrogen projects and stifle growth in the sector, potentially impacting the company\u2019s green energy ambitions. [Australian Financial Review, Peter Ker, April 22, 2024]. - Fortescue's iron ore shipments fell 6% in the March quarter compared to the same period last year due to a derailment in late December and weather disruptions, raising concerns about the company's logistics resilience and ability to meet its full-year shipment targets. [The Age, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's Iron Bridge project continues to face significant operational issues, with a faulty water pipeline and plant inefficiencies slowing output, forcing the company to undertake costly repairs and reconfigure its processing plant, which could delay production targets. [The Age, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has forecast that its full-year iron ore shipments will likely come in at the lower end of its guidance range due to operational setbacks, including a derailment and adverse weather, which could impact revenue and investor confidence. [Seeking Alpha, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's Iron Bridge magnetite project has suffered another production downgrade, with expected shipments now reduced to just 2 million tonnes, significantly below previous guidance, highlighting ongoing challenges in ramping up the project. [The Australian, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's iron ore exports dropped 11% from the December quarter, and the decline in shipments pushed up average C1 cash costs by 7% to $18.93 per tonne, increasing operational expenses and potentially squeezing profit margins. [The Australian, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue will need to maintain near-record export rates to meet its full-year shipment guidance, requiring an ambitious 53.5 million tonnes in the June quarter, which may be difficult given recent logistical and operational setbacks. [The Daily Telegraph, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's Gibson Island hydrogen project has been sidelined despite receiving a $13.7 million government grant, with the company citing high Australian power prices as a major obstacle, raising doubts about the financial viability of its domestic green hydrogen ambitions.

Dr Forrest had received mostly positive coverage in the \npaper, which lasted until a few months after Fortescue struck the truck deal in June 2022, after negotiations with \nWesTrac stalled over the vehicles' fuel systems.\n\"I made it really clear if they don't change that stance, I don't bluff,\" he said in February last year when asked about \nthe contract.\nSome of the critical stories appeared on the front page, hurting Dr Forrest's reputation and likely damaging morale \nat Fortescue.\nThe West Australian does not have a state-based competitor, and Mr Stokes controls the Seven television network, \nwhich broadcasts the most popular news bulletin in Perth. Facing off against a local media monopolist, Dr Forrest \ndecided to record the video for his staff to present his side of the story.\n\"Everyone loves positive disruption and improvement in technology and in society, except perhaps when it happens \nto them,\" he said. \"This, I believe, is the case and what has inspired the biased, inaccurate reporting of The West.\"\nMr Stokes, 83, comes from an era when media proprietors freely used their outlets to help their business interests. \nHe feels that he is unfairly criticised by bigger media companies based on the east coast, according to a person \nwho knows him.\nSeven West Media, which owns The West Australian, is worth $310 million.

After all, \nthe bloke couldn't spend the rest of his life playing golf, partying with Lindsay Fox and triggering Steve Price.\nSo we can now reveal that Andrews has teamed up with West Australian mining billionaire Andrew \"Twiggy\" \nForrest and his iron ore giant Fortescue to help fulfil Twiggy's dream of selling 100 million tonnes of \"green\" iron to \nChina.\nIt's not clear exactly how this thing came to pass, but sources close to the action tell us that Andrews, who is taking \non the Fortescue work through his consultancy, Forty Eight and Partners, gave a presentation at the Boao Forum \nfor Asia in China's Hainan Province in March.\nForrest, a major sponsor of the event, was also present, and the two men appear to have clicked.\nThe green iron plan aims to deliver vast quantities of the metal to market after stripping carbon emissions from the \nextraction, processing and supply chain operations by using - and this could be the tricky bit - 8 million tonnes of \nrenewable hydrogen each year.\nSo, Forrest is thinking big. But then Andrews never saw a large project he didn't like, if we overlook the East West \nLink and the Commonwealth Games. So this thing makes sense on that level.\nIt's also been a winning approach for Forrest in the past. The Fortescue chairman - who, like Whitney Houston, \nbelieves that children are our future - hired another former long-serving Labor premier, South Australia's Jay \nWeatherill, in 2019 to lead the Thrive by Five early childhood education campaign that the miner established with \nhis then-wife, Nicola Forrest.\nNeither Forrest nor Andrews were available on Sunday to chat, leaving CBD to ponder alone the many questions \nraised by this news.

So maybe don't hold your \nbreath for a powerful work of the imagination.\nThe initial signs are promising though, with Auerbach running his first chapter past an artificial intelligence program \n- you can do that these days - which gave the former print journalist's literary efforts as warm a review as you could \nhope for. From a machine.\nBut litigation-obsessed CBD worries that Auerbach might be entering legally fraught territory, what with all the \ndefamation cases launched after Higgins first made her allegation that Lehrmann raped her in Parliament House in \n2019.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 18\nLength: 620 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nFortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest and oil and gas producer Woodside Energy have emerged as \nunlikely allies in the fight over legislative changes they say are threatening hydrogen projects in the United States.\nThe two biggest Perth-based companies on the ASX have found common ground in lobbying against plans by US \nTreasury officials to restrict the availability of tax credits for hydrogen developments through the Biden \nadministration's Inflation Reduction Act. Both companies had counted on access to those incentives to underpin \ntheir US hydrogen ventures.\nDr Forrest has warned the provisions, known as 45V, threaten to \"kill off\" Fortescue's $US550 million ($836 million) \nhydrogen project in Arizona. Woodside has similar concerns about its H2OK project in Oklahoma, a key plank in the \ncompany's decarbonisation strategy.\nIn a submission to officials in the US, Woodside has warned that instead of incentivising hydrogen production, 45V \nwould add costly requirements that are \"virtually impossible to meet\". Woodside has committed more than $100 \nmillion in procuring equipment for H2OK.\nOf particular concern for Woodside and Fortescue is a requirement that requires companies accessing tax credits \nto match each hour of production to an hour of renewable power consumption. The rule is designed to ensure \nsubsidies are not given to hydrogen made from fossil fuel power during times when solar and wind power are \nunavailable.\nWoodside's H2OK plan involves using electricity from Oklahoma's power grid to run electrolysers to produce liquid \nhydrogen. It would source renewable energy certificates to offset the emissions from the non-renewable power \nincluded in that supply.\nFortescue also plans to use renewable energy certificates in Arizona.\nWoodside wants the US to instead offer annual - rather than hourly - matching. Hourly matching raises the spectre \nof having to shut down plants when wind and solar power is unavailable to maintain tax credit status.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue, Woodside allies on green hydrogen\nIn a submission to the government, Woodside said: \"Switching to hourly matching would require the procurement of \nthe type of electrolyser that can ramp up and down in response to intermittent renewable electricity. These issues \nwill increase costs, resulting in an increased levelised cost hydrogen in an already challenging macroeconomic \nenvironment.\"\nWoodside is pushing for annual matching to apply to hydrogen projects that start construction before the end of \n2027 and 10-year grandfathering of annual matching for first-movers.\nIn a similar submission, Fortescue is pushing for annual matching to apply for projects that start production before \nthe end of 2028 and 10-year grandfathering. Fortescue says it is \"difficult to have confidence\" in the feasibility of its \nproject without changes to the 45V proposal.\nSpeaking this month in Buckeye, Arizona, where Fortescue plans to build its hydrogen project, Dr Forrest claimed \nthat lobbyists for big oil and gas producers were behind the draft provisions in 45V.\nHe has previously criticised Woodside, Australia's biggest oil and gas producer, and its chief executive Meg O'Neill, \ndescribing her as \"hard-edge trained by the biggest liar we've ever seen around climate change over the last 40 \nyears, and that's ExxonMobil\".\n\"Can we please look at the fact that Meg is driving an agenda to get carbon bombs going as quickly as possible,\" \nhe said in an incendiary interview last year. He separately told the ABC that fossil fuel executives should have their \nheads \"put on spikes\", and said Ms O'Neill was \"peddling poison\".\nWoodside accused Dr Forrest of using \"violent imagery\" and resorting to \"personal vitriol\". \"Such language sets a \nterrible example for public debate and should be condemned,\" it said.\nLoad-Date: May 16, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Brad Thompson\nDate: May 14, 2024\nTitle: Fortescue, Woodside allies on green hydrogen\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Hydrogen credit could blow its $6.7b allocation\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Ben Potter\n### Date: May 16, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nHydrogen credit could blow its $6.",
