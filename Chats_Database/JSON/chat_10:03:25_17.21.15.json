The Information \nTechnology (-2.52%), Materials (-2.02%), and Financials (-1.89%) sectors led the declines.\nIn contrast, the Consumer Staples (-0.65%), Industrials (-0.68%), and Utilities (-1.11%) sectors fared slightly better, \noutperforming the broader market.\nInvestor sentiment took a hit following a hawkish rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, just days before Christmas. \nThe index plummeted 180 points in early trading before recovering slightly to finish the session down 141 points, \nerasing gains made after the US election.\n\"We believe the sell-off on Wall Street that inspired yesterday's carnage was more likely a position wash than the \nresult of an unexpected policy shift. For that reason, we think the Santa Claus rally has been postponed rather than \ncancelled,\" IG Markets analyst Tony Sycamore noted. \nWall Street flat after big selloff\nUS stock markets closed relatively unchanged overnight after the prior session's Fed-induced selloff. The Dow \nJones Industrial Average rose by 14 points, breaking a ten-session losing streak.\nPage 2 of 3\nThe morning catch up: ATO to dip again as Wall Street flattens out\nOn the economic front, the final estimate for third-quarter GDP was revised upwards to 3.1%, compared to the \nprevious 2.8%. Additionally, initial jobless claims fell by 22,000 to 220,000 in the first week of December, \noutperforming market expectations of 230,000.\nThe data highlights the resilience of the US economy and aligns with the Federal Reserve's outlook that fewer \ninterest rate cuts may be required in the coming year.\nThe Fed's more hawkish tones were not something that risk markets were prepared for just six days out from \nChristmas and were the catalyst to flush some of the speculative excesses that flowed into risk assets, including \nstocks and Bitcoin, following the US election,\" Sycamore said. \"Looking ahead, attention turns to tonight's Core \nPCE inflation data, which is expected to rise to 2.9% YoY in November, up from 2.8% prior. The rates market is \npricing in 36 bp of rate cuts for 2025 rebounding from the 31bp we saw post the FOMC meeting yesterday.\"\nEuropean retreat\nEuropean sharemarkets declined on Thursday as investors retreated from riskier assets following the US Federal \nReserve's signal of a slower pace of interest rate cuts in 2024.\nThe real estate sector, particularly sensitive to interest rate movements, led the losses, falling 2.4%, with technology \nshares matching the decline.\nThe Bank of England maintained its benchmark interest rate at 4.75%, in line with expectations, though \npolicymakers were divided on the decision to hold rates steady.\nMeanwhile, Sweden's central bank reduced its key interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, as anticipated, and \nNorway's central bank left its policy rate unchanged at a 16-year high of 4.50%.\nThe continent-wide FTSEurofirst 300 index slid 1.5%, while the UK's FTSE 100 index in London declined 1.1%.\nCurrencies and commodities\nCurrencies mixed as US dollar strengthens\nCurrencies showed mixed movements against the US dollar in European and US trade on Thursday. \n  \n\u2022 The euro declined from US$1.0421 to US$1.0354 and settled near US$1.0360 at the US close.   \n\u2022 The Australian dollar rose from 62.13 US cents to 62.63 US cents before finishing near 62.40 US cents.   \n\u2022 The Japanese yen weakened from 154.99 yen per US dollar to JPY157.80, closing around JPY157.40.\nCommodities retreat on cautious monetary outlook\nGlobal oil prices fell as central bankers in the US, Europe, and Asia signalled a cautious approach to easing \nmonetary policy, raising concerns about reduced economic activity impacting oil demand in 2024. \n  \n\u2022 Brent crude dropped by 51 US cents, or 0.7%, to US$72.88 per barrel.  \n\u2022 US Nymex crude fell by 67 US cents, or 0.9%, to US$69.91 per barrel.\nBase metal prices also retreated, weighed down by a stronger US dollar, which climbed to a near two-year high \nafter the US Federal Reserve indicated a slower pace of rate cuts in 2024. \n  \n\u2022 Copper futures fell 1.9%.  \n\u2022 Aluminium futures declined 0.8%.  \n\u2022 Gold prices slid as US economic data reinforced expectations of cautious monetary policy from the Federal \nReserve.

This transaction highlights Ramelius's strategic focus on divesting non-core assets while potentially enhancing Leeuwin's portfolio.\n\n2. **Market Sentiment Impacting Gold Prices**: The article notes a significant decline in gold prices, with futures dropping by 1.7% to US$2,608.10 an ounce. This downturn is attributed to cautious monetary policy signals from the US Federal Reserve, which could affect Ramelius Resources' operational profitability and investor sentiment in the gold sector.\n\n3. **Broader Market Decline**: The ASX200 experienced a sharp decline, with the Materials sector, which includes gold mining companies like Ramelius, falling by 2.02%. This broader market trend may reflect investor concerns about economic conditions and could impact Ramelius's stock performance and market positioning.\n\n4. **Speculative Excesses in Risk Assets**: The article discusses a sell-off in risk assets, including gold, following the US Federal Reserve's hawkish stance. This environment may lead to increased volatility for Ramelius Resources as it navigates market fluctuations and investor expectations in the gold mining sector.\n\n5. **Future Outlook for Gold Mining**: With the Federal Reserve indicating a slower pace of interest rate cuts, the outlook for gold mining companies, including Ramelius Resources, may be challenged. The cautious monetary policy could dampen demand for gold as a safe-haven asset, impacting future exploration and drilling activities in the Australian market.",
