It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nShell sues Woodside and Paladin over $87m oil platform clean-up bill\nShell sues Woodside and Paladin over $87m oil platform clean-up bill\nThe Daily Telegraph (Australia)\nMay 31, 2024 Friday\nTelegraph Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 58\nLength: 315 words\nByline: Cameron England\nBody\nEnergy giant Shell is suing Woodside Energy and Paladin Resources for $86.6m for the clean-up bill for the \nNorthern Endeavour oil platform, saying it struck agreements almost two decades ago which absolved it of any \nresponsibility to pay remediation costs.\nThe question of who should pay to remediate Northern Endeavour, on Western Australia's North West Shelf, and \nabandoned oil and gas projects more broadly, prompted the previous government to introduce laws to protect \ntaxpayers from having to foot the bill, should operators not be able to meet their obligations.\nWoodside sold the platform to junior operator Timor Sea Oil and Gas Australia in July 2015, however TSOGA was \nforced to shut down production over a safety issue and subsequently went into voluntary administration.\nThere were fears the federal government would have to step in and bear the cost of the clean-up. Instead new rules \naround trailing liability provisions were introduced, which could slug former owners of the licence areas with the bill, \nthereby putting the onus on them to do adequate due diligence should the assets change hands.\nThe exploration permit in the current matter was granted to Woodside, Shell and BHP Billiton Petroleum in 1997, \nwith Woodside owning a half share and the other two companies one quarter each.\nProduction from the Laminaria and Corallina oilfields began in 1999. The writ filed with WA's Supreme Court says \nShell then sold two-thirds of its interest to Woodside in March 2005, and one-third to British company Paladin.\nShell says in its claim that the agreement with each company \"expressly provided ... that Woodside/Paladin is liable \nfor all environmental, abandonment, reclamation, remediation and restoration claims\". The claim says following the \nfailure of TSOGA, neither that company nor its liquidator made any efforts to remediate the platform. Woodside was \ncontacted for comment.\nLoad-Date: May 30, 2024\nPage 2 of 2\nShell sues Woodside and Paladin over $87m oil platform clean-up bill\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
