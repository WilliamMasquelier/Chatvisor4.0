Josh Gilbert, markets analyst at eToro, said the \nASX 200 fell away from record levels but \"stayed within touching distance\".\nRetail sales fell by 2.7 per cent in December, more than reversing the Black Friday-driven bump in November and \nthe weakest monthly result since the height of Covid-19 lockdowns in August 2020.\nMr Gilbert said the data backed up the view that rate cuts by the Reserve Bank were on the horizon in the middle of \nthe year. \"This is what the RBA wanted to see; sales weakening, and we're likely to see further signs of weakening \nin the months ahead,\" he said.\nInvestors were focusing on Wednesday's consumer price index data, expected to show that inflation had eased to \n0.8 per cent in the December quarter, with the annual rate falling to a two-year low of 4.3 per cent.\n\"A reading under expectations, after (Tuesday's) dismal retail print, will see the rate cut expectations brought \nforward, which could be the catalyst the local market needs to take out that record-high close,\" Mr Gilbert said.\nThe dollar ignored the retail data and was trading near US66.15c at 5pm AEDT. The tech sector was the strongest \nASX performer, with Megaport rocketing almost 28 per cent to $12.48 after a stronger-than--expected trading \nupdate.\nPage 2 of 2\nBourse toys with a record high\nHealthcare stocks also gained as biotech giant CSL rose 1.2 per cent to $296.74 and ResMed lifted 1.8 per cent to \n$28.95.\nMarket and mining heavyweight BHP was up 0.4 per cent at $47.05, while Fortescue hit a record high, closing with \na 1.5 per cent gain at $29.70.\nNickel Industries jumped almost 21 per cent to 72.5c on the back of record quarterly earnings and production, a \nhigher dividend and a $US100m share buyback.\nGold miner Northern Star Resources rose 2.9 per cent to $13.33, and Ramelius advanced 2.9 per cent to $1.58 \nafter raising its production guidance.\nEnergy stocks declined after oil prices fell, having reached their highest level since November on Monday amid an \nescalation in Middle East tensions.\nWoodside Energy dipped 0.1 per cent to $31.87 and Santos lost 0.5 per cent to $7.76.\nAustralia's biggest bank, Commonwealth Bank, reached a record high before ending with a 0.1 per cent lift at \n$116.05.\nWestpac fell 0.5 per cent to $23.82, ANZ dropped 0.2 per cent to $26.79 and NAB was flat, dipping 0.03 per cent to \n$32.13.\nClothing retailer City Chic soared 26.4 per cent to 55c as it flagged a better-than-expected interim earnings loss and \nthe potential sale of its North American business. The local sharemarket's rise followed gains on Wall Street as the \nS&P 500, up 0.8 per cent, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 0.6 per cent, both hit fresh records.\nLoad-Date: January 30, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**ENTITY**: [Organization Name]\n**TYPE**: [Type of organization - e.g., Company, Government Agency, NGO, etc.]\n**DESCRIPTION**: [Brief description of how the entity is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**ENTITY**: Tesla, Inc.\n**TYPE**: Company\n**DESCRIPTION**: Main subject of article, discussing Q4 earnings report\n\nOnly include entities that are meaningful to the article's content.
