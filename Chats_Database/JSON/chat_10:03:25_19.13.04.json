Private investigators \nidentified -Element Zero's principal and likely secondary place of businesses at two locations close by in Malaga, in \nPerth's northern suburbs.\nPage 2 of 3\nFortescue 'spied on' wives, kids\nFormer Fortescue executives Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen and their company Element Zero along with \nlong-term Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman are parties to the court fight. All three quit the would-be green \nenergy giant to start their own green metal firm in 2022.\nAfter Fortescue accused them of stealing intellectual property relating to its carbon dioxide-free iron technology, it \nsuccessfully obtained orders from the Federal Court in May to search the offices and homes of Element Zero and \nits staff. Computers and electronic devices were seized in those raids.\nElement Zero denies the allegations and says its technology was developed independently to that of Fortescue's.\nSuch has been the veil of secrecy cast over the case that its existence was not revealed until two weeks after the \nsearch orders were granted (on May 14), and elements of the matter are still suppressed.\nDuring a brief case management hearing on Wednesday, Chris McMeniman, the barrister appearing for Element \nZero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman, told the court that for 19 days Fortescue's private investigators pursued \nhis clients, their families and Element Zero staff.\nHe said Fortescue claimed it was \"too difficult\" to redact residential addresses and photos of minors included in a \n600-page report completed for them, and therefore wanted the whole thing kept secret.\nThat report contains details about the extraordinary surveillance conducted by Fortescue, including that private \ninvestigators followed \"wives to Kmart\", sifted through mail \"and the like\" and that Element Zero staff beyond those \nlisted in the court filings were followed.\n\"They want the entirety of that redacted,\" he said.\nFortescue barrister Wen Wu told the court that since an interim suppression order was granted on May 9, the \ncompany had since lodged a further two applications.\n\"The reason \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 why a further suppression application was brought is because the initial suppression was to \nsuppress -material that was confidential to Fortescue and not known to the individual respondents,\" Mr Wu said.\n\"The second suppression -application made \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 covers confidential information which is known to individual \npersons but not to the world at large.\" Mr Wu agreed that Fortescue's bid for a suppression order covering the 600 \npages of private investigator reports was \"broader\" than Element Zero's.\nJustice Markovic described Element Zero's application as \"more nuanced or selective\".\nShe said she would need to \"sift through\" the vast amounts of material filed and examine what was sought to be \nredacted.\nIn relation to one of Mr Wu's suppression applications, Justice Markovic said: \"I would like your side to consider \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \nnarrow applications\".\nHall and Wilcox were hired by Fortescue's external lawyers Davies Collison Cave Law to act as independent \nsolicitors and carry out the raids in May.\nAccording to a letter sent from Davies Collison Cave Law to Hall and Wilcox that summarised Fortescue's \nallegations against Element Zero, Dr Winther-Jensen sent emails to his personal email address attaching \nconfidential Fortescue technical documents.\nAs well, Fortescue claimed Dr Kolodziejczyk accessed confidential technical documents on his work-issued laptop \nusing a USB and deleted a file shortly -before he left.\n\"Fortescue are unable to locate a substantial number of documents recording the research and development of the \nER (electrochemical reduction) process in the green iron project on its internal file systems,\" the letter read.Page 3 of 3\nFortescue 'spied on' wives, kids\nLawyers for Element Zero have previously flagged they would move to have Fortescue's case struck out, saying \nthe accusations had caused \"ongoing reputational damage\" to all three men, and the orders were improperly \nobtained by Fortescue.\nAt a hearing late last month, Dr Kolodziejczyk suggested he planned to introduce evidence he was allowed by \nFortescue to take some documents with him when he resigned. The matter will return to court next month.\nLoad-Date: July 10, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
