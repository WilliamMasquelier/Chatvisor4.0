Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 26\nLength: 990 words\nByline: Anthony Macdonald\nBody\nIt takes only two words to mesmerise investors this year: data centres.\nThey are red-hot. It's part artificial intelligence, part cloud adoption and part big tech, colliding in the sweet spots \nwhere public and private markets and infrastructure and real estate (together \"real assets\") meet. Investors are \nhooked.\nWe've seen all sorts of proof points recently - AirTrunk's $23.5 billion sale, NextDC's back-to-back equity raisings, \nAustralianSuper's multibillion-dollar bet and David Di Pilla's opportunistic (and still pending) IPO.\nBut the one that is hiding in plain sight, and doing things its own way, is $70 billion warehouses and logistics parks \ndeveloper, operator and fund manager Goodman Group. It told investors it was crossing into data centres last year, \nand has since added about $25 billion to its market capitalisation.\nWhat's it done to date? A lot of preparation work. It has the sites, has scurried together a 5 gigawatt power bank - \nup from more than 3GW when the plans were first unveiled mid-last year - including 2.6GW of secured power and \nanother 2.4GW in advanced negotiations, and has started digging trenches at a few sites.\nIt has also been talking to potential co-investors (or capital partners) and customers, including the big tech \ncompanies who need homes for their AI training machines, and hiring engineers and other staff with the appropriate \nexpertise. Greg Goodman, the conductor, gave his latest update yesterday. He revealed only a little bit more than \nthe last time he fronted analysts in August, really.\nThe secured powerbank, for example, was up to 2.6GW from 2.5GW. He's talking more about developing turnkey \ndata centres - fully designed, built, powered, installed - and even operating them, although can and will also do \nlighter \"powered shells\" for the opportunity.\nWhere exactly are these data centres, though?\nWhat's the rollout schedule?\nPage 2 of 3\nGoodman's striking run at data centres Closing Bell\nHow quickly can that 2.6GW power bank turn into revenue?\nWho exactly is Goodman Group in talks with to invest in them?\nWhat are the expected returns?\nGoodman punted a lot of the questions, or at least the specific answers to them, into next year.\nHe wasn't evasive, so much as not yet ready for the full reveal. He promised a more fulsome update when he fronts \nthe market with his company's half-year results in February, saying 2025 would be a big year for project starts.\nIt sounds like he expects to be building data centres in the US, Europe, Japan and Australia next year. Some of \nthem will be co-located with Goodman's logistics assets, others will be standalone. Artarmon in Sydney, the only \nspecific site to get a callout during the analyst briefing, is the latter.\nAnalysts and investors are lapping it up. There was no dissent on the call, no pushing Goodman to be more specific \nabout the returns/investors/sites - he gave away enough to satisfy curious minds, but kept coming back to next \nFebruary's more comprehensive briefing. The shares are up more than 40 per cent so far this year.\nThis sort of organic expansion plan is rare in Australia. Such plans tend to only take place where a big player in one \nindustry spots a gap in a new or booming adjacent industry - like a warehouses builder getting into powered shells, \nor pay TV company Foxtel getting into streaming with Kayo/Binge.\nListening to the call, we couldn't help but think Goodman Group's treatment was a stark contrast to another large \ncap's ambitious organic expansion plans: Fortescue's move into hydrogen and energy more broadly.\nFortescue's calls are met with demands for more details: where are the sites, what's the rollout schedule, how \nquickly can it turn into revenue, who are the co-investors, what are the expected returns - all the same stuff that is a \nbit vague at Goodman Group.\nIt's got to the point where analysts are sick of talking and hearing about it until there are binding agreements worth \ndisclosing, even if the message is delivered by Andrew Forrest, another of Australia's great founder class who has \ncreated plenty of value for long-term shareholders.\nIt shows the difference of being hot - or not. Data centres are clearly hot (hydrogen still not), with demand right now, \ncustomers keen to sign long-term contracts and infrastructure and real estate investors willing to invest in new \nprojects to underwrite developments. That reduces the risk involved of a logistics park developer switching over to \ndata centres, which can cost $1 billion-plus and take years to build.\nIt is a credit to Greg Goodman's ability to spot an opportunity and make a run for it.\nHe's doing it without any acquisitions (\"it's highly competitive if you want to buy anything already operational\", he \nsays) or diluting shareholders with equity raisings, preferring to build capability within his existing team and utilise its \nexisting sites. (So is Fortescue for that matter, albeit there is much more scepticism around the clean energy end-\nmarket and no sign that customers are willing to step up today to underwrite big developments.)\nThe other thing that helps Goodman is that his core logistics business is in rude health. It reported 97.5 per cent \noccupancy across its industrial and warehouse assets at September 30, which includes partnership sites, and 4.9 \nper cent like-for-like net property income growth. It reaffirmed FY25 operating earnings per share and distribution \nguidance, and isn't reliant on one customer (China) like Fortescue.\nIf Goodman pulls it off, it will be one of the great strategic pivots.\nFor now, having added tens of billions to Goodman Group's value, it is already one of the most valuable organic \ngrowth strategies we've seen on the ASX. Goodman's job is to turn that value, which is based on potential, promise \nand things like land banks and sites, into built and functioning data centres.Page 3 of 3\nGoodman's striking run at data centres Closing Bell\nThis sort of organic expansion plan is rare in Australia.
