Pg. 26\nLength: 448 words\nByline: NICK EVANS\nBody\nFortescue partner and supplier Plug Power is looking to raise $US1bn ($1.52bn) in the US capital markets to keep \nits hydrogen ambitions alive, underlining the risks facing the nascent green energy sector.\nStock in the electrolyser and hydrogen company crashed on the US markets this week after the company said it \nplanned to raise as much as $US1bn in a stock offering, despite downplaying its financial troubles in November.\nPlug is a key partner for Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Energy, both as a potential supplier of electrolysers for the \ncompany's own projects, and as a joint venture partner with Fortescue in the US hydrogen market.\nLast October, Fortescue named Plug Power as the preferred supplier of 550MW in electrolysers for its Gibson \nIsland green ammonia plant in Queensland - although that plan may be stalled as Fortescue battles to find power \ncheap enough to realise its hydrogen ambitions.\nPlug and Fortescue also have a deal for the Australian resources major to take up to a 40 per cent stake in Plug's \nTexas hydrogen plant and for Plug to take a stake of up to 25 per cent in a plant Fortescue wants to build in -\nArizona.\nThose plans may also need rethinking, however, after the draft detail of hydrogen subsidies on offer from the Biden \nadministration turned out tougher than expected, requiring new sources of clean energy powering the production of \nhydrogen to qualify for generous $US3 per kilogram -subsidies.\nIn November, Plug attached a going concern warning to its quarterly accounts, warning the company was running \nout of cash after burning through more than $US860m ($1307m) in the first nine months of the year.\nAt the time a spokesman for Fortescue said the company was not concerned about Plug's -financial position or \nability to deliver on its agreements with -Fortescue.\nPlug chief financial officer Paul Middleton told analysts the going concern warning was driven by the need to comply \nwith corporate accounting standards, and Plug was confident it could raise debt to cover its obligations.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue partner Plug Power tumbles after $1.5bn raising plan\n\"I have a $US5bn ($9.43bn) balance sheet that's unlevered,\" he said. \"I mean, I really don't have any debt.\n\"So we still are extremely confident about the range of parties and solutions that we're working with.\" But the \ncompany instead filed a prospectus to raise up to $US1bn on the US market this week, in a move that could dilute \nexisting shareholders substantially.\nThe filing sent Plug stock down more than 40 per cent over the past few days, with the company now trading \naround $US2.40 a share - more than 85 per cent below its price a year ago, and a fraction of its all-time high of \n$US66.87 in January 2021. Plug is due to give a business update early next week.\nLoad-Date: January 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Paul Middleton | Chief Financial Officer of Plug Power | \"I have a $US5bn ($9.43bn) balance sheet that's unlevered.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
