It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nBe smart when splashing out\nBe smart when splashing out\nThe Courier Mail (Australia)\nApril 6, 2024 Saturday\nHomeQLDRE Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: REALESTATE; Pg. 6\nLength: 744 words\nBody\nChecklist for buyers There are many issues to look out for when buying a house with a pool, writes Kate McIntyre \nRhiannon Royall from Poolz, a marketplace described as the realestate.com.au for pool design and maintenance, \nshares the top five things buyers should check before purchasing a home with a pool.\n1 Check the pool lights work - they can be costly to replace. 2 Check the pool is level - measure the distance from \nthe water to the top of the pool shell on all sides.\n3 Check the waterline - look for signs of degradation. On a concrete pool, look at the waterline tiles or pebble to see \nif tiles are cracked or missing; and on a fibreglass pool, make sure any white residue can easily be wiped away.\n4 Check the coping tiles - any cracks or level changes could mean issues with the pool shell.\n5 Check the filter and pump room - check for signs of leaks and wear and tear. Most will have a sticker from a pool \ncompany that has serviced the equipment. Call that company and ask about the state of the equipment and the \npool condition to get an independent opinion. If you hope to install heating, it's worth checking to see if the pool \nalready has heating provisions or an existing heater installed.\nAfter a summer of heatwaves, a home with a pool may well be on the bucket list for many Australian families - but \nonce purchased, it could also be a hole in the bucket.\nData from trades platform hipages shows there was a surge in the number of pool-related jobs over the past year, \nwith pool repairs soaring more than 71 per cent from last summer and renovations up 49 per cent.\nIn order to avoid ending up with a money trap there are several things you should look at before buying a home with \na pool.\nBUILDING REPORT Poolz pool builder operations Rhiannon Royall says with structural pool renovations costing a \nsimilar amount to building a new pool, it's important to ensure there is no major damage by getting a pool report \ndone by an independent building inspector.\nPage 2 of 2\nBe smart when splashing out\n\"Cosmetic renovations are typically not as expensive, but are still tens of thousands of dollars,\" Royall says . \"If you \nhave any suspicion of a leak, then getting a professional leak detection service is also recommended.\" Buyers \nagent Bianca Field from Bought says she always pays for a pool report when assessing homes for her clients.\nRED FLAGS Ms Field also uses Google Earth to find old images of the pool. This often provides clues as to how \nwell it has been maintained.\n\"If the pool is green, it has been neglected in the past,\" she says. \"In the same way people pay stylists to cover up \nwhatever they've got in the house, they do the same things for pools.\" Hipages pool maintenance expert Hom \nNepali from Hom to Home Pool Services says sellers can disguise a broken chlorinator by adding chlorine weekly \nto stop the water turning green. A noisy pump and a dripping filter means there is something wrong with the pool \nequipment, while a pool surrounded by trees adds up to extra maintenance. Fallen leaves regularly clog the filter \nand change the chemistry of the water and roots pose a massive problem and could lead to cracks and structural \nissues forming, he says.\nVISIBLE SIGNS There are several things buyers can check themselves while inspecting the property, Ms Royall \nsays. These include checking the pool lights work and whether there are cracks or level changes in the coping tiles, \nwhich are the first row of tiles around the pool edge.\n\"Coping tiles are part of the shell structure, so any cracks or level changes could indicate issues with the pool shell \nitself,\" she says.\nMeasuring the distance from the water to the top of the pool shell on all sides of the pool is another good idea.\n\"If the pool is not level, it could indicate structural issues and that the pool was installed incorrectly or is sinking at \none end,\" she says.\nMr Nepali says rust stains are a red flag that can easily add up to $30,000 worth of repairs.\n\"That means the pool needs to be renovated or fixed,\" he says. The rust forms when the metal under the pool \nsurface comes into contact with water because it hasn't been sealed properly. While the rust costs around $3000 to \nfix, the pool may also need to be repainted or renovated, adding tens of thousands more to the price. Cracks are \nanother common and costly issue easily disguised by topping up the water.Age is also important. He said pools \nusually need to be renovated after about 30 years, with new pools prone to problems caused by inferior products.\nLoad-Date: April 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
