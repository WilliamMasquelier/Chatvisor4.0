Ltd.\nLength: 537 words\nDateline: SYDNEY Aug 8\nBody\n  Fortescue has been accused of having \"unclean hands\" for the unnecessary and invasive spying of two former \nstaff sued over the alleged theft of green iron technology.\n   The mining giant searched the Perth offices of Element Zero and the homes of the startup's directors Bartlomiej \nKolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen, seizing a swathe of computers, devices and documents.\n   Fortescue's extensive surveillance of Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen has been revealed in a Federal \nCourt lawsuit launched over the alleged theft of trade secrets.\n   Before filing the case, the company engaged a private investigator to track the directors from their homes to a \nvariety of places including shopping centres, cafes, restaurants, the beach and the airport.\n   Fortescue alleges that Dr Kolodziejczyk, Dr Winther-Jensen and Element Zero chief executive Michael \nMasterman used secrets picked up during their time at the mining giant to develop their own green-iron technology.\n   Mr Masterman, on behalf of Element Zero, has called the allegations \"spurious\".\n   During a hearing on Thursday, Element Zero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman's barrister Chris McMeniman \nslammed Fortescue for the spying.\n   \"The level of surveillance conducted on the respondents was highly invasive and not necessary,? he told Justice \nBrigitte Markovic.\n   Not only did it extend beyond what was needed for the search orders, Fortescue did not divulge crucial \ninformation to the Federal Court judge who signed off on the proposed order, Mr McMeniman said.\n   This related to the question of whether Fortescue had gone to the court with \"clean hands\" and made the request \nfor the search order in good or bad faith, he said.\n   But Justice Markovic criticised the allegations, saying they did not appear in an affidavit that simply mentioned an \ninvasion of privacy.\nPage 2 of 2\nFED:Fortescue criticised for 'bad faith' spying on ex-staff\n   Element Zero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman will seek to overturn the May search orders during a two-day \nhearing that begins on August 19.\n   On Thursday, the judge set aside a request by the startup and two executives seeking documents from \nFortescue ahead of that hearing.\n   This material related to reports by the investigator and a computer expert who examined Dr Kolodziejczyk's work \nlaptop.\n   Representing Fortescue, barrister Julian Cooke SC argued the material was irrelevant or could be legal advice \nprotected from being publicly divulged.\n   He called the bid a \"massive distraction\", criticising his opponents as using an extraordinarily broad \"scattergun\" \napproach to try and build up their case.\n   ?It's quite absurd ... they?re completely fishing,\" he said.\n   Element Zero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman are also seeking permission to cross-examine Fortescue's \nlawyer Paul Dewar on why he did not divulge the commercial relationship between the mining goliath and startup \nwhen asking for the search orders.\n   In the lawsuit, Element Zero and the executives have been accused of breach of contract, copyright infringement, \nbreach of corporations and consumer law, and breach of their fiduciary duties.\n   Fortescue is seeking damages or compensation, which could include any profits gained by Element Zero from \nthe allegedly stolen invention.\n   The hearing continues.\nLoad-Date: August 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
