Mr Nipper survived that cull, vowing to \u201cfight with everything I\u2019ve got\u201d to restore investor confidence.\nBut the company has taken a fresh blow as the outlook to the renewable energy sector darkens with the return of \nDonald Trump as US president.\nMr Trump, who has vowed to reverse the US\u2019s policy on renewables and revert to oil and gas, has already signed \nan executive order suspending new leases for offshore wind.\n\u00d8rsted this month announced fresh writedowns of 12.1bn Danish krone (\u00a31.4bn) on its US business, which it \nblamed on rising interest rates and market uncertainties.\nMr Nipper said: \u201cLeading \u00d8rsted through four challenging yet rewarding years has been a great privilege. Despite \nthe obstacles we\u2019ve faced, we\u2019ve achieved many significant milestones, and I\u2019m immensely proud of our colleagues\u2019 \nefforts and dedication.\u201d\nMr Errboe, who joined \u00d8rsted in 2012, said: \u201c\u00d8rsted has a strong foundation with unique capabilities, and I\u2019m \nlooking forward to taking the lead on the transformation necessary to navigate the headwinds that \u00d8rsted and our \nindustry currently face.\n\u201cOffshore wind remains crucial for the green transition, and we\u2019re deeply committed to pursuing our vision of a world \nthat runs entirely on green energy.\u201d\nLoad-Date: January 31, 2025\nEnd of Document\n            ",
