Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 19\nLength: 723 words\nByline: Angela Macdonald-Smith\nBody\nAn apparent gas strike by energy giant Shell deep underground in onshore Queensland has fuelled industry hopes \nof a potential major new source of energy that could ease the threat of shortages in the tight east coast market.\nFlames from a well drilled by Shell in the Taroom Trough at the southern edge of the Bowen Basin have stoked \nspeculation that the little-known region could emerge as a new supply source that lies much closer to pipeline \ninfrastructure than the Northern Territory's remote Beetaloo Basin.\nThe gas flare from the well, a photograph of which has been seen by The Australian Financial Review, signals one \nof the first instances of gas flowing to the surface in the region.\nThe Taroom Trough lies close to Queensland's gas hub at Wallumbilla, north-west of Brisbane, and wells being \ndrilled are targeting unconventional gas at a depth of 2500-3500 metres, much deeper than coal seam gas wells.\nWhile Shell declined to confirm the gas flow, MST Marquee energy analyst Saul Kavonic said the region, which he \ndescribed as the most anticipated exploration play on the east coast over the next two years, held significant \npotential. \"If they can prove horizontal wells work in this tight coal seam gas play, it could open up several more tcf \n[trillion cubic feet]) of gas for the east coast,\" Mr Kavonic said, noting ASX-listed juniors Elixir Energy and Omega \nOil and Gas Ltd are also in the area.\n\"This is the only new exploration play with that potential, which is also close to infrastructure,\" he added, pointing to \nthe greater infrastructure and funding constraints around large gas resources in the Beetaloo and the northern \nBowen Basin.\nShell is drilling three appraisal wells in the area \"as part of early-stage exploration in the Bowen Basin\", a \nspokeswoman said. \"The data will be analysed and will inform any further exploration.\"\nThe apparent early success comes as output from the east coast's biggest supply source for the domestic market, \nthe mature Bass Strait petroleum fields held by ExxonMobil and Woodside Energy, has started to dive, risking \nshortfalls on gas on peak winter days, especially in Victoria.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes\nProduction from the Longford plant that processes Bass Strait gas plunged 18.2 per cent in the June quarter, \naccording to consultancy EnergyQuest, noting that peak supply shortfalls hit the east coast in 2022 and again this \npast winter.\nThe firm said that exploration and appraisal success by Elixir and Omega was raising hopes that the Taroom \nTrough could be \"a genuine new source of material supply to the east coast gas market and even backfill for \nQueensland LNG projects\".\nEnergyQuest CEO Rick Wilkinson said the flare reported at the Shell site \"seems to indicate more gas is flowing \nthan the vertical well tested recently by Elixir\", which he said was a \"good sign\" for the application of horizontal well \ntechnology.\nAccessing gas held in such deep sands typically requires the use of horizontal drilling - as used in the US shale gas \nindustry - and fracking, a controversial process that helps gas to flow.\nElixir and Omega, between them, have almost 3 trillion cubic feet of \"contingent resources\" - an uncertain measure \nof resource - in \"tight\" sandstones in the Trough, while Shell advised the Queensland government in 2021 that its \nown acreage in the area could hold three tcf of gas resource, EnergyQuest said.\nIt said Shell's investment in a program of multiple, stimulated horizontal wells costing between $100 million and \n$200 million \"adds a lot of credibility\". Elixir, chaired by coal seam gas entrepreneur Richard Cottee, late last month \nreported a successful flow of gas to the surface from its Daydream-2 well in the area.\nOmega, which is backed by Queensland coal seam gas pioneer Tri-Star Group and Brian Flannery's Ilwella Group, \nis now moving the rig used by Shell for its wells to its Canyon site where it expects to start drilling a well on \nSeptember 20 to test the flow of gas in its acreage for the first time.\n\"If we're successful here this could be the next big wave of development post the coal seam gas wave,\" said \nOmega CEO Trevor Brown, a former vice president geoscience at Santos.\nHe said that while the Beetaloo Basin was more advanced in terms of proving up the flow of gas, the Taroom \nTrough had several compelling reasons that gave it a quantifiable commercial advantage.\nLoad-Date: September 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
