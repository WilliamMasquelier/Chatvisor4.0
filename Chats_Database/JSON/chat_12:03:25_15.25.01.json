Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Carl Solder | Australian Chief Technology Officer at Cisco | \"I think the reality is that they started to appreciate the work and effort involved in getting all those building blocks squared away, and the strategy, infrastructure data governance, talent and culture.\" | N.A. |\n| Carl Solder | Australian Chief Technology Officer at Cisco | \"The reality is that maybe there is a little bit more work that we have to do to be fully -prepared.\" | N.A. |\n| Carl Solder | Australian Chief Technology Officer at Cisco | \"Fifty-six per cent of those organisations said that the pressure has increased significantly.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Cisco.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Cisco or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
