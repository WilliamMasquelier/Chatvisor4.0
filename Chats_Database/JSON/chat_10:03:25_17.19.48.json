Shaw is keen on Genesis Minerals in the sector and has a price target on the \nstock of $2.75 against $2.18 currently.\nPage 2 of 2\nTrading at near-record highs, but gold still has 'further to go' - DATA ROOM\nUBS has a target price of $2.25 on Genesis but that's assuming a long-term gold price of $US1950 per ounce and \nan Australian dollar exchange rate of US75c.\nCanaccord favours Evolution Mining, Northern Star Resources, Resolute Mining and Ramelius Resources among \nthe Australian gold miners. Evolution had improved balance sheet capacity and a \"unique investment offering\" given \nit also has copper exposure, with a dearth of quality copper names on the ASX.\nCashed up Northern Star also had plenty of room to move should attractive deals emerge, Canaccord said.\n\"Northern Star maintains exceptional leverage to rising gold prices, owing to the scale of its operations,\" the broker \nsaid.\n\"Its FY25 production profile is more than double the next biggest ASX gold producer ... \"Northern Star retains \n$1.5bn in available undrawn debt facilities for total liquidity of over $2.7bn.

Canaccord Genuity has identified Ramelius Resources as one of the key Australian gold miners that could benefit from the anticipated easing of US interest rates, suggesting that the company has potential for margin expansion amidst favorable market conditions.\n\n2. The article highlights that Ramelius Resources is included in Canaccord's list of preferred gold equities, indicating a positive outlook for the company in the context of rising gold prices and overall market dynamics.\n\n3. Despite the bullish sentiment surrounding gold, the article does not provide specific performance metrics or recent developments for Ramelius Resources, suggesting a potential gap in the company's visibility compared to its peers like Northern Star and Evolution Mining.\n\n4. The broader market analysis indicates that while gold is trading at near-record highs, there remains a disconnect in valuations, which could imply that Ramelius Resources, along with other miners, may still have room for growth in equity performance as market conditions evolve.",
