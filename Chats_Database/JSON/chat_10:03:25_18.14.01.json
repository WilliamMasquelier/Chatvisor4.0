Mr Lange was appointed as the president of \nFortescue Energy's European operations in March 2023, tasked with helping Fortescue make good on its big \npromises about the production of green energy and hydrogen across Europe.\nAt the same time long-term company secretary Cameron Wilson is set to take a step back from Fortescue, initially \nshifting to a part-time role as he hands over duties at the company. Mr Wilson's decision comes only a few months \nafter the departure of co-company secretary and Fortescue general counsel Gemma Tually, who stepped down \nfrom the role in November 2023.\n\"We are delighted that (Cameron) has agreed to continue with the company on a part-time basis to ensure a \nsmooth transition,\" a Fortescue spokesman said.\nBoth of those moves come amid a fresh wave of senior executive losses at Fortescue.\nFormer Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner quit the company earlier this month, after only 15 months \nwith Fortescue's Energy arm. Initially appointed as Fortescue Energy's Head of Northern Australia in late 2022, Mr \nGunner finished his period with Fortescue as the head of business development for Australia and New Zealand.\nThis year Fortescue Energy also lost the services of chief financial officer Deborah Caudle, less than five months \nafter she was appointed to the role, with former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also formally severing ties with the \ncompany, and external affairs boss Fiona Sugden leaving to join the office of current Prime Minister Anthony \nAlbanese.\nThe departure of Mr Lange - also once an executive director of Fortescue's WAE arm in Britain - extends the \nuncertainty around the company's progress in establishing a hydrogen and green energy production hub in Europe.\nIn 2022 Fortescue committed to delivering as much as five million tonnes of green hydrogen a year to German \ngiant E. ON, one of Europe's largest power companies, with the start of deliveries around 2030.\nThe company also bought into a German import terminal in late 2022, and has said its first European green \nhydrogen plant is likely to be in Norway.\nBut the company also missed a self-imposed deadline to make a final investment decision on up to five green \nenergy projects by the end of 2023, instead saying it had \"fast-tracked\" an investment decision on its Holmaset \nproject in Norway.\nShipping news As blockbuster names go for decisions at next week's High Court sittings, you couldn't do much \nbetter than a showdown between Indian billionaire Gautam Adani and British metals magnate Sanjeev Gupta.\nOn a first glance, the prospect of a High Court call on a gloves-off stoush in the nation's top court between the \nAdani Group's Carmichael coal mine and Gupta's Whyalla steelworks should have security guards wedging them \ninto the aisles with crowbars in Court No 1 in Canberra on Wednesday.\nSadly, the reality falls far short of Margin Call's hopes, expectations and sensationalist attempts to fool our loyal \nreaders into reading the last third of this column.\nWhile the case does indeed involve companies associated with both men - along with a shipping line - the actual \ndispute troubling the court appears to be the most pointless pile of guff to ever be billed in eight-minute increments \nby King's Counsel.\nEssentially, the dispute is this: Carmichael commissioned Gupta's South Australian steelworks to manufacture 8669 \nindividual steel rails for its railway line.\nWhyalla did so, and bunged them onto a ship in South Australia - owned by BBC Chartering Carriers GmbH - \nbound for Queensland's Galilee basin.Page 3 of 3\nNew chief executive pays price\nAs it turns out, somebody failed to tie them down properly in the ship's hold, so the rails apparently got bounced \naround a bit in transit, rendering them unfit for use as railway lines when they finally arrived in Mackay.\nAs a result Carmichael was forced to flog the lot off for scrap, fetching $656,998.51. The Adani group now, not \nunreasonably, wants someone to cough up for the difference in what it paid for the rails and what it received from \nthe scrap merchants.\nAlthough the court documents don't make it clear exactly how much is at stake, the total sum is likely to be a fair bit \nsouth of $10m, steel industry sources suggest.\nOn the face of it, a pretty simple commercial dispute, with only one likely outcome. But, no! As the matter \napproached hearings in the Federal Court over who should pay, shipping line BBC launched a bid to move the case \nto arbitration in London.\nAnd, as is known by all close followers of admiralty and maritime law (may God protect their eternal souls), the \nAustralian and British laws on the subject may read the same, but are interpreted very differently - with the British \ninterpretation likely to reduce the liability of the shipping company.\nThe issue now facing the High Court is whether to allow this type of jurisdiction shopping, or not. Lawyers of our \nacquaintance insist it could be an immensely important point of law at some other point, or the High Court wouldn't \nbother hearing it. Irrespective, Margin Call is betting the legal teams will make more money than the cargo was \nworth by the time the case is done.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Billionaires battle it out in High Court clash\nLoad-Date: February 9, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Nick Evans\nDate: February 10, 2024\nTitle: New chief executive pays price\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Mining giants BHP, Rio and Fortescue to watch China as they post results\n## Media outlet: WA Today\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: February 18, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nMining giants BHP , Rio and Fortescue to watch China as they post results\nMining giants BHP, Rio and Fortescue to watch China as they post results\nWA Today\nFebruary 18, 2024 Sunday 6:07 AM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 698 words\nHighlight: The health of China's economy will be a key focus for investors when big miners BHP, Rio Tinto and \nFortescue report their results this week.\nBody\nInvestors will this week be seeking reassurance from Australia's largest miners that there are no shocks in store \nfrom China's economy as it kicks back into gear following a week-long holiday for the Lunar New Year.\nThese issues will come under intense scrutiny when BHP reports its half-year results on Tuesday, followed by Rio \nTinto on Wednesday and then Fortescue.\nThe share prices of all three miners started 2024 at record highs, with iron ore prices soaring through the $US140-\nmark on the promise of fresh stimulus measures in China. But these stocks retreated over the past month as \nworries returned about China's economic malaise and its impact on iron ore demand.\nIt is a significant issue for BHP and Rio, which both count on China for more than half of their revenue. For \nFortescue, the figure is closer to 90 per cent.\nAnd it will be of significance in Canberra as well, with iron ore accounting for around 60 per cent of the value of \nAustralian exports to China in recent years.\n\"The first dark cloud is growing concerns about the Chinese property markets and Chinese economy,\" investment \nbanking group Jefferies said in a recent report.\nJeffries also flagged concerns about non-residential construction outside China, including the US commercial real \nestate market, which is buckling under significant debt and low valuations.\n\"The problem, in each case, is that things are more likely to get worse before they get better,\" the banking group's \nanalysts said.\nOne bright spot for China's economy is that travel and spending patterns during China's most important holiday \nbreak indicate that domestic consumption has rebounded, despite the economic struggle with deflation and a \nproperty crisis. It has primed China's sharemarkets for a strong opening this week.\nANZ senior commodity strategist Daniel Hynes doubted even a potential stimulus package from the Chinese \ngovernment - something that investors have been discussing for months - would cure the country's economic woes.\nPage 2 of 2\nMining giants BHP , Rio and Fortescue to watch China as they post results\n\"I think the stimulus will help stem the fall that we've seen in property investment and construction activity, but that \nwon't ignite another rally like we've seen in the past,\" he said.\nThis is crucial for Australian miners, as property and construction account for half of the 1 billion tonnes of steel \nChina produces annually. But Hynes said iron ore miners were helping their own cause by recognising that growth \nin steel demand is reaching its limits.\n\"They're now talking about peak steel demand and that did instigate a bit of a review of their projects,\" he said.\nHynes said he expected this to pay off over the medium term as miners balance supply and demand.\n\"We actually have the iron ore market, remaining relatively tight over the next two to three years. On the back of \nthat lower growth in supply.\"\nAccording to Macquarie Equities, consensus estimates expected a $US6.5 billion ($10 billion) underlying profit from \nBHP for the half year, a full-year profit of $US11.6 billion from Rio for the year ending December 31, and $US3.3 \nbillion from Fortescue's half year.\nWhile BHP is a diversified miner, iron ore dwarfs the contribution of the other businesses.\nMacquarie forecasts that iron ore earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will reach $US9.8 \nbillion, followed by copper with $US3.1 billion and coal at $US1.1 billion.\nBHP confirmed last week that its nickel business would make no contribution to earnings, after writing down the \nvalue of the loss-making business to zero.\nThe Albanese government subsequently added nickel to its critical minerals list, which opens access to potentially \nbillions of dollars in government funding, and the West Australian government has also offered royalty relief for the \nnickel industry.\n\"The nickel industry supported almost 10,000 jobs, and generated sales of more than $5 billion last financial year,\" \nWA Premier Roger Cook said on Saturday while announcing the package.\n\"It is also an essential component of the state's vision of becoming a global hub for the downstream processing of \nbattery metals.\"\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

Costs \nhad been kept low, he said.\nLink to Image\nTrevor Collens\nFortescue reported underlying earnings of $US5.9 billion ($9 billion), 36 per cent above the previous half-year \nperiod, as it declared a fully franked interim dividend of $1.08 per share, 44 per cent higher, and a net profit of \n$US3.3 billion ($5.06 billion).\n\"Whether it's through our first green energy projects, our diversification into the high-grade segment of the iron ore \nmarket through Iron Bridge, or expansion of our global footprint with the Belinga iron ore project in Gabon, we \nremain committed to creating value for all our stakeholders,\" Otranto said.\nShipments of hematite ore fell to 95 million tonnes, about three million tonnes below the previous period, and the \namount of ore mined decreased by 10 million tonnes to 105 million tonnes. The volume of ore processed also fell \nslightly. Fortescue attributed the drop to infrastructure maintenance activities and an increase in waste mining.\nFortescue's shares started the year at a record high as ore prices peaked above $US140 a tonne in anticipation \nChina would unleash a fresh wave of stimulus to fix its ailing economy, but the miner's shares followed iron ore's \ndownward trajectory in intervening weeks.\nThe metal, still at a 10-year-high, is now sitting around $US125. Fortescue's shares rose about 2 per cent to \n$27.79 in trade by midday.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue ups dividend, profits jump despite lower iron ore shipments\nUBS analyst Lachlan Shaw said the result was \"solid and clean,\" and off the back of elevated iron ore prices and \ntight discounting. Softer shipments or ore in January because of bad weather and a train derailment meant \nFortescue will need a stronger second half to meet its shipping forecasts.\n\"This is not unusual seasonally, but we will need to monitor for disruptions over coming months,\" Shaw said.\nAt Iron Bridge, Fortescue had planned to produce five million tonnes of high-grade magnetite ore this financial year \nas it ramped up the $5.9 billion project to its full capacity of 22 million tonnes a year. The project hit a snag recently \nfrom continual leaks in the higher pressure section of a 240-kilometre pipeline that supplies water to the processing \nplant.\nNevertheless, the company said it reached six million tonnes of mined ore over the first half at Iron Bridge and \nshipped 84 thousand tonnes. It also shipped its first iron ore from its Belinga project in Gabon, the first time it has \nexported outside of Australia.\nThe Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day's trading.
