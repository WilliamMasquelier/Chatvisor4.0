It operates in the Renewable energy, with a prefered focus on the Netherlands market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Orsted based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Orsted is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Orsted.\n\nIf Orsted is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nSSE, Orsted, ScottishPower win contracts in latest green energy auction\nSSE, Orsted, ScottishPower win contracts in latest green energy auction\n \nProactive Investors (UK)\nSeptember 3, 2024 Tuesday 08:45 AM EST\nCopyright 2024 Proactive UK Ltd All Rights Reserved\nLength: 274 words\nByline: Josh Lamb\nBody\nSSE PLC (LSE:SSE), Orsted and ScottishPower are among firms to have secured contracts under the UK's latest \ngreen energy allocation round.\nAfter no bids were submitted in last year's auction, nine offshore wind contracts were awarded in the UK's sixth \nallocation round, the government announced on Tuesday.\nThese come alongside a wider string of green energy projects which combined will provide enough power for some \n11 million homes.\nSSE saw its 130.5 megawatt Cloiche Wind Farm awarded a contract for difference under the round, guaranteeing a \nprice for the power it produces.\nOther wind farm developers ScottishPower and Denmark's Orsted also won contracts, for their Hornsea 4 and East \nAnglia 2 sites respectively.\nScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson noted offshore wind was \"back on track\"  following last year's \n\"misstep,\" which saw lower offered prices fail to attract any developers.\nStephen Wheeler, managing director at SSE Renewables, added guaranteed prices under the contracts for \ndifference secured a \"route to market\" for projects and was \"critical to delivering new homegrown green energy\".\nSIMEC's MeyGen 2 tidal stream project was among other green energy projects to secure a new contract, which \nwill see the site expanded and guaranteed \u00a3172 per megawatt hour.\nPage 2 of 2\nSSE, Orsted, ScottishPower win contracts in latest green energy auction\nBritain's government hiked the maximum strike prices, which guarantee income for developers, offered in the latest \nauction.\nThis meant developers could be offered up to \u00a373 per megawatt hour, against \u00a344 previously, with both Orsted and \nSSE reporting theirs were lower but based on 2012 prices, meaning inflation since would have taken the contract \nvalues higher.\nLoad-Date: September 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Orsted.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
