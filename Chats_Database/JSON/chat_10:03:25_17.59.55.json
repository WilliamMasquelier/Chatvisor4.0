Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 849 words\nHighlight: The former Victorian premier still has an eye for a big project: joining a billionaire to sell \"green\" iron to \nChina.\nBody\nWe all knew the cat would soon be out of the bag on the next chapter for former premier Daniel Andrews. After all, \nthe bloke couldn't spend the rest of his life playing golf, partying with Lindsay Fox and triggering Steve Price.\nSo we can now reveal that Andrews has teamed up with West Australian mining billionaire Andrew \"Twiggy\" \nForrest and his iron ore giant Fortescue to help fulfil Twiggy's dream of selling 100 million tonnes of \"green\" iron to \nChina.\nIt's not clear exactly how this thing came to pass, but sources close to the action tell us that Andrews, who is taking \non the Fortescue work through his consultancy, Forty Eight and Partners, gave a presentation at the Boao Forum \nfor Asia in China's Hainan Province in March.\nForrest, a major sponsor of the event, was also present, and the two men appear to have clicked.\nThe green iron plan aims to deliver vast quantities of the metal to market after stripping carbon emissions from the \nextraction, processing and supply chain operations by using - and this could be the tricky bit - 8 million tonnes of \nrenewable hydrogen each year.\nSo, Forrest is thinking big. But then Andrews never saw a large project he didn't like, if we overlook the East West \nLink and the Commonwealth Games. So this thing makes sense on that level.\nIt's also been a winning approach for Forrest in the past. The Fortescue chairman - who, like Whitney Houston, \nbelieves that children are our future - hired another former long-serving Labor premier, South Australia's Jay \nWeatherill, in 2019 to lead the Thrive by Five early childhood education campaign that the miner established with \nhis then-wife, Nicola Forrest.\nNeither Forrest nor Andrews were available on Sunday to chat, leaving CBD to ponder alone the many questions \nraised by this news. The first would be, who gets to call himself chairman?\nAndrews was never quite able to shake that \"chairman Dan\" moniker used by unkind souls over both his hard line \non public health during the pandemic and enthusiasm for closer trade links with China.\nPage 2 of 3\n'Iron Dan': Andrews' next career move aligns with Forrest's green dream\nThere's this too: with the former premier and the mining boss both well-known for having a certain, well, let's call it a \nsingle-minded management style, what happens if differences emerge on strategy or tactics?\nOh, and you'd think that Andrews' new gig would mean spending a lot of time away from his beloved Mulgrave, in \nChina and, of course, at Fortescue's HQ way out west.\nIt'd be a shame if someone closed the borders.\nTAYLOR MADE\nLooks like Taylor Auerbach, the former producer from Seven's Spotlight program who stole the show at Bruce \nLehrmann's recent high-profile defamation case, is not yet ready to move on from the matter of Lehrmann and \nBrittany Higgins.\nTwitter link\nAuerbach announced on the weekend that he's been \"writing a book!\"\nWell, \"just having a crack, to see if I can do it. It might never be read by anybody but me. And I'm only an each-way \nbet.\"\nNow, Tay-Tay II reckons it'd be \"crass\", at this stage, to reveal if the tome will be fiction or non-fiction, and we'll \ndefer in matters of crassness to the expertise of anybody who's worked a few shifts at Spotlight.\nYou're not going to believe this, but Auerbach's post on X says the book is about a group of people working in \nmedia and politics and features an accusation of rape against a controversial figure. So maybe don't hold your \nbreath for a powerful work of the imagination.\nThe initial signs are promising though, with Auerbach running his first chapter past an artificial intelligence program \n- you can do that these days - which gave the former print journalist's literary efforts as warm a review as you could \nhope for. From a machine.\nBut litigation-obsessed CBD worries that Auerbach might be entering legally fraught territory, what with all the \ndefamation cases launched after Higgins first made her allegation that Lehrmann raped her in Parliament House in \n2019. The Federal Court last month sustained that allegation on the balance of probabilities.\nMaybe Auerbach enjoyed his days in court so much that he fancies another go.\nLink to Image\nSimon Schluter\nGAS FRIGHT\nSince we've come over all empathetic, we'll spare a thought now for Victorian Energy Minister Lily D'Ambrosio, \nwho had to watch last week as her so-called Labor comrades in Anthony Albanese's federal government put a \nmatch to her efforts to take gas out of Victoria's energy supply mix.\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, D'Ambrosio then had to listen to frontbench colleague Ben Carroll tell the airwaves \nthat he was an enthusiastic gas user at home and had no plans to switch.\n\"I have gas at home,\" Carroll, the deputy premier no less, told ABC Melbourne Drive presenter Ali Moore.\n\"We're keeping it [for] a range of reasons, and I think that's symbolic of a lot of Victorians, a lot of Victorians like \ncooking with gas.\"Page 3 of 3\n'Iron Dan': Andrews' next career move aligns with Forrest's green dream\nMoore observed that D'Ambrosio might have something to say about all that.\nWe wondered too, but the minister's office wasn't keen to comment when we called.\nStart the day with a summary of the day's most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. \nSign up for our Morning Edition newsletter.\nGraphic\n \nVictorian Energy Minister Lily D'Ambrosio.\nLoad-Date: May 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
