Any Core Lithium \nshareholders looking to indulge in a little tax-loss selling to offset taxable gains elsewhere in their portfolio will have \nbeen well-placed last week, with the company - the first major Australian victim of the lithium price plunge - finishing \nthe year down 89.7 per cent, the biggest loss on the S&P/ASX 300 Metals and Mining index.\nInvestors who jumped on the Canadian lithium bandwagon have also had a torrid time, with Sayona Mining and \nPatriot Battery Metals down 79 per cent and 67.5 per cent respectively.\nChalice Mining was the third biggest loser on the list, with a 77.3 per cent plunge for the fiscal year after delivering \nan underwhelming scoping study on its Gonneville project in WA in August last year.\nIGO was hit by falling lithium and nickel prices - while still feeling the hangover from its disastrous takeover of \nWestern Areas - and suffered a 60.6 per cent value loss for the year.\nGraphite plays Talga Group, Syrah Resources and Renascor Resources all made the top 10 loser list.\nThe list is rounded out by -Liontown Resources, which was the hottest lithium play on the market when Albemarle \nlobbed a $2.50-a-share bid in March 2023. Hancock Prospecting spoiled that takeover, however, and the falling \nlithium price - as well as cost blowouts at its Kathleen Valley project in WA - did the rest, with Liontown stock \nclosing off 68 per cent for the financial year at 90.5c.\nLoad-Date: June 30, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nPerson's Context: Mentioned in relation to Hancock Prospecting's involvement in the lithium market and the competition for lithium explorers.\n\nDetermine if Gina Rinehart's portrayal in the provided article is \"Positive\", \"Neutral\", or \"Negative\".\nOutput ONLY ONE of these three words and nothing else.\n",
