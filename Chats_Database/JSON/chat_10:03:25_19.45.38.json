Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 12\nLength: 568 words\nByline: Mark Wembridge\nBody\nThe US government relaxed some of the strictest criteria for hydrogen producers seeking billions of dollars in tax \ncredits, giving Australian green fuel hopefuls a reprieve after a torrid 2024 reduced their ambitions.\nThe administration of outgoing US president Joe Biden on Friday (Saturday AEDT) finalised the Congress-\napproved 45V provisions aimed at reducing the cost for companies to make clean hydrogen.\nThe US hydrogen scheme endured a complex and long-winded review that concluded with the easing of stringent \nrules on how producers source their energy. Hydrogen producers now have two extra years to find adequate \nrenewable power, deferring a problem that proponents had feared would stymie the industry's formative years.\nThe original proposal required producers to run their electrolyser machines - which split hydrogen from water - \nstrictly during the operating hours of wind or solar farms. Producers now have until 2030.\nSeveral Australian companies have hydrogen interests in the US including Woodside Energy's H2OK project in \nOklahoma and Fortescue's Arizona Hydrogen, both of which stand to potentially benefit from Washington's tax \ncredits.\n\"Will it be a shot in the arm [for the sector]? Yes, overall, it's positive,\" said Nick O'Loughlin, managing director at \nhydrogen start-up Sparc Technologies, which has a joint venture with Fortescue and the University of Adelaide.\n\"But unless we can get power prices down, the cost of green hydrogen will remain above the cost at which people \nare willing to purchase it. That is a fundamental barrier that the industry is facing to get these projects up and \nrunning, with or without credits.\"\nThe Albanese government is pouring billions into green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable energy, \nthrough its $4 billion Hydrogen Headstart Program.\nDespite the push headed by Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen, multiple homegrown projects were \nshuttered or downgraded as the sector's economics came into question.\nPage 2 of 2\nAussie hydrogen hopes buoyed by US rule change\nIn July, Fortescue axed 700 jobs and slowed its push into green hydrogen and ammonia by pulling back from its \nlarge-scale complex at Gibson Island in Queensland.\nOther local setbacks included Woodside icing two projects in Australia and New Zealand, Province Resources \nputting its Western Australian facility on hold, while Origin Energy abandoned its hydrogen venture in the NSW \nHunter Valley.\nWoodside said it was reviewing the new US tax credit regime and \"how it may impact our project in Oklahoma\", but \ndeclined to comment further yesterday.\nThe group's flagship green energy project has been repeatedly delayed since it was first earmarked for board \nsanction in 2022 and remains idled. The oil and gas producer hopes to produce up to 60 tonnes a day of liquid \nhydrogen through electrolysis and liquefaction at the US plant.\nFortescue, which has an ambitious strategy to become a major force in hydrogen and renewables, was contacted \nfor comment.\nExecutive chairman Andrew Forrest last year criticised the Biden administration's scheme, specifically the eligibility \nrules that may affect its $US550 million Arizona operations. Fortescue began constructing its Phoenix-based plant \nin 2024, with the goal of producing of liquid green hydrogen by mid-2026.\nSparc Technologies has invested $5 million in their hydrogen joint venture, which uses photocatalysis, rather than \nthe more widely adopted technology of using an electrolyser.\nLoad-Date: January 8, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"The Biden administration's scheme, specifically the eligibility rules that may affect its $US550 million Arizona operations.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
