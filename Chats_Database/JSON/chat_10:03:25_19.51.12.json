Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue Energy chief executive | \"For the Arizona project, the Trump administration has been a flurry of executive action around some sections of the [Inflation Reduction Act] from the grants that come into question and including hydrogen production tax credits.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue Energy chief executive | \"Until we have a much clearer view on that, we are being quite cautious about what we're doing. We've spent about one-fifth of the capex on Arizona, so we're being very cautious, very disciplined about the money we spend. We're waiting on the outcome of several elections globally.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue Energy chief executive | \"We're not going to bring [the projects] to the board until we've locked in the buyers.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Major shareholder and control of Fortescue | \"The dividend is worth about $560 million to Andrew and Nicola Forrest, who separated in 2023 and collectively control 36.7 per cent of the miner.\" | N.A. |\n| Dino Otranto | Fortescue mining boss | \"We've never shied away from the right compensation outcome.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
