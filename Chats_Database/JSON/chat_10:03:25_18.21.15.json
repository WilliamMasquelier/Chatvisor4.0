Mr Cooke said Element Zero's bid to have the search orders discharged was a \"cynical attempt\" to prevent \nhis client from viewing material seized in raids and to delay filing their defence.\n\"The discharge application has been a monumental waste of time and is a distraction from the real issues to be \ndecided,\" he said.\nDocuments and emails referred to intellectual property concepts about \"green\" projects, including the green iron \nconcept, the court was told. Mr Cooke said the evidence before Justice Perry supported her conclusion that \nFortescue had a \"strong prima facie case\" in favour of granting the search orders.\nSignificantly, he denied Ele-ment Zero's claim that Justice Perry should have been told they were co-operating with \nFortescue to allay the mining giant's concerns in December last year and January this year by meeting with it to \ndiscuss technical differences between the organisations' green technologies - before she approved the search \norders.\n\"Mr Masterman was co-operating because he wanted to persuade Fortescue there were no relevant similarities \nbetween the Element Zero electrochemical reduction process and the Fortescue electrochemical reduction process \nso that Fortescue would not bring a case on any such claim,\" Mr Cooke said.\n\"Fortescue's pleaded case \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is (not) that the Element Zero process is the same or similar to the Fortescue \nparticle process.\n\"Rather, the respondent misused what's defined as the Fortescue Confidential information - the ionic liquid \nresearch and development which is fundamentally different from the Fortescue particle process.\" Mr Cooke said \nFortescue also claims Element Zero misused its confidential plant information.\nMr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk were in court for Tuesday's hearing.

All three \nminers were overvalued. They are now fairly valued,\" said Morningstar equity analyst Jon Mills.\n\"There is little for an investor to do but hope for a turnaround in China. We think that is unlikely.\"\nThe bearish outlook chimes with that of the hedge fund industry, which has been targeting iron ore stocks. Short \npositions in Rio Tinto are sitting at the highest level in at least three years and bets against Mineral Resources have \nhit a record.\nIt's also been fuelled by a wave of short-sellers in Asia pulling money out of poor-performing Chinese equities and \nredirecting the funds into targeting Australian mining stocks.\n\"Asian hedge funds have been aggressively shorting Australian resource stocks as a proxy for what they expect to \nsee from China - weak growth,\" said Bell Potter strategist Richard Coppleson.\nAnalysts also agree that Fortescue is the most vulnerable to lower iron ore prices, given it is a pure-play producer \nand its margins sit well below rivals BHP and Rio Tinto. That is partly because Fortescue sells a lower-grade \nPage 2 of 2\nBHP, Rio Tinto still at risk from China crisis Iron ore\nproduct compared with the 62 per cent iron ore benchmark. This means it costs more for customers because of the \nwaste created when transporting and processing the ore, the additional energy/coal per unit of steel, and lower \nblast furnace productivity.\nThis results in a lower realised price compared with the benchmark. In the 10 years to June, Fortescue realised a \n23 per cent discount compared with the benchmark price.\nWhile the eventual ramp-up of Fortescue's higher-grade Iron Bridge joint venture will help, Morningstar warns that \nthe company's margins will fall more than its rivals if iron ore prices continue to decline.\nHowever, not everyone agrees. Some fund managers - including Ellerston Capital's Chris Kourtis - and brokers are \nturning bullish on Fortescue, citing its low share price as an attractive entry point for investors. Morningstar has \nalso flagged the risk from BHP's exposure to the Chinese economy, given the mining giant's earnings are \ndominated by iron ore and copper.\n\"With demand for many commodities likely to soften as the China boom ends, particularly iron ore... we think the \noutlook is for earnings to materially decline,\" Mr Mills said.\nBHP is regarded as the most resilient to weaker iron ore prices because of its low-cost and high-quality assets, \nmaking it one of the few miners that remains profitable through the commodity cycle.\nIt's why UBS has nominated it as the best option for investors amid weaker prices, but it also warns that the stock's \nprice-to-earnings ratio is trading up towards its long-term average.\n\"On a historical basis, BHP does not appear to be especially cheap currently,\" said UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw, \nwho has a \"neutral\" rating on the stock.\nThe broker has the same recommendation for Rio Tinto, and notes that both companies will derive about 30 to 40 \nper cent of their earnings outside iron ore in the next two years.\nThe share prices of both closely follow the iron ore price, given it is the core driver of earnings - a trend UBS \nexpects to continue until that equation changes.\nThat could spell further trouble for both stocks - some analysts predict that iron ore prices will drop below $US90 a \ntonne.\nLoad-Date: August 24, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Alex Gluyas\nDate: August 22, 2024\nTitle: BHP, Rio Tinto still at risk from China crisis; Iron ore\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Fresh Fortescue spy details revealed\n## Media outlet: The Australian\n### Author: Angelica Snowden\n### Date: August 23, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nFresh Fortescue spy details revealed\nFresh Fortescue spy details revealed\nThe Australian\nAugust 23, 2024 Friday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 14\nLength: 453 words\nByline: ANGELICA SNOWDEN\nBody\nMore details about the extraordinary surveillance detail placed on ex-Fortescue executives amid a court blow-up \ncan be revealed, as news emerges that multiple \"operatives\" spied on homes for up to 17 hours per day in the lead \nup to raids.\nThe Federal Court released a tranche of evidence lodged in the intellectual property war between Andrew Forrest's \nFortescue and its would-be green steel competitor, Element Zero on Thursday.\nA brawl has broken out between the mining giant and its former staff Bart Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn Winther-Jensen and \nlong-term Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman over allegations they stole Fortescue's green technology secrets \nto launch a rival.\nIn one affidavit, a solicitor acting for Element Zero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman said the level of \nsurveillance conducted on the men was \"highly invasive\" and not necessary to confirm their location before raids \nwere executed on their properties to preserve information.\n\"The surveillance reports indicate that surveillance was conducted on Mr Masterman's residential premises in \nSydney and Perth, as well as surveillance on Mr Masterman personally,\" it read.\n\"I am not aware of any reason why it was necessary to conduct surveillance on Mr Master-man, given Mr \nMasterman was not a recipient of a search order.\n\"I note \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the private investigator searched Mr Masterman's garbage bin and mail box and followed an elderly lady \nwho parked on Mr Masterman's front lawn to Officeworks.\" As well, the solicitor said Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr \nWinther-Jensen's residences were under \"heavy surveillance\" between April 21 and May 12, typically for about 14 \nhours a day but up to 17 hours a day.\n\"Surveillance operatives followed Dr Kolodziejczyk closely including to his son's daycare \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and Dr Winther-Jensen \nto parks, shopping centres and to a cancer awareness charity event,\" the solicitor said.\nPage 2 of 2\nFresh Fortescue spy details revealed\nLater he said: \"Based on my review of the surveillance reports, I believe additional surveillance was carried out on \nMr Masterman that has not been disclosed by Fortescue.\" Other details about the surveillance missions were \nrevealed, including that Element Zero staff were followed by private investigators to their residences and shops \nafter leaving the office.\nAs well, Element Zero's cleaners were followed by \"Fortescue's surveillance operatives\" and title searches were \nobtained of people who visited Element Zero's office, according to the affidavit.\nThe affidavit claimed the surveillance reports showed at least 685 hours of surveillance was carried out on the men \nand their families and staff between April 21 and May 12.

Futures added 0.8 per cent to $US99.25 a tonne yesterday, and have bounced more than 7 per cent from \nlast week's two-year low of $US91.45.\nThe swift rebound follows a 9 per cent plunge in prices last week, which added fresh momentum to Asian hedge \nfunds targeting Australia's largest mining stocks.\nShort positions in Mineral Resources hit record levels this week, and bets against Rio Tinto are at the highest in \nmore than three years.\nThat trade has paid off, with BHP, Rio Tinto, Fortescue and MinRes down more than 20 per cent this year, but \nthere are signs of that unwinding after all four miners rallied on Wednesday.\nBHP jumped 2.6 per cent from its low, Rio Tinto gained 2.7 per cent, Fortescue 4.9 per cent and MinRes 7.5 per \ncent. All four extended those gains yesterday. \"Asian hedge funds were still shorting Aussie resource stocks \n[yesterday morning], but as they saw iron ore still rallying, it looked like they went to the sidelines to see if this is a \nfalse recovery, or it keeps going and takes iron ore back above $US100,\" said Bell Potter strategist Richard \nCoppleson.\nThat \"would be a disaster for all the shorts and see some trying to cover\".\nIron ore's rapid turnaround has been triggered by reports that Beijing is considering a new funding option for local \ngovernments to buy unsold homes. It would involve the issue of so-called special bonds, which are currently \nrestructured for use in infrastructure and environmental projects.\nThe potential support follows a series of rescue packages that have failed to stabilise China's real estate market - a \nbig source of iron ore demand.\nPage 2 of 2\nShort-sellers brace for iron ore back at $US100 Commodities\nThat included 500 billion yuan ($104 billion) of funding to purchase excess housing inventory for conversion to \naffordable homes. But with market estimates indicating that between 2.5 trillion yuan and 7 trillion yuan is needed to \nabsorb the excess housing in China's property sector, traders have been left disappointed.\nAnalysts remain divided on the direction of iron ore prices and mining stocks from here.\nMorgan Stanley strategists told clients yesterday they did not expect iron ore to stay under $US100 a tonne for \nlonger than one to two months because lower prices would force higher-cost producers to curtail supply.\nThe broker estimated that about 80 million tonnes of production was making losses at current prices, with about 93 \nper cent of that coming from Chinese supply.\nMorgan Stanley also said the increase in supply from Australia and Brazil in the first half, which weighed on prices, \nlooks to have passed.\n\"Although a rebound in iron ore prices will benefit all iron ore miners, it is likely to benefit higher-cost miners more,\" \nnoted its equity analyst Rahul Anand.\nFor that reason, the broker prefers Minerals Resources followed by Rio Tinto. It has an \"overweight\" rating on both \nstocks.\nIt is \"equal weight\" BHP and remains \"underweight\" Fortescue given the company's continued spending on green \nenergy, which threatens its free cash flow generation and future dividend payouts.\nThat stands in contrast to some fund managers - including Ellerston Capital's Chris Kourtis, who sold his fund's \nBHP stake to buy Fortescue, and other brokers who have upgraded the stock to a buy.\nMorningstar also warned investors this week it was too early to jump back into beaten-up mining stocks, given \nBeijing had offered little hope of stabilising China's property sector.\nAnd Westpac, which has been one of the most vocal iron ore bears, is sticking with its view that prices of the \ncommodity will drop below $US90 a tonne this year.\n\"If we do see iron ore back into the late $US90s, we want to sell it again for that coming drop into the $US80s,\" said \nWestpac's head of commodity and carbon strategy Robert Rennie.",
