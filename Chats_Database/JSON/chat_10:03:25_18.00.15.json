It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 3\nFortescue doubles down on green tilt\nFortescue doubles down on green tilt\nThe Australian\nAugust 29, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 960 words\nByline: Cameron England\nBody\nFortescue is \"doubling down\" on green iron, and says the market for green products generally is \"much, much \nlarger\" than it previously believed, as the company looks to sink $US1.2bn ($1.8bn) into its energy division this \nyear.\nBut the company's co-chief executive, Dino Otranto, told The Australian a massive investment into new renewables \nand -associated energy infrastructure was needed if Australia was going the grasp the opportunity to capitalise on a \ngenerational shift in the commodities market.\nThis opportunity encompassed both green iron - with Fortescue, chaired by billionaire founder Andrew Forrest, \naiming to produce its first green metal from Pilbara ores within a year from its $US50m Christmas Creek pilot plant - \nand ammonia, which Fortescue said China had indicated would be an important feedstock for its power plants.\nThe iron ore miner and energy developer reported on Wednesday that its Fortescue Energy division lost $US659m \nin the 2024 financial year, which the company capped off with an announcement in July that it would cut 700 jobs \nacross the broader business and scale back its green hydrogen ambitions.\nBut Mr Otranto said on Wednesday that Fortescue was still firmly committed to the green opportunity, and Australia \nhad the chance to position itself to benefit from the next commodities boom, which would be focused on products \nsuch as green iron and ammonia.\n\"We will show the world that it is possible to make green iron metal - 95 per cent-plus pig iron that is in granules out \nof Pilbara-based iron ore with hydrogen as a reducing agent, derived from the sun and, in the future, the wind,\" Mr \nOtranto said.\n\"So within a year, you'll see us making further announcements around what the next stage of green iron \ndevelopment in Australia or around the world will look like.\" Mr Otranto said the company was focused initially on \nproving up its green iron technology at the Christmas Creek plant, and would then scope sites around the world with \nabundant renewable energy sources.\nPage 2 of 3\nFortescue doubles down on green tilt\n\"Our first step is proving the technology with the lower to mid-grade hematite out of the Pilbara, because that is the \nstep that really hasn't been done yet,\" he said.\n\"Right now, the green iron projects around the world utilise a very high-grade feed, and there's not many places \naround the world that actually produce that.\n\"So if you wind the clock forward and the trend of decarbonising our steel industry, there will be a real challenge for \nhigh-grade iron ore. \"So the world needs to solve low to mid-grade iron ore and for Australia, where we hold a pre-\neminent position in this space, we see endless opportunities to develop a green iron metal industry here in \nAustralia.\" Fortescue Energy co-chief executive Mark Hutchinson told The Australian on Wednesday that green \niron plants would gravitate to areas with abundant and cheap renewable energy, which Australia currently lacked at \nthe necessary scale.\nMr Hutchinson said the Pilbara was blessed with good sun and wind resources, but more investment was needed.\n\"The bit that we lack right now is the capital investment and getting the cost down,\" he said.\n\"And it's not an equipment issue, it's an installation issue, an operational issue, and that's really the big thing we've \ngot to solve as a country, because we have the resources, it's just too expensive.\" Mr Otranto added that power \n\"unlocks everything\", pointing to the historic establishment of the Whyalla and Newcastle steel -operations on the \nback of coal supplies. He said the company was \"doubling down on green iron\", with a recent visit to China \ndemonstrating to the company's management that the green shift was going to present a huge -opportunity.\n\"When I was there a few weeks ago, the Chinese government made an announcement that 10 per cent of all coal-\nfired boiler feedstock will be ammonia,\" he said. \"And if you do the numbers, China burns two billion tonnes of \nthermal coal a year, 10 per cent of that by mass is 300,000 tons of ammonia. That's nearly 50 million tonnes of \nhydrogen to get to that ammonia amount.\" Fortescue Energy this year is focused on four main projects: its 80MW \nArizona hydrogen project on which it is expected to start construction this calendar year with production set for \n2026; its 300MW Holmaneset green ammonia project in Norway targeted to start construction in 2025; its Pecem \ngreen hydrogen project in Brazil for which the design process has started, and; the Gladstone PEM50 project, \nwhich is a two-stage 50MW green hydrogen project that will operate alongside the company's Gladstone \nelectrolyser manufacturing plant.\nMr Hutchinson said the company would look to sell down stakes in those projects as they progressed. Fortescue \nEnergy is expected to spend about $US700m on operations and $US500m on capital expenditure in the current \nfinancial year.\nOn the earnings front, Mr Otranto said Fortescue delivered its third-best result to date, with underlying profit after \ntax of $US5.7bn, up 3 per cent.\nRevenue rose 8 per cent to $US18.2bn, with the company receiving $US103 a tonne for its ore, also up 8 per cent.\nThe result was a miss on consensus profit estimates of $US6.12bn, while revenue was in line with market \nexpectations.\nIron ore guidance for the current year is for shipments of 190-200 million tonnes, compared with 191.6 million \ntonnes in the 2024 financial year.\nThe company is expecting its cost for hematite production to come in at $US18.50-$US19.75 a tonne, up from \n$US18.24 for 2024.\nFortescue will pay a dividend of 89c a share on September 27, down from $1 for the same period last year. Total \ndividends for the full year were $1.97, up 13 per cent. UBS said the earnings result was \"a solid finish to FY24, \ndespite key earnings metrics falling slightly short of expectations\".Page 3 of 3\nFortescue doubles down on green tilt\nLoad-Date: August 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
