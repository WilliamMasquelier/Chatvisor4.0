Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations.

To get out of that awkward era as soon as possible is the responsibility for any good government.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Chairman of Fortescue | \"You can't run around kicking your customers and still expect to sell a lot of boots.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Chairman of Fortescue | \"Causing fear and division or claiming you can run a business, let alone a country, without targets just says to me you've obviously never employed anyone, you've never created value from scratch.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Chairman of Fortescue | \"The reason why we can drive potentially the next big economic wave, the biggest economic growth, the highest employment multiplier and economic multiplier in Australia's recent history is thanks to the necessity to address climate change.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Chairman of Fortescue | \"I see this as a really key historical step to creating the next wave of major economic growth and employment for Australia.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Chairman of Fortescue | \"Now the last thing we want to do is start hurting that standard of living, hurting that economic growth, and a strong relationship between China and Australia is absolutely necessary to continue the growth of the economies of both countries.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
