Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 669 words\nHighlight: Billionaire Andrew Forrest's Fortescue spied on three former employees and their families over \nallegations of stolen intellectual property, a court has heard.\nBody\nBillionaire Andrew Forrest's company Fortescue is fighting to suppress a 600-page private investigator report, \nwhich details its extensive spying on ex-staff and their extended family members, in a court case that alleges stolen \nintellectual property.\nThe court heard that Fortescue conducted 19 days of surveillance on three former employees, their wives, children \nand other family members. The spying included sifting through their personal mail, following some family members \nand partners to Kmart, trailing a former employee to the airport and also spying on his wife and child at their family \nhome.\nLink to Image\nAlex Ellinghausen\nJustice Brigitte Markovic is presiding over the case before the Federal Court in which Fortescue has taken legal \naction against three former employees: Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen.\nIt has accused the men of copying and taking the company's intellectual property when they left to start a rival \ngreen iron project, called Element Zero.\nA hearing on Wednesday was called to discuss the reasons for the suppression of the report. Markovic told \nFortescue's legal team that its suppression request in relation to some material was an \"ambit claim\", while the \nrequest from Element Zero to release the report with redactions of selective information, such as residential \naddress and photographs of minors, was \"more nuanced\".\n\"There's a real issue about how much of this material is confidential.\" Markovic said.\nShe noted that she had been \"littered with applications for confidentiality and suppression orders\" regarding the \ncase, where there has been a large amount of interest from third parties requesting documents.\nIn a statement after the court proceedings, Andrew Forrest, Fortescue's executive chairman, said protecting the \ncompany's intellectual property was critical to its success.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue seeks to suppress 600-page document detailing spying on ex-staff\n\"I was surprised to learn of the investigations and have been advised by Fortescue's legal team that they were \nnecessary in order to be granted search orders from the Federal Court,\" Forrest said.\n\"Fortescue's external legal team have been reminded that they also have an obligation to comply with the \ncompany's values and their engagement is now under review.\"\nThe ex-staff members accused of intellectual property theft have denied the allegations.\nMasterman, who is Element Zero's chief executive, has called Fortescue's claims \"spurious\" and said that their \n\"green metals technology was developed independently of, and is very different from, anything that Fortescue is \ndoing or has done in this space\".\nFortescue secured court orders to raid the offices and homes of two of the men from mid-May. An independent \nlawyer was present, and a computer expert was allowed to search and copy any electronic devices, including family \nmembers' computers, while also being required to hand over all passwords and passcodes.\nA summary of the private investigator's report, already released by the court, included photographs and Google \nMaps images of Kolodziejczyk and Winther-Jensen's private residences, floor plans, and also photographs of their \nwives and family members, including children.\nKolodziejczyk is a co-founder and chief technology officer of Element Zero. Winther-Jensen departed Element Zero \nin January.\nElement Zero was formed by Kolodziejczyk and Masterman at the end of 2022. Masterman has had a long career \nin the energy industry, including as Fortescue Future Industries' chief financial officer.\nElement Zero said it wanted to reduce the carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry. It \nhas patented a technology that aims to convert metal ores to metals, not only iron ore, with zero carbon emissions.\nFortescue has said it would \"vigorously\" defend its intellectual property in the development of cutting-edge \nsolutions to decarbonise its Australian iron ore operations by the end of the decade.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.
