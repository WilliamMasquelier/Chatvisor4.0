Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1346 words\nHighlight: Designer George Gorrow is behind a new surf hotel at Crescent Head in NSW, which he desperately \nhopes isn't the next Byron Bay.\nBody\nIf there was such a thing as a slighty scruffy utopia, Crescent Head would fit the bill. Just under five hours' drive \nfrom Sydney (depending on how the Newcastle bypass roadworks are proceeding that day), \"Creso\" is the \nquintessential NSW surf town that time forgot. A council-owned caravan park hogs prime real estate on its \nforeshore. Clusters of surfers lean back on the hoods of their 4WDs in the beach carpark checking the right-\nhanders that peel off perfectly from the craggy headland. Children paddle in the turquoise tidal inlet Killick Creek \nbelow.\nLink to Image\nLouie Douvis\nIt's an unvarnished beauty, made even more memorable by a golden buttery light on my visit and the fact the town \nhasn't attracted the fanfare and overdevelopmen t other NSW coastal meccas like Yamba and Byron have. And that \nsuits multidisciplinary designer George Gorrow and his wife, Cisco Tschurtschenthaler, just fine.\nOn November 1, the couple will open the doors to their 25-room boutique hotel Sea Sea, a collection of low-slung, \nbrown-brick suites and villas that blends a laidback, time-warped spirit of '70s Australian surf culture with \nprogressive cultural immersion.\nLink to Image\nLouie Douvis\n\"There are so many elements to this thing,\" says Gorrow, granting Life & Leisure the first look at the 6000 square-\nmetre motel he acquired in 2022. \"It's going to be a proper surf-culture hotel. We'll have our own surf souvenir shop. \nAn audio lounge. Our own CC TV in-house channel which is like an old version of MTV 'surf-style', so when you go \nto your room you can just flick it on. An event space that will hold seasonal photography-based exhibitions, live \nperformances, movie nights. A space dedicated to listening to music. A games room. And a lounge, restaurant and \nbar that will be accessible to the public, with the food by Daniel Medcalf [ex Icebergs] using the freshest produce \nfrom the Macleay Valley food bowl and wines by Mike Bennie.\nPage 2 of 4\nSea Sea hotel aims for win win blend of old cool and new vogue\n\"We'll also have a rental fleet of surfboards available, which is a collaboration with Byron's Wild Things Gallery, that \nguests can book for their stay.\"\nLocated a five-minute stroll from the surf, two blocks back from the beach, Sea Sea in its previous life was a tired \nthree-star motel with a kidney-shaped pool and restaurant enticingly called Wombats.\nLink to Image\nLouie Douvis\nIt was decided that the building's original bones be retained but privacy became a priority. \"I really loved those old \nmotels all up and down the east coast, where you parked your car and walked in,\" says Gorrow.\n\"But you'd shut the blinds straight away. Everyone walking past could see straight in. They were goldfish bowls. \nWe've bricked those up, setting the windows higher, retaining the skylights to let light stream in and emphasised \neach suite's garden areas, packing the beds with long grasses and natives and protecting them from eyes with \ntimber screens.\"\nFashion fans will remember 52-year-old Gorrow as the co-founder of the cutting-edge yet controversial Australian \ndenim label Ksubi he launched in 1999 with Dan Single, Paul Wilson and Gareth Moody, and resigned from as \ncreative director 12 years later. In 2014, he moved with wife, ceramicist and model Tschurtschenthaler, to Bali and \nin 2016, the couple channelled their energy into the hospitality arena with the launch of Canggu's The Slow hotel.\nArchitectural/interior design projects followed, including Byron Bay's Soma (its owner Gary Gorrow is the Vedic \nmeditation guru and George's brother); Bali's Sandhouse Berawa villa and the restaurant Times Beach Warung; as \nwell as hospitality venues like Santa Monica's \u00c9lephante and Los Angeles' Belles Beach House.\nLink to Image\nLouie Douvis\n\"To me this place feels like early Bali,\" says Gorrow, dipping a bare foot in Sea Sea's 20-metre green-tiled pool, \nwhich is surrounded by palm trees, wooden decks, U-shaped lounges and pergolas. \"The low-lying villas, the big \ngardens: that doesn't exist in Bali any more because developers just want to pack everything in, make everything \nout of steel and build higher.\"\nHe surveys the scene. \"Imagine this spot in winter. The beautiful energy of fire from the fire-pit, steam coming off \nthe pool...\"\nKey design elements throughout the space are exposed brick walls coated in a satin gloss to darken them slightly, \nand original golden-pine timber wall panels stained a darker teak to match the new furniture - a mix of vintage items \nand custom pieces the couple designed and had manufactured in Bali.\nLink to Image\nLouie Douvis\nWooden touches give the place a hunting-cabin feel. Retro-style speakers (a collaboration with furniture brand \nTorre) pull double-duty as bedside tables. Polygon-shaped light sconces, hand-carved by American artist Aleph \nGeddis, hang on walls and glow red at night (\"It won't break your circadian rhythm if you wake to go to the \nbathroom,\" quips Gorrow.)\nLink to Image\nLouie DouvisPage 3 of 4\nSea Sea hotel aims for win win blend of old cool and new vogue\nArtworks fashioned from raw wood frames predominantly comprise photographs with a '70s Australian surf-culture \nvibe, captured by the likes of Kate Bellm, Peter Crawford and legendary surf snapper Alby Falzon, whose iconic \nblack-and-white shot of surfers at Crescent Head has been printed onto a frame shaped to resemble a decorative \nBavarian-style cutout.\n\"It's a nod to my German heritage,\" says Cisco proudly, the intent being to honour the charms of the old in a new \nand inventive way.\nThe couple fell for Crescent Head because of its strong identity, and say it's a slice of paradise that needs to be \ncelebrated in an authentic way. But converting rundown retro motels along Australia's east coast into luxe hotels \nisn't exactly an original concept. (Exhibits A, B and C: Cabarita's Halcyon House, Gold Coast's Mysa Motel and \nByron's The Sunseeker).\n\"The thing is, we're not trying to evoke Palm Springs, southern California or Italy here,\" assures Gorrow. \"Sea Sea \nis uniquely Australian in design, aesthetic and intent. We're not targeting the wealthy jet set from Sydney or \nBrisbane. You don't have to be a guest to dine in our restaurant or drink at the bar. And we've deliberately designed \nthe frontage so it's open to the street to make the town and community feel they're invited in.\"\nStudios and suites are priced between $460 and $508 a night, two-bedroom suites from $600, and a villa with a \nprivate pool $1250 - not exorbitant compared with competitors whose rates start at $800.\nLink to Image\nLouie Douvis\n\"This pricing has to draw in like-minded people,\" says Gorrow. \"If you push those people out and chase a more \ncashed-up guest, suddenly they don't like your food or your music.\" He shrugs unapologetically. \"I don't care if you \nput that in the story!\"\nThat aside, Sea Sea appears to be a canny business decision. South towards Point Plomer, out along the newly \nasphalted (previously the notorious potholed dirt) back road and past the breathtaking Racecourse Beach, there's \nnot a soul in sight. For the moment.\nLink to Image\nLouie Douvis\nHere, plans are under way to link four of the Macleay Valley Coast's national parks with walking trails (the Five \nHeadlands Coastal Experience), an 80-kilometre trek that could rival Tasmania and New Zealand's best hiking \ntracks and draw even more visitors to the region.\nIn state forest just south of Kempsey, the addition of five new mountain-bike trails means the region now attracts \nbiking enthusiasts from all over the country. And just up the road, 40 minutes' drive away at South West Rocks, lies \nthe Fish Rock Cave dive site, considered one of Australia's best.\nOr you could just stay put at Sea Sea, order yourself a negroni and immerse yourself in Gorrow's showcase of surf-\ncommunity creatives. \"Cis says to me, 'George, really? Are you going to add that to it? You're biting off more than \nyou can chew here. Maybe on the next hotel you need to do it differently?'\n\"But I don't know how to do it differently. It's exciting to add all these bits to it. If you took one away, you'd be \nmissing that. I like that it feels full. I go bang! And then I mould things. It's constant removing ... adding ...\"\n\"What does Sea Sea stand for?\" he asks, grinning. \"It's fun.\"Page 4 of 4\nSea Sea hotel aims for win win blend of old cool and new vogue\nGraphic\n \nCisco Tschurtschenthaler and George Gorrow at Sea Sea Hotel, Crescent Head.\nSunrise at Crescent Head. \nSurfers love the ride-hand break off Crescent Head. \nLocal surf shop and the owner's dad, Chad, doing some touchup paintwork after an electrical fire.\nLongboard surfer Lyn, who was at Crescent Head for a surf competition on the weekend that Life & Leisure visited.\nHelen Eames from Noosa going for a morning swim. \nCrescent Head and the local attractions.
