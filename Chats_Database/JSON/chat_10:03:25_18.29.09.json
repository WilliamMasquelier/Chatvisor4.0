Pg. 14\nLength: 488 words\nByline: EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER\nBody\nBHP shareholders on Wednesday night were taking the view that the negotiations with its takeover target Anglo \nAmerican would probably result in a compromise.\nThe miner's announcement on Wednesday showed that it was moving to allay concerns around risks in South \nAfrica related to its deal, and expectations are that there will be a coming together in the middle from both sides.\nThe fact that BHP had asked for an extension for negotiations showed that it remained a keen buyer of Anglo \nAmerican and, as it was made clear last week, the discussion had gone beyond value and moved to deal structure.\nAnother week would allow Anglo American to work through the issues further, and some believe it should have \neven gone as far as underwriting the transaction.\nBy taking the South African Kumba iron ore operation from Anglo American shareholders as part of the deal, rather \nthan returning it to them as planned, BHP could combine it with some coal mines in a sale process down the track \nand potentially achieve a better price for the assets.\nOn Wednesday, there was divided opinion as to whether BHP was making progress with Anglo American in the \nnegotiations, with some suggesting the lack of an announcement that an extension had been agreed meant it was \nnot gaining the co-operation from Anglo American it may have been hoping for.\nAs reported by The Australian on Wednesday, among BHP's efforts to allay fears surrounding structure was the \noffer of a \"reverse break fee\", and it had offered direct responses to Anglo's concerns, including offering the South \nAfrican government a three-year guarantee to maintain staffing levels in the country, sharing any costs of employee \nshare schemes, and establishing a mining centre of excellence in the country to train mine workers and conduct \nresearch and development for BHP's global mining operations.\nPage 2 of 2\nShareholders see compromise on the cards as BHP continues discussions with Anglo American - DATA \nROOM\nElsewhere, an odd application to the Takeovers Panel revealed to the market on Wednesday shows that mergers \nand acquisitions remain on the agenda for Ramelius Resources.\nThe gold miner led by Mark Zeptner is seen as a sophisticated operator that will soon be more cashed-up than it \nalready is and has executed well on mergers and acquisitions in the past, so the market would probably support \nany deal it puts forward.\nIt walked away from a deal to buy Canadian gold miner Karora, with which Westgold Resources has agreed to \nembark on a $2.2bn merger transaction.\nBut judging by the Takeovers Panel application, it appears that Ramelius is keen to take part in some sort of two-\nway of three-way tie-up with Westgold and/or Karora.\nIt's objecting to the cost of the break fee on Westgold's deal with Karora, which is standard for deals in Canada, and \na one-year standstill agreement Ramelius and Westgold had in place from November. Expectations are that once \nthe panel examines the application, it will be thrown out. Ramelius closed down 7 per cent on Wednesday and \nWestgold up 6.5 per cent.\nLoad-Date: May 29, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Mark Zeptner | CEO of Ramelius Resources | \"The gold miner led by Mark Zeptner is seen as a sophisticated operator that will soon be more cashed-up than it already is and has executed well on mergers and acquisitions in the past, so the market would probably support any deal it puts forward.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
