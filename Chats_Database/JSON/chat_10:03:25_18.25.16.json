However, Scantlebury \\nsays discussions with mining contractors and industry suppliers shows pressures are easing, be it wage rises or \\nfuel prices.\\n\\\"The rate of cost inflation has definitely come off, so we're very confident that this gold price increase will convert to \\nproper margin and proper cash flow,\\\" he says.\\nThat's a shift Euroz Hartleys expects to show up in the March quarterly reports of miners like Northern Star \\nResources, Evolution, Ramelius, Perseus, West African and Gold Road Resources. Euroz Hartleys would expect \\ninvestors to then focus on smaller producers and explorers after a re-rate in these larger miners occurs.\\n\\\"Assuming the gold price stays equal, gold producers in Australia should definitely re-rate,\\\" Scantlebury says.\\nANZ commodity strategists Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari said gold's latest rally isn't being derailed by the \\nmarket's expectation that the Fed may push back expected cuts in interest rates, delaying a move that would signal \\nit has US inflation under control.\\n\\\"While speculators have increased their bullish bets recently, positions are not matching the intensity of the latest \\nprice rally. Moreover, disinvestment in gold-backed exchange-traded funds has been continuing,\\\" they said in a \\nresearch note last week.\\n\\\"A pull-back in gold prices is likely in the short term, as [the] recent rally has surpassed macroeconomic and \\ngeopolitical developments,\\\" they maintain.\\nAt Bullion Now, Pepper also anticipates things to calm down. \\\"We're expecting a pullback in the shorter-term,\\\" he \\nsays.

At least Bellevue could raise money.

The Diggers organisers showed a sense of theatre when Spartan boss Lawson and Ramelius boss \\nMark Zeptner spoke back-to-back on Wednesday. Lawson has stirred the pot by suggesting that with a market \\ncapitalisation of $1.2 billion, Spartan might now be too much to bite off for $2.16 billion Ramelius.\\nLess than a year ago, he was hoping Ramelius, Westgold or Silver Lake would come knocking about a deal and \\nbemoaning a timid approach to M&A in the gold sector.\\n\\\"I stand by that,\\\" Lawson said this week. \\\"There was a little confusion about why no one had moved on me earlier. \\nWhy did [Ramelius] wait until it cost them $185 million to get less than 20 per cent of my company? I'm still \\nconfused as to why cashed-up gold producers, who are actually running at a pretty good premium and with \\npremium gold prices, are not more active in that M&A space.\\\"\\nNorthern Star, valued at $16.3 billion, made many of its acquisitions at times when the gold price was in the \\ndoldrums.\\nBoth Northern Star boss Stuart Tonkin and Evolution Mining executive chairman Jake Klein said this week that they \\nwere less inclined to make acquisitions at a high gold price.\\nDespite the impressive size and grade of Never Never, one hurdle for Lawson has been the stigma associated with \\nGascoyne. \\\"One particular fund manager said he hated Gascoyne, it had torched $35 million of his fund and that it \\nreally left a bad taste in his mouth,\\\" Lawson says. \\\"He said he wasn't interested in hearing our story, but he turned \\nup, sat in a corner and pretended not to listen. Eight minutes later he wanted 5 per cent.\\\"Page 3 of 3\\nGold saves the day as Diggers deals with the rout\\nLawson is also backing his mate Stralow to deliver with Bellevue despite some grumblings about the capital raising \\nat a big discount. \\\"There's more money in the tank now [at Bellevue], and he's running the highest-grade gold mine \\nin Australia. It's going to be very profitable,\\\" he adds.\\nLast year at Diggers, lithium was all the rage, with Albemarle about to up its bid for Liontown to $6.6 billion and Gina \\nRinehart and Chile's SQM working up to a joint $1.7 billion takeover offer for explorer Azure Minerals.\\nAndrew Forrest-backed Wyloo had just completed its $760 million acquisition of nickel miner Mincor. BHP was \\nplanning to build a 1000-bed village at Kalgoorlie to accommodate the workforce needed for a major overhaul and \\nupdate of its nickel smelter.\\nA year later, the Wyloo mines are mothballed and BHP has written down the value of its nickel business by $5.4 \\nbillion. Glencore and IGO Limited have the only nickel mines still standing in WA - and they are just hanging on.\\nIGO sold its 30 per cent stake in Tropicana, one of WA's biggest gold mines, to Regis Resources in 2021 as part of \\na big punt on battery minerals that involved acquiring stakes in the Greenbushes lithium mine and a still mis-firing \\nlithium hydroxide refinery.\\nThe same green metals strategy led to the disastrous acquisition of nickel miner Western Areas.\\nThose deals were done before Ivan Vella arrived as chief executive. He remains optimistic on lithium but isn't so \\nsure about a nickel revival in the face of growing supply from Chinese-backed producers in Indonesia.\\n\\\"What we do know is a lot of WA nickel mines are actually quite old.

Gold has also had double-digit returns in \\nmost other major currencies, including the Australian dollar, where it has surged by an impressive 25 per cent.\\nThese gains have been driven by investor optimism about upcoming US interest rate cuts and lingering geopolitical \\nrisks. In the past three interest rate easing -cycles in the US, the US dollar gold price has averaged an increase of \\n40 per cent.\\nDespite the gold price being near all-time high levels, gold equities have underperformed. Since August 2020, when \\nthe Australian gold equities index was at its all-time high, gold equities have underperformed the gold price by about \\n45 per cent. In our view, the potential for gold equities to catch up is a significant opportunity for investors, given the \\nfundamentals for gold remain very strong.\\nTo date, gold's performance has been due to significant buying from central banks and eastern investors who have \\nmainly acquired physical gold. In contrast, western investors, who typically favour gold mining equities, have for the \\nlarge part not participated in the gold run so far.\\nRecent figures indicate that the average investor currently holds less than 1 per cent of gold in their total portfolio, \\nwhich is significantly less than the four-decade average of 2 per cent. This is even lower than the estimated 6 per \\ncent in 1980 when the last inflation-led gold bull market occurred and the gold price reached its all-time high of \\nabout $US2850 per ounce on an inflation-adjusted basis. The potential entry of western investors and a higher gold \\nprice is likely to be a tailwind for the gold equities to rerate higher. The fight for relevance in investor portfolios has \\nbeen challenging for the gold sector versus other more favoured sectors, such as technology. Persistent cost \\npressures have negatively impacted gold miners' ability to generate free cashflow and provide an attractive return to \\ninvestors.\\nHowever, with gold prices now rising faster than inflation, cash margins are expanding. We estimate that the \\naverage cash margin for the Australian gold miners is at record levels of $1700 an ounce of gold produced. Recent \\ncompany results indicate this is being translated into financial performance, with Australian gold miners such as \\nPage 2 of 2\\nA golden opportunity as stocks trail the commodity's price\\nNorthern Star and Ramelius generating strong free cashflow, allowing them to return capital to investors through \\nincreased dividends.\\nThe relative valuation of gold miners versus the rest of the market is also attractive. Based on forward earnings \\nmultiples, Aus-tralian gold miners are trading at a 40 per cent discount to the rest of the market. In addition, the \\nmarket consensus gold price for the next 12 months is about 10 per cent lower than the current gold price of $3780 \\nin Australian dollars. Should the gold price remain at these levels for an extended period, then the market will need \\nto upgrade its forward earnings forecasts, making gold equities even cheaper. Gold miners' cashflow generation \\npotential and attractive valuation compared to the rest of the market cannot be ignored by the market for too long.\\nThe disconnect in equity performance is even more apparent in the gold developers and explorers. The \\noutperformance of developers and explorers is typically later in the cycle when investors are looking for value \\nfurther down the mine life cycle. At current discounted levels, it remains cheaper to acquire someone else's ounces \\nthan it is to discover new ounces. The potential for sector consolidation could further enhance the appeal of gold \\nminers as an investment, particularly in an environment where the price of physical gold continues to rise, and more \\ninvestors seek exposure.\\nThe Victor Smorgon Group has been well placed in gold for some time now and has capitalised on the record run of \\nthe precious metal. Our Global Multi Strategy Fund and Resources Gold Fund can invest internationally, and prefer \\nstocks that are attractively priced, operate in safe jurisdictions and are forecast to generate strong cashflow yields in \\nthe next year. Australian gold miners that we are attracted to include Ramelius and Red5. International gold miners \\nthat have consistently delivered include -Agnico Eagle and Alamos Gold.
