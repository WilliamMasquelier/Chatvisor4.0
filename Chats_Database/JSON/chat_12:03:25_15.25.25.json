The \njunior operator was forced to shut down production over a safety issue and subsequently went into voluntary \nadministration.\nThere were fears the federal government would have to step in and bear the cost of the clean-up, with the Morrison \ngovernment at one point floating the idea of a $250m-plus industry levy to pay for it.\nInstead new rules around trailing liability provisions were introduced. These could slug former owners of the licence \nareas with the bills, thereby putting the onus on them to do adequate due diligence should the assets change \nhands.\n\"The trailing liability provisions will be an action of last resort when all other safeguards have been exhausted and \nwill reduce the risk that the financial costs of decommissioning will be left to Australian taxpayers,\" the then-\nresources minister Keith Pitt said at the time.\n\"It also sets the expectation that sellers will undertake appropriate due diligence before selling assets, titles and \ninfrastructure, so they can avoid being called back to decommission and remediate title areas.\" The exploration \npermit in the current matter was granted to Woodside, Shell and BHP Billiton Petroleum in 1997, with Woodside \nowning a half-share and the other two companies one-quarter each.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell sues Woodside over $86m oil platform clean-up\nProduction from the Laminaria and Corallina oilfields began in 1999. The writ filed with Western Australia's \nSupreme Court says Shell then sold two-thirds of its interest to Woodside in March 2005, and one-third to British \ncompany Paladin.\nShell says in its claim that the agreement with each company \"expressly provided ... that Woodside/Paladin is liable \nfor all environmental, abandonment, re-clam-ation, remediation and restoration claims\".\nThe claim says following the failure of TSOGA, neither that company nor its liquidator made any efforts to remediate \nthe platform.\n\"Thereafter the Commonwealth has commenced the process of decommissioning the Northern Endeavour and \nseabed infrastructure,\" the claim says.\nShell says it received notices of assessment in January 2023 and 2024, for $42.3m and $44.3m respectively, but \nsays Woodside and Paladin are liable for those payments under the agreements struck in 2005.\nShell says it wrote to both companies in February last year and March this year, but Woodside denied liability for \nboth payments via letter, while Paladin also refused to pay.\nShell is seeking the $86.6m in accrued payments to date, and \"A declaration that Woodside/Paladin must \nindemnify Shell for, and hold it harmless against, any or all of the amounts for which Shell is in the future held to be \nliable to the Australian Taxation Office under the Offshore Petroleum Levy Act, plus all costs reasonably incurred by \nShell with respect to that liability, including legal costs of and associated with this action.\" Woodside has been \ncontacted for comment.\nLoad-Date: May 30, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
