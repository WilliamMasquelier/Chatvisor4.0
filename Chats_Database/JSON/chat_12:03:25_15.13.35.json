It's a remarkable rise for the co-founder of the semiconductor company, who was ranked 128th with a net \nworth of $US13.5 billion as recently as early last year.\nNvidia surged 16 per cent to a record high on Thursday in New York, adding about $US277 billion in market value. \nThat was the biggest single-session increase in market history, beating Meta's $US197 billion gain earlier this \nmonth. The company was able to exceed sky-high investor expectations with a revenue forecast that was more \nthan $US2 billion ahead of analyst expectations.\nNvidia's rally boosted the fortunes of the 30 billionaires on Bloomberg's wealth list who attribute at least some of \ntheir wealth to AI by a combined $US42.8 billion. Charles Liang, CEO of Super Micro Computer, was the biggest \nwinner on a percentage basis with a 33 per cent jump.\nNvidia's outlook extends a streak of the company shattering expectations, thanks to insatiable demand for its \nartificial intelligence accelerators - highly prized chips that crunch data for AI models. The technology has helped \npower a proliferation of chatbots and other generative AI services, which can create text and graphics based on \nsimple prompts.\n\"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point,\" Huang said. \"Demand is surging worldwide \nacross companies, industries and nations.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nAI chipmaker Nvidia CEO's wealth soars $15b in a day; Technology\nNvidia's market capitalisation has now increased by more than $US650 billion this year - bringing its valuation to \n$US1.89 trillion - as investors bet that the company will remain the prime beneficiary of an AI computing boom.\nThat turned Wednesday's report into a highly anticipated event for both Wall Street and the tech world. And the \nnumbers - along with the upbeat tone from Huang - renewed confidence that spending will stay strong.\n\"The entire market is watching this report and expectations have been elevated,\" Wolfe Research analyst Chris \nCaso said.\nGuidance was strong enough to \"demonstrate continued momentum, while also leaving room for continued upside \nthrough the second half.\"\nNvidia, co-founded by Huang in 1993, got its start as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. Its profile \nblew up in the last two years, when its technology proved adept at handling heavy AI workloads. The company's \nH100 accelerators have become legendary in the tech world, with customers scrambling to get their hands on as \nmany as possible.\nCompanies such as Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet's Google are Nvidia's largest customers, \naccounting for nearly 40 per cent of its revenue, as they rush to invest in hardware for AI computing.\nIn the US fiscal fourth quarter, which ended January 28, Nvidia's revenue more than tripled to $US22.1 billion. Profit \nexcluding certain items was $US5.16 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $US20.4 billion and earnings \nof $US4.60 a share. Underscoring the magnitude of its recent growth streak: As recently as 2021, Nvidia didn't \ngenerate that much revenue in an entire year.\nNvidia's data centre division, now by far its largest source of sales, generated $US18.4 billion of revenue, up 409 \nper cent from the same period a year earlier. Gaming chips provided $US2.87 billion of sales.\nNvidia is now working to spread its AI technology beyond the big data-centre companies. Huang, 61, has travelled \nthe globe arguing that governments and corporations need their own AI systems - both to protect their data and \ngain a competitive advantage.\nNvidia announced a deal with Cisco Systems earlier this month that gives it a new distribution channel. As part of \nthat deal, Cisco, the world's biggest provider of networking gear, will help sell complete AI systems to companies.\nBut Nvidia faces risks, including mounting competition and a push by some customers to develop their own AI \nchips.\n\"We're going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in the marketplace,\" Huang said. \nBloomberg\nLoad-Date: February 23, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOnly output one of these values: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and nothing else.\n                ",
