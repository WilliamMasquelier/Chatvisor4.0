Focus on how the article portrays Shell in terms of its actions, reputation, performance, and impact. The tone should be categorized as one of the following:\n\nPositive: The article reflects well on Shell, highlighting favorable aspects.\nNeutral: The article presents information about Shell in a balanced, objective manner without any strong positive or negative bias.\nNegative: The article is critical of Shell, highlighting challenges, controversies, failures, or unfavorable developments.\n\nProvide the final tone assessment as \"Positive,\" \"Neutral,\" or \"Negative.\"\n\nHere is the article content: Page 1 of 2\nShell suspends Red Sea shipments amid attack fears\nShell suspends Red Sea shipments amid attack fears\nThe Australian\nJanuary 18, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: WSJ; Pg. 17\nLength: 390 words\nByline: Benoit Faucon\nBody\nBritish oil major Shell has suspended all shipments through the Red Sea indefinitely after US and UK strikes on \nYemen's Houthi rebels triggered fears of further escalation, according to sources.\nThe West's targeting of the Iranian-ally militia came after the Houthis launched dozens of missiles and drones at \ncommercial vessels around the Red Sea and the nearby Bab el-Mandeb. The militia has said the attacks are in \nresponse to the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip.\nAbout 12 per cent of total global seaborne oil trade goes through the Red Sea. Last month, a tanker chartered by \nShell to move Indian jet fuel was targeted by a drone in the Red Sea and harassed by Houthi boats, according to \nshipping officials.\nShell declined to comment on the suspension of transit and the attack. But the company last week halted all \ncrossings over concerns that a successful -attack could trigger a massive spill in the region, as well as present risks \nto the safety of crews on the ships, sources said.\nShell joins other global shippers in deciding to avoid the Red Sea, including other energy companies.\nBP last month said it would pause all shipments through the key shipping lane, and Qatar Energy did the same this \nweek.\nQatar, which has acted as a mediator for the Houthis in the past, halted the use of the Red Sea route for its \nliquefied natural gas exports for fear of being caught in the conflict, according to a Qatari energy official and \nshipping trackers.\nRecent Houthi attacks, initially directed against Israeli-linked vessels, have rattled global markets, upended \ninternational shipping routes and become more indiscriminate. The rebels have attacked vessels from \ncontainerships to tankers moving sanctioned Russian oil, as the global shipping nexus complicates their ability to \nidentify specific targets.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell suspends Red Sea shipments amid attack fears\nThey have vowed to continue their campaign against US and international targets in the region in response to \nIsrael's actions in Gaza. \"Anyone attempting to hinder us from doing so will fail,\" a Houthi official said on Monday. \nAfter the US-led strike, several captains of chartered vessels heading for Europe via the Suez Canal have refused \nto enter the Red Sea, forcing them to sail through a lengthy route around southern Africa. The Singapore ship \nregistry and Intertanko, an industry lobby group, said the waterway should be avoided.\nLoad-Date: January 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should solely be one of these three words based on your assessment: \"Positive\", \"Neutral\", or \"Negative\". Nothing else\n                ",
