Please go ahead.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Travis. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to dial into Ramelius' December 2023 \nquarterly conference call. I'm joined this morning for the first time in a speaking role that is by acting CFO, Ben \nRingrose, who will provide some detail on the quarterly financials after I've run through the highlights.\nAs usual, there will be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions before we finish up the call. As you will have \nseen this morning we reported quarterly gold reduction of 68,524 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of AUD1,837 \nper ounce which is towards the upper end of our quarterly guidance of 60,000 to 70,000 ounces, and also in line \nwith internal forecasts that has production increasing over the course of the financial year. The increase in the \nDecember quarter was primarily attributable to a greater contribution from Penny underground and also mining at \nthe Symes' open-pit operation ramping up.\nAs I said, Ben will delve into the financials further, but I wanted to highlight upfront that the increase in production, \nwe saw a similar trend with cash generation. Operating cash flow was 68 million with underlying free cash flow \ntotaling 45.7 million, our best performance on that front for several years. Further, we anticipate strong cash flows \nwill continue over the rest of the financial year and beyond. Including the December quarter contribution, first half \nproduction totaled 12447 ounces, at an all-in sustaining cost of just under $1,900 an ounce, again ahead of our \ninternal budgets and at the upper end of guidance.\nYou may have noticed we have upgraded second half guidance to 140,000 to 155,000 ounces and consequently \nfull year guidance for this financial year has also increased to 265,000 to 280,000 ounces. By way of reminder, \noriginal guidance was 250,000 to 275,000 ounces. In terms of all-in sustaining costs, the guidance range in the \nsecond half is AUD1700 to AUD1800, which demonstrates a continuing downward trend and results in full year all-\nin sustaining costs for FY24 of AUD1750 to AUD1850. This compared to our original all-in sustaining cost guidance \nof AUD1550 to AUD 1750 with the higher costs attributable to CV01 conveyor appears carried out at Mt Magnet in \nthe quarter, which I'll expand on shortly and also an increased production contribution from Edna May, which is the \nhigher cost production hub of the two.\nThe split in production from our two houses were relatively even this quarter with Mt Magnet producing just over \n35,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of AUD1,668 and Edna May also producing just over 33,000 ounces as \nan all-in sustaining cost up to over AUD2,000 per ounce. That breakdown gives an insight into the real impact of \nPenny on costs at Mt Magnet. Although it should be noted that the Edna May all-in sustaining figure does include a \nreasonably significant non-cash component, which relates to the drawdown of existing stockpiles. I'll let Ben to \nexplain the actual unit cost detail later.\nDuring the quarter, a total of 36,829 tonnes at 12.39 grams per tonne for 14,296 recoverable ounces was hauled \nfrom Penny to Mt Magnet. At Penny with multiple stoping areas becoming available, production is expected to \nincrease significantly in the second half. On the CV01, mill throughput at Mt Magnet was impacted by repairs to the \nmain conveyor structure, which goes from the crusher to the course or stockpile referred to as CV01. They put it out \nof action for approximately nine weeks. We were however able to maintain plant feed, albeit at a slightly lower rate \nthrough the use of a mobile crushing solution. Thankfully, the conveyer outage didn't prevent us from meeting \nproduction targets, as the site team and external contractors managed the situation very well, but we did incur some \nextra costs, both sustaining capital for the repairs and operating costs associated with the mobile crushing and \nhaulage operation, which added almost AUD180 per ounce to Mt Magnet's quarterly all-in sustaining costs. The \nrepairs were completed by mid-December and we have reviewed our structural integrity regime, and have taken \nsteps to reduce the likelihood of similar unplanned repairs being required elsewhere in the plant in the future.\nThe quarter saw completion of mining operations in Marda, with rehab activities now being carried out while \nremaining stockpiles have been hauled to Edna May. At the end of the period, there was almost 450,000 tonnes \ngrading 1.71 grams per tonne in stockpiles at Marda. A similar situation is playing out at Tampia where mining \noperations ceased in the middle of last year, and there we have just over 635,000 tonnes at a grade near to 1.5 \ngrams per tonne in stockpiles at the end of the quarter.Page 3 of 8\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\nOn to exploration; highlights in the quarter include results from resource definition work undertaken at Eridanus \ntargeting high-grade mineralization for potential underground mining below and outside their plant of a current open \npit. Among the better intercepts from the [Indiscernible] RC program with 13 meters at 10.4, 12 meters at 12.8, and \n10 meters at 18.1. Important to note, all significantly better grades than what we're seeing at depths previously at \nEridanus.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nAt Galaxy underground diamond drilling targeting the Mars ore body produced results including two meters at 28.9 \nand four meters at 17.8, whilst diamond drilling at the Bombora deposit, part of the Roe Project acquired from \nBreaker Resources produced first results, which included 4.5 meters at 18.7 and 4.2 meters at 11.1, which were \nfrom the Tura underground Lode.\nLastly, in terms of the highlights, we wrapped up the acquisition of Musgrave Minerals in October having reached \nthe compulsory acquisition threshold of 90% acceptances. Infill and extensional diamond and RC drilling is \nunderway at the key project targeting the high-grade Break of Day resource, but also the nearby Waratah \nProspect. We've only received limited results at this stage. Further information on the expiration program, there's \nplenty of detail in the quarterly itself.\nNow that covers the highlights for me. So I'll now hand over to Ben.\nBen Ringrose\nThank you, Mark, and it's a pleasure to be here with you all today. December quarter was indeed a very strong one \nfinancially for Ramelius with sales revenue of 194.5 million and an associated underlying free cash flow of 47.5 \nmillion, which is after growth and exploration investment. On both metrics, the December quarter was our best since \nJune 2020. During the quarter we sold just over 68,000 ounces at an average realized gold price of AUD2,855 an \nounce, which includes a mix of spot and committed forward sales.\nAs Mark mentioned, the all-in sustaining costs for the December quarter was AUD1,837 per ounce. Pleasingly both \nproduction centers reported a low all-in sustaining cost than the prior quarter. At Mt Magnet, 8% reduction in all-in \nsustaining costs was achieved despite the increased costs associated with the one-off CV01 repairs, which, as a \nreminder, added AUD179 per announced to the Mt Magnet all-in sustaining costs for the quarter. Impact of Penny is \nevident here along with the increased tonnages and grades from Mt Magnet's own open pit operations.\nMoving on to Edna May, the improved all-in sustaining costs was the result of increased throughput and grades, \nmost notably the introduction of the high-grade ore from Symes'. Whilst Edna May is reporting a higher all-in \nsustaining costs than Mt Magnet, it is important to note that this includes a AUD227 per ounce non-cash charge for \nthe drawdown of existing Tampia stockpiles. This non-cash component of the Edna May all-in sustaining costs will \nincrease over the second half of FY24, as the existing Tampia, Marda and Symes' stockpiles continue to be drilling \ndown and monetized.\nThe resulting operating cash flow from the business was AUD68 million, from which AUD20.9 million was invested \nin growth capital exploration and resource definition. The quarter also saw Ramelius return AUD17.3 million in \ncash to shareholders by our via FY23 dividend paid in October 2023, as well as complete the Musgrave Minerals \nacquisition with a final consideration payment of AUD2.1 million. AUD10.5 million investment in growth capital for \nthe quarter mainly related to the Galaxy underground mine and the AUD10.4 million spent on exploration and \nresource definition in the quarter focused on the Rebecca and Roe Gold Project and the recently acquired Cue \nGold Project. Both capital and exploration spent is in line with our forecast and we have maintained our full-year \nguidance on capital and project development expenditure of AUD50 million to AUD60 million and exploration and \nresource definition expenditure of AUD30 [Phonetic] million.\nThe closing cash and gold position of AUD281.8 million was our best on record leaving Ramelius in a very healthy \nfinancial position. Further to this, a total of AUD9.2 million was received from the -- was due from the ATO in \nDecember. However, the late payment of this by the ATO meant these funds were only received by Ramelius in Page 4 of 8\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\nthe first week of January. Notionally, including this, the reported cash and gold at 31 December would have been \nAUD291 million. In addition to the strong cash and gold position is our AUD100 million debt facility, which remains \nin place and undrawn.\nThe Aussie dollar spot price increased 5% over the December quarter, finishing at just under AUD3,030 an ounce. \nIn fact, the Aussie dollar gold price has had a daily closing price above AUD3,000 every day since the 12th of \nOctober 2023, a trend that is continuing into the March 2024 quarter. What is even more encouraging about this is \nthat this AUD3,000 plus gold price was maintained despite the strengthening Aussie dollar pointing to a \nfundamental increase in the US dollar gold value.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to gradually rundown our fixed price contracts delivering 30,000 ounces into \nmaturing contracts and replacing 24,000 of these at an average price of AUD3,259 an ounce. At the end of the \nquarter, forward gold sales consisted of 192,000 ounces at an average price of AUD2,918 an ounce over the period \nJanuary 2024 to June 2026. As you will note, our committed ounces have decreased over the financial year and we \nexpect this trend to continue for the remainder of FY24. A disciplined hedge book maintenance over the past 12 \nmonths leaves the book in a very healthy position.\nLastly to note on gold sales is that with the increased production forecasted for H2, our exposure to the spot price \nwill increase in the second half of FY24.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nWith that I'll now hand back to Mark.\nMark Zeptner\nThanks Ben. Travis, if we could please open the line up for questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Hayden Bairstow from Argonaut. Please go \nahead.\nHayden Bairstow\nHi, good morning guys. Pretty impressive results at Magnet mining wise. I mean just get a field of view to the \nsecond half and obviously you push guidance a bit higher about Edna May, I mean despite that mill shut down, and \nwhat -- how are we looking second half on ounces into Magnet, looks like it's going to be a pretty sizable increase.\nMark Zeptner\nYeah. Good morning, Hayden. It's Mark. I don't have the numbers off top my head but it's driven obviously by \nincreases at Penny combined with the gradual ramp up at Galaxy but probably more importantly at Magnet is \nreducing strip ratio at Eridanus and improving grades at depth. We're saying that back into it as there was a bit of a \nlower grade section that we mined through for 12 months, but we're back into much better grades at Eridanus. So \nthe combination of those three things leads to a very strong second half at Magnet. I'm not sure if you've got the \nnumbers Ben but I won't put you on the spot with that. But yeah, we can provide some numbers Hayden.\nHayden Bairstow\nYeah, okay. And just on -- I guess more beyond 2025, just given you locking in hedging, almost 3300 an ounce and \nthen does that start to make the stage very cut back at Magnet look like a more attractive option for you guys to sort \nof deliver to production decline there?\nMark ZeptnerPage 5 of 8\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\nPotentially, you're a little bit ahead of where we're focused on right at the moment. We will be putting out this \nquarter a new Mt Magnet mine plan and then probably turning our attention to see sort of 12 months on from when \nwe made the decision to defer stage three where we stand. We're obviously seeing some things in the market labor \nwise that are starting to ease. Unfortunately, that's brought about by some closures of operations, but we think, in a \ncouple of months time, we will dust that off and see where we're at, Hayden.\nHayden Bairstow\nAnd the Magnet mine plan, that obviously incorporates all the key stuff, I presume, is that going to come with an \nupgrade to that -- or an update to that three year guidance?\nMark Zeptner\nYeah, the idea with the Mt Magnet mine plan is obviously, including any Penny extensions, which we've already \nflagged, the Q project in its entirety and then obviously, the portfolio of projects at Mt Magnet itself, including \n[Indiscernible] et cetera. There's a whole list of names there, so everything that goes into Mt Magnet out for the \nforeseeable future.\nHayden Bairstow\nAlright. Perfectly alluded. Thanks, guys.\nMark Zeptner\nThanks, Hayden.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Alex Barkley from RBC. Please go ahead.\nAlex Barkley\nThanks. Good morning Mark and Ben. Question on that strong Edna May production this year. Is that mostly \naround accelerated mining and haulage? Does that mean, it might get pulled forward from FY25 or is there some \nother component to the strong result this year? Thanks.\nMark Zeptner\nIt is Mark again. Alex, good morning. Stronger performance out of the underground definitely. Since we've \naddressed the water issues, which were prominent mid-to-late last year, the team out there has really hit some \ndecent production numbers. It's a small underground, but they are pushing towards 30,000 ton a month there. So \nthat may bring forward some production there into 2024. The haulage, I think, has been pretty consistent. The \nramping up and the inclusion of Symes' sort of has added to that. And I think some of the Symes' grades are \nprobably a little better than we might have expected in certain areas of the pit as well. So I don't think we're robbing \nPeter to pay Paul at the Edna May. I think it's better performance, the underground with better grades, and sort of \nconsistent haulage like in summer.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nAlex Barkley\nOkay. That's very helpful. Thanks very much, guys.\nMark Zeptner\nThanks, Alex.Page 6 of 8\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Dr. Richard Hatch from Topwheel [Phonetic]. \nPlease go ahead.\nRichard Hatch\nHello, Mark, and Ben. Happy New Year to you and thanks for another great performance. I thought a brilliant \nperformance, particularly with the conveyor belt problems. Obviously, I had a question about it, and may everybody \ndoes about what happens next, but I'll leave that one alone. One thing I remember talking about, I think last time \nwas your hedging of oil and I see you have hedged 5 million liters. I just wondered, how does that 0.991 price \nhedge diesel compare -- beware, I won't judge you because I'm all for hedging for insurance, but how does it \ncompare with current price?\nBen Ringrose\nHi, Richard, and thanks for the question. It's Ben here. We put that diesel hedging program in place probably 12 \nmonths ago, and it's served us quite well, I guess over the last 12 months and continue to do so and we have had \nsome cash returned on those hedges, which is good. That 91 cents, the price we're paying today is 98 cents, so it's \nmarginally in the money. It has been more in the money over the past 12 months but, yeah, it is getting closer.\nMark Zeptner\nIt's the rebated figure to have [Multiple Speakers].\nBen Ringrose\nThat's right, yeah.\nMark Zeptner\nYeah, it is not the price you see at the service station.\nBen Ringrose\nYeah.\nRichard Hatch\nNow I understand that. Well, again, congratulations. That's an interesting area for you to go into but well done being \nwinners again. Anyway, thanks for all you've done.\nMark Zeptner\nThanks, Richard.\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Ashley Chen from shareholder. Please go ahead.\nAshley Chen\nHi, Mark. Hi, Ben. Thanks again for a nice quarter and your hard work for it. I just have a question on the -- also on \nthe diesel hedging strategy. Can you give some more details on your thinking now for the next two, three, four years \nin regards to hedging? I can see production -- if production were to be 550,000 over two years, your current hedge \nbook is about 33% hedged? Are you expecting to reduce that to 25%, 20%? That is my first question. And second \nquestion are something completely different. As you probably know, the government has put a positive duty on \nemployers to prevent harassment, sexual harassment, at work and the Australian Human Rights Commission Page 7 of 8\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\nprobably spot the iron ore industry, Rio Tinto, BHP, and its sights at the moment, but eventually you'll come around \nto the gold industry. What programs or what anti-harassment programs Ramelius Resources is planning to \nimplementing or planning to implement over the next couple of years?\nBen Ringrose\nThanks, Ashley. I will take those ones. It's Ben. In terms of hedging policy, I think Tim Manners late last year \nreported that the Board is in the process of reviewing our policy and if there are any changes -- obviously, there's \nnot a lot of Board meetings through December, January, but if there is any change, then we'll obviously inform the \nmarket on that one. In the meantime, we are gradually running off our book, as we have been for some time. In \nterms of our duty to prevent harassment, it's not something that we've waited to be told that we should look at it or \nare we planning to. We've been reasonably proactive in that area. When people start with the company, they run \nthrough workplace behavior training, we have a whistleblower line. I think a lot of the goldies have a lot of these \nthings in place, we've assessed our sites for the safety and security, and we're basically taking a no tolerance \napproach to those who crossed the line. Unfortunately, there've been a few cases and those people are no longer \nworking for us or the contractors associated with that. So we've done a lot in that area and we continue to try to \nimprove.\nAshley Chen\nThank you.\nBen Ringrose\nThanks, Ashley.\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for a moment to allow parties to enter the queue. The next question \ncomes from Steven Goranson [Phonetic] from RE Funds Management. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Participant\nHi, guys. Just a quick question around Musgrave. What have you seen to date since the acquisition and when do \nyou expect to -- for us to start thinking about when we should be seeing Musgrave coming through the mill?\nMark Zeptner\nThanks for the question, Steve. I will answer that. It's Mark. Look, what we're saying is that the team at Musgrave \ndid an excellent job in terms of drilling the ore body out and preparing resources and mine plans that are pretty \nclose to production ready. Our optimizations and reruns of [Indiscernible] are very similar and very close, which is \nalways company. It's not what you'll always find, I have to add. In terms of production, we hope to be developing in \nthe second half of this calendar year with -- I'd say, or first or sort of September, August, September, obviously \nramping up through that period. So perhaps, I sent it earlier than some expect. We've already submitted our mining \nproposal and we're on like the third back and forwards with the department on that. So assuming we get approvals \nprior to June, then we should be ready to go from July onwards.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nUnidentified Participant\nThat's an great sign. Thanks very much for that, Mark.\nMark Zeptner\nThanks, Steve.Page 8 of 8\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Andrew Bowler from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Bowler\nHello, gents. Quick one from me. Obviously, handy tax refund post quarter end. Just wondering if you're expecting \nany more over the remainder of the financial year or is that what you're expecting to say?\nBen Ringrose\nHi, Andrew. It's Ben here, I'll take that one. No, that tax refund related to the 2023 tax term, it is a one-off, I guess, \nand we don't expect that to be a recurring throughout the financial year.\nAndrew Bowler\nAlright. Thanks.\nBen Ringrose\nThanks, Andrew.\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, we're showing no further questions. I'll hand the conference back to Mark for closing \nremarks.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Travis. I'd just like to make two points to wrap up. Ramelius is one of the few Aussie gold producers \nactually upgrading guidance and therefore we are expecting to deliver a very strong cash flows in the second half of \nFY24. I mean, as already mentioned, we are on track to deliver our new Mt Magnet mine plan this current quarter, \nwhich promises to include Penny, Cue, as well as all the portfolio of projects at Mt Magnet itself. Thank you for \nlistening in this morning.
