It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 1\nTop NRL talent dig deep for mate\nTop NRL talent dig deep for mate\nThe Cairns Post (Australia)\nOctober 18, 2024 Friday\nCairns Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 5\nLength: 233 words\nByline: David Riccio\nBody\nTop NRL stars have helped raise almost $50,000 to bring the six-week premature baby of Jesse Ramien home \nfrom a Bali hospital to Australia.\nThe story has triggered more than 630 donations, with Ramien and fiancee Shell also being aided by the Cronulla \nSharks and the NRL.\nIn a major development, the efforts of the Sharks and NRL to work with the Australian Embassy in Indonesia to fast-\ntrack paperwork has proven promising, with the documentation crucial for baby Teo to be transported back to \nAustralia.\nRamien and Shell remain desperate to co-ordinate a care flight for their medically induced baby boy Teo back to \nAustralia at an estimated cost of $130,000.\nShavaun Hunt - the wife of Sharks forward Royce Hunt - organised a fundraising campaign, which prompted the \nNRL community to respond, far beyond Ramien's Cronulla.\nDespite not having created the Go Fund Me page, some fans have questioned why the well-paid Sharks star would \nrequire financial assistance. Ramien, however, has made it clear where he stands.\n\"I'll play for nothing just to get our baby boy home safely,\" he said. Teo needed to be resuscitated for five minutes \nafter being born six weeks premature at a Bali hospital last Friday night. Shell was 33 weeks pregnant when she \nleft Sydney and had clearance from Shell's obstetrician and the airline, as well as travel insurance for her \npregnancy. Shell went into early labour last Friday.\nLoad-Date: October 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
