Their original quote about Shell exactly as it appears in the article, without any modifications or translations\n\nGuidelines:\n- Include only real people: Exclude organizations, companies, or any other non-person entities\n- Direct connection: Ensure that each selected individual is explicitly connected to Shell or explicitly express his opinion on Shell.\n- Only include those whose statements are directly about Shell\n- Exclude individuals whose comments are not directly relevant to Shell or are too general\n- Pertinent stakeholders only: Only include the most relevant individuals\n- Do not include stakeholders who are not directly associated with Shell\n\nOutput Format Requirements:\n- Each line must contain exactly two columns separated by \"|\" symbols\n- Column 1: Stakeholder's name\n- Column 2: Stakeholder's role or link to Shell.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 9\nLength: 685 words\nByline: Peter Ker and Lap Phan\nBody\nShell chairman Sir Andrew Mackenzie says tackling climate change is harder than he realised when he was \nrunning BHP, and the world must now focus on a few \"winning\" solutions and invest in them strongly.\nIn an exclusive interview with the Tech Zero podcast, Sir Andrew said he believed the world could still cut \ngreenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, but may have a better chance if the problem was tackled \"sector by \nsector\" across international borders, rather than \"country by country\" as required by international climate \nagreements.\nSir Andrew's six-year term as BHP chief executive was marked by a simplification of its portfolio and an embrace of \nsocial issues like gender balance and the \"Scope 3\" emissions of customers.\nHe exited Australia's biggest company in December 2019 and became Shell chairman in May 2021; a move he \nsaid provided a different perspective on the world's carbon challenge.\n\"The one thing that has struck me, since moving from BHP to Shell, is it is quite a lot harder than I expected,\" he \ntold the Tech Zero podcast.\n\"At BHP, to some extent, we were not quite in the thick of it in the way that we are at Shell, and you were able to \ntalk about a lot of things that made sense to me, technically, that I assumed could happen more easily than actually, \nwhen you are having to deal with it in a much more full on way, as you are at Shell.\"\nSir Andrew said he \"strongly believed\" the world needed to focus on the best solutions rather than be distracted by \nthe wide range of potential decarbonisation technologies.\nSir Andrew said he was a \"huge advocate\" for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in places where renewable \nelectricity was incapable of providing the solution. He said electric vehicle adoption needed to be pushed \"hard\" and \nliquefied natural gas would be \"critical\" in supporting the roll-out of renewables.\n\"Because of the urgency, we have to make our choices and decide where we're really going to put our emphasis,\" \nhe said.\nPage 2 of 2\nMackenzie: Focus on the best few energy solutions Exclusive\n\"We shouldn't be adding and adding and adding, if at the same time, we're not finding the things that are winning \nand getting behind that with a lot more investment and more focused investment, and just deciding this is going to \nwork in this sector, and let's get behind that because we don't have a lot of time.\"\nShell's business was built on selling oil and petrol for traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, but the \ncompany has also invested in electric vehicle charging stations, and Sir Andrew said the world needed to push \n\"hard\" on electric vehicles, and \"maybe harder than we're pushing it\".\nBut despite the rise of electric vehicles, he said the internal combustion engines that consume petrol were here to \nstay, and would enjoy longevity as the world embraced \"biofuels\" from agricultural waste and synthetically created \n\"e-fuels\".\n\"In looking at the future of oil, you look at the future of the internal combustion engine, and some would imagine \nthat the internal combustion engine would just kind of disappear. That won't happen,\" he said.\n\"Even in a world of very successful decarbonisation ... the internal combustion engine will continue, but it will be \nfuelled by biofuels, maybe by hydrogen or indeed e-fuels.\"\nThe comments come as big diesel consumers like Rio Tinto are urging the federal government to ramp up support \nfor biofuels, in the belief biofuels are the best way to reduce the emissions of iron ore trucks and trains in the \ndecade before batteries are expected to be a viable alternative.\nSir Andrew said liquefied natural gas would be \"critical\" to the energy transition.\n\"It is available now, it can be shipped everywhere, it is possible to increase its supply, and it is the lowest carbon \nfossil fuel,\" he said.\nInternational climate agreements were built on \"nationally determined contributions\", where each nation set a target \nfor emission reductions and attempts to deliver on it, he said. But the problem might be better tackled by industry \nsectors that worked collaboratively across borders.\n\"That's how some of the issues to do with the ozone hole were sorted in the end, trying to move away from CFCs.\"\nLoad-Date: June 26, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
