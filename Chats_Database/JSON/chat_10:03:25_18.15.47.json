[Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has never had an Indigenous land use agreement with the Yindjibarndi people, despite mining on their land for over a decade, leading to a $500 million compensation claim for unpaid royalties, interest, and damages for cultural and spiritual losses, which could result in a significant financial and reputational impact on the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued in court that compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should not be based on the value of the minerals extracted from their land, despite industry standards where native title holders receive a percentage of royalties, raising concerns about the company's approach to Indigenous compensation. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest held private meetings in a Perth park with Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation leader Michael Woodley in an attempt to settle a billion-dollar compensation case, but the talks failed as the parties remain hundreds of millions of dollars apart, highlighting the ongoing dispute and lack of resolution. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue is facing a potential $1 billion compensation claim from the Yindjibarndi people, including $500 million for economic losses and an additional $500 million for the destruction of more than 240 culturally significant sites, which could have major financial and reputational consequences for the company. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue was left exposed to the Yindjibarndi compensation claim in 2020 after the High Court denied the company special leave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings, which found that a large part of its Solomon iron ore mining hub was built without permission from traditional owners, raising legal and ethical concerns about its operations. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has argued that any compensation for the Yindjibarndi people should be funded by the State of Western Australia because it granted the mining tenements, but the WA government maintains that Fortescue should pay, creating further uncertainty over the company's financial liability. [Australian Financial Review, Brad Thompson, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Institutional investors are increasingly avoiding Fortescue, making it the least-held stock among the 10 largest companies on the ASX, with concerns over its lower iron ore grades, high executive turnover, and heavy spending on unprofitable green hydrogen projects. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been ranked as the \"least-loved\" stock among major Australian companies in a JPMorgan survey of 50 fund managers, reflecting ongoing skepticism about its business strategy and financial stability. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Analysts and brokers have been bearish on Fortescue for an extended period, with most maintaining a sell rating on the stock since November 2022, in contrast to competitors BHP and Rio Tinto, which have never held a majority sell rating since at least 2009. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue lost its final buy rating in January after JPMorgan's head of Australian resources advised investors to take profits, with the stock subsequently falling more than 10% from its peak in early February, raising concerns about its valuation and future performance. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's unconventional management style under Andrew Forrest has left the investment community baffled, with concerns that the company's entrepreneurial approach lacks the structured management seen in competitors like BHP and Rio Tinto. [Australian Financial Review, Joshua Peach, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has been criticized for its approach to Indigenous compensation, with an expert witness arguing in court that the company\u2019s attempt to exclude the value of minerals from compensation calculations is \"nonsensical\" and unfair to the Yindjibarndi people. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue began mining at the Solomon hub in 2013 without an agreement from the Yindjibarndi\u2019s registered native title body and instead dealt with a breakaway group, raising ethical concerns about its treatment of traditional owners. [AAP Newsfeed, Anonymous, April 17, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has slammed the Biden administration\u2019s proposed hydrogen incentive rules, arguing that they could triple the cost of low-carbon hydrogen projects and stifle growth in the sector, potentially impacting the company\u2019s green energy ambitions. [Australian Financial Review, Peter Ker, April 22, 2024]. - Fortescue's iron ore shipments fell 6% in the March quarter compared to the same period last year due to a derailment in late December and weather disruptions, raising concerns about the company's logistics resilience and ability to meet its full-year shipment targets. [The Age, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's Iron Bridge project continues to face significant operational issues, with a faulty water pipeline and plant inefficiencies slowing output, forcing the company to undertake costly repairs and reconfigure its processing plant, which could delay production targets. [The Age, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue has forecast that its full-year iron ore shipments will likely come in at the lower end of its guidance range due to operational setbacks, including a derailment and adverse weather, which could impact revenue and investor confidence. [Seeking Alpha, Anonymous, April 24, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's Iron Bridge magnetite project has suffered another production downgrade, with expected shipments now reduced to just 2 million tonnes, significantly below previous guidance, highlighting ongoing challenges in ramping up the project. [The Australian, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's iron ore exports dropped 11% from the December quarter, and the decline in shipments pushed up average C1 cash costs by 7% to $18.93 per tonne, increasing operational expenses and potentially squeezing profit margins. [The Australian, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue will need to maintain near-record export rates to meet its full-year shipment guidance, requiring an ambitious 53.5 million tonnes in the June quarter, which may be difficult given recent logistical and operational setbacks. [The Daily Telegraph, Nick Evans, April 25, 2024].  \n\n- Fortescue's Gibson Island hydrogen project has been sidelined despite receiving a $13.7 million government grant, with the company citing high Australian power prices as a major obstacle, raising doubts about the financial viability of its domestic green hydrogen ambitions.

In fact, the terms of the separation make Nicola wealthier than her husband, given she now \nowns 50 million more shares than Andrew does in Fortescue, the iron ore miner he founded in 2003. But such \nintricacies are a moot point - the pair remain in furious agreement on their commitment to the Giving Pledge, set up \nby American billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, under which they have agreed to give away the \"vast \nmajority\" of their wealth.\nIt was to this end that last June the couple transferred one-fi fth of their Fortescue holding worth $5b to their \ncharitable Minderoo Foundation, knocking their combined wealth at the time down to $28b. Their fortune has since \nrebounded on a climbing share price for Fortescue, which ships about 180 million tonnes of hematite iron ore per \nyear from its Chichester, Solomon and Western mines in the Pilbara. Fortescue's fi rst mine for higher-grade \nmagnetite iron ore, the Iron Bridge operation 145km south of Port Hedland, had a slower-than-expected start but \nthe company remains confi dent it will eventually ship 22 million tonnes a year.\nFortescue also shipped its fi rst iron ore mined outside Australia, from the Belinga mine in Gabon, which Andrew \nhopes will eventually become globally signifi cant. However, Andrew is more likely to be heard discussing green \nenergy than iron ore these days. His dreams of making Fortescue a clean energy superpower are starting to take \nmaterial shape - this year Fortescue conducted the world's fi rst use of ammonia as a marine fuel onboard the \nSingapore-fl agged ammoniapowered vessel Fortescue Green Pioneer. Nicola is driving investment in Australian \nfashion with her half of the Forrest family's Tattarang investment vehicle. In April, she unveiled an $8m women's-\nboot-only production line at the Adelaide factory of R.M. Williams, the iconic footwear brand Tattarang bought in \n2020.

The iron ore miner, led by executive chairman Andrew Forrest, has \nalleged they copied and took information when they left Fortescue that helped them build Element Zero's own \ngreen iron project.\n\"It is alleged that this has been utilised in the designing, engineering and construction and operation by the first \nrespondent of an industrial pilot plant for an electrochemical reduction process,\" said Federal Court judge John \nLogan in a summary of the claim.\nElement Zero has asked the court to set aside the search request, which Justice Logan said could become an \n\"industrial-scale forensic debacle\".\nDuring their time in Fortescue's clean energy division, Mr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk were among the small \ngroup that spent most of 2020 travelling on Dr Forrest's private jet to more than 30 nations on the hunt for clean \nenergy projects.\nMr Masterman had worked closely with Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest for close to a quarter of a century, both \nat Fortescue and at Dr Forrest's private companies.\nFortescue's claim has been lodged against Element Zero, Mr Masterman, Dr Kolodziejczyk and a third man, Bjorn \nWinther-Jensen.

We continue to rapidly advance our \ntechnology.\n\"As the matter is now before the court, we will not be making further comment at this time.\" A Fortescue \nspokesman said the company's intellectual property is critical and \"must be -protected\".\n\"Protecting our IP helps to protect the substantial investment of time and effort made by our innovative employees \nand stakeholders every day,\" he said.\n\"We invest significant resources in creating IP and are committed to vigorously managing and enforcing its \nprotection. As the matter is the subject of legal proceedings, we do not intend to comment further at this stage.\" The \ndocuments and devices were made under Anton Pillar orders, which are made without alerting respondents, Justice \nLogan said.\n\"The purpose of such search orders is invariably to preserve evidence, so as to assist in the proof of an applicant's \nclaim, which may be in jeopardy of destruction, concealment or perhaps removal from the jurisdiction,\" he said.\n\"They usually provide, and in this case, did, for a search by representatives of the applicants, here the Fortescue \nparties, of nominated places associated with the respondents, under the supervision of an independent lawyer.\" \nThe court action comes as Fortescue kicked off negotiations with Chinese authorities for the supply of 100 million \ntonnes of green iron from its Pilbara operations in May.\nThe company ticked off a $50m pilot plant for its green iron production plant in late 2023, estimating it could \nproduce 1500 tonnes of iron ore a year from 2025.\nDr Forrest has spruiked his ambitious goal of producing 200 million tonnes a year of carbon-free iron ore for export \nto the company's customers.\nFortescue plans to produce high-grade iron ore for use in the steel industry by using renewable energy and green \nhydrogen reduction technology, together with an electric smelting furnace at its pilot plant. Fortescue will need \nabout eight million tonnes of hydrogen a year to reach its goal of producing 200 million tonnes a year of green iron, \npotentially eliminating 220 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually.\nLoad-Date: June 6, 2024\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Angelica Snowden, Nick Evans\nDate: June 07, 2024\nTitle: Fortescue 'staff stole green iron tech'\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Fortescue accuses two former executives of 'industrial-scale misuse' of its intellectual property\n## Media outlet: WA Today\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: June 07, 2024\n\nPage 1 of 2\nFortescue accuses two former executives of 'industrial-scale misuse' of its intellectual property\nFortescue accuses two former executives of 'industrial-scale misuse' of its \nintellectual property\nWA Today\nJune 7, 2024 Friday 3:16 AM UTC\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
