When we did \nour planning and set our guidance for this financial year, we were probably about $1000-$1200 (in Australian \ndollars) an ounce lower than what the spot price is today. That's how much it's moved in six or seven months \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \nwe would never have thought you would get a 25-30 per cent rise in the gold price in such a short time.\" The \nsurging gold price has lit a fire under ASX-listed gold stocks, which rose 7 per cent across the board last week and \nare up 55 per cent over the past year.\nNorthern Star, the biggest Australian-domiciled gold producer after Newmont's $26bn takeover of Newcrest in 2023, \nis up 18.5 per cent since the start of 2025.\nEvolution, the second biggest, is up 23.5 per cent to $5.97, with Bell Potter initiating coverage on Friday with a buy \nrating and 12-month target price of $6.65.\nPage 2 of 2\nSurging gold price stuns veterans\n\"Evolution is now passing its capital expenditure peak and we forecast increasing free cashflows, deleveraging of \nthe balance sheet and rising dividend distributions supported by Evolution's near-unhedged gold and copper price \nexposure,\" Bell Potter noted.\nOther ASX 200 gold stocks enjoying the ride are Gold Road, with its share price up about 80 per cent in 12 months, \nRamelius Resources (up 75 per cent), Perseus Mining (up 70 per cent) and US giant Newmont (up 41 per cent via \nits CHESS depositary interests listing).\nThe World Gold Council's 2024 gold demand trends report, released last week, says annual demand hit a record \nhigh of 4974 tonnes, driven by strong central bank buying and growth in investment demand. The combination of \nrecord high gold prices and volumes resulted in the highest ever total value of demand at $US382bn.\nThe council said central banks continued to buy gold at an eye-watering pace in 2024, with purchases exceeding \n1000 tonnes for the third year in a row.\nMarket analysts said Beijing had played a big role, with the market boosted by an increase in the People's Bank of \nChina's gold holdings and a move to allow insurance funds to invest in gold.\nMr Conway said another big factor had been the volumes traded in New York through the CME Group's Comex.\nJPMorgan Chase and other banks said in January that they would deliver gold bullion valued at billions of dollars \nagainst futures contracts due to expire in February as the threat of tariffs and a major trade war saw US investors \nmove to secure gold.\n\"We knew when (Mr Trump) was coming into office that it would have an impact on the gold price, and we expected \nit to be positive, depending on which way he decided to take his administration,\" Mr Conway said.\n\"It was either going to be a fair number of interest rate cuts through this year, or some of the other things that are \ngoing on around the tariffs and his intervention in terms of the geopolitical situation in Gaza and the Ukraine.\n\"The most interesting thing for me when you look over the past few weeks is the amount of gold that's been coming \ninto the Comex, the US exchange, as particularly retail people have been buying gold. It's like they want some \nprotection against the US dollar.\" On the potential rerating of mining stocks as more investors look for exposure to \ngold, Mr Conway said companies had to show the market the discipline needed to make the most of the higher gold \nprice.\n\"The thing for gold mining companies is to consistently deliver on your guidance and what you've told the market, \nand to have the discipline to put that money into the bank,\" he said.\n\"That's where you'll start to get a bit of that reward. If it's not seen to be flying through to the bank balance, I think \nthat's where you'll get the investors being a little bit more sceptical.\n\"That's been an absolute focus of us over the last 12 months because delivering to your plan in a rising metal price \nenvironment is a real positive, and we've seen that with our cashflow. \"What the shareholders want to see is that it's \nactually hitting the bank account. I think if we can demonstrate that as an industry, there will be more support and \nthen the rerate would flow on from that.\"\nLoad-Date: February 9, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nYour output should be formatted as follows:\n# Surging gold price stuns veterans\n## The Australian\n### Brad Thompson\n### February 10, 2025\nNumbered List of 2 to 5 key insights (in English).\n\nYou stop your output when there are no more key and important information or facts from the article, about Ramelius Resources, to report.
