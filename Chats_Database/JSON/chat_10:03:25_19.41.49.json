The \nbusiness is tasked with adapting the technology applied in racing electric cars in Formula E to moving big volumes \nof iron ore using haul trucks under Fortescue's goal to eradicate greenhouse gas emissions in its mining \noperations.\nFortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest doubled down on his commitment to stop using diesel in the \ncompany's mining operation by 2030 at the weekend by backing a proposed fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty. Ms \nCoates will report to Fortescue energy boss Mark Hutchinson, who stepped in to run Fortescue Zero after the \nsudden departure of Judith Judson in June.\nA separate business within the energy division - Fortescue Zero Hydrogen Systems - is run by Cameron Smith, \nwho also reports to Mr Hutchinson.\nThe work done by Fortescue Zero Power Systems is integral to Fortescue's $US2.8bn ($4.3bn) partnership with \nEurope-based Liebherr to jointly develop zero emission mining machinery -solutions.\nFortescue expects to purchase about 360 autonomous battery electric trucks, 55 electric excavators and 60 battery \npowered dozers under the deal.\nLiebherr's role is to provide the chassis while the battery power systems will be supplied by Fortescue Zero.\nMs Coates, previously Fortescue's executive director of strategy and innovation, will move from Perth to the UK in \nher new role.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue names exec to drive unit\nA Fortescue spokesman said Mr Hutchinson would remain chief executive of the Fortescue energy division.\nThe $US2.8bn figure on the Liebherr partnership represents the cost to the Fortescue mining division of buying \ntrucks and other machinery.\nMr Hutchinson recently told analysts Fortescue Zero would capture some of the revenue from the sales. \"We just \nhave to remember that a big part of that flows back to Fortescue Zero because a big part of the trucks is the power \nsystem,\" he said.\nMs Judson was appointed chief executive of Fortescue Zero in 2023 as it opened two new -facilities in the UK and \nforeshadowed a recruitment drive. She lasted less than a year before returning to her home in the US.\nFortescue has budgeted $US6.2bn to achieve a switch to renewable energy to decarbonise its iron ore operations \nby 2030. Dr Forrest described the company as one of Australia's biggest greenhouse gas polluters at the weekend, \nbut said it could convert the burning of one billion litres of diesel equivalent a year into \"long-term profitable green \nenergy assets\" by 2030.\nLoad-Date: November 29, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman of Fortescue | \"I am committed to stop using diesel in the company's mining operation by 2030.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
