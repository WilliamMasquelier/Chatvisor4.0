Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Professor Wei Xiang | Cisco Research Chair and Director of La Trobe University\u2019s Cisco Centre for AI | \u201cNow we've proven the technology, the next step is to add additional features to improve productivity and crop yields through leveraging cutting-edge AI technology.\u201d | N.A. |\n| Luke Malan | Managing Director of Aglantis | \"With growing pressures on profitability, it\u2019s more imperative to know what you\u2019re doing and how you can do it better. This flips conventional thinking on its head and opens the doorway to new possibilities.\" | N.A. |\n| Kamyar Karimi | IoT Researcher | \"This technology represents a major shift towards data-driven, sustainable agriculture where AI and IoT optimise every drop of water for maximum farming efficiency.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Castelanelli | Sugarcane Farmer | \"There's endless opportunity and the power of computing is just getting smarter.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Cisco.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Cisco or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
