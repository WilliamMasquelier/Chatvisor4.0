Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 17\nLength: 630 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue has accused the two architects of its clean energy pivot of copying and taking the company's intellectual \nproperty when they departed to start a rival green iron project.\nFortescue has asked the Federal Court for permission to search three premises in Western Australia and one in \nVictoria in pursuit of evidence that supports its claim that the founders of Element Zero engaged in \"industrial-scale \nmisuse\" of work on green iron.\nElement Zero was founded by Fortescue's former chief scientist, Bart Kolodziejczyk, and Michael Masterman in \nDecember 2022, soon after they left Fortescue. The iron ore miner, led by executive chairman Andrew Forrest, has \nalleged they copied and took information when they left Fortescue that helped them build Element Zero's own \ngreen iron project.\n\"It is alleged that this has been utilised in the designing, engineering and construction and operation by the first \nrespondent of an industrial pilot plant for an electrochemical reduction process,\" said Federal Court judge John \nLogan in a summary of the claim.\nElement Zero has asked the court to set aside the search request, which Justice Logan said could become an \n\"industrial-scale forensic debacle\".\nDuring their time in Fortescue's clean energy division, Mr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk were among the small \ngroup that spent most of 2020 travelling on Dr Forrest's private jet to more than 30 nations on the hunt for clean \nenergy projects.\nMr Masterman had worked closely with Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest for close to a quarter of a century, both \nat Fortescue and at Dr Forrest's private companies.\nFortescue's claim has been lodged against Element Zero, Mr Masterman, Dr Kolodziejczyk and a third man, Bjorn \nWinther-Jensen. Justice Logan's summary is the only document from the case that is publicly available, and a \nspokesman for Element Zero said it would contest the search request.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue takes former execs to court over IP\n\"Element Zero believes this legal action is entirely without merit and welcomes the opportunity to respond to \nFortescue's spurious claims.\nOur response will include an application to vary or set aside the original search orders,\" he said.\n\"As Element Zero will demonstrate, its green metals technology was developed independently of and is very \ndifferent from anything that Fortescue is doing or has done in this space.\nWe continue to rapidly advance our technology.\n\"As the matter is now before the court, we will not be making further comment at this time.\"\nA spokesman for Fortescue said yesterday that it was developing cutting-edge solutions to help the world fight \nclimate change and protecting intellectual property was crucial.\n\"As a first mover, our intellectual property is critical to our ongoing success in this pursuit and must be protected at \nall times,\" he said.\n\"Protecting our IP helps to protect the substantial investment of time and effort made by our innovative employees \nand stakeholders every day.\n\"We invest significant resources in creating IP and are committed to vigorously managing and enforcing its \nprotection. As the matter is the subject of legal proceedings, we do not intend to comment further at this stage.\"\nHearings into the case are scheduled to resume later this month.\nThe stoush comes as all the major Australian iron ore miners are ramping up efforts to reduce the carbon emissions \nfootprint of the nation's most lucrative commodity export.\nEarlier this week, Rio Tinto announced plans to spend $215 million building a giant microwave heating system \nsouth of Perth for its BioIron method of making metallic iron, with up to 95 per cent lower emissions.\nHancock Prospecting and Fortescue are also pushing more into a form of iron ore known as magnetite \nconcentrate, which can lower the carbon footprint of the entire steel value chain compared to traditional iron ores.\nLoad-Date: June 9, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
