Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Dino Otranto | Chief Executive of Mining Division | \"Fortescue intends to grant up to 208,656 performance rights to Mr Otranto and up to 248,001 rights to Mr Hutchinson.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Hutchinson | Chief Executive of Green Energy | \"Mr Hutchinson stands to gain up to $5.46m in addition to his fixed salary of $2.08m if he can deliver on some of Fortescue's green energy and hydrogen ambitions.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Executive Chairman | \"The board has heard this feedback and while it retains the ability to apply discretion to incentive outcomes, it will not make discretionary payments that do not clearly align with shareholder interests.\" | N.A. |\n| Fiona Hick | Former CEO | \"Fortescue told investors Ms Gaines, now a part-time executive director and global ambassador for the company, had agreed not to participate in the performance rights plan even though she was eligible.\" | N.A. |\n| Elizabeth Gaines | Former CEO | \"Fortescue does not expect to have issues with this year's remuneration report after moving to address shareholder and proxy adviser concerns.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
