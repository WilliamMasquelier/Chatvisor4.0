Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Peter Barrett | Director of Universal Hydrogen | \"But it ain't.\" | N.A. |\n| David Tuckwell | Manager at GlobalX | \"Aside from interest rates, he says investors have been scared away from the hydrogen sector by frequent dilutive share issuances and the threat that Donald Trump could scrap President Joe Biden's hydrogen incentives if he regains power.\" | N.A. |\n| Cindy Huang | Analyst at Mirova | \"We try to learn first from the individual company, and then through that company understand that part of the value chain.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Founder of Fortescue | \"Fortescue is the nation's biggest hydrogen bull.\" | N.A. |\n| Andy Vesey | Fortescue's North America boss | \"Fortescue would need 1363 projects the size of that $US550 million hub to achieve its goal of producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030.\" | N.A. |\n| Andy Marsh | CEO of Plug | \"When Plug boss Andy Marsh updates investors on Tuesday, it will be exactly one year since he bruised Fortescue by suggesting the economics of the Gladstone electrolyser factory were not attractive enough for him to invest.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
