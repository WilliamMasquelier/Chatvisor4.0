Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1394 words\nHighlight: Dateline Resources has kicked the door in as the latest entrant to the million-ounce gold club at its \nColosseum gold and rare earths project near Las Vegas.\nBody\nDateline Resources has kicked the door in as the latest entrant to the million-ounce gold club on the ASX having \nlast month tabled a 1.1 million-ounce resource running 1.26 grams per tonne gold at its Colosseum gold and rare \nearths project near Las Vegas.\nNotably, the company says the resource still has plenty of legs and unusually, it also shows signs of rare earths in \na region that is revered for the scale and grade of the precious metals.\nTrue, the rare earths and lithium markets may have taken a breather recently, but gold is still shining brightly. And \nnow, the AU$12 million market-capped Dateline Resources appears well-placed to ride the precious yellow metal's \nrun, while at the same time appearing also to be poised to capture the blue-sky potential of rare earths into the \nfuture.\nThe Colosseum project in California is unusual in that it is clearly well-endowed with gold, but intriguingly, may also \ncontain substantial rare earths. It sits just down the road from the United States' only rare earths mine of any scale, \nthe Mountain Pass mine that is owned by Nevada-based MP Materials and which has been the talk of the town for \nmore than half a century as one of the world's highest-quality rare earths deposits.\nProduction at the carbonatite-hosted Mountain Pass mine started in 1952 with a mind-boggling grade of 7 per cent \ntotal rare earths. It supplied most of the world's rare earths from the 1960s to the 1990s and sits in the same \ngeological setting as Dateline's Colosseum project, less than 10km away.\nDateline acquired the Colosseum mine from Barrick Gold in March 2021 after that company had mined 344,000 \nounces of gold at the site from two open pits between 1988 and 1993. Production then ceased when the gold price \nslumped to about US$350 (AU$524.15) an ounce. Now, that price sits in stark contrast to the recent price highs that \ntopped US$2450 (AU$3669) per ounce.\nThe company's strategy to acquire historically mined projects that may still have more to give is a tried-and-tested \none amongst ASX hopefuls.\nIn the early days before becoming an AU$15 billion heavyweight gold producer, Northern Star Resources picked \nup several \"non-core\" Barrick mines jettisoned by that gold giant around 2014 that went on to deliver serious gold \nounces. And in a more recent example of renewed exploration success at old projects, Spectrum Resources' share \nPage 2 of 3\nDateline rolls the dice in Vegas to join million-ounce club\nprice got all stratospheric after that company hit the sister lode of the previously mined-out Penny West deposit in \nWA just 300m away before the company was collared by Ramelius Resources in February 2020 for Au$228 \nmillion.\nSince its Colosseum acquisition, Dateline has reconstructed nearly 60,000m of historical drilling and recently rolled \nout successful depth extensional drilling to tie together the now 27.1 million-tonne, 1.26g/t gold resource for the 1.1 \nmillion ounces.\nImportantly, the higher-confidence measured and indicated portion of the resource now sits at 736,000 ounces, or \n67 per cent of the total resource - and some of those ounces are even going more than 3g/t gold.\nBy any measure, Colosseum boasts some exceptional drill intersections that are not readily found, even in some of \nthe better-known projects. Recent drilling also shows some remarkable grades and thicknesses including a \nsubstantial 100.6m hit weighing in at 4.16g/t gold from 79m and 76.2m at 8.62g/t from 91m including a 23.5m \nsection going a stunning 21.8g/t. Another 70m intercept came in at a very respectable 6.53g/t gold.\nIf those intersections were discovered in Western Australia's Eastern Goldfields, they would be considered \ncompany-makers by the hardened punters that frequent the coffee shops of West Perth.\nAnd while 100m intersections exceeding 4g/t gold is remarkable in its own right, for a company that also boasts \nblue sky rare earths opportunity and a market cap under $20 million, Dateline is a rare breed indeed.\nIn addition, management also believes there remains considerable upside at Colosseum for significant underground \nounces to be hosted in two high-grade breccia pipes, both of which were historically mined in open pits, one to \n245m and the other to 90m. In fact, the company is looking to prove up its theory that the two breccia pipes may link \nup at depth.\nWhile the current mineral resource now extends to 300m below surface, it is also understood that a couple of \nwildcat holes drilled in the area in 1972 by then-operator Draco Mines intersected the high-grade breccia units at \nalmost 1000m below the surface. The history sets the scene nicely for what could potentially be lurking at depth, \nunderlining Dateline's theory that the two pipes could join.\nColosseum is in good company, too, sitting within California's Walker Lane trend - the host of multiple substantial \ndiscoveries including Equinox Gold's 6.5 million-ounce Castle Mountain gold mine and the 1.7 million-ounce Mother \nLode deposit.\nDateline Resources managing director Stephen Baghdadi said: \"As 736,000 ounces out of the total mineral \nresource estimate of 1.1 million ounces of gold are measured and indicated, the company will now commence \nmining studies to determine what material can be mined in the most suitable and economically-viable way.\"\nThe company is currently considering three potential options for mining Colosseum. The most likely is to use \nexisting infrastructure to lower costs in a bulk mine scenario for both breccia pipes by expanding the two pits into \none big pit ahead of underground mining.\nIt recently announced a $4.2 million non-renounceable rights issue to fund a mining study and determine the best \ndevelopment options for Colosseum.\nBaghdadi is also clearly convinced by the project and will tip in, from his own pocket, $570,000 into the offer, in \naddition to underwriting a further $177,000 for a total commitment of $747,000. Non-executive chairman Mark \nJohnson will also take up his full entitlement of in excess of AU$800,000 by way of converting outstanding debt to \nequity in Dateline.\nJohnson is no slouch when it comes to investment markets either. He founded Hill Samuel Australia, which grew \ninto Macquarie Bank and he was then the deputy chairman of the uber-successful merchant bank up until 2007.Page 3 of 3\nDateline rolls the dice in Vegas to join million-ounce club\nThe global gold price remains strong and some analysts are even proposing a record US$3000 (AU$4505) per \nounce target by next year. There is also a school of thought out there that rare earths are just taking a breather and \nthe tide is likely to come back in again for both rare earths and lithium as the global electric vehicle (EV) market \nstarts to hit its straps.\nColosseum is about gold for now, but the early warning signs of rare earths at the project just might represent a \nneat bit of future blue sky for Dateline.\nThe signs include rocks surrounding the breccia pipes at Colosseum showing remarkably similar geological \nfeatures to the nearby Mountain Pass mine, the highest-grade rare earths mine on the planet. They also show the \ntwo geological structures were likely formed at the same time.\n\"Fenites\" and \"trachytes\" are both rock types typically associated with carbonatite complexes that are generally \nprevalent at some of the big hard rock rare earths discoveries around the world. Both have been mapped at \nColosseum.\nDateline also says a high-density margin outlined by geophysical modelling that lies directly adjacent to the gold \nrich breccia pipes at Colosseum could be the edge of a rare earths-infused carbonatite body similar to the one at \nthe Mountain Pass mine up the road.\nThe dense units have been identified over 2.5km of strike and at widths of between 75m and 125m.\nA \"Petrographic\" and \"cathodoluminescence\" analysis also pointed to similarities with Mountain Pass, providing \nanother useful clue in the search for rare earths at Colosseum.\nLate American stock market player Marty Zweig was once said to have mused that \"the trend is your friend until the \nend when it bends\". And while nobody can foresee a bend in the gold market right now, if one does eventually \ncome, Dateline is not only is building a serious gold endowment, it may also be well-placed to jump onto the EV \njuggernaut as well if its theory about Colosseum also harbouring rare earths checks out.\nIt could be a nice one-two combination for what is still a sub-AU$20 million market-capped company.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?
