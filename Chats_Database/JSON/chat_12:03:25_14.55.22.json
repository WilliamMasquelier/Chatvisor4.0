Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.\n\nIf Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 3\n82nd anniversary of Newcastle's fiery reception for Japanese submarine\n82nd anniversary of Newcastle's fiery reception for Japanese submarine\nNewcastle Herald (Australia)\nJune 9, 2024 Sunday\nPrint & Internet Editions\nCopyright 2024 Australian Community Media All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1029 words\nByline: Mike Scanlon\nBody\nIT was the morning that war came right to Newcastle's doorstep.\nAlthough it occurred decades ago, the episode became history, and today's the anniversary, exactly 82 years ago, \nback on June 8, 1942.\nThe incident, of course, was the infamous shelling of our sleeping city by a large Japanese submarine I-21 during \nWorld War II. That's when about 24 enemy shells rained down on city and harbour suburbs.\nThe official log at Fort Scratchley in Newcastle's East End, overlooking Nobbys beach, recorded an enemy alert \nraised at 2.17am with sound of gunfire to the north. Despite a false air-raid scare about an hour earlier, city streets \nwere still ablaze with lights, although roads were deserted in the chill of early winter.\nThere was no siren warning that Newcastle was under attack, for real this time, and from the sea, not from aircraft. \nEnemy submarine star shells lit up the city and potential targets. Searchlights swept the sea mist off Nobbys looking \nfor the maritime intruder.\nEnemy shells whizzed past the East End military fort towards BHP Steelworks. Here, some exploded while others \nfell into the Hunter River. At that moment, 13 furnaces were in full operation and inspection holes had to be \nhurriedly covered up to conceal their exact position.\nIn Parnell Place, outside the fort, a shell exploded on the tramway causing metal splinters to pepper nearby \nterraces. Another shell exploded on the seawall north of the ocean baths in an enemy effort, perhaps, to silence a \ncoastal searchlight pinpointing the 109-metre submarine lurking at sea behind Nobbys headland in a blind spot for \nHunter gunners.\nThe gun crews of Fort Scratchley's twin 6-inch Mark VII naval guns fired back very accurately at the 1-21 sub. The \nshots straddled the craft, which suddenly crash-dived and escaped. The fort went down in Australian military history \nas the only coastal fort to have fired in anger and engaged an enemy. Sydney military authorities ordered a \nblackout of all Newcastle lights at 2.40am, two minutes after the 23-minute enemy attack had ended.\nPage 2 of 3\n82nd anniversary of Newcastle's fiery reception for Japanese submarine\nAnd, like all war stories, odd things are discovered afterwards. I've always found it ironic that one of the fort's gun \ncrews was a Jim Cannon and that much later, in 1994, when a terrace house in Parnell Place was being reclad, the \nrenovators discovered the old timber exterior still carried shrapnel embedded in it from 52 years before.\nHowever, the most curious incident, to my mind, was a memory by bombardier Eric Pricter, then aged 27, who was \non the crew of the gun that fired the first retaliatory shot at the Japanese sub. Speaking 40 years afterwards, the \nNew Lambton man (pictured) hinted Newcastle was very lucky the submarine didn't risk staying around to continue \nits shelling of the city in 1942. As he was bringing up shells to be fired, he could heard enemy shells whining \noverhead. But at 2.31am, the fort's No.2 gun completely went out of action. The recoil of the gun had hit a bucket \nthat bent the breech mechanism. It took more than an hour for the naval gun to be repaired, but luckily the enemy \nwas long gone.\nThis was very fortunate as the massive 9-inch guns at Fort Wallace, at North Stockton, never fired at the offshore \nenemy. Only one searchlight was used to prevent the fort's position being exposed at a time when its guns could \nnot depress low enough to fire.\nOne aspect of the drama later came from Stockton legend, the late Vera Deacon. Days after the shelling, her father, \nNorman Pender (pictured), had recovered a star shell canister with two mini-parachutes from Mosquito Island \nwhere they lived. It was probably the \"great flare\" that had lit up their island during the bombardment. Military \nofficials soon confiscated the objects as the souvenirs were being shown off in a Mayfield pub. After the war, the \nsilk parachutes were returned, and Vera's dressmaker mother created blouses for her daughters.\nAnother aftermath of the Japanese shelling of Newcastle city though only came in the early 1970s. That's when \n'Chris', a Charlestown carpenter, revealed he had then been digging behind a house in Scott Street, Newcastle \nEast, when his spade hit something solid. It turned out to be a small shell, probably Japanese. He rang the police.\n\"But you'd think I had leprosy,\" Chris said. \" 'Cripes. Don't bring it in', the sergeant told me and hung up.\"\nFort Scratchley's big guns were later removed after the site closed in 1964. The guns were relocated as a static \ndisplay below The Obelisk, but then returned to the fort in 1978.\nMost other traces of wartime defences around Newcastle had vanished long before. Two such 'unknown' sites north \nof Stockton's Fort Wallace. One was the dune gun battery and the other 'Wipers' OP (observation post) which had a \nsmall radar station, the disc of which soldiers used to call \"bat catchers\".\nPersonal memories of those days are now almost gone. But the 1940s war years were a totally different era. Almost \nall buses, for example, terminated at The Nine Ways at Broadmeadow, not in Newcastle, to save fuel. Electric \ntrams transported patrons into inner city suburbs. There were also hoods on the headlights of the few cars roaming \nthe streets as a wartime safety precaution to reduce light pathways.\nAnother surprising fact was that from 1941 to war's end in 1945 an estimated one million US troops passed through \nAustralia to fight in the Pacific War. Aussie soldiers, often competing with the US soldiers for the affections of local \nwomen complained, calling their rivals \"overpaid, oversexed and over here\".\nOne small reminder of that US presence in Newcastle was pointed out to me by a friend recently. On a door arch of \nthe brick monolith of what is now the Hunter Mall Chambers in Scott Street, overlooking the Newcastle ferry \nterminal, is an \"Australia Remembers\" plaque from 1995. The plaque tells us of the forgotten history of this former \nBebarfalds furniture warehouse from September 1943. The American Red Cross service club once occupied four of \nits five-storeys. It held 500 beds, a dance hall, dining room, picture theatre, barber shop, and games rooms.\nIt was for the use of US and Australian servicemen training in the Lower Hunter and Port Stephens.\nLoad-Date: June 8, 2024Page 3 of 3\n82nd anniversary of Newcastle's fiery reception for Japanese submarine\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
