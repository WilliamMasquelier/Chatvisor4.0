Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 25\nLength: 650 words\nByline: Alex Gluyas\nBody\nInvestors are preparing for a new era of slumping profits and hefty dividend cuts by the world's largest miners as \niron ore markets brace for a flood of supply to trigger a collapse in prices.\nFortescue and Rio Tinto became the latest mining giants yesterday to reveal the full effect from China's property \ncrisis, which caused iron ore prices to plunge nearly 30 per cent last year, forcing boards to slash shareholder \npayouts.\nRio will pay its lowest dividend in seven years while Fortescue sliced its payout by more than 50 per cent after its \nfirst-half profit slid 53 per cent.\nEarlier in the week BHP said it would pay its lowest interim dividend in eights years after a 23 per cent profit slump.\nThe results triggered a sell-off in the sharemarket with Fortescue diving 6.2 per cent to $18, Rio Tinto 1.5 per cent \nto $120.09 and BHP 2 per cent to $40.15. That extended last year's rout which saw the S&P/ASX 200 Resources \nIndex plunging nearly 20 per cent.\nFund managers are expecting further pain for the heavyweight mining sector, which could accelerate the local \nsharemarket's retreat this week from record levels.\n\"We're not even close to the end of these sorts of results,\" warned Perennial fund manager and resources analyst \nSam Berridge.\n\"The slump in iron ore prices over the past 12 months is largely a result of weak demand from China ... we haven't \neven had a meaningful increase in supply yet.\"\nBerridge, who runs Perennial's Natural Resources Fund, believes iron ore prices will average $US80 a tonne next \nyear - compared with current levels of around $US106 a tonne in Singapore - and is happy to not own any iron ore \nminers despite analysts declaring they are too cheap to ignore.\nPage 2 of 2\nInvestors dump big miners as iron ore heads for a glut Resources\nWestpac is even more bearish, warning that prices could collapse to $US70 a tonne this year as Rio Tinto's \nmassive Simandou project in Guinea adds a fresh wave of supply to the physical market.\n\"There's high-cost production still online today which needs to get bumped off the end of the cost curve by that \nincoming supply from Guinea,\" added Berridge. \"That suggests prices are going to tick down further.\"\nSupply disruptions at Australia's biggest iron ore port caused by Tropical Cyclone Zelia have helped keep prices \nwell north of $US100 a tonne.\n\"It's clear that exports from Australia will definitely have been impacted at the same time as heavy rainfall in Brazil \nhas added to concerns about supply,\" said Westpac head of commodity strategy Robert Rennie.\nThat has coincided with hopes that Beijing will announce further stimulus at next month's Two Sessions - an annual \nmeeting of China's top legislative and advisory bodies - which Rennie believes will keep iron ore trading in the \n$US105 to $US110 range before crashing later this year.\nIndeed, BHP has noted that supply is already outpacing demand - it expects the combined annual shipments from \nleading producers to have hit record levels in 2024, which has only added to the huge stockpiles sitting at Chinese \nports.\nEven so, BHP is studying options to raise its Australian iron ore output higher still in the long term and Fortescue is \nramping up production at its Iron Bridge project. Rio Tinto said it was on track to deliver first production at Simandou \nlater this year.\n\"Supply growth from major producers is anticipated to continue in the coming years,\" Rio Tinto warned. \"New iron \nore projects in Africa and potentially some mine restarts are expected to bring further supply pressures from 2026.\"\nHowever, BHP chief executive Mike Henry said he was seeing \"early signs of recovery\" in the Chinese economy. \nIndeed, data this week showed the decline in new home sales ease for a fifth month in January, suggesting values \nwere beginning to stabilise.\nWhile the figures offer a glimmer of hope for the beleaguered property sector, a pick-up in sales and new \nconstruction will be needed to support demand for the steel-making ingredient, according to ANZ.\nLoad-Date: February 23, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Sam Berridge | Resources analyst | \"We're not even close to the end of these sorts of results.\" | N.A. |\n| Sam Berridge | Resources analyst | \"The slump in iron ore prices over the past 12 months is largely a result of weak demand from China ... we haven't even had a meaningful increase in supply yet.\" | N.A. |\n| Sam Berridge | Resources analyst | \"There's high-cost production still online today which needs to get bumped off the end of the cost curve by that incoming supply from Guinea.\" | N.A. |\n| Robert Rennie | Head of commodity strategy at Westpac | \"It's clear that exports from Australia will definitely have been impacted at the same time as heavy rainfall in Brazil has added to concerns about supply.\" | N.A. |\n| Mike Henry | BHP chief executive | \"I was seeing early signs of recovery in the Chinese economy.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
