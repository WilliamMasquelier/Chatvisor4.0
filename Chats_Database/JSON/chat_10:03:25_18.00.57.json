It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 3\nCut price could have solved issue\nCut price could have solved issue\nThe Australian\nOctober 23, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 14\nLength: 976 words\nByline: YONI BASHAN & NICK EVANS, MARGIN CALL\nBody\nThere's no bigger story in town than Richard White's legal feud with Linda Rogan. The latest development saw both \nof them abandon their torrid legal beef on Tuesday after White buckled and agreed to pay an undisclosed \nsettlement amount in the millions of dollars.\nFor that price, Rogan withdrew the raft of unpalatable allegations that she's levelled at the WiseTech founder, \nnamely that he invested in her wellness -business in exchange for sexual relations.\nSpurred by that glowing cinder of scandal, a parade of women have stepped forward to accuse White of \nungentlemanly conduct, including on social media.\nInstead of Instagram, White used LinkedIn to slide into the DMs of the women he fancied. One woman he met, \nJenna Riches, told The Australian that he presented her with a bunch of flowers, which is sweet enough \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 except \nthere was a dildo sticking out among the chrysanthemums. Or perhaps they were roses? Riches never confirmed \nthe genus of flower.\nMore material here is that the staggering drop in WiseTech's share price, the $2bn wipe-out to White's net wealth, \nand the reputational whacking he's received (top of low, bottom of medium on the public shaming scale) could have \nall been buried beneath a pile of NDAs for a fraction of the sum he's now agreed to pay.\nMargin Call has established with impeccable authority that Rogan made an attempt last year to settle her feud with \nWhite for a bargain basement price of about $400,000, or what White probably spends restringing his rare guitars \neach year.\nIt was an offer extended during the early months of 2023, at which point Rogan had been locked out of the \nVaucluse mansion that White had purchased for her - and at a time when Rogan was alleging that White owed her \nmore than $91,400 for the furnishings she had bought. It's that amount that she later successfully sought months \nlater to garnish from his bank account, setting the fuse on this palaver between them.\nPage 2 of 3\nCut price could have solved issue\nA Sydney solicitor (referred to Rogan by someone in the Cranbrook parent network) -approached White's camp \nwith the offer, which was refused, and which must now be regarded as one of the worst decisions ever made by a \nman with much, much more to lose than $400,000.\nWhite, clinging for life to what remains of his good name, chose not to comment on that.\nChange of address If British corporate regulators ever need to write to Fortescue, it's very important that they know \nthe company owns its own building.\nThat's the only conclusion that can be drawn from a bizarre little update to the company records in the UK this week \nof Fortescue Zero, which noted a change of address for the miner's UK subsidiary.\nAnother management shake-up? Or have they moved? Curious if so, given they only bought the \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a316m ($31.1m) \nbuilding a year ago, and moved in in April.\nBut no! On closer examination the address change is little more than a missive to Companies House to announce a \nrebrand had officially arrived in the village of Kidlington, just outside Oxford.\nIn future, rather than writing to Fortescue Zero at Oxford Spires Business Park, correspondence should be \naddressed Fortescue Zero, The Fortescue Building.\nStill, it cost the company a cool \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a38.8m to pay out the lease on its former HQ, according to its financial \nstatements, so you'd probably want to make sure you get full value from the branding where you can.\nFortescue Zero's annual accounts, released at the end of August, show a \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a322m loss for the year - on revenue \nup 45 per cent to \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a3112.6m.\nThe improvement, its directors say, is due to extra business coming in from Fortescue's own decarbonisation \nprograms in Australia. But the extent of Fortescue Zero's remaining outside business is, alas, not clear - the \ncompany has taken advantage of UK rules that allow it to duck reporting related-party transactions in wholly owed \nBritish subsidiaries of offshore companies.\nBlackwattle spray The danger of spraying your opinion around in the name of publicity is that you're always in \ndanger of making yourself look like a bit of a goose.\nTake Sydney investment house Blackwattle Partners. After launching in 2023 with $60m in seed capital, the fund \nmanager has done a nice job of getting its name in the financial press.\nCalling on Rio Tinto to abandon its dual-listed structure in June was met with a shrug by the mining giant, but \nsparked a new round of discussion about Rio's listed structure.\nAnd then there is Rio's $US6.7bn takeover offer for lithium play Arcadium. Blackwattle mid-cap fund manager Tim \nRiordan rushed out a statement decrying the deal as soon as it hit the market, saying it would never, ever vote for \nthe bid without a substantial bump and expressing \"disappointment\" that the board and management had agreed to \nthe deal.\nThat, as an aside, was given short shrift by Arcadium chairman Peter Coleman, who told a Perth newspaper he'd \nnever heard of Blackwattle, hadn't received its letter, and was only taking it on faith that it was a shareholder. \nArcadium wasn't in Blackwattle's top five mid-cap fund holdings in September, by the way, according to its latest \nfund statement.\nBut then the weekend press brought out Blackwattle's Ray David on the subject of lithium, talking up Rio's offer as \npotentially one of the company's finest acquisitions.\n\"Buying low-cost lithium assets such as Arcadium at current lithium prices makes total sense to us as Rio Tinto \nshareholders,\" David said.Page 3 of 3\nCut price could have solved issue\nDavid manages a different Blackwattle fund, to be fair, so there's no suggestion of Takeovers Code breaches. And \ninvestment managers are entitled to their own opinions.\nBut, as David reminded Margin Call when asked about the disparity of views, there are a lot of distressed lithium \ncompanies on the market and not many buyers - which you might think would also resonate with his colleagues \nacross the hall.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Fortescue Zero's bizarre update to UK company records\nLoad-Date: October 22, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment. Nothing else.\n            ",
