Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 20\nLength: 462 words\nByline: Tom Richardson\nBody\nCommonwealth Bank shares hit a record price of $119.37 yesterday, helping send the sharemarket higher for a \nsecond day.\nInvestors also sent National Australia Bank to a post-GFC high and Westpac to its highest level since 2015. The \nrecord-breaking banks helped lift the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 up 0.4 per cent to 7763.7 points. Nine of the 11 \nindustry groups finished higher.\nThe financials sector climbed 0.6 per cent as CBA pared earlier gains to finish up 0.8 per cent at $119.25. The \nadvance means Australia's largest bank has now climbed around 22 times in value (excluding dividends) since its \ninitial public offer at $5.40 per share in 1991.\n\"Investors think interest rates have peaked, and the outlook is for lower rates, so people seem happy to buy at a 4 \nper cent yield for premium banks,\" said Sean Sequeira, the chief investment officer of Australian Eagle Asset \nManagement.\nNAB climbed 0.7 per cent to $34.32 with Westpac up 0.2 per cent to $27.\nTechnology stocks got a lift from Wall Street overnight, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index added 0.6 per cent and \nsemiconductor giant Nvidia rose to a new all-time high of $US887 ($1348) per share and $US2.2 trillion valuation.\nOn the local sharemarket, WiseTech added 1.1 per cent to $1.06 and NextDC rose 2.5 per cent to $17.37.\nIn the mining sector, market heavyweights BHP, Rio Tinto and South32 all traded ex-dividend and lost value, \nkeeping a lid on the market's gains. Woodside Energy was also ex-dividend, sending the energy sector down 1.2 \nper cent.\nGold miners, meanwhile, extended a week-long rally as the precious metal hit a new record high of $US2168.10 an \nounce. Perseus Mining jumped 5.9 per cent to $2.07, Newmont added 0.6 per cent to $51.32 and Evolution Mining \nclimbed 2.8 per cent to $3.29.\nPage 2 of 2\nASX soars for second day as banks hit highs Equities\n\"Gold has flirted with record highs for a while, there's demand coming out of China and Russia as a store of \nwealth,\" said Mr Sequeira.\n\"The local gold stocks have lagged significantly though as a result of a few mishaps from the miners, and we've had \nlarge increases to cost bases which has really hurt earnings.\"\nIn other company news, gold miner Ramelius Resources entered a trading halt at $1.545 per share after The \nAustralian Financial Review's Street Talk column reported it would bid $700 million to $1 billion for Toronto-listed \nWest Australian gold miner Karora Resources. The best performer on the S&P/ASX 200 was nickel miner Chalice \nMining. It jumped 9.9 per cent to $1.33 on the hope the nickel price rout may have bottomed.\nElsewhere, bitcoin fetched $US66,230 at the closing bell and the Australian dollar climbed 0.3 per cent to buy \nUS65.9\u00a2 as the US dollar retreated across a basket of major currencies, after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome \nPowell said he still expected to cut borrowing rates in 2024.\nLoad-Date: March 10, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**ENTITY**: [Organization Name]\n**TYPE**: [Type of organization - e.g., Company, Government Agency, NGO, etc.]\n**DESCRIPTION**: [Brief description of how the entity is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**ENTITY**: Tesla, Inc.\n**TYPE**: Company\n**DESCRIPTION**: Main subject of article, discussing Q4 earnings report\n\nOnly include entities that are meaningful to the article's content.
