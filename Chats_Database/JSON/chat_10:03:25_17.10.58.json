Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 708 words\nByline: James Pearson\nHighlight: Latitude 66 is launching an air core drilling campaign near to Kalgoorlie Gold Mining's exciting new high-\ngrade Lighthorse gold discovery in WA's Eastern Goldfields.\nBody\nLatitude 66 Limited is gearing up the rigs for a major drilling campaign at its 100 per cent-owned Edjudina gold \nproject near to Kalgoorlie Gold Mining's recent spectacular high-grade supergene gold discovery in Western \nAustralia's Eastern Goldfields.\nThe 9000-metre air core program is set to begin this month and is designed to target multiple high-potential gold \nanomalies picked up from geochemical testing, geophysical surveys or historical air core drilling.\nOne target, the Hercules prospect, was identified as a 7-kilometre-long soil anomaly with up to 92 parts per billion \n(ppb) gold.\nAnother target, called Falcon, reported soil samples of up to 98ppb gold over 1.3km.\nLatitude 66's Colossus and Spartan high spots need follow-up drilling to test previous air core drill hits of one metre \ngrading 3.4 grams per tonne (g/t) gold and 5m running at 0.6g/t gold.\n'Latitude 66 is excited to be commencinga drilling program across multiple targets.'\nLatitude 66 managing director Grant Coyle\nHistorical drilling results also hinted at the potential for mineralisation in the bedrock under the oxide zone, which \nhas boosted Latitude's confidence that further treasures may lie beneath and are waiting to be discovered from the \nfollow-up exploration.\nAll the targets share a similar trait - they sit on the fringes of an intrusive formation known as the Great Victoria \nGranite. This has gifted the company a 20km gold-prospective corridor that is ready to explore.\nLatitude 66 managing director Grant Coyle said: \"With record high gold prices, it's a rewarding environment for \nexploration success and Lat66 will commence drilling this month at both the KSB project in Finland and now \nEdjudina in WA.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nLatitude 66 set to drill near to high-grade KalGold WA gold find\nThe Edjudina project covers 1193 square kilometres and sits at the southern end of the legendary north-south \ntrending, 40-million-ounce Laverton tectonic zone in the State's Eastern Goldfields.\nAs a premier gold mining district, the corridor plays host to some of the biggest gold discoveries in WA, including \nthe Gold Fields Ltd-owned 5.8-million-ounce Granny Smith mine, the 11.8m-ounce Barrick-owned Wallaby mine \nand the 10.3m-ounce Sunrise Dam gold mine owned by Anglo Ashanti.\nDirectly to the south of Edjudina, KalGold's recent high-grade Lighthorse gold discovery has .. got explorers hot \nunder the collar with hits such as 8 metres grading 9.21g/t gold from 52m within a broader 17m zone of 4.81g/t gold \nfrom 48m.\nThis discovery also prompted another neighbour E79 Gold Mines to dust off the drill rig and test potential westward \nextensions of Lighthorse.\nFurther south, Ramelius Resources is developing up the 1.04m-ounce Rebecca gold deposit.\nExciting for the juniors, the area has very little outcropping, which would have been an obvious deterrent to \nexploration as recently as 20 years ago.\nIt's also why the region was the last spot to be worked over before the end of the 19th-century gold rush and has \nlittle evidence of the old-timers.\nBecause less exploration was conducted on the region, the common thinking is that there may be plenty of new \ntargets waiting to be discovered with the aid of modern technology.\nTo help fund its exploration campaign, Latitude has locked in a drill-for-equity deal with Kalgoorlie-based Raglan \nDrilling covering 25 per cent of the costs through a placement of shares to the driller. Latitude says the arrangement \nhas conserved cash and will speed up its exploration timeline.\nEdjudina is one of three exploration projects Latitude is chasing. In Finland, the company is aggressively developing \nup its flagship Kuusamo Schist Belt gold and cobalt project in northern Finland, which holds 650,000 ounces of gold \ngrading 2.7g/t gold and 5800t of cobalt running at 0.08 per cent in the resource.\nIn Queensland, the company is sitting pretty on a 17.5 per cent free-carried position over the Greater Duchess \ncopper project in joint venture with Carnaby Resources. The project hosts 260,000t of contained copper.\nPunters will likely closely watch for some initial results as Latitude starts drilling, especially given its proximity to the \nneighbouring Lighthorse discovery, which has recently shone a big spotlight on the region.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?
