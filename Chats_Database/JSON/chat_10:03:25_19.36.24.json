Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 7\nLength: 446 words\nByline: Tom Rabe and Peter Ker\nBody\nAndrew Forrest and his ex-wife Nicola will step down as co-chairs of their family's $8 billion philanthropic \nfoundation, with the billionaire mining magnate saying he will focus on his Fortescue iron ore empire.\nThe Minderoo Foundation has directed the family's philanthropic efforts since it was founded in 2001. It will be \nchaired by former Melbourne University chancellor Allan Myers, a high-profile barrister.\nThe leadership shake-up comes just months after the organisation slashed its workforce by close to one-third as \npart of measures to ensure more of the endowment money reached the intended beneficiaries.\n\"This is a significant responsibility, and I've elected to step aside as chair of the Minderoo Foundation, so I may \nfocus on driving the global adoption of real zero - the elimination of fossil fuels across Fortescue and global \nindustry,\" Dr Forrest said.\nNicola Forrest is seeking to set up her own new charitable foundation called Coaxial Foundation. Coaxial was \nregistered in January and its constitution says it will focus on early childhood education and gender equality.\nIt is not clear where the foundation will source its funding from, but Ms Forrest is the ultimate owner of 50 million \nFortescue shares that were put into a new company called Coaxial Ventures in June last year.\nMr Myers has served on the Minderoo board since 2014 and is a former National Gallery of Victoria chairman.\nLast year, the Forrests gave 220 million Fortescue shares to the Minderoo Foundation, one-fifth of their holdings, \nworth $5 billion, making it one of the largest philanthropic organisations in the world.\nThe Australian Financial Review revealed several months after that grant that the Forrests had separated after 31 \nyears of marriage.\nNicola Forrest said the decision to step aside as co-chairs was a show of confidence in how the Minderoo \nFoundation was performing.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrests step back from Minderoo\n\"Guided by its new strategy, Minderoo and its partners are in an even stronger position to face up to these \nchallenges together,\" she said in a statement.\nMinderoo Foundation chief executive John Hartman has flagged the charity will direct more money into \ncollaborations and partnerships. The charity supports cancer research, ocean research and initiatives to end \nslavery, and has provided millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to Ukraine.\nThe Minderoo Foundation spent $268 million in the 12 months to the end of June last year, up from $178 million in \nthe previous year.\nThe tax-exempt charity booked $35.2 million in employee expenses, up from $25.4 million.\nDespite stepping down as co-chairman, Dr Forrest is expected to continue working on key Minderoo Foundation \ncauses and will remain on the board.\nLoad-Date: October 20, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
