Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1636 words\nHighlight: The definitive ranking of eggs, rabbits and the odd Humpty Dumpty this Easter.\nBody\nEvery Easter, I plan a trip to my local chocolatier to buy something luxurious and artisanal for my niece and \nnephew. Something made by hand and boasting single-origin cacao from the Pacific Islands, Dominican Republic \nor Daintree Forest. Something their parents will try to pinch and eat in front of the telly on Monday. \nEvery year, however, I run out of time and find myself at Coles on Saturday night, wondering if kids still like \nCadbury Creme Eggs, and if Red Tulip still makes a Humpty Dumpty on a wall (it doesn't), and pondering if any \nsupermarket Easter treats are worth buying for grown-ups, too.\nLeaving most of the new-fangled freakazoid flavours on the shelf (sorry, Life Savers Fruit Tingle bunny), I set about \ntasting as many classic Easter chocolate treats as possible to see how they stacked up. To arrive at the final \nranking, all chocolates were assessed for flavour, texture and appearance, and a little nostalgic bias here and there. \n14. Cadbury Creme Egg, 40g, $1.30\nLink to Image\nJanie Barrett\nMany of you will be upset that the Creme Egg isn't higher on the list, if not number one. When was the last time you \nate one, though? Having not touched Cadbury's goo-filled googs in maybe two decades, I had forgotten how \ngrossly cloying they are. The chocolate shell is fine - your bog-standard Cadbury milk chocolate stuff - but the \ncreme fondant core is so sweet it makes wedding cake frosting seem like Greek yoghurt. On closer inspection, the \nCreme Egg contained the highest sugar percentage of all items tasted, at 65 per cent. Almost two-thirds! If there's a \nmore sickly egg on the market, I don't want to know about it. \nLink to Image\nJanie Barrett\n13. Kinder Surprise Milk Chocolate Easter Bunny, 75g, $4.50\nPage 2 of 5\nBattle of the bunnies: 14 classic Easter eggs ranked from the sickening to the sensational\nKids are eating this stuff? Holy moly. This made-in-Poland rabbit is obscenely sweet, with a milk chocolate shell, \nand sugary white lining on the flipside. A nice \"snap\" is paramount when it comes to identifying good chocolate - it \nmeans the chocolate is well tempered and made with plenty of cocoa butter. That you can bend this egg more or \nless like Play-Doh is not a good sign. I like the design of the bunny holding the egg, at least. My toy surprise was a \ngreen plastic frog. He looks like Tony Soprano.\n12. Cadbury Hollow Hunting Eggs, 204g, $6\nLink to Image\nJanie Barrett\nAh, the mid-sized hollow egg. Easter's number one basket filler and hat decorator. Cadbury sells these as \"hunting \neggs\", but I'm not sure if they're fit for that purpose because 1. They're quite easy to find compared to the little guys. \nAnd 2. You can expect a melted sticky mess if they spend more than five minutes in the sun in a backyard or park. I \nfound a 20-pack for $10 at Woolies, and each one tasted like it cost 50\u00a2. Unsurprisingly sugary, but also oily, bendy \nand somewhat grainy. \nLink to Image\nJanie Barrett\n11. Darrell Lea Milk Chocolate Nougat Egg, 150g, $6\nI want a full inquiry into what happened to the little chicken that used to sit on top of Darrell Lea's nougat egg. That \nfluffy yellow guy was the best part of what's otherwise an uncompromising stodgefest of sugar, glucose syrup, \nchocolate and coconut. I'm sure the egg also used to be taller. The current version is long and flat, like a deflated \nmodel of Uluru. The mighty have fallen.\nLink to Image\nJanie Barrett\n10. Cadbury Dairy Milk Humpty Dumpty, 130g, $5.50\nI'm old enough to remember when Humpty Dumpty would sit on an actual wall - or at least a hollow chocolate \nrectangle moulded into Humpty's body/torso/head. These days, Humpty is just a standard-issue egg with a different \nname, but at least he's still filled with knock-off Smarties (or, as Cadbury likes to call them, \"beanies\"), which \narguably taste better than the real thing. Bonus points for the \"all the king's horses\" finger puppets that kids can cut \nout from the back of the box. \nLink to Image\nJanie Barrett\n9. Cadbury Caramilk Easter Bunny, 125g, $6\nThis slim-design bunny only made its Easter debut in 2021, but Caramilk is such a cult favourite I'm going to allow it \nonto this list. Introduced to the Australian market in 1968, the carmelised white chocolate is highly addictive stuff, \nand I can see why home-made Caramilk cheesecake is so popular that Philadelphia once released a Caramilk \ncream cheese spread. The chocolate could have better tempering (it's a little bendy) but the decorated mould is \nsmartly done, right down to the creases in the bunny's jacket. \nLink to Image\nJanie BarrettPage 3 of 5\nBattle of the bunnies: 14 classic Easter eggs ranked from the sickening to the sensational\n8. Grand Ferrero Rocher, 125g, $9\nI bought my first girlfriend a Ferrero Rocher three-pack on the way to school in year 7. She dumped me at recess \ndue to differing opinions on Clueless, but I reckon we could have made it all the way to lunch if I had given her one \nof these instead. If you've eaten a Ferrero Rocher before, this is just like that (crunchy, sweet, hazelnutty), except \nit's hollow and the size of a cricket ball. I don't understand why the Grand Ferrero isn't filled with smaller Rochers, \nbut at least it's topped with a gold bow you can reuse at Christmas. \nLink to Image\nJanie Barrett\n7. Darrell Lea Milk Chocolate Hunting Eggs, 120g, $5\nDarrell Lea was considered better chocolate than the no-name stuff school teachers would hide for treasure hunts \nwhen I was a kid, but it was still a rung down from Cadbury's and Red Tulip*. In 2023, however, Darrell Lea's \nhunting (or mini) eggs are the best in class, with a chewy, sticky texture to get the chocolate stuck in your gums in \nthe most excellent way. To be fair, Koko Black's hunting eggs are delicious too, but for three times the price of \nDarrell Lea's, I can't say they're three times as good. \nLink to Image\nJanie Barrett\n6. Lindt Lindor Assorted Mini Eggs, 90g, $4\nFor as long as I live, I'll never be able to remember which colour is which flavour in a bag of Lindor assorted eggs. \nThe milk chocolate one (the red one) is agreeably balanced with a soft, fudgy interior; the blue one is a more robust \ndark chocolate treat; and the gold one (the best one) features white chocolate and a velvety cream filling. Or, hang \non, is the red one the white chocolate one? Damn it, I've already forgotten.\nLink to Image\nJanie Barrett\n5. Lindt Milk Gold Bunny, 100g, $6\nWith the greatest respect to Australia's own bilby, the Lindt bunny must be the cutest treat on shelves every Easter. \nThe little nose, the whiskers, the red bow, the BELL. It would rank higher, however, if some of that cuteness was \npresent on the actual chocolate. Beneath the foil, there's only the shape of a rabbit with a pair of unblinking, \nunsettling eyes. But the taste is not too sugary, the texture reasonably creamy, and the head nice and thick to sink \nyour teeth into. \nLink to Image\nJanie Barrett\n4. Red Tulip Elegant Rabbit, 200g, $7\nGrowing up, it wasn't Easter until I had poured milk into the boots of an Elegant Rabbit, swished it around with bits \nof broken bunny head, and knocked back the concoction like it was God's own Coco Pops. Just like a chocolate \nmilkshake, only with a lot more chocolate. The Red Tulip Elegant Rabbit might be Australia's most iconic Easter \ntreat, which I guess is why Coles can get away with charging $7 per bunny. (Is it just me, or does that seem like a \nlot?) The milk chocolate, to be fair, isn't bad. Sweet, sure, but it doesn't burn the back of your throat like the nasty \nstuff. I also enjoy that the bunny's chocolate mould features the same fancy waistcoat as its wrapper.

Koko Black The Littlest Bunny, 90g, $17\nI know I just said $7 seemed pricey for an elegant rabbit, and this bunny is half the size and more than twice the \ncost of Red Tulip's, but it is much tastier chocolate. Balanced and not too sweet, with a touch of fruity complexity, \nthere's vanilla in the background and the tempering has fantastic snap. Plus, it's a charming rabbit to look at, with \ndetailed fur and big round eyes - much better than the beady peepers on its gold cousin from Switzerland. Also \navailable in white, gold (pictured) and dark chocolate.\nLink to Image\nJanie Barrett\n2. Cherry Ripe Egg, 110g, $4\nI could have done a separate ranking just of eggs based on Streets ice-cream and Cadbury chocolate-bar \nflavours**. In the Streets corner you now have eggs themed to the Golden Gaytime (terrific), Splice Pine Lime (fine) \nand Bubble O'Bill (break it open to find five bubblegum \"noses\"). Meanwhile, Cadbury has come to the party with \nTurkish Delight and Crunchie-flavoured eggs, and a Roses egg filled with Hazelnut Swirls et cetera. Then there's \nthis cracker. We're all agreed that the Cherry Ripe is the best chocolate bar, right? For the Easter version, snappy \ndark chocolate is blended with bits of coconut and cherry jelly moulded to the inside of the shell. Perfect. I should \nalso mention the special-edition Cherry Ripe egg filled with smaller Old Gold chocolate eggs. Mum, if you're reading \nthis, you know what to buy Dad. \n1. Haigh's Australian Single Origin Milk Chocolate Bilby, 100g, $14.90\nMade from Australian cocoa beans, this marsupial has lovely raisiny, malty notes and is, by far, the most complex-\ntasting chocolate on this list. The shell is lovely and thick. The go-to bit is, of course, the pointy chocolate ears, \nalthough the bilby will take on a less appealing rat-like form if you eat them first. \n*Nothing, however, was as prized as every kids' chocolate de resistance, a Violet Crumble egg the size of a \nfootball. I went to considerable lengths to track one down for this list (OK, I called three shops), but they're even \nharder to find in the wild than a Bertie Beetle.\n**The Cadbury Favourites box isn't included here because it's an any-occasion gift, not just limited to Easter. \nFavourites have their own power ranking too, with the Cherry Ripe firmly in first position, followed by the Moro, \nTurkish Delight, Old Gold, Picnic, Boost, Flake, Dream, Dairy Milk, Caramello and Crunchie.\nGraphic\n \nCadbury Creme Eggs.\nKinder Surprise Milk Chocolate Easter Bunny.\nCadbury Hollow Hunting Eggs.\nDarrell Lea Milk Chocolate Nougat Egg.\nCadbury Dairy Milk Humpty Dumpty.Page 5 of 5\nBattle of the bunnies: 14 classic Easter eggs ranked from the sickening to the sensational\nCadbury Caramilk Easter Bunny.\nGrand Ferrero Rocher.\nDarrell Lea Milk Chocolate Hunting Eggs.\nLindt Lindor Assorted Mini Eggs.\nLindt Milk Gold Bunny.\nRed Tulip Elegant Rabbit\nKoko Black The Littlest Bunny.\nCherry Ripe Egg.\nLoad-Date: March 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Shell.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
