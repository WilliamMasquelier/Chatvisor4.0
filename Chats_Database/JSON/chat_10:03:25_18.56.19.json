Fortescue wrote $US1bn off its valuation of the project in its last annual report.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue nears green hydrogen call\nFortescue shipped 48.6 million tonnes of iron ore in the December quarter, slightly below the 49.4 million tonnes \nshipped in the same period in 2022.\nThe company said its C1 cash cost for the period averaged $US17.62 a wet metric tonne, and it received an \naverage $US116.18 a dry metric tonne for its sales in the December period.\nFortescue closed December with net debt of $US600m, the company said. The company has said it still expects to \nship 192-197 million tonnes for the full year, despite the impact of the troubles at Iron Bridge and a derailment on its \niron ore line in the Pilbara that stopped trains for four days over the New Year weekend.\nFortescue said it was implementing an \"operational recovery plan\" to optimise rail loading and shipments for the \nsecond half of the year.\nFortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said he believed the company would still meet its full-year \nshipments guidance for the year, despite the setbacks at Iron Bridge and through the derailment.\n\"The rest of the supply chain is performing exceptionally well. The bottleneck for our operations is rail, so we expect \nany specific recovery plan just to be focused on that, but we're in a pretty good position,\" Mr Otranto said.\nAfter falling short of its promise to reach a final investment decision on as many as five green energy projects in \n2024, the company was likely to make a call on its biggest planned hydrogen project in Australia, Mr Hutchinson \nsaid.\nFortescue announced the -approval of two projects from its energy division in November, ticking off plans for small \nhydrogen production plants in Phoenix in the US and at Gladstone in Queensland.\nAt the time, Fortescue said it would fast-track a decision on larger projects in Norway, Kenya and Brazil.\nBut the company put off any decision on its Gibson Island proposal in Brisbane, where For-tescue has been \nworking with Incitec Pivot on a green hydrogen feed for Incitec's mothballed fertiliser plant. At the time, Fortescue \ncited high Australian energy costs for the deferral.\nLate last month, Genex Power told the market it had extended a deadline for Fortescue to close a deal for power \nfrom its proposed Bulli Creek solar farm - first -announced in October - by two months until the end of February.\nMr Hutchinson told reporters and analysts that a final decision on the plant was likely at Fortescue's board \nmeeting.\n\"We're working hard to get this project over the line,\" Mr Hutchinson said. \"We have a board meeting coming up \nlater in February and I would imagine there will be a 'go or no go' decision made at that board meeting.\" Fortescue \nshares rose 2 per cent to $28.97 in a higher market on Thursday.\nLoad-Date: January 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
