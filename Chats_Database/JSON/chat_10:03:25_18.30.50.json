Pg. 16\nLength: 499 words\nByline: EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER\nBody\nRamelius Resources boss Mark Zeptner says his company's acquisition of an 8.9 per cent stake in Spartan \nResources in June provided a \"seat at the table\" and he would continue to assess the gold miner as a potential \ntarget.\nHowever, he said the company had moved on from Westgold Resources after holding takeover talks with its fellow \ngold miner last year.\nOn the sidelines of the Diggers and Dealers conference in Kalgoorlie, Zeptner said that Ramelius moved on \nSpartan when \"an opportunity presented itself\" and the company would continue to assess the target.\n\"We did some work \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and thought that is an opportunity we would like to capitalise on.\" He said he knew \nSpartan's managing director Simon Lawson, and the pair had a coffee, \"and that's as far as it has gone,\".\n\"Ultimately, as the project grows, it becomes more and more attractive to others, but it is in our backyard.\" \nRamelius owns and operates two production and processing hubs at Mt Magnet and Edna May, in Western \nAustralia.\nIt is also developing its Rebecca-Roe project and Cue Gold Project, 35km south of Mt Magnet, after buying Apollo \nConsolidated in 2022 and Musgrave Minerals the following year.\nIt purchased Spartan shares at 92c in June, and they are currently trading at about $1.08.\nSpartan, with a $1.3bn market value, owns the Dalgaranga Gold Project, 65km northwest of Mt Magnet in \nMurchison, where Ramelius owns a processing hub.\nPart of that is its Never Never high-grade gold deposit on which the company is pinning its hopes for growth.\nIt was previously called Gascoyne Resources and collapsed after gold production levels being processed through \nits mill were not profitable, and it was later recapitalised after its market value fell beneath $100m.\nPage 2 of 2\nRamelius boss keeps watching brief on Spartan Resources - DATA ROOM\n\"Everyone would like a Never Never in their portfolio - for us, it is a nice to have, but not a must-have.\" Speculation \nhas existed about a move by Ramelius on Spartan since at least 2021 as the gold industry looks to consolidate.\nZeptner said Ramelius saw \"some real synergies\" with Westgold, but the opportunity had \"been and gone\".\nHe said discussions with the Canada listed gold miner Karora, which has operations in WA, ended in February after \na deal could not be reached on value.\nKarora went on to merge with Westgold.\nZeptner addressed his move to object to the merger between Westgold and Karora by taking the matter to the \nTakeovers Panel, with Ramelius accusing Westgold of breaching standstill conditions relating to its takeover talks.\nHe said that the panel took too long to rule on the matter that was raised in April and not finalised until July, so he \nwould not have taken that path if the company had its time again. \"The panel response wasn't timely so it wasn't \neffective,\" he said.\nLate last year, it was known around the market that Ramelius was in search of an opportunity where it could add \n100,000 ounces of gold per annum and wanted to add a third production hub to put its cash pile to work. Zeptner \nsaid he was focused on good margins and cashflow.\nLoad-Date: August 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Mark Zeptner | CEO of Ramelius Resources | \"We did some work \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and thought that is an opportunity we would like to capitalise on.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Zeptner | CEO of Ramelius Resources | \"Ultimately, as the project grows, it becomes more and more attractive to others, but it is in our backyard.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Zeptner | CEO of Ramelius Resources | \"Everyone would like a Never Never in their portfolio - for us, it is a nice to have, but not a must-have.\" | N.A. |\n| Mark Zeptner | CEO of Ramelius Resources | \"The panel response wasn't timely so it wasn't effective.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
