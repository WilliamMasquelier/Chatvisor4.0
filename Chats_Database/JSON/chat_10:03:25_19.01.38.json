The facility on the outskirts of Gladstone will \nultimately underpin more than 300 direct and indirect jobs.\nElectrolysers pass an electrical current through water, splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen.\nThe electrolyser facility is the first stage of a wider Green Energy Manufacturing Centre being developed by \nFortescue on the 100ha Gladstone site. The next phases will include a hydrogen system testing facility and \nFortescue's PEM50 green hydrogen project.\nPEM50 will receive development approval from Queensland's Coordinator-General on Monday, paving the way for \nconstruction to begin.\nIt will use the locally made Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysers with approval to produce green \nhydrogen for local and export markets. Once operational it will be Fortescue's first commercial-scale green \nhydrogen facility.\n\"Queensland is now leading the nation on investment in renewable energy, and we are now seeing that translate \ninto good manufacturing jobs in our regions,\" Mr Miles said.\n\"This is why one of my first announcements as Premier was to commit to 75 per cent emissions reduction by 2035 \non the path to net zero because it means accelerating investment in good clean economy jobs in our industrial \nheartlands.\" Mr Husic said: \"This hydrogen gigafactory shows what can be achieved when government and industry \nwork together.\"\nLoad-Date: April 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Mark Hutchinson | Fortescue Energy chief executive | \"We're strategically focused on building out our energy business.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | Fortescue executive chairman | \"Together we have laid the cornerstone for what will be a massive new manufacturing industry in Australia creating the potential for thousands of new green energy jobs.\" | N.A. |\n| Steven Miles | Premier of Queensland | \"Queensland is now leading the nation on investment in renewable energy, and we are now seeing that translate into good manufacturing jobs in our regions.\" | N.A. |\n| Ed Husic | Federal Industry and Science Minister | \"This hydrogen gigafactory shows what can be achieved when government and industry work together.\" | N.A. |\n\nYour output must contain the initial Quotes table provided with an additional column containing the appropriate sentiment classifications.
