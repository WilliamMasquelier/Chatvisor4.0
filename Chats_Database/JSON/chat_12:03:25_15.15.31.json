Agents would not only schedule staff but make assessments of who might be the best at \na particular role, choosing who might work the register and who might be better on the floor selling clothes.\nAt big four bank ANZ, chief technology officer Tim Hogarth, who studied business information systems and \ninformation technology at the University of South Australia, holds the reins on AI.\nPrior to ANZ he worked as vice-president of innovation at TD bank in Canada and as head of application platform at \nCBA.\nWhile most financial institutions have major technology teams, Mr Hogarth said it was important to remember \"we're \na bank first\". He said: \"When people write code it's 'if this, then that' - it's deterministic. But there's a whole bunch of \nproblems we can't solve with 'if this, then that'.\n\"The way I explain it is I have both Taylor Swift and AC/DC in my playlist. You can't write rules to say 'this chief \ntechnical officer used to work in Canada, then play these songs'. But Spotify uses patterns and they discover music \nI like and overlap that with what other people like and it finds patterns between them.\" When it came to banking, he \nsaid: \"AI can essentially find trends and implement solutions faster than we can interpret them and write the code \nourselves.\" And in 2024, the technology is now brought several times a day. \"It has changed from being one of the \ntechnologies that was occasionally mentioned to every single conversation,\" he said.\nMr Hogarth said he believed Australia had not yet seen the full innovation AI would bring. \"We're at the bottom of \nthe S curve,\" he said.\nHe wants Australia to be at the forefront of the revolution rather than \"play catch-up\", and that could happen if \nAustralia didn't capitalise on the opportunity.\nUS multinational Cisco might have one of Australia's most senior AI executives, with 28-year veteran Carl Solder \nleading the charge.\nMr Solder is chief technology officer of ANZ, a role he took up after briefly leaving Cisco after spending several \nyears as vice-president of engineering, based in Silicon Valley in California.\n\"AI is software that intends to mimic human intelligence,\" Mr Solder said. \"A traditional computer program follows a \nset of fixed instructions to perform an outcome that's always the same. With AI, the outcome you'll get is going to be \na little bit more fluid.\" Last year Cisco conducted a global AI readiness that found just 5 per cent of Australian \ncustomers were ready to adopt AI. That same report found 59 per cent of respondents believed they had just 12 \nmonths to adopt AI, which leaves him to the conclusion that companies would race to adopt the technology either \nthrough off-the-shelf products from the company or going out creating their own AI product.\nLoad-Date: February 28, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOutput Format:\n**ENTITY**: [Organization Name]\n**TYPE**: [Type of organization - e.g., Company, Government Agency, NGO, etc.]\n**DESCRIPTION**: [Brief description of how the entity is discussed in the article]\n\nExample Output:\n**ENTITY**: Tesla, Inc.\n**TYPE**: Company\n**DESCRIPTION**: Main subject of article, discussing Q4 earnings report\n\nOnly include entities that are meaningful to the article's content.
