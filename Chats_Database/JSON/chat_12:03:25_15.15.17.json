The rocket company's move comes two weeks after a Delaware court ordered Musk to give up a Tesla \ncompensation package valued at $US55.8bn. \"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,\" Musk \nwrote on X following the court's decision, noting that shareholders would be able to vote on whether to move \nTesla's incorporation to Texas.\nPublishing spat Arena Group Holdings said it would continue publishing the print and digital editions of Sports \nIllustrated as it continued negotiating with the publication's owner, Authentic Brands Group. Arena, which also \npublishes TheStreet and Men's Journal, said there was an unresolved claim of $US45m against the company by \nAuthentic, and it would continue to publish Sports Illustrated until the issue was resolved. The publisher previously \nmissed a payment to Authentic, which licenses the Sports Illustrated brand to Arena. Under the publishing deal \nbetween the two, Authentic has the right to terminate its licensing agreement, which Authentic did. Arena on \nWednesday also named Cavitt Randall as the company's next chief executive. Arena said in a regulatory filing that \nRandall was appointed chairman of the board January 23 and had previously served as CEO of investment firm \nMBX Clearing and operating chief of SI Capital. Randall, 46, has agreed to an annual salary of $US1, according to \nthe filing.\nCisco axes staff Cisco Systems plans to cut about 5 per cent of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan to \nrealign its business and enable further investment in key areas. The networking equipment company estimates it \nwill recognise pre-tax charges of about $US800m, which will be primarily cash-based. It expects to take the majority \nof these actions in the third quarter and recognise about $US500m of these charges. Cisco expects about \n$US150m of the charges to be recognised in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and the remaining amount primarily \nthrough the first half of fiscal 2025. Cisco had about 84,900 employees as of July 29.\nMorgan Stanley cuts Morgan Stanley plans to cut several hundred jobs in its wealth management division as new \nchief executive Ted Pick seeks to rein in costs in an area that is critical to the Wall Street firm's success but has \nshown signs of weakening lately. The cuts, which include a small number of managing directors as well as non-\ncustomer-facing employees, are expected to hit less than 1 per cent of the wealth unit's employees, which number \nless than 40,000 in total. Affected employees are expected to be notified as soon as this week, according to people \nPage 2 of 2\nIN BRIEF\nfamiliar with the matter.
