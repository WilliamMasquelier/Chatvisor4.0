Limited All Rights Reserved\\nLength: 1207 words\\nHighlight: The oil super majors are eyeing shifting their primary stock exchange listings to New York as a stronger \\npush to reduce fossil fuels in their home markets weighs on their share prices.\\nBody\\nThere's a yawning gap between the valuations of US oil and gas majors and their UK and European counterparts. \\nThat's prompted a debate over whether the more lowly rated energy giants should switch their primary stock \\nexchange listing to New York.\\nThe discussion was given a sharper edge late last month when the chief executive of France's Total Energies, \\nPatrick Pouyann\\u00e9, said the century-old super major, founded by the French government, was seriously considering \\na shift of its listing, albeit not its headquarters.\\nShell, which shifted its headquarters from The Hague and unwound its dual listing to base itself and its shares in \\nLondon in 2022, is known to have also seriously pondered a shift in its primary listing three years ago.\\nBP has said a move is not on its agenda but would inevitably have done some analysis on it. There's also been \\nspeculation that its relatively low sharemarket valuation could make it a target for one of the more highly rated oil \\ngiants, which could effectively produce a transfer of its listing.\\nThe driver of the discussion is a significant disparity in the sharemarket valuations of European and UK energy \\ncompanies relative to their US counterparts like Exxon and Chevron, which trade on cashflow multiples up to 50 per \\ncent higher than their transatlantic rivals.\\nNot only does that make their shareholders happier, but it lowers the US majors' cost of equity, enables them to \\ninvest more productively and makes acquisitions more attractive. Exxon bought Pioneer Natural Resources for \\n$US60 billion ($91 billion) last year, while Chevron announced an agreed all-share $US53 billion for Hess Corp.\\nThe smaller strand in the explanation for the varying valuations relates to the markets themselves.\\nThe New York stock market is much bigger and deeper than London and the fragmented European exchanges and \\nis supported by a far larger pool of institutional and retail investors. Historically, that has produced higher valuations \\nrelative to European peer companies.\\nWith the US being the world's largest producer and exporter of oil and gas, there is also stronger interest in the \\nsector there and better support from US and international investors.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nIt's not easy being green for UK and European oil giants\\nWhile the market dynamics have seen some UK and European companies, particularly (but not exclusively) tech \\nand biotech companies, shift their listings to the US, they are not the primary reason energy companies have \\nconsidered the move.\\nNor is the post-Brexit decline in the status of London's market a major factor, although what was once the global \\nhub for resources investment has been fading as some of its larger listings, like BHP's UK listing, have disappeared \\nor - as will happen if BHP succeeds with its Anglo-American bid -- London-listed miners have been acquired.\\nThe US companies are pursuing growth strategies. Their trans-Atlantic competitors aren't.\\nThe more material influence on the oil majors' valuations than the nature of their domestic markets is the extent to \\nwhich policymakers and investors in the UK and Europe have responded to climate change and the way that has, \\nand is, shaping the growth strategies of companies like TotalEnergies, Shell and BP.\\nExxon and Chevron are aggressively growing their oil and gas production volumes and investing in increasing their \\noutput even as, across the Atlantic, TotalEnergies, Shell and BP are pursuing carbon emissions reduction-related \\nstrategies that will eventually see their volumes decline.\\nThe US companies are pursuing growth strategies. Their transatlantic competitors aren't.\\nShell and BP have received significant criticism recently for slowing the rate at which their fossil fuel volumes are \\nscheduled to fall.\\nBP, for instance, had a 2020 plan to cut its oil and gas production by 40 per cent by 2030 from 2019. Last year, the \\ntarget was shifted to 25 per cent by 2030, with the 35 to 40 per cent target for its own carbon emissions revised to \\nbetween 20 and 30 per cent.\\nShell, which had said it would reduce its output by 1 or 2 per cent a year through to the end of the decade, last year \\nrestated its plan.\\nIt now expects flat volumes through to 2030 and, where it had planned to reduce investment in oil and gas and \\nincrease its spending on low-carbon products, it will now invest $US40 billion in oil and gas by 2035, against the \\n$US10 to $US15 billion it will spend in those low-carbon products.\\nThe backlash against BP and Shell was strong because European and UK fund managers, retail investors and their \\ngovernments are far more committed to environmental, social and governance policies than most US fund \\nmanagers and other investors.\\nIn the US, where President Joe Biden has presided over a massive increase in US oil and gas production and \\nDonald Trump is promising to \\\"drill, baby, drill\\\" if he regains the presidency, there has recently been something of a \\nbacklash against ESG investment policies.\\nThe stronger emissions reduction frameworks in Europe and the UK (and successful legal actions by environmental \\nactivists) have forced their oil and gas companies to pursue strategies that have resulted in them constraining their \\noil and gas investment and production while building a presence in greener technologies and fuels.\\nFrom the companies' perspective - and that of prospective investors less concerned about fossil fuels - the pressure \\nto reduce their oil and gas production and invest in renewables and hydrogen will deliver lower returns than the \\nmore aggressively pro-fossil fuel strategies pursued by Exxon and Chevron.\\nWhen BP unveiled its new timetable for responding to climate change, it said that it generated returns on \\ninvestment of 15 to 20 per cent from its fossil fuel projects. The returns from bioenergy were about 15 per cent, but \\nthey were only 6 to 8 per cent from renewables like solar and wind. It's not surprising that it decided to invest more \\nin oil and gas and biofuels than in renewables.Page 3 of 3\\nIt's not easy being green for UK and European oil giants\\nThere's a relatively recent view among the majors, one that arguably was held earlier and more strongly by the US \\ncompanies, that the transition to cleaner energy is going to take longer and, if it is to be relatively smooth, will \\nrequire more investment in fossil fuels to maintain energy supply than was once projected.\\nThat view doesn't sit well with ESG-sensitive European or British investors. At the same time, the significant and \\nstill-growing presence of lower-returning assets in their portfolios and the absence of the production growth \\nstrategies of Exxon and Chevron deter those investors less fussed about investing in fossil fuels.\\nTotalEnergies, which has far more US investors than Europeans and whose biggest exposure to oil and gas is in \\nthe US, has less of a discount relative to Exxon and Chevron than the UK companies. But it believes that, if it were \\nvalued in line with them, there would be a very substantial uplift.\\nBut as a French national champion, TotalEnergies would face significant obstacles to moving its listing - as might \\nShell and BP - from governments determined to retain their flagship companies, retain their corporate offices and \\nmaintain the size and relevance of their equity markets.\\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

Delays in approvals and higher costs of construction have \\nslowed the rollout of big renewable energy projects despite plenty of interest from global investors.\\nThe Coalition has proposed a network of nuclear power stations as the best way to move away from fossil fuel as \\ncoal plants shut. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton will use a speech in Sydney today to again pitch nuclear power as \\na long-term renewable energy solution, hitting back at an attack on the plan last week by Energy Minister Chris \\nBowen.\\nWhile conceding nuclear power will have a \\\"significant upfront cost\\\", Mr Dutton will claim that the 80-year lifespan of \\neach plant means they will outlast renewable electricity sources many times over. He will not, however, release any \\ncostings.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nRules put transition at risk: Shell; Exclusive\\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese, however, is banking on mechanisms which incentivise the development of wind \\nand solar projects to hit targets. That, the government says, can be supported by gas to ensure supply if demand \\nsurges.\\nShell has long criticised the investment climate for gas. Ms Wake pointed to duplication between state and federal \\nenvironmental approvals and \\\"ambiguous\\\" requirements on Indigenous consultation as some of the reasons for \\ndelays and higher costs.\\nBut she said similar hurdles were now evident for wind and solar projects, putting at risk private investment needed \\nto underpin the move away from fossil fuels.\\n\\\"If we're going to reach net zero by 2050, for Australia to really thrive through the energy transition, we're going to \\nneed not one wave of investment, but a second, a third, a fourth, multiple waves of investment and what that \\nrequires is successful delivery of projects,\\\" she said. \\\"We need a really harmonised set of regulatory settings so that \\nwe can deliver projects - whether they're in the gas or the renewables or firming space - predictably and deliver the \\nlowest cost, most reliable, lowest-emissions energy.\\\"\\nLondon-listed Shell is one of the country's biggest energy players. It owns the Queensland Curtis LNG venture at \\nGladstone, one of the state's three large gas export projects. It owns gas power and solar plants, the ERM Power \\nelectricity retailer, which sells to business, and household energy retailer Powershop.\\nIn the west, its portfolio includes the Prelude floating LNG plant, a stake in Chevron's Gorgon LNG venture, and a \\nsmall holding in Woodside Energy's North West Shelf.\\nMs Wake said the Australian business represented \\\"quite a powerful microcosm\\\" of a \\\"balanced\\\" energy transition, \\nbut added that funders of these projects had \\\"choices on where to go\\\", signalling Shell could look elsewhere if \\ninvesting became too difficult.\\nThese issues were raised by Clean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton in a speech earlier this month, \\nwhen he described environmental and planning rules for wind farm development as \\\"not fit for purpose\\\" and one \\nreason for a difficult year in 2023, when few decisions were made on whether to proceed with big projects.\\nThe Clean Energy Council, which represents major renewable energy developers, has warned that a big increase in \\ncommitments for generation projects will be needed by the end of December to reach the level of work needed to \\nhit government targets.\\n\\\"We should have big expectations for the second half of this year,\\\" said Mr Thornton. \\\"As a nation, we didn't do a \\ngreat job of preparing for this complex transition. So we now need to draw on every ounce of tenacity to confront \\nthese challenges.\\\"\\nMs Wake said the transition away from fossil fuel needed plenty of capital, urging governments to \\\"leave the \\npopulism and the ideology and the party politics to one side and really get behind what is in Australia's best \\ninterests\\\".\\nMs Wake pointed to Shell's Crux LNG project in Western Australia as one that suffered from the fallout from the \\nlitigation over Indigenous consultation at Santos' Barossa gas project in the Timor Sea and Woodside's \\nScarborough LNG project.\\nThe $3.6 billion Crux project, which was approved in 2022, is intended to supply replacement gas for Prelude LNG \\noff the north-west coast. She said Shell had had to significantly broaden and lengthen consultation, taking in talks \\nwith 18 traditional owner groups even though none of the project infrastructure will come onshore.\\n\\\"It felt to me like an example of additional complexity that added delay and costs to projects without delivering a \\nsignificantly better outcome for traditional owner groups, and in fact, put a huge burden on them,\\\" she said of the \\nproject.Page 3 of 3\\nRules put transition at risk: Shell; Exclusive\\nShell's clean energy portfolio in Australia has almost 1.5 gigawatts of renewable generation and storage, including \\na 49 per cent interest in developer WestWind Energy, the Gangarri solar farm in Queensland, a battery in the NSW \\nRiverina, and the Rangebank battery south-east of Melbourne, which is due online later this year.\\nBut it has a bigger pipeline of projects, including a big battery at Wallerawang in NSW and a smaller storage project \\nin WA's Wheatbelt region.\\n\\\"There's another bit over a gigawatt of other battery projects that are there in the pipeline, so if we hit a permitting or \\na contracting roadblock on one of them, we can shuffle the deck in terms of the sequence,\\\" Ms Wake said.\\nIn all, Shell aims to have 4GW of renewables and storage operating by 2032.\\nLoad-Date: September 25, 2024\\nEnd of Document\",\n      \"Page 1 of 3\\nBig Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare\\nBig Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare\\nThe Age (Melbourne, Australia) - Online\\nDecember 18, 2024 Wednesday 1:08 AM UTC\\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Now they are leading the retreat.\\nBody\\nBP and Shell led Big Oil's push into renewable energy. Now they are leading the retreat.\\nLast week BP announced that it had sold its offshore wind assets into a joint venture with Japan's JERA, itself a \\njoint venture between Tokyo Electric Power and Chubu Electric Power, to create one of the world's largest offshore \\nwind businesses.\\nThat followed an earlier BP announcement, in September, that it planned to sell its US onshore wind farms.\\nUnder former chief executive, Bernard Looney, BP had been building its wind farm portfolio as part of an ambitious \\nstrategy to cut its hydrocarbon production by 40 per cent by 2030, reduce its emissions and those of its customers \\nby 35 to 40 per cent by the end of this decade and become a \\\"net zero\\\"-emissions company by 2050.\\nLast year it started backing away from those commitments, saying it would cut production by only 25 per cent by \\n2030 and its emissions by 20 to 30 per cent.\\nThis year, under a new chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, it now appears even those reduced targets are being \\nwound back.\\nIt's not just BP.\\nShell has scaled back its investment in renewables, including offshore wind and hydrogen; it has reduced its \\nemissions' intensity targets and it has abandoned its objective of becoming the world's largest electricity company. \\nNorway's energy giant, Equinor, has also announced plans to shrink its renewable energy division.\\nAs they retreat from their push into renewable energy and downgrade their ambitions to build major exposures to \\nelectricity generation, the UK and European oil companies are refocusing on their traditional oil and gas \\nbusinesses.\\nWhere previously they planned to cap or reduce their production, now they are planning and investing to increase it.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nBig Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare\\nLast year BP raised its forecast of oil equivalent production from 1.5 billion barrels a day by 2030 to 2 million \\nbarrels a day, planning to invest $US8 billion ($12.6 billion) more than previously budgeted on new oil and gas \\ninvestments. Since Auchincloss became CEO, that focus on lifting hydrocarbon production has intensified.\\nThe commercial logic in what they are doing is clear. BP generates returns of 15 to 20 per cent on its fossil fuel \\ninvestments but only 6 to 8 per cent from its renewable assets, with wind's returns inferior to solar's.\\nPloughing billions each year into wind, solar and hydrogen dilutes the overall returns on capital and reduces the \\nreturns to shareholders, making them most unhappy. Having invested about $US18 billion over the past five years \\nin lower-returning renewables between them, BP and Shell investors have become increasingly unhappy.\\nMoreover, the UK and European energy majors are always compared with their US counterparts.\\nExxon and Chevron haven't been anywhere near as committed to lowering the carbon intensity of their portfolios as \\ntheir transatlantic rivals. The US majors were committed to the \\\"drill, baby, drill\\\" mantra before Donald Trump and \\nsaw that reflected in their share price relativities with their UK and European counterparts.\\nWhere, over the past five years, Exxon's share price has risen 54 per cent and Chevron's 23 per cent, BP's has \\nfallen 22 per cent and Shell's more than 6 per cent. That kind of disparity in performance tends to galvanise \\nshareholders, along with executives motivated by their remuneration.\\nBy moving its offshore wind assets into a joint venture vehicle and off its own balance sheet BP will keep an \\nexposure to wind but significantly reduce the amounts of capital devoted to it and the levels of debt supporting it.\\nBetween them, BP and JERA plan to spend up to $US5.8 billion on their combined portfolios (which includes the \\nproposed Blue Mackerel offshore wind farm in Bass Strait) by the end of 2030. With shared investment and non-\\nrecourse funding, BP's capital commitment will be modest relative to what it would otherwise have been.\\nBoth BP and Shell still seem committed to solar, which is less capital intensive than wind, but that won't help them \\nescape the criticism from climate activist groups and ESG (environmental, social and governance) investors, who \\nare particularly vocal and litigious in Europe and the UK.\\nThe problem, of course, is that the companies can't satisfy both constituencies and in a contest between emissions \\nand returns is one that ultimately shareholders will always win.\\nWith Trump about to return to the White House and open up US federal lands to more drilling for oil and gas, and \\nthe incoming Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, having a \\\"3-3-3\\\" plan that includes lifting US energy production by \\nthree million barrels of oil equivalent a day, the contrast between the environment for the US producers and their \\ncompetitors elsewhere will only become starker and the pressure from shareholders on companies like BP and \\nShell will only intensify.\\nTrump also plans to remove the generous 10-year tax credits for renewables within Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction \\nAct, which, if he is successful, would make the returns from investment in US renewables even less competitive \\nwith those from fossil fuels.\\nAny increase in US oil production would add to the existing glut in the oil market and depress prices that are \\nalready under pressure, despite the withdrawal of about six million barrels a day of supply by the OPEC+ cartel.\\nThe lower prices being experienced now and likely to continue into at least the first half of next year, however, \\naren't an argument for the oil majors to invest in renewables.\\nReturns from oil and gas will still be superior to those from renewables and, if oil and gas prices and profits are \\nunder pressure, there will be even more of an incentive to invest only in the highest-returning assets.\\nThose who invest purely in renewables appear unconcerned about the gradual withdrawal of the oil majors who \\ngatecrashed their sector and, seeking to gain scale rapidly, drove up the costs of developing greenfields projects.Page 3 of 3\\nBig Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare\\nPloughing billions each year into wind, solar and hydrogen dilutes the overall returns on capital and reduces the \\nreturns to shareholders, making them most unhappy.\\nThere are a lot of environmentally-sensitive and patient investment funds available from sources other than the oil \\nmajors that are willing to trade off returns for their convictions and/or consistent long-term returns, so losing some \\ninvestment from the oil companies shouldn't retard renewables developments.\\nIt was always going to be difficult for BP and Shell to try to produce a balance of their traditional oil and gas \\nbusinesses and renewable energy portfolios while satisfying both financially-motivated and ESG-driven investors.\\nIt has been particularly difficult for the UK and Europeans, with their lower returns but better environmental \\ncredentials, to attract investors in the US. There's been a backlash against ESG investing in the US where, \\nbecause there is no significant stigma associated with the oil and gas industry, valuation metrics tend to be higher.\\nIf BP and Shell want better access to those more attractive metrics, improved share price performances and \\naccess to cheaper capital, they have no realistic option but to shed, and invest less in, low-returning assets.

The first gas production is expected in 2026, as phase 1 was launched in 2020,  Reuters reported.\\n\\\"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify \\nArrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast,\\\" Arrow CEO Zhengxin Peng said.\\nThe announcement by Arrow Energy comes in the wake of calls for more investment to increase the local energy \\nsupply. Australia's energy market operator and competition watchdog, too, had urged oil and gas companies to \\ninvest more to increase the supply of energy.\\n\\\"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to \\nmarket,\\\"  Energy Connects quoted Zo Yujnovich, Integrated Gas and Upstream Director at Shell. \\\"QCLNG marked \\nits 1000th cargo at the end of last year, reflecting its significance as a gas supplier for Australia and the region. This \\ninvestment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a lower emissions \\nalternative to options like coal.\\\"\\nThe gas will flow to the Shell-operated QCLNG liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility on Curtis Island, near \\nGladstone. It is expected to  meet the requirements of long-term contracts and domestic market, as part of a 27-\\nyear agreement between Arrow Energy and QGC.\\nLink to the original story.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nArrow Energy To Develop Phase 2 Of Surat Coal Gas Project In Australia\\nNotes\\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \\\"Newstex \\nAuthoritative Content\\\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its \\nre-distributors.

The Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) is depicted neutrally, primarily as a regulatory body issuing warnings about potential gas shortages and urging investment in new supply to stabilize the energy market. PetroChina, also portrayed neutrally, is consistently mentioned as a joint venture partner in Arrow Energy\u2019s Surat Gas Project expansion, with little independent focus on its role beyond its partnership with Shell. Overall, Chevron receives the most favorable coverage, emphasizing its financial strength and strategic positioning, while AEMO and PetroChina are framed more as functional entities within the broader energy landscape.",
