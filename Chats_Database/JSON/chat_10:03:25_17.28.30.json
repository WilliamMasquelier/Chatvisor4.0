The one sentence description should highlight in which regards does the article relate to Ramelius Resources. Your output should only consist of that one sentence.\nThis one sentence should highlight the main topic or theme of the article from the perspective of Ramelius Resources. We are interested about what is said on Ramelius Resources in the article and on this overall topic or industry: Mining, exploration and drilling of gold in the Australia market.\n\nHere is the article: Page 1 of 2\nNorthern Star may sell Carosue Dam to Ramelius Resources - DATA ROOM\nNorthern Star may sell Carosue Dam to Ramelius Resources - DATA ROOM\nThe Australian\nDecember 13, 2024 Friday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 14\nLength: 359 words\nByline: EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER\nBody\nFollowing Northern Star's $5bn buyout of De Grey Mining, speculation is mounting that it may move to sell its \nCarosue Dam Operations to Ramelius Resources.\nCarosue Dam is 120km northeast of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia and produces 248,000 ounces of gold \nannually.\nMarket sources estimate a price tag of about $800m.\nSources believe it would be a valuable addition for Ramelius Resources and strategic for its Rebecca-Roe project, \n150km east of Kalgoorlie.\nRamelius released a pre-feasibility study for Rebecca-Roe on Thursday. RBC analysts at RBC said it came in \nbelow expectations with a net present value of $332m, with higher costs and a shorter than expected mine life.\nIt will produce about 130,000 ounces per annum.\nBut others in the market say that the findings are largely in line with what many had been anticipating.\nRBC analysts say that while the project fell below its expectations, it still offers a path for Ramelius to develop a \nsecond production hub, following the Edna May closure in the 2025 financial year.\nSources believe that Northern Star would probably be willing to part with Carosue Dam if offered the right price for \nthe asset.\nIts merger with gold miner Saracen Mineral Holdings meant it gained full control of the Super Pit gold mine, which \nwas its key objective, and it now has a very large mill in the Kalgoorlie district.\nSo does it really need the far smaller processing facilities of Carosue Dam? Northern Star's mill expansion is well \nadvanced - 77 per cent of engineering and design is complete and 84 per cent of procurement contracts have been \nawarded.\nPage 2 of 2\nNorthern Star may sell Carosue Dam to Ramelius Resources - DATA ROOM\nConstruction is on schedule.\nRamelius is developing both the Rebecca-Roe project and the Cue Gold Project, 35km north of Mt Magnet, after \nbuying Apollo Consolidated in 2022 and Musgrave Minerals the following year.\nIt owns and operates two production and processing hubs at Mt Magnet and Edna May, in Western Australia.\nRamelius purchased a 8.9 per cent stake in Spartan Resources in June. It then increased its holding to 18.3 per \ncent. It is also known to have been eyeing up other targets at a time when it is cashed up, with the gold price \nsurging to record highs this year.\nLoad-Date: December 12, 2024\nEnd of Document\n            ",
