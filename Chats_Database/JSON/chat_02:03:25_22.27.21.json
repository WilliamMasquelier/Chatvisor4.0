Construction delays at its onshore substation are the key cause.\nMr Nipper said: \u201cDespite encouraging progress on our US offshore wind project, Revolution Wind, the construction \nof the onshore substation for the project has been delayed. This means that we have pushed the commercial \noperation date from 2025 into 2026, which led to an impairment.\n\u201cThis is, of course, unsatisfactory.\u201d\nThe company reported a pre-tax profit of 3.9bn kroner, up from 2.4bn kroner in the same period last year, and net \nprofits of 931m kroner.\nTancrede Fulop, senior equity analyst at Morningstar said \u00d8rsted had outperformed expectations especially in \noffshore wind, but the impairments \u201cunderscore the impact of project delays\u201d.\n\u00d8rsted\u2019s cuts follow similar moves by other energy majors in scaling back renewable energy projects.\nLast month, Shell halted construction of a new plant in Rotterdam meant to convert waste into jet fuel and biodiesel, \nwarning that market conditions were not right.\nLoad-Date: August 15, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nBased on the content of the article, choose the most appropriate category from the following list: ['Financial Challenges and Strategic Adjustments', 'Offshore Wind Project Developments and Setbacks', 'Leadership Changes and Corporate Restructuring', 'Market Exits, Divestments, and Investments', 'Technological Innovations and Sustainability Initiatives', 'Regulatory and Legal Challenges', 'Human Resources and Workforce Initiatives', 'Shifts in Renewable Energy Strategy']\nYour output should solely be the name of the category chosen and nothing else.\n            ",
