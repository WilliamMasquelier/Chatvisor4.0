It operates in the Mining, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: \"Yes\" or \"No\". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Fortescue based on the following criterion:\n\nCentrality: The article is considered relevant if Fortescue is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Fortescue.\n\nIf Fortescue is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.\n\nHere is the article you will be evaluating: Page 1 of 2\nFortescue green lights $4bn truck deal\nFortescue green lights $4bn truck deal\nThe Australian\nSeptember 26, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 787 words\nByline: CAMERON ENGLAND\nBody\nFortescue chairman Andrew Forrest has challenged the mining sector to follow his company's lead after signing a \n\"jaw-dropping\" $US2.8bn ($4.06bn) deal with German company Liebherr, which will convert two-thirds of the \ncompany's mining fleet to zero-emissions battery technology over the next couple of years.\nCore to the deal is Fortescue-developed fast-charging technology which will robotically deploy a 6MW charger, \nwhich can charge a haul truck in 30 minutes, providing six hours of run time.\nDr Forrest, speaking to The Australian from the MINExpo event in Las Vegas, said the deal was likely close to, if \nnot the, largest single mining equipment deal in Australian mining history.\n\"We invite all companies in the mining, heavy industry and haulage sectors to join us,\" he said. \"The solutions are \nthere, and the missing ingredient is leadership.\n\"The time of others persuading you that greenwashing is a better return to shareholders and your community is \nover.\" Dr Forrest said the size of the deal was \"jaw-dropping\".\n\"It really does point the way for the future of the mining industry going zero emissions, and it points the way for \nheavy industry running out of excuses,\" he said.\n\"If these two companies are issuing their largest agreements ever, and it's 100 per cent zero emissions, then that \ntells you which way heavy industry, particularly the mining industry, is going. This is where the smart end of town is \ngoing. This is where we're leading, and we're doing it for shareholders.\" Under the deal with Liebherr, Fortescue \nwill buy 360 autonomous, battery-electric trucks, 55 electric excavators and 60 battery-powered dozers. The deal is \nan expansion of an agreement struck between the two companies in 2022, for 120 haul trucks.\nFortescue developed the battery technology to be used in the haul trucks and jointly developed the Automated \nHaulage Solution, with the trucks employing a robotic charging system which will avoid issues such as having to \nqueue machines for charging.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue green lights $4bn truck deal\n\"All of the trucks in this fleet will ultimately be equipped with a zero-emission battery power system developed by \nFortescue Zero and the jointly developed Autonomous Haulage Solution - both of which were built to be scalable \nso they can be retrofitted on to existing Liebherr haul trucks,\" Fortescue said. \"This means that trucks purchased \ntoday are already future-proofed for tomorrow.\n\"The AHS, which was co-developed using both companies' expertise, also includes an energy management system \nthat co-ordinates the static recharge assignments for the trucks and ensures the charger is fully utilised without \ncausing queuing on site.\n\"Equipped with robotic connection options, the charger can provide up to 6MW of power and charge the current \nbattery-electric T 264 in 30 minutes.\" The new T 264 trucks will begin onsite validation at Fortescue's Pilbara \noperations at the end of 2025, the company said.\n\"The approximately 360-strong T 264 truck fleet has already begun arriving to Fortescue's Western Australian \noperations, with the first trucks delivered to Fortescue's Eliwana mine in October 2023,\" the company said. \"The \ninitial 240-tonne capacity trucks will be converted to zero-emission powertrains before 2030.\n\"However, most of the fleet will be supplied in battery-electric configuration from first arrival.\" Four autonomous \ntrucks are in validation at Fortescue's testing site, the company said, with the first deployment of operational \nautonomous trucks expected in the first quarter of 2025.\n\"All T 264 trucks are arriving autonomy-ready and will be progressively deployed to autonomous operations across \nFortescue's sites,\" it said. \"Validation of the full autonomous battery-electric solution is expected to be complete in \nearly 2026.\" The new vehicles, once in operation, will represent about two-thirds of the current mining fleet at \nFortescue's operations.\nFortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said the charging solution, which had its genesis in technology \ndeveloped by Fortescue for electric car racing, was the \"disruptive technology\".\n\"A year ago, nobody would have even thought about a 6MW charger,\" he said. \"And in fact, we've got a concept \ncalled boost charging in the works, which could bring the current charging time of minutes down to seconds, and \nthat will unlock even further productivity increases.\n\"As it stands, the first-generation charger and power system combination is already a better offering than its diesel \nequivalent in the market.\" Other companies will also be able to buy the technology, with Mr Otranto saying there \nwas already strong interest at the MINExpo event. The deal also includes the supply of 55 R 9400 E electric \nexcavators, while a zero-emissions dozer is under development.\nLoad-Date: September 25, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nYour response should be based on whether the article meets the relevance criteria for Fortescue.\nYour output should only be \"Yes\" or \"No\", based on your assessment.
