Energy users want cheap energy and hydrogen \nis not cheap. Having scoured the world for subsidies and customers, Forrest has learnt that any technological \nadvance to lower costs will be hard won.\nHe has instead launched a sweeping restructure of Fortescue with as many as 700 jobs going and the company's \ngoal of producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030 has been shelved. This leaves Fortescue, a \ncompany with one of the nation's largest carbon emissions footprints, looking for other ways to salve its eco-\nconscience. But it leaves the federal government with a much bigger hole to fill.\nBillions of public subsidy dollars are being directed towards getting hydrogen production down to a reasonable \nprice. In the Albanese government's mind, it is the nation's route to being a renewable energy superpower.\nIn the latest sign of what hydrogen means for the federal government, it has put forward draft plans that, unlike Joe \nBiden's hydrogen subsidy scheme, will allow green hydrogen producers to claim a credit for hydrogen that is \nactually made with fossil fuels.\nThe US refusal to count gas-fired hydrogen might explain why among the projects shelved as part of Fortescue's \nrestructure is a hydrogen play in the US state of Washington.\nFortescue has spent hundreds of millions of dollars examining potential green hydrogen and ammonia sites across \nthe world, but has so far delivered just three investment decisions across the would-be green energy portfolio. One \nof these is a small-scale pilot plant in Gladstone, Queensland.\nWithout hydrogen, Labor's renewables-only transition is left looking for a reliable long-term fuel that can firm the grid \nwhen wind and solar fail to produce. Grid-scale batteries will get you only so far.\nPage 2 of 2\nMinister left high and dry by sudden change of direction\nHydro is the obvious answer, but look at Snowy 2.0. On Wednesday, Energy Minister Chris Bowen remained full \nbore on a renewables-only plan. Without hydrogen, Labor has little choice but to go back to gas, something he \nironically described as a life insurance policy, and something he and those inside the energy industry know to be \ntrue.\nThe federal government has a lot of work to do persuading states to lift their bans on gas exploration and \ndevelopment.\nGas is also the clash of ideology that the Greens have been most anxious to have with Labor. The big picture is a \nre-elected Donald Trump as US president will reinvigorate the global energy picture as he strives to restore US \nenergy independence. Forrest has shown that private capital can quickly change course. Government must show it \ncan do so as well.\nLoad-Date: July 17, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nQuotes Table:\n| Andrew Forrest | Mining billionaire, founder of Fortescue | \"Forrest has admitted what should have been obvious from the start.
