The future of green hydrogen in \nAustralia explained\nThe Guardian (London)\nJuly 19, 2024 Friday 4:00 PM GMT\nCopyright 2024 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc. All Rights Reserved\nSection: ENVIRONMENT; Version:1\nLength: 1193 words\nByline: Peter Hannam\nHighlight: Fortescue announced 700 job cuts this week in a bid to remain \u2018lean\u2019. So what does it mean for green \nhydrogen?Get our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast\nBody\nThe iron ore billionaire Andrew Forrest has long vowed to transform Australia\u2019s energy landscape with green \nhydrogen made from renewable energy, even turning up to 2023\u2019s Cop28 in a ship dubbed the \u201cGreen Pioneer\u201d. \nBut pundits wondered whether the green dream had come crashing down to reality after Fortescue announced this \nweek  that it was cutting 700 jobs across its businesses globally as it seeks to remain \u201clean\u201d, with an unspecific \nnumber going in its energy unit.\nHere we look at the emerging green hydrogen industry and the headwinds \u2013 and tailwinds \u2013 it faces.\n                   What is green hydrogen?                   \nHydrogen, as fans of the periodic table recall, is the simplest element and most abundant in the universe. It makes \nup about 73% of the sun\u2019s mass and one-tenth of yours.\nRefineries use hydrogen to crack heavy oil into petrol and diesel, and to make ammonia for fertiliser. It is also an \nimportant energy store that might one day displace gas or other fossil fuels, used for everything from power \ngeneration to metal production and heavy transport.\nBut hydrogen usually needs to be split from other elements and that takes energy. According to the International \nEnergy Agency, hydrogen production and use was linked to 900m tonnes of C02 emissions in 2022, or about twice \nthat of Australia\u2019s total.\nThe source of the energy used to split hydrogen is categorised into up to a dozen colours. \nPage 2 of 3\nIs Andrew Forrest\u2019s energy dream in peril? The future of green hydrogen in Australia explained\nCSIRO highlights a few,  with green hydrogen extracted without greenhouse gas emissions, usually via \nelectrolysers that are powered by wind, solar or hydro.\nSo-called blue hydrogen uses steam to separate hydrogen from natural gas, with resulting emissions sequestered. \nIf they aren\u2019t, it\u2019s grey hydrogen. If coal is used (as the Japanese have been eyeing in Victoria  ), it\u2019s brown or black, \ndepending on the type of coal. There\u2019s also \u201cpink hydrogen\u201d if nuclear power is the energy source.\n                   Is Fortescue quitting the green hydrogen scene?                   \nFortescue said it \u201cremains resolute in its commitment to be the world\u2019s leading green technology, energy and \nmetals company with a laser focus on achieving Real Zero [ by cutting 90%  of emissions] by 2030\u201d.\nThe cost cuts relate to combining the metals and energy divisions into one \u201cto simplify its structure, remove \nduplication and deliver cost efficiencies\u201d.\n\u201cWe are by no means winding back on our commitment to green hydrogen,\u201d Forrest said in a statement provided to \nGuardian Australia. \u201cIn fact, we are doing all we can to back green hydrogen in Australia by investing in renewable \nenergy and hydrogen technology every single day.\n\u201cThe price of power remains a challenge in Australia, and this has been caused by fossil fuels and the subsidies \nprovided for fossil fuels.\u201d \nAccording to the investment bank UBS, Fortescue\u2019s proposed green ammonia plant  at Queensland\u2019s Gibson \nIsland needs electricity to cost $20-$30 per megawatt hour to be viable but recent long-term contracts for large wind \nand solar farms are offering $70-$90 per MWh power.\nThose price gaps must close if hopes for \u201cgreen steel\u201d or other green metals that use hydrogen are to be realised.\nAGL Energy, meanwhile, confirmed on Friday that Fortescue was ending plans to produce hydrogen at the site of \nits defunct Liddell coal-fired power station. \u201cAGL remains committed to exploring options to produce green hydrogen \nand future fuels at the Hunter [Valley] site in the future if economically feasible,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nUBS has a \u201csell\u201d call on Fortescue shares, predicting they have at least another 10% to fall (building on the 25%-\nplus fall in 2024 so far). A big reason for the dip is falling iron ore prices as China\u2019s demand cools \u2013 unrelated to \nFortescue\u2019s hydrogen hopes.\n                   What are governments doing?                   \nThe government will offer a tax credit to subsidise green hydrogen as part of its Future Made in Australia  scheme. \nProducers will receive a $2/kg \u201cincentive\u201d for up to 10 years \u2013 between mid-2027 and mid-2040 \u2013 for projects \nreaching final investment signoff by 2030.\nStates, too, are chipping in. South Australia, for instance, has a $500m hydrogen jobs plan  that includes $100m \nstate and federal support for the Port Bonython Hydrogen Hub  that aims to produce green hydrogen-related \nexports from 2030.\nNew South Wales, meanwhile, will offer as much as $3bn to lure similar ventures to that state, with a 2030 \u201cstretch \ntarget\u201d of 111,000 tonnes a year of green hydrogen output and 700 megawatts of electrolyser capacity.\nBut other nations are spending much more. The US\u2019s inflation reduction act may end up topping $1UStn ($A1.5tn) \nfor decarbonising programs, including hydrogen and electric vehicles among others.\nFortescue cuts were likely related to missing out on being shortlisted for the first $2bn  of the $4bn federal \ngovernment\u2019s \u201chydrogen headstart\u201d scheme, one source added.\n                   What does the hydrogen industry think?                   Page 3 of 3\nIs Andrew Forrest\u2019s energy dream in peril? The future of green hydrogen in Australia explained\nInsiders say much climate action hinges on \u201ccost-effective\u201d renewable energy, not just the green hydrogen industry.\nSo-called blue hydrogen might be a near-term solution to make the product cheap enough to foster greater demand \nbut \u201cit\u2019s better for the planet if we went straight to green\u201d, one source said.\nFiona Simon, chief executive of the Australian Hydrogen Council, said Fortescue\u2019s move was \u201cless about hydrogen \nthan it is about one company and how it\u2019s sought to reassess its priorities\u201d.\nThat said, \u201cwe\u2019ve all known that hydrogen was difficult, and in the last two or three years [experience has shown] \nthat is harder than we thought\u201d, Simon said. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t signal the death of hydrogen.\u201d\nScaling up the production of electrolysers that use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen will help drive \ndown costs, she said.\nBy some estimates, hydrogen costs would need to drop to about $US2/kg ($A3/kg) to be competitive. One recent \nUS government study  puts present costs at $US12 to $16/kg when delivery costs are included.\n                   What next?                   \nThe International Energy Agency estimates global hydrogen demand reached 95m tonnes in 2022, rising about 3% \nthat year. Low-emissions sources of the fuel accounted for just 0.7% of demand.\nMinh Le, global head of hydrogen for analysts Rystad Energy, said that \u201cas things stand at the moment it will be \nvery challenging, if not almost impossible to reach $2 [US] for green hydrogen\u201d.\nStill, \u201cthe momentum of hydrogen development remains strong\u201d, with \u201cmany major auctions in key regions\u201d coming \nthrough this year in Europe, Japan and elsewhere, he said.\nFalling battery costs add to the competitive pressures in areas such as transport. At 14 times lighter than air, \nhydrogen is leaky \u2013 with safety issues  \u2013 and not yet barbecue ready. \nRystad Energy\u2019s Nigel Rambhujun said \u201ca lot more work can be done on demand-side policies to incentivise \npotential end-users and reduce the green premium associated with clean hydrogen\u201d with the next 6-12 months \n\u201ccritical\u201d for the sector in Australia.\n\u201cWithout significant government support, green hydrogen will continue to be the most expensive hydrogen colour.\u201d\nLoad-Date: July 19, 2024\nEnd of Document\n        ",
