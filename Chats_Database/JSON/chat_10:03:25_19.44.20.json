Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using \"-\".\n\nInput:\n| Andrew Forrest | CEO of Fortescue | \"I just hope you're enjoying it, the interview. Oh, please enjoy it. You've come a long way to not have a good time!\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | CEO of Fortescue | \"I mean [you] might be assassinating Andrew. He's fair game. But can we at least mention what a fantastic team the other twenty-odd-thousand people are?\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | CEO of Fortescue | \"It's the most successful magnetite project in the region. They're shooting the lights out.\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | CEO of Fortescue | \"I'm not talking about China!\" | N.A. |\n| Andrew Forrest | CEO of Fortescue | \"That was just the Chinese authorities,\" he jokes. The room chortles. \"Checking I'm saying the same thing here as in Beijing.\" | N.A. |\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.\n2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.\n3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.\n4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Fortescue.\n5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.\n6. If no lines represent real people, return \"None\".\n7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Fortescue or are directly involved with the company.\n8. Remove all rows which are only containing the \"-\" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.\n9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines\n\nPlease provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:\n        ",
