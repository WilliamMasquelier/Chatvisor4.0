Overall, the company employs 6,000 people in the UK.\nThe company has other profitable divisions, including producing tech for gas generation and power grids.\nHowever, its business has struggled in the past year as a result of its troubled wind division, as faults in its 4X and \n5X onshore wind turbine models led to them being taken off the market.\nLoad-Date: February 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n\nOrganization Context: Discussed in relation to its profitability and challenges in the UK wind industry, including quality issues with onshore wind turbines.\n\nDetermine if the portrayal of Siemens Energy is \"Positive\", \"Neutral\", or \"Negative\" in the article.\nOutput ONLY ONE of these three words and nothing else.\n",
