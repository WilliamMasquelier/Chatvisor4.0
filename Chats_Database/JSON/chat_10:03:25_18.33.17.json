However, many roads remain closed and remote \ncommunities and cattle stations have been hard hit by flooding.\nRio was able to get iron ore carriers back into the ports of Cape Lambert and Dampier late on Saturday and there \nare no indications of damage to its 2000km-long rail network.\nHowever, the latest disruption means Rio's port operations have been out of action for almost two weeks since late \nJanuary.\nRio shipped 328.6 million -tonnes of iron ore from its Pilbara ports in 2024, in line with production guidance, which \nremains unchanged for 2025 despite its recent setbacks.\nCyclone Zelia crossed the Pilbara coast northeast of Port Hedland on Friday and weakened into a tropical low that \ndumped heavy rain on the minerals-rich but sparsely populated Pilbara region.\nThe cyclone's eventual path took it away from a direct hit on Port Hedland or Rio's ports, and also spared the LNG \nindustry from major damage.\nBHP said it mines, rail and infrastructure at Port Hedland had fared better than expected as it hunkered down for \nCyclone Zelia.\n\"The experience of our teams in managing cyclones in the Pilbara meant we were well prepared,\" a spokesperson \nsaid. \"Our teams are now progressively returning to site, with recovery and ramp-up operations underway.\" \nFortescue said all non-essential travel to its mines remained suspended and that all its workers on the ground were \nsafe.\nPage 2 of 2\nPilbara miners dodge worst of cyclone\n\"While some of our operations have experienced temporary disruptions, we are working to resume normal activities \nas quickly and safely as possible,\" a Fortescue spokesperson said.\nBHP is due to hand down its first half results on Tuesday, followed by Rio's full-year results on Wednesday and \nFortescue's first- half numbers on Thursday.\nLithium miner Pilbara Minerals, which reports first-half results on Thursday, appears to have dodged a bullet after \nearly modelling showed Cyclone Zelia tracking straight at its Pilgangoora mine. \"Initial assessments indicate no \nmaterial damage to our operation, and our on-site team continue to conduct infrastructure checks,\" a spokesman \nsaid.\nPilbara Minerals has offered support to surrounding communities, including Strelley and Warralong, caught up in \nflooding and other fallout from the cyclone.\nMineral Resources shut down operations at it Wodgina lithium mine and flew non-essential staff to Perth in advance \nof the cyclone.\nIt said initial assessments indicated minimal impact at Wodgina with workers returning to site.\nCyclone Zelia hit the Pilbara with Rio still carrying out repair work in the wake of Cyclone Sean, which flooded key \nparts of its operations in January and also hit BHP, Fortescue and MinRes.\nEven before the latest storm, Rio admitted first-quarter shipments would be affected by the impact of Cyclone Sean, \nand subsequent closures from Cyclone Taliah and Cyclone Vince.\nThe most northern of Rio's 17 mines in the Pilbara, including Gudai-Darri, appear to have copped the brunt of the \nlatest downpour and may still have water sitting in the bottom of pits.\nThe mines would normally be better prepared to cope with cyclone disruption but they were soaked by heavy \nrainfall in the December quarter, forcing Rio to draw down on stockpiles.

On Monday the Greens \nsenator called for a \"full and frank inquiry\" into Creative Australia's decision to withdraw its selection of Khaled \nSabsabi as Australia's artist representative to the Venice Biennale 2026.\nMany of you will never have heard of Sabsabi, or the Venice Biennale, or Creative Australia, an agency rat-holed in \nthe nether reaches of government and armed with wheelbarrows of taxpayer slush. Yes, some of you might even \nhave thrown your iPads across the room at the temerity of our suggestion that a Greens senator might actually be \nright about something. Because they never are.\nBut it's true, there really should be an inquiry into Sabsabi's humiliating board retraction and it should also probe the \nideological capture that's hijacked decision-making at Creative Australia.\nThe agency's CEO, Adrian Collette, will appear before a Senate Estimates hearing next week to talk more about \nthat.\nIn the meantime, the fallout from this affair keeps expanding. Staff have walked out of Creative Australia offices. \nArtists have huffed and torn their smocks and signed petitions in protest (which never, ever happens). Lindy Lee \nresigned from the Creative Australia board despite reiterating her support for Sabsabi to be nixxed in her exit letter - \na decision in which she participated, after all.\nAnd then there's Simon Mordant, co-chairman of Luminis Partners, who resigned as a biennale ambassador and \ntold The Guardian that he'd pulled a \"significant\" funding pledge for the project. We hear it was $40,000, roughly \nwhat Simon spends on Cohiba's and Brunello each month at his villa in Italy. His business partner Ron Malek spent \nthe weekend shaking his head in embarrassment at Mordant's unalloyed sanctimony.\n\"It's outrageous,\" Mordant wrote of the Sabsabi decision on Instagram. \"I have resigned as an Ambassador to the \nnow cancelled project and withdrawn my financial support - this situation is unacceptable. Maybe the Pavilion \nshould remain empty in solidarity with Khaled. A very dark day for Australia and the Arts.\" Mordant, who is Jewish, \nhasn't posted any messages of solidarity for Jewish artists who've been doxxed, abandoned and relentlessly \nPage 2 of 3\nFallout over CA decision continues\nexcluded since the October 7 massacres. Not a word from Mordant until Monday when he suddenly sought to \nclarify his support for Sabsabi - an artist who boycotted the 2022 Sydney Festival because the organisers received \n$20,000 of Israeli funding to stage an Israeli choreography display - and posted a whimpering statement saying he \nwould never support an artist \"that glorifies terrorism, racism or antisemitism\".\n\"I think everybody has to be very careful about the insidious rise of racism and anti-Semitism which has become \nparticularly prevalent in Australia,\" Mordant said. Well Simon, when even Sophie McNeill is lavishing you with \npraise and thanking you for your \"leadership\", as she did online, it might be time for a walk through the hall of \nmirrors.\nMikala Tai was the other prominent figure to walk out of Creative Australia \"in support of Sabsabi and curator \nMichael Dagostino\", as she wrote on Instagram.\nSabsabi is friendly with Tai. When Creative Australia announced his selection as the Venice Biennale \nrepresentative, Tai posted a video of them celebrating.\nJoining them in that video was Creative Australia program manager Tahmina Maskinyar, who resigned alongside \nTai, and whose posts online have included calls for the eradication of Israel (\"From the river to the sea ...\") and \n\"intifada until victory\", which Liberal senator Sarah Henderson called \"grossly offensive anti-Semitic content\".\nCreative Australia said these sentiments didn't breach the agency's code of conduct.\nNothing wrong with a bit of dancing, and nothing wrong with members of Sabsabi's artist group, Eleven Collective, \nbeing friendly with Tai. It is a fact, however, that some of these people have sat on Creative Australia panels that \nadjudicated the provision of taxpayer-funded grants, or been grant recipients themselves.\nLike Shireen Taweel, who we mentioned last week - she's affiliated with Tai and received Creative Australia grants \nof $45,200 in 2023 and $32,500 in 2022; Anna Louise Richardson, the wife of artist Abdul-Rahman Abdullah, a \npanel assessor, received $31,729 in March 2021; Amrita Hepi received $35,715 in 2023; and Sabsabi was awarded \nthree grants of $8500, $5000 and $7680 between March 2022 and October 2023 (he also received much larger \ngrants in 2018, 2019 and 2020, prior to Tai taking up work at Creative Australia).\nWe're not suggesting any of this is evidence of a conflict, nor that Tai had any involvement in furnishing these \ngrants; plus, within Australia's shallow artist pool, decision-making will inevitably involve people who wind up \nknowing each other.\nBut wrinkles remain. In the video of Sabsabi dancing, Abdullah left behind a comment that drew our attention: \"I \nlove everything about today's announcement. Thank you MT!!!!\" It would be telling to discover what role, if any, Tai \nmight have played in the backing of Sabsabi during discussions of the Biennale. One for next week's senate \nestimates hearing to tease out.\nOngoing process It's been six months since Andrew Forrest's Fortescue bowed to the inevitable and wound back \nthe exponential growth of its green energy hiring, sacking as many as 700 staff in the process. But Margin Call \nhears Fortescue staff have been attending a fresh round of leaving parties, as the company again hacks away at \nits management ranks.\nThe latest to go is general manager of community and government engagement, Sasha Pendal - a well known \nfigure in Perth business circles, not least for her role on the board of the hapless Fremantle Dockers football club.\nPendal's departure is said to be amicable, but appears part of another round of redundancies among senior \nmanagers.\nUnder the turmoil caused by Fortescue's pivot to green energy, the company somehow managed to insert an \nentire new level of management - the number of general managers at Fortescue blew out from 30-odd a few years \nago to as many as 130 in 2024.Page 3 of 3\nFallout over CA decision continues\nThe massive cull last year, when Fortescue announced it would lay off 700 staff, was supposed to reduce that total \nto around 40. The process is clearly still ongoing, with a few more departing in recent months, Pendal among them. \n(Not that all of last year's round of 700 came from Fortescue Energy, of course, as the company has been at pains \nto tell anyone that dares suggest it.) Also departing Fortescue this year is the former commercial manager for \nFortescue's hydrogen systems unit, Samantha Buchanan, who took a promotion to become a Shell Australia vice-\npresident in January.\nFortescue will deliver its first-half financial results on Thursday, and the company is (again) on a promise to update \nshareholders on the progress of its energy projects - primarily its Holmaneset green ammonia project in Norway \nand the Pecem green hydrogen development in Brazil.\nFair to say the going has been getting tougher in Europe, where Fortescue's plans are facing growing public \nopposition - not least because Holmaneset will draw down about 2 per cent of the total power produced in the \ncountry, at a promise of only a small number of jobs.\nAnd as for Fortescue's plans in the US, where it wants to build a hydrogen production plant to fuel trucks? That, \nlike every other renewable energy project in the country, is now prisoner to the new priorities of Donald Trump's \n\"drill, baby drill\" administration.\nBut also in need of a market update is the progress of Forrest's green fundraising arm, Fortescue Capital, which, \nsince its 2023 launch under the guidance of Robert Tichio, has built up a leadership group of no less than eight \nmanaging directors - all lured away from well-paid gigs at investment banks.\nFortescue Capital was launched with a mandate to attract external investment into the company's green energy \narm.\nOnly Fortescue's board really knows what the gang has been up to since, but Margin Call's quick math suggests \nFortescue is currently paying 2.7 managing directors for each green energy project that it still hasn't decided to \nbuild.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL The big changes continue at Andrew Forrest's Fortescue\nLoad-Date: February 17, 2025\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: The Australian\nAuthor: Yoni Bashan, Nick Evans\nDate: February 18, 2025\nTitle: Fallout over CA decision continues\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: WA: Community, Country 'ruptured' over iron ore mine damage\n## Media outlet: AAP Newsfeed\n### Author: Anonymous\n### Date: February 19, 2025\n\nPage 1 of 2\nWA:Community, Country 'ruptured' over iron ore mine damage\nWA:Community, Country 'ruptured' over iron ore mine damage\nAAP Newsfeed\nFebruary 19, 2025 Wednesday 4:54 PM AEST\nCopyright 2025 Australian Associated Press Pty.
