We are focused on Coogee because we saw the potential for it to become a near-term WA brownfields \nexploration success story. The results reveal new high-grade shoots outside the existing resource, both along \nstrike and below the existing open pit.\" \nThe current campaign represents the first systematic exploration at Coogee since Ramelius Resources pulled \nstumps in 2014. After mining a 70m open pit Ramelius recovered 147,400 tonnes of material at 4.7g/t gold for \n20,400 ounces of gold.\nThe ore was processed at the nearby carbon-in-leach Burbanks Mill with metallurgical recoveries at the time \nrunning to an impressive 96.4pc.\nThe latest drilling campaign has potentially provided a company-defining moment for Javelin, given it designed an \nexploration program to chase lookalike nearby deposits that may have gone unnoticed.\nThe same near-mine theory recently massively rewarded neighbouring ASX-listed Spectrum Metals and Spartan \nResources, both of which found multi-million-dollar gold deposits lurking just north of their old open pits.\nSpectrum Metals unearthed a new 355,000-ounce deposit five years ago at Penny North grading 13.8g/t just 300m \nfrom the old Penny West open pit. Spartan had similar luck jagging a 721,000-ounce gold resource at its Never \nNever project, with grades of 5.85g/t, also just 300m north of its old pit.\nWith phase one drilling out of the way, Javelin is gearing up for a second phase to test for extensions of the newly \nidentified shoots and chase a high-priority magnetic anomaly to the north, dubbed Bullseye, along with a similar \ntarget 1.5km to the west of the old pit.\nThe gold prices, currently trading close to all-time highs and just shy of US$2900 (A$4677) per ounce, are proving a \nhuge fillip for junior gold miners at the moment. With the improving prospects of a new discovery seemingly just \naround the corner and with easy access to third party milling facilities, Javelin now has the bit well and truly \nbetween its teeth.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

When we did \nour planning and set our guidance for this financial year, we were probably about $1000-$1200 (in Australian \ndollars) an ounce lower than what the spot price is today. That's how much it's moved in six or seven months \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \nwe would never have thought you would get a 25-30 per cent rise in the gold price in such a short time.\" The \nsurging gold price has lit a fire under ASX-listed gold stocks, which rose 7 per cent across the board last week and \nare up 55 per cent over the past year.\nNorthern Star, the biggest Australian-domiciled gold producer after Newmont's $26bn takeover of Newcrest in 2023, \nis up 18.5 per cent since the start of 2025.\nEvolution, the second biggest, is up 23.5 per cent to $5.97, with Bell Potter initiating coverage on Friday with a buy \nrating and 12-month target price of $6.65.\nPage 2 of 2\nSurging gold price stuns veterans\n\"Evolution is now passing its capital expenditure peak and we forecast increasing free cashflows, deleveraging of \nthe balance sheet and rising dividend distributions supported by Evolution's near-unhedged gold and copper price \nexposure,\" Bell Potter noted.\nOther ASX 200 gold stocks enjoying the ride are Gold Road, with its share price up about 80 per cent in 12 months, \nRamelius Resources (up 75 per cent), Perseus Mining (up 70 per cent) and US giant Newmont (up 41 per cent via \nits CHESS depositary interests listing).\nThe World Gold Council's 2024 gold demand trends report, released last week, says annual demand hit a record \nhigh of 4974 tonnes, driven by strong central bank buying and growth in investment demand. The combination of \nrecord high gold prices and volumes resulted in the highest ever total value of demand at $US382bn.\nThe council said central banks continued to buy gold at an eye-watering pace in 2024, with purchases exceeding \n1000 tonnes for the third year in a row.\nMarket analysts said Beijing had played a big role, with the market boosted by an increase in the People's Bank of \nChina's gold holdings and a move to allow insurance funds to invest in gold.\nMr Conway said another big factor had been the volumes traded in New York through the CME Group's Comex.\nJPMorgan Chase and other banks said in January that they would deliver gold bullion valued at billions of dollars \nagainst futures contracts due to expire in February as the threat of tariffs and a major trade war saw US investors \nmove to secure gold.\n\"We knew when (Mr Trump) was coming into office that it would have an impact on the gold price, and we expected \nit to be positive, depending on which way he decided to take his administration,\" Mr Conway said.\n\"It was either going to be a fair number of interest rate cuts through this year, or some of the other things that are \ngoing on around the tariffs and his intervention in terms of the geopolitical situation in Gaza and the Ukraine.\n\"The most interesting thing for me when you look over the past few weeks is the amount of gold that's been coming \ninto the Comex, the US exchange, as particularly retail people have been buying gold. It's like they want some \nprotection against the US dollar.\" On the potential rerating of mining stocks as more investors look for exposure to \ngold, Mr Conway said companies had to show the market the discipline needed to make the most of the higher gold \nprice.\n\"The thing for gold mining companies is to consistently deliver on your guidance and what you've told the market, \nand to have the discipline to put that money into the bank,\" he said.\n\"That's where you'll start to get a bit of that reward. If it's not seen to be flying through to the bank balance, I think \nthat's where you'll get the investors being a little bit more sceptical.\n\"That's been an absolute focus of us over the last 12 months because delivering to your plan in a rising metal price \nenvironment is a real positive, and we've seen that with our cashflow. \"What the shareholders want to see is that it's \nactually hitting the bank account.

The VanEck Gold Miners exchange-traded fund \nclimbed nearly 20 per cent in 2024 versus a 38 per cent rally for the gold price in Australian dollars.\nBut easing cost inflation that has plagued the mining sector for the last three years and an ongoing surge in prices \nhas seen the trend reverse course. VanEck's Gold Miners ETF is up 17 per cent already this year while the Aussie \ndollar spot price has climbed 6.3 per cent.\nLocal fund managers are bullish that gold has much further to run after the US dollar price climbed above $US2942 \nan ounce for the first time and the Australian dollar gold price breached $4500 an ounce.\nVictor Smorgon Partners' Resource Gold Fund returned a chunky 13.3 per cent in January and portfolio manager \nCameron Judd believes the valuations of ASX gold stocks still don't reflect the outlook for the yellow metal.\n\"Gold's performance in times of uncertainty or crisis could see it push towards $US3600,\" Mr Judd said. \"Despite \nthe strong gold price performance and fundamentals supporting further appreciation, gold miners are trading at \ndiscounted valuations on the ASX.\"\nWall Street's biggest banks believe a $US3000 price tag is imminent. Citi said it was possible within the next three \nmonths, while JPMorgan has a year-end target of $US3150. Bank of America said on Thursday that gold could \nreach $US3500 an ounce if investment demand rises 10 per cent this year.\nThe unprecedented surge in the gold price has been fuelled by investors seeking safe haven assets as US \nPresident Donald Trump unleashes aggressive trade and geopolitical policies. There are fears the president will \naccelerate inflation, forcing central banks to raise rates in a way that damages global growth.\nPage 2 of 2\nGold funds burst out of the blocks with rocketing returns; Commodities\nVictor Smorgon's top holdings include ASX-listed Vault Minerals and the world's largest gold miner, US-based \nNewmont, which recently acquired Newcrest. The fund also owns Australia's biggest gold miner, Northern Star, \nwhich agreed to buy rival De Grey in a $5 billion deal.\nMr Judd is also expecting international companies to make further plays for local miners and explorers given the \ncheaper valuations of ASX gold stocks, aided by a weak local currency.\n\"The lower Australian dollar makes gold miners even cheaper to buy as demand for the precious metal rises,\" Mr \nJudd said.\nCollins St Asset Management is also finally starting to reap the benefits of the catch-up in gold stocks after taking a \nstake in a basket of miners through its flagship value fund nearly two years ago. Founder Michael Goldberg said the \nopportunity was so large that the firm launched a special situations fund in March 2023 focused solely on gold \nstocks.\nHe believes the sector is finally ready to realise its potential after the Collins St Special Situation Fund surged 13 \nper cent, after fees, in January. It's up another 9 per cent so far in February.\n\"I think 2025 might be the year that we see a rapid catch-up,\" he said. \"Not relying on higher gold prices per se, but \njust a recognition by the market of the earnings potential for those companies, in particular the early-stage \nproducers.\"\nCollins St is focused on small and mid-cap companies, which have a lower cost of production, unhedged sales \nbooks and an ability to ramp up sales and output in the near term. This includes Catalyst Metals, Black Cat, \nWestgold Resources and Ramelius Resources.\nArgonaut's Global Gold Fund has also shown signs of a rebound following a disappointing 2024 when the portfolio \nreturned just 4.5 per cent net of fees. The fund stormed back in January with an 8.8 per cent return. Its top five \nholdings - Perseus Mining, Evolution Mining, Ora Banda, Ramelius Resources and Ora Gold - represented 55 per \ncent of the portfolio.\nLoad-Date: February 16, 2025\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Alex Gluyas\nDate: February 14, 2025\nTitle: Gold funds burst out of the blocks with rocketing returns; Commodities\n---\n\n\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article content below:\n# Title: Westgold shops gold mill acquired in $2.5b Karora merger; Street Talk\n## Media outlet: Australian Financial Review\n### Author: Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood, And Emma Rapaport\n### Date: February 19, 2025\n\nPage 1 of 2\nWestgold shops gold mill acquired in $2.5b Karora merger; Street Talk\nWestgold shops gold mill acquired in $2.5b Karora merger; Street Talk\nAustralian Financial Review\nFebruary 19, 2025 Wednesday\nPrint & First Editions\nCopyright 2025 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The $20 billion Northern Star owns the nearby land.\nSources said a deal could see Lakewood valued at between $70 million and $95 million, and would be welcomed \nby investors who've watched the shares fall almost 16 per cent this year. Unlike plenty of its listed peers, Westgold \nhasn't benefited from higher gold prices given issues around digesting the Karora acquisition.\nWestgold CEO Wayne Bramwell plans to use sale proceeds to increase capacity at its Higginsville mill from 1.6 \nmillion tonnes a year to well above the 2 million mark. A spokesperson declined to comment.\nThe up-for-grabs Lakewood was acquired by Karora to add an extra million tonnes in capacity for its flagship Beta \nHunt gold mine, on top of the 1.6 million tonnes capacity at its existing Higginsville mill, amid a production ramp-up.\nSources said since the merger, Westgold has narrowed its focus on fewer but bigger mills, which are fed by fewer \nbut bigger mines - in a bid to finetune its cost base against movements in gold pricing. This strategy, at its Beta \nHunt mine, means processing the ore via the lower-cost and larger Higginsville mill.\nProcessing a tonne of ore via the Lakewood mill costs $50, while Higginsville can handle the same amount for $30 \nor more. Should Westgold expand Higginsville as expected, this cost could be brought down to the $20 range, the \nsources said.\nPage 2 of 2\nWestgold shops gold mill acquired in $2.5b Karora merger; Street Talk\nThe mooted deal comes after Westgold and rival Ramelius Resources locked horns last year over Karora, as \nrevealed by Street Talk. The stoush ended when the $3 billion Ramelius decided to walk away, while Westgold \nprogressed and took the keys to Karora in August. But the proceedings also outed the fact that Ramelius had \napproached Westgold with a merger proposal but was knocked back.\nA fortnight ago, Westgold shares tanked after the miner cut its 2025 production guidance by as much as one-fifth \nand warned of higher costs after paying big for Karora. It said it would produce between 330,000 ounces and \n350,000 ounces this financial year, down from its previous forecast of between 400,000 ounces and 420,000 \nounces. Costs were also expected to be higher, up from a range of $2000 to $2300 per ounce to $2400 to $2600. \nThe miner attributed the production cuts to teething problems in production at its two main mines Beta Hunt near \nKambalda, and Bluebird-South Junction near Meekatharra.\nLoad-Date: February 21, 2025\nEnd of Document\n---\nHere are the metadata and reference of the article above:\nMedia outlet: Australian Financial Review\nAuthor: Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood, And Emma Rapaport\nDate: February 19, 2025\nTitle: Westgold shops gold mill acquired in $2.5b Karora merger; Street Talk\n---.",
