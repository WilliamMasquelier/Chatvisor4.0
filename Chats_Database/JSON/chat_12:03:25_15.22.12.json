It's a remarkable rise for the co-founder of the semiconductor company, who was ranked 128th with a net \\nworth of $US13.5 billion as recently as early last year.\\nNvidia surged 16 per cent to a record high on Thursday in New York, adding about $US277 billion in market value. \\nThat was the biggest single-session increase in market history, beating Meta's $US197 billion gain earlier this \\nmonth. The company was able to exceed sky-high investor expectations with a revenue forecast that was more \\nthan $US2 billion ahead of analyst expectations.\\nNvidia's rally boosted the fortunes of the 30 billionaires on Bloomberg's wealth list who attribute at least some of \\ntheir wealth to AI by a combined $US42.8 billion. Charles Liang, CEO of Super Micro Computer, was the biggest \\nwinner on a percentage basis with a 33 per cent jump.\\nNvidia's outlook extends a streak of the company shattering expectations, thanks to insatiable demand for its \\nartificial intelligence accelerators - highly prized chips that crunch data for AI models.

And the \\nnumbers - along with the upbeat tone from Huang - renewed confidence that spending will stay strong.\\n\\\"The entire market is watching this report and expectations have been elevated,\\\" Wolfe Research analyst Chris \\nCaso said.\\nGuidance was strong enough to \\\"demonstrate continued momentum, while also leaving room for continued upside \\nthrough the second half.\\\"\\nNvidia, co-founded by Huang in 1993, got its start as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. Its profile \\nblew up in the last two years, when its technology proved adept at handling heavy AI workloads. The company's \\nH100 accelerators have become legendary in the tech world, with customers scrambling to get their hands on as \\nmany as possible.\\nCompanies such as Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet's Google are Nvidia's largest customers, \\naccounting for nearly 40 per cent of its revenue, as they rush to invest in hardware for AI computing.\\nIn the US fiscal fourth quarter, which ended January 28, Nvidia's revenue more than tripled to $US22.1 billion.

It's also on paper, in Document 79.\\nThe 2022 Chinese government directive expands a drive that is muscling US technology out of the country - an \\neffort some refer to as \\\"Delete A\\\", for Delete America.\\nDocument 79 was so sensitive that high-ranking officials and executives were only shown the order and weren't \\nallowed to make copies, sources say. It requires state-owned companies in finance, energy and other sectors to \\nreplace foreign software in their IT systems by 2027.\\nAmerican tech giants had long thrived in China as they hot-wired the country's meteoric industrial rise with \\ncomputers, operating systems and software. Chinese leaders want to sever that relationship, driven by a push for \\nself-sufficiency and concerns over the country's long-term security.\\nThe first targets were hardware makers. Dell, IBM and Cisco Systems have gradually seen much of their \\nequipment replaced by products from Chinese competitors.\\nDocument 79, named for the numbering on the paper, targets companies that provide the software enabling daily \\nbusiness operations from basic office tools to supply chain management. The likes of Microsoft and Oracle are \\nlosing ground in the field, one of the last bastions of foreign tech profitability in the country.\\nThe effort is just one salvo in a year-long push by Chinese leader Xi Jinping for self-sufficiency in everything from \\ncritical technology such as semiconductors and fighter jets to the production of grain and oilseeds. The broader \\nstrategy is to make China less dependent on the West for food, raw materials and energy, and instead focus on \\ndomestic supply chains.\\nOfficials in Beijing issued Document 79 in September 2022, as the US was ratcheting up chip export restrictions \\nand sanctions on Chinese tech companies. It requires state-owned firms to provide quarterly updates on their \\nPage 2 of 4\\nChinese push to delete US technology\\nprogress in replacing foreign software used for email, human resources and business manage-ment with Chinese \\nalternatives.\\nThe directive came down from the agency overseeing the country's massive state-owned enterprise sector - a \\ngroup that includes more than 60 of China's 100 largest listed companies.\\nThat agency, the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, and the country's national \\ncabinet, the State Council, didn't respond to requests for comment.\\nSpending by China's state sector topped 48 trillion yuan ($10 trillion) in 2022. The directive leverages that \\npurchasing power to support Chinese tech companies, which in turn can improve their products and narrow the \\ntechnology gap with US rivals.\\nState firms have ramped up their buying of domestic brands, even if the Chinese substitutes sometimes aren't as \\ngood. The buyers include banks, financial brokerages and public services such as the postal system.\\nBack in 2006, \\\"China was the land of milk and honey, and intellectual property was the main challenge\\\", says a \\nformer US Trade Representative official involved in previous technology discussions with the Chinese. \\\"Now, there \\nis a feeling that the sense of opportunity is off. Companies are merely hanging on.\\\" The push to localise tech is \\nknown as Xinchuang, loosely translated as \\\"IT innovation\\\" with a reference to technology that is secure and \\ntrustworthy. The policy has gained urgency amid an escalating tech and trade war with Washington, which has cut \\nmany Chinese entities off from American technologies.\\nPremier Li Qiang reiterated the push during China's annual legislative sessions this week. China's central \\ngovernment plans to increase its spending on science and technology by 10 per cent to about $US51bn ($77bn) \\nthis year, according to a budget report released on Tuesday - up from a 2 per cent increase last year.\\nAt some trade fairs across the country, vendors tout homegrown tech as an alternative to foreign brands. One \\nsemiconductor equipment maker stall in Nanjing put it bluntly, offering to help buyers \\\"Delete A\\\" from their supply \\nchain.\\nDomestic alternatives are growing more user-friendly. A local official recalled how in 2016, it took a whole day to \\nopen and close a spreadsheet on a computer with an operating system known as KylinOS, developed by a Chinese \\nmilitary-linked company. He compares the usability of the latest KylinOS version to Microsoft's Windows 7, \\nintroduced in 2009 - workable if not great.\\nAs recently as six years ago, most government tenders sought hardware, chips and software from Western brands. \\nBy 2023, many were seeking Chinese tech products instead. When the customs department in the eastern Chinese \\ncity of Ningbo sought to purchase rack servers in 2018, it stated a preference for brands such as Dell and Hewlett \\nPackard Enterprise, and for hardware powered by Intel's Xeon central processing units. Five years later, the same \\nagency asked for rack servers made by Chinese companies and equipped with Huawei chips.\\nThese servers are typically assembled by state-owned tech manufacturers that barely sell equipment overseas, \\nsuch as Beijing-based Tsinghua Tongfang. Tongfang's controlling shareholder is a state-owned company in charge \\nof China's civilian and military nuclear programs.\\nSome government officials in China's capital had their foreign-branded PCs replaced with those made by Tongfang \\nand officials last year were told to use Chinese phones instead of Apple's iPhones for work.\\nOver the past decade, Xi has repeatedly emphasised technological innovation and the use of trusted homegrown \\ntechnology in government departments and industry. Revelations by former National Security Agency contractor \\nEdward Snowden in 2013 that US authorities had hacked into Chinese mobile phone communications, universities \\nand private companies strengthened Xi's resolve. More recently, he has told senior officials that China should \\nleverage its strengths and market to break bottlenecks in the development of essential software such as operating \\nsystems.Page 3 of 4\\nChinese push to delete US technology\\nAs China focused on replacing hardware, IBM's China revenues have steadily declined. It downsized its China \\nresearch operations in Beijing in 2021, more than two decades after it opened.\\nCisco, once a technology powerhouse in China, said in 2019 that it was losing orders in the country to local \\nvendors. PC maker Dell's market share in China has almost halved in the past five years, to 8 per cent. Hewlett \\nPackard Enterprise, which makes servers, storage and networks, got 14.1 per cent of its revenue from China in \\n2018, according to estimates from FactSet. By 2023, that had fallen to 4 per cent.\\nIn May, HPE said it would sell its 49 per cent stake in its Chinese joint venture. The company continues to sell direct \\nto multinational customers in China and sells selected products to the broader mainland market through its Chinese \\npartner.\\nIn software, Adobe, Citrix parent Cloud Software Group and Salesforce have pulled out or downsized direct \\noperations in the country over the past two years.\\nMicrosoft, the world's biggest software provider, historically dominated computer operating systems in China. A \\nMorgan Stanley poll of 135 chief information officers in China found that many expected the share of computers \\npowered by Microsoft's Windows operating system installed in their companies to fall over the next three years. \\nThey expected Linux-based UOS, or Unity Operating System, an effort co-led by a state-owned company, to gain in \\nthe shift. Even as Microsoft's top executives and co-founder Bill Gates have frequently travelled to Beijing for high-\\nprofile meetings with Chinese leaders on subjects like co-operation on AI and US-China trade relations in recent \\nyears, the company has decreased its offerings in China. Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a subcommittee \\nhearing last September that China made up just 1.5 per cent of its overall sales. The company posted sales of \\n$US212bn in the last fiscal year.\\nSome state-owned companies are dragging their feet on orders to replace foreign IT products that are essential to \\ntheir core businesses over concerns about the stability and performance of domestic alternatives.\\nBut in addition to becoming more advanced, China's own technology is also plugged into the local ecosystem. \\nProviders of domestic business software allow interoperability with WeChat, a ubiquitous chat messaging app \\nwidely used in place of email among Chinese businesses.\\nThe buy-local policy is trickling down to privately run companies, which are showing greater inclination to buy \\ndomestic software, according to Morgan Stanley's CIO survey.\\nA shift towards hosting and managing data on cloud servers instead of servers on the premises has also allowed \\nChinese companies to narrow the gap. Oracle, IBM and Microsoft dominated the database software market in \\nChina in 2010. Since then, Chinese companies including Alibaba and Huawei have come up with their own \\ndatabase management products to replace American technology.\\nChina-based vendors took more than half of that market in China - worth $US6.3bn overall - for the first time in \\n2022, and continue to grow, according to researcher Gartner. Tenders examined by the Journal show more state-\\nlinked entities and companies have opted for Huawei's databases in recent years.\\nChina's banks, brokerage firms and insurers had sped up procurement of homegrown databases, Yang Bing, chief \\nexecutive of Chinese database company OceanBase, said at a Beijing conference in November. OceanBase, \\ndeveloped by Alibaba and its fintech affiliate Ant Group, replaced Oracle databases at Alibaba and Ant in 2016.\\nWestern companies are being replaced not just by Chinese national champions such as Huawei but also more \\nspecialised companies. Yonyou Network Technology, a Shanghai-listed firm with a market value of $US6bn, \\nprovides systems to manage human resources, inventory and finances. Yonyou has been gaining users at the \\nexpense of Oracle and SAP, which together used to dominate more than half the market.\\nLoad-Date: March 8, 2024Page 4 of 4\\nChinese push to delete US technology\\nEnd of Document\"\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Cisco\",\n    \"average_sentiment\": 0.0,\n    \"mentions\": 2,\n    \"tones\": {\n      \"Neutral\": 2\n    },\n    \"descriptions\": [\n      \"Conducted a global AI readiness report, discussing the adoption of AI technology in Australia.

            "content": "Bain & Company is portrayed negatively in the media due to its research findings that generative AI investments are underperforming, with investors expressing skepticism about AI's value in 2025. This aligns Bain with broader concerns about AI's slow return on investment and workplace anxieties. Microsoft Corporation faces negative coverage primarily due to its declining market share in China, where government policies are pushing for domestic alternatives, threatening its dominance in software. Additionally, while Microsoft is noted as a major Nvidia customer, this is framed within the broader AI investment landscape rather than as a positive development. Cisco, despite being mentioned in AI-related discussions, receives a neutral portrayal, with its AI readiness index highlighting industry-wide challenges rather than specific failures or controversies tied to the company itself.",
