His statements suggest a shift from an experimental phase to a more mature stage, yet frustration with market unwillingness to meet \u00d8rsted\u2019s pricing expectations indicates a growing concern. This sentiment, which leans negative, could impact \u00d8rsted\u2019s reputation by highlighting difficulties in commercial viability, potentially influencing investor confidence and stakeholder negotiations.",
