All Rights Reserved.\nCopyright 2024 International Business Times Australia \nLength: 579 words\nBody\nMay 2nd, 2024 ( International Business Times Australia  - Delivered by  Newstex )\nBritish oil and gas giant Shell announced Thursday that first-quarter earnings fell but beat expectations in a \n\"strong\" performance, and unveiled another bumper stock buyback.\nAdjusted earnings sank almost a fifth to $7.7 billion from a year earlier but this smashed market expectations of \n$6.5 billion, while cash flow from operating activities hit $13.3 billion.\nAdjusted profit stood at $9.6 billion a year earlier when Shell saw a derivative inflow that was not repeated in the \nfirst quarter of 2024 due to lower prices in commodity derivatives, according to the company.\nThe energy major, which is investing heavily in renewables, insisted it remained on track to become a net zero \nemissions company by 2050, but its results sparked fresh anger from the green lobby.\nShell also unveiled a fresh $3.5-billion stock buyback and forecast capital expenditure this year would reach \nbetween $22 billion and $24 billion, it added in a results statement.\n\"Shell delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial performance, demonstrating our continued \nfocus on delivering more value with less emissions,\" said chief executive Wael Sawan.\n\"We continue to deliver on our... targets, giving us the confidence to commence another $3.5-billion buyback \nprogramme for the next three months.\"\nThursday's news sent its share price one percent higher in late morning deals on the rising London stock market.\nShell added that net profit, or profit after taxation, declined about 15 percent to $7.4 billion in the reporting period.\nRevenues slid 16 percent to $74.7 billion following a sharp drop in gas prices, which had spiked following key \nproducer Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nShell had already warned last month that it expected lower natural gas sales in the first quarter after a particularly \nstrong performance in the final three months of 2023.\nPage 2 of 2\nShell Logs 'Strong' Quarter As Earnings Fall But Top Expectations\n\"Shell's produced yet another quarter of staggering cash flows,\" said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at \nstockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, in response to the results.\n\"Higher margins and uptime at its refineries more than offset lower earnings in the upstream and integrated gas \ndivisions.\n\"The strong cash generation is enabling Shell to reduce debt, reward shareholders and continue investing into the \nbusiness.\"\nThe company was, however, slammed by climate campaigners over its huge profit from fossil fuels.\n\"On a day where climate leaders are negotiating in Abu Dhabi how to help the world's poorest meet the \nskyrocketing costs of climate loss and damage, Shell continues to bank billions from flogging the fuels that are \ndriving the crisis,\" said Charlie Kronick, senior climate advisor at Greenpeace UK.\n\"With countries experiencing the worst impacts of climate change among those least responsible for it, the case for \nmaking polluters pay for the damage their industry is causing could not be clearer.\"\nA Shell spokesperson responded that the company was seeking to help the world transition to low-carbon energy.\n\"We agree the world needs urgent climate action. Shell is playing an important role in the energy transition by \nproviding the energy needed today while helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future,\" a \nspokesperson told AFP.\n\"We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making Shell a \nsignificant investor in the energy transition.\"\nLink to the original story.\nNotes\nThe views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex \nAuthoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its \nre-distributors.
