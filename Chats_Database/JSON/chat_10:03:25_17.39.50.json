It now has to prove itself with its ambitious \nplan to take its production level to 500,000 ounces of gold annually.\nBut if it pulls it off, it will become the third-largest gold miner in Australia.\nSo far it has impressed, with the once embattled Westgold Resources soaring in value from $300m to over $1bn \nunder Mr Bramwell's leadership.\nAnd one of the reasons it is interested is it believes Karora had been producing 170,000 ounces of gold, when it \nshould have been producing about 200,000, as it had earlier forecast.\nPage 2 of 2\nDual listing the price Westgold has to pay for deal - DATA ROOM\nGold miners are currently cashed-up on the back of the buoyant gold price. Now the question is whether Ramelius \nResources pounces on Spartan Resources (formerly Gascoyne), which is said to be on its radar given the close \nproximity of its assets to Spartan's.\nYet the speculation has been around for a while and it is still to move, leaving some to think Ramelius sees \nSpartan as over-priced for now.\nAs gold mining consolidation continues apace, the other deal some believe will play out over the medium term is an \nacquisition by Northern Star of the $2.5bn De Grey Mining.\nNorthern Star's first priority is rebuilding the processing plant of the Super Pit gold mining asset that it owns, but \nafter that attention will likely turn to De Grey.\nThis is why many found its presence at Newcrest's Telfer mine and Havieron processing facility on a site visit in \nrecent weeks curious.\nNorthern Star sources say it has no interest in Telfer, but it's very close to De Grey's assets, so perhaps it was there \nwhile on a De Grey site visit, determining whether gold could be processed there.\nMeanwhile, the terms of Westgold's deal will see Karora shareholders receiving 2.524 Westgold shares and 68c \ncash a.\nThe offer represents about $6.60 per Karora share based on Westgold's closing share price on the ASX of $2.28 on \nApril 5.\nIt represents a 10.1 per cent premium to Karora's closing share price on the TSX of $5.99 ($C5.36) on April 5.\nWestgold shareholders will own 50.1 per cent of the combined company. Westgold, advised by Argonaut and \ncurrently producing about 220,000 ounces of gold from its underground and open pit mines in Western Australia, \nsays the business is capable of producing 400,000 ounces of gold per annum from Western Australia assets and \nestimates operating synergies of $209m and estimated corporate savings of $281m. The Beta Hunt underground \nmine, 600km from Perth, is the jewel in Karora's crown with its gold potential.\nLoad-Date: April 8, 2024\nEnd of Document\n  Tone: Neutral\n  Sentiment Score: -2\n- Content: Page 1 of 2\nShareholders see compromise on the cards as BHP continues discussions with Anglo American - DATA \nROOM\nShareholders see compromise on the cards as BHP continues discussions \nwith Anglo American - DATA ROOM\nThe Australian\nMay 30, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 14\nLength: 488 words\nByline: EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER\nBody\nBHP shareholders on Wednesday night were taking the view that the negotiations with its takeover target Anglo \nAmerican would probably result in a compromise.\nThe miner's announcement on Wednesday showed that it was moving to allay concerns around risks in South \nAfrica related to its deal, and expectations are that there will be a coming together in the middle from both sides.\nThe fact that BHP had asked for an extension for negotiations showed that it remained a keen buyer of Anglo \nAmerican and, as it was made clear last week, the discussion had gone beyond value and moved to deal structure.\nAnother week would allow Anglo American to work through the issues further, and some believe it should have \neven gone as far as underwriting the transaction.\nBy taking the South African Kumba iron ore operation from Anglo American shareholders as part of the deal, rather \nthan returning it to them as planned, BHP could combine it with some coal mines in a sale process down the track \nand potentially achieve a better price for the assets.\nOn Wednesday, there was divided opinion as to whether BHP was making progress with Anglo American in the \nnegotiations, with some suggesting the lack of an announcement that an extension had been agreed meant it was \nnot gaining the co-operation from Anglo American it may have been hoping for.\nAs reported by The Australian on Wednesday, among BHP's efforts to allay fears surrounding structure was the \noffer of a \"reverse break fee\", and it had offered direct responses to Anglo's concerns, including offering the South \nAfrican government a three-year guarantee to maintain staffing levels in the country, sharing any costs of employee \nshare schemes, and establishing a mining centre of excellence in the country to train mine workers and conduct \nresearch and development for BHP's global mining operations.\nPage 2 of 2\nShareholders see compromise on the cards as BHP continues discussions with Anglo American - DATA \nROOM\nElsewhere, an odd application to the Takeovers Panel revealed to the market on Wednesday shows that mergers \nand acquisitions remain on the agenda for Ramelius Resources.\nThe gold miner led by Mark Zeptner is seen as a sophisticated operator that will soon be more cashed-up than it \nalready is and has executed well on mergers and acquisitions in the past, so the market would probably support \nany deal it puts forward.\nIt walked away from a deal to buy Canadian gold miner Karora, with which Westgold Resources has agreed to \nembark on a $2.2bn merger transaction.\nBut judging by the Takeovers Panel application, it appears that Ramelius is keen to take part in some sort of two-\nway of three-way tie-up with Westgold and/or Karora.\nIt's objecting to the cost of the break fee on Westgold's deal with Karora, which is standard for deals in Canada, and \na one-year standstill agreement Ramelius and Westgold had in place from November.

Another key area of focus has been the development of its CMA mine pit underground extension to the \nYaoure Gold Mine.\nMeanwhile, Chinese groups may be in the strongest contention for Akyem when it comes to price, but Newmont will \ntake into consideration whether the buyer is a responsible owner of the asset, so it may not get sold to the highest \nbidder.\nNewmont is offloading mines globally following its $24bn purchase of Australia's largest gold mining company \nNewcrest.\nIt is also working with advisory firm BMO to sell mines in Canada and North America, including the Musselwhite, \nCripple Creek (US) and Eleonore (Canada) projects, potentially worth a combined $1.5bn.\nThe contest is expected to attract North American miners.\nPage 2 of 2\nPerseus drops out of the contest for Ghana asset - DATA ROOM\nLast on the block will be Newmont's Telfer gold mine in Western Australia, which Macquarie Capital is mandated to \nsell. Greatland Gold has first right to buy the asset and there's been some market chatter that perhaps the \nnegotiations are already afoot, despite floating at Telfer's tailings dam causing production delays.\nThere was also a suggestion that Ramelius Resources could be interested. However, judging by the trading in \nSpartan Resources, it appears Ramelius's interest lies elsewhere.\nThe Australian listed gold miner that last year held merger talks with near-by rival Westgold Resources told the \nmarket on Thursday it had purchased 8.9 per cent of the $994m listed gold miner Spartan after a major holding \nfrom Tembo Capital was on offer through Citi.\nHowever, it added that it had no current intention to acquire control or make a takeover of the business that owns \nthe Dalgaranga Gold Project, 65km northwest of Mt Magnet in Murchison, Western Australia, where Ramelius \nowns a gold processing hub.\nStill, it gives Ramelius deal certainty should it be keen to move in on the target in the future.\nDataRoom reported in April that Spartan was on the radar of Ramelius. Spartan was previously called Gascoyne \nand had to undergo a string of emergency equity raisings since 2019 following losses, with a mill far bigger than its \nproduction capacity being its downfall.\nThe strategic move by Ramelius resembles Silver Lake's with Red 5, buying 11 per cent last year ahead of a scrip \nmerger deal later with the $1.2bn company.\nThe share price of Red 5 post the merger has been lagging, down about 20 per cent in the past month and taking \nits market value to $2.5bn. Some Silver Lake assets now part of Red 5 are also close to Spartan's. Australian listed \ngold mining companies are under pressure to consolidate to attract global institutional investors that want gold \nmining investment opportunities of scale.\nLoad-Date: June 27, 2024\nEnd of Document\n  Tone: Neutral\n  Sentiment Score: 0\n- Content: Page 1 of 2\nGold shines again at Diggers and Dealers but developers are struggling - DATA ROOM\nGold shines again at Diggers and Dealers but developers are struggling - \nDATA ROOM\nThe Australian\nAugust 5, 2024 Monday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 789 words\nByline: EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER\nBody\nAustralia's lithium mining industry may have had its chance to shine last year, but it is those digging gold out of the \nground that are back in favour among resources investors.\nAs the Diggers & Dealers Conference gets under way in Kalgoorlie this week, investors have once again made gold \na key focus.\nBut while gold producers are in favour, it's a different story for developers, who face a tough journey getting projects \ninto production.\n\"Exploration is hard,\" Westgold Resources managing director Wayne Bramwell says. \"Being a single mine project \ndeveloper is really hard and it is a massive leap to get to that point where you can become a portfolio company, \nwhere your risk is mitigated by having multiple production outlets.\" In the past month, Calidus Resources collapsed \nafter lender Macquarie called in its loans.\nMeanwhile, Bellevue Gold's recent $150m-plus raising proved that gaining investor backing and moving to \nproduction can be a bumpy path, when it surprised investors with the raise and lower production forecasts.\n\"Bellevue has done a good job to get into production, but it is proving more difficult than they promised the market \nand there are growing pains that come with that,\" Barrenjoey mining analyst Daniel Morgan says.\nDiggers and Dealers will feature 66 corporate presentations from listed miners, explorers and other exhibitors from \nthe resources sector.\nMany investors made their way to Western Australia ahead of the conference, with Bellevue Gold holding a site visit \nlast Wednesday and Gold Road Resources the previous Thursday, along with Northern Star's Super Pit gold mine \non the outskirts of Kalgoorlie.\nPage 2 of 2\nGold shines again at Diggers and Dealers but developers are struggling - DATA ROOM\nAccommodation is tight for delegates at the conference. Some sidestep the event, instead using the build-up as an \nopportunity to schedule meetings in Perth, but it still attracts over 2000 delegates.\nLithium miners stole the show last year. Producers of the battery material were in favour because of the expected \nramp-up in electric vehicle manufacturing. But the lithium price has come off the boil while gold is striking record \nhighs.\n\"If you went back last year or the year before, what was remarkable was lithium, which had been a small \ncommodity, had really come to dominate the proceedings at Diggers and Dealers,\" Morgan says.\n\"The Australian-dollar gold price is high, and lithium and nickel are having a tough time of it and not likely to be as \nfocused on growth. Nickel and lithium are battening down the hatches.\" Domestic gold production growth has \nslowed over the past decade as mines approach the end of their productive lives, says IBISWorld, but it's set to \nreturn to growth as project expansions come online, capitalising on the weaker Australian dollar.\nThe industry's annual revenue is about $27.9bn and growing at a rate of 4.4 per cent as the metal continues to act \nas an inflation hedge and benefits from central bank purchases.\nAustralia is the third-largest producer globally with 293.8 tonnes in 2023, behind China and Russia, according to the \nWorld Gold Council.\nLithium miners dominated the mergers and acquisitions landscape in the resources industry last year, with \nAlbemarle bidding for Liontown Resources (it later abandoned the deal), SQM acquiring Azure Minerals, Chalice \nMining looking for a backer and speculation about a move on Patriot Battery Metals by Pilbara Minerals, which was \nsitting on a $3bn cash pile. But investment bankers have turned their attention to gold.\nHeading into Diggers and Dealers, there has been talk Regis and Gold Road Resources might merge. Ramelius \nResources is also in focus with an 8.9 per cent stake in Spartan Resources, West Gold and Ramelius have held \ntakeover talks and there's the perennial takeover target De Grey Mining.\nGenesis Minerals boss Raleigh Finlayson has emphasised his focus is on operations rather than deals, but the \ncompany is surrounded by consolidation opportunities in Western Australia's Leonora gold district, while it's \nexpected Northern Star will return to deal making to gain further scale after the country's largest gold miner \nNewcrest was taken over by Newmont.\nDriving M&A, Bramwell says, will be producers with cash. \"This is a time when the producers are cashed-up and \nthe explorers and the people in the middle are cash-strapped.\" Also of interest this year will be uranium miners like \nBoss Energy and Paladin, as the fuel remains at the centre of the energy debate and demand grows, with a lack of \nsupply to the West from Russia. \"There's a lot of enthusiasm towards the sector. Its prospects are still high and \nhave not dimmed as much as lithium or nickel or rare earths have,\" Morgan says. Another positive for gold could be \nnickel producers such as BHP mothballing projects, making workers available.\nLoad-Date: August 4, 2024\nEnd of Document\n  Tone: Neutral\n  Sentiment Score: 0\n- Content: Page 1 of 2\nBattle for relevance a key driver for more gold mining deals - DATA ROOM\nBattle for relevance a key driver for more gold mining deals - DATA ROOM\nThe Australian\nAugust 7, 2024 Wednesday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 16\nLength: 339 words\nByline: EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER\nBody\nGroups that mine more than 400,000 ounces of gold annually are more likely to get attention from investors \nallocating a shrinking pool of funds to listed Australian stocks in the sector, says Westgold Resources boss Wayne \nBramwell.\nThe managing director of the $1.3bn Westgold said the concept of remaining relevant was top of mind for chief \nexecutives of mid-tier gold miners on the Australian Securities Exchange, and it would likely drive mergers and \nacquisitions in the space.\n\"Capital markets are shrinking in certain areas, so it is not just about being profitable but relevant,\" he said.\nMr Bramwell said being relevant meant mining at least 400,000 ounces of gold a year.\n\"Under that space, you may be interesting, but less relevant to a broader audience,\" he said.\nHis comments at the Diggers and Dealers conference in Kalgoorlie come after Mr Bramwell struck a $2.2bn deal to \nmerge with the Canadian-listed Karora.\n\"Now we have moved above that space, we are more relevant to a broader audience,\" he said.\nRival ASX miner Ramelius Resources, which was also in earlier talks to buy Karora, lobbed an objection to the \nTakeovers Panel about the deal.\nThe process exposed mergers and acquisition talks between the Mark Zeptner-led Ramelius and Westgold late \nlast year that involved standstill terms between the pair.\nRamelius owns two production and processing hubs at Mt Magnet and Edna May, both in Western Australia, and is \ndeveloping its Rebecca and Cue Gold Projects.\nMr Bramwell confirmed there were talks late last year with Ramelius, which were likely to be similar to what the \ncompany had with Karora.

Its most logical target is De Grey \nMining, whose shares also fell more than 5 per cent on Thursday.\nPart of the reason behind a rally in the gold price in the past two months has been expectations of geopolitical \ninstability and an uncertain outcome in the US election.\nBut the sweeping victory of Donald Trump in the race for the White House has caught out some gold traders, with \nthe result creating more certainty about US policy.\nPage 2 of 2\nGolden chance for miners to buy out rivals amid commodity sell-off - DATA ROOM\nAlso sending the gold price lower on Thursday was a rally in the US dollar following the election outcome, with the \nUS economy expected to be stronger under Mr Trump.\nHowever, while gold may be volatile for about two months as the market assesses the impact of Mr Trump's \nleadership, if he introduces trading tariffs on other countries such as China, and the US dollar remains high, that \nwould lead to global inflation.\nAnd inflation usually supports a higher gold price.\nThe same would be said about more geopolitical tension, should it occur under Mr Trump.\nGroups that were also looking to raise equity may now have second thoughts over doing so before Christmas, or \nmay raise less funds and at a lower price. Another plus for gold miners wanting to do deals following the election of \nMr Trump is that it may be easier to come across financing for transactions at better rates, sources say.\nLoad-Date: November 7, 2024\nEnd of Document\n  Tone: Neutral\n  Sentiment Score: 0\n- Content: Page 1 of 2\nRamelius may look to M&A if Rebecca-Roe project doesn't stack up - DATA ROOM\nRamelius may look to M&A if Rebecca-Roe project doesn't stack up - DATA \nROOM\nThe Australian\nNovember 28, 2024 Thursday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: BUSINESS; Pg. 14\nLength: 505 words\nByline: EDITED BY BRIDGET CARTER\nBody\nA move by Ramelius Resources on its smaller rival Spartan could rest on the release of its feasibility study into its \nRebecca-Roe development, expected out in the near term.\nShould the results prove that the project will not be all that viable, it may propel the group more towards taking the \nmergers and acquisition route for growth.\nRamelius purchased 8.9 per cent of Spartan Resources in June and it is also known to have been eyeing up other \ntargets at a time it remains cashed up with the gold price hitting record highs this year.\nCurrently, the Ramelius market value is close to $2.4bn whereas Spartan's market value is almost $1.5bn.\nRamelius Resources chief executive Mark Zeptner earlier said that the Spartan Resources project was \"in our \nbackyard\".\nRamelius is developing both the Rebecca-Roe project and Cue Gold Project, 35km south of Mt Magnet, after \nbuying Apollo Consolidated in 2022 and Musgrave Minerals the following year.\nIt owns and operates two production and processing hubs at Mt Magnet and Edna May, in Western Australia.\nSpartan owns the Dalgaranga Gold Project, 65km northwest of Mt Magnet in Murchison, where Ramelius owns a \ngold processing hub.

Karora \nwill bring new production hubs with mills, and could help the company consolidate its position in the region. A \nRamelius spokesperson declined to comment.\nKarora's portfolio, located 60 kilometres from Kalgoorlie, includes 100 per cent ownership of the Beta Hunt mine, \nHigginsville gold operations and Spargos gold mine. It is expected to produce 170,000 to 195,000 ounces gold in \n2024. By contrast, Ramelius has told shareholders it would hit 272,500 ounces production this financial year.\nZeptner and his team are chasing the acquisition after a period of solid performance and perky gold prices. \nRamelius shares have risen nearly 48 per cent in the past year, giving it a $1.8 billion market capitalisation and a \nstrong balance sheet.\nIn particular, it has benefited from high-grade Penny ore being fed into the Mt Magnet Mill. Cash and gold reserves \nare expected to hit $400 million by year-end, while about $100 million in undrawn debt would further boost its \nliquidity profile.\nRamelius reported a 14 per cent increase in revenue to $348.5 million at its half-year results on February 20. \nEBITDA shot up 39 per cent to $140.2 million, thanks to a 12 per cent jump in realised gold price.\nRamelius' biggest asset is the Mt Magnet production centre, which it started building via a $40 million acquisition in \n2010. Now, 14 years on, Mt Magnet speaks for 62 per cent of the group's gold reserves.\nWhen combined with the Vivien gold deposit and Penny gold mine, it is 53 per cent of the total net present value, \naccording to Macquarie Capital analysts. Production is expected to reduce significantly by the 2029 financial year.\nPage 2 of 2\nRamelius in exclusive talks to buy Canada-listed gold miner; Street Talk\nBut the more pressing matter for Zeptner has been finding a replacement for Edna May, which it bought from \nEvolution Mining in 2017.

Nothing came of the talks, and Westgold has since moved on its scrip-and-cash bid for Canada-listed \nKarora Resources.\nInterestingly, another listed gold player, Ramelius Resources, has sniffed around Spartan in the past.

To make \nmatters worse, Ramelius also approached Westgold to explore a $3 billion-plus merger, but was turned back.

One \ncompany, however, has remained uncharacteristically quiet.\nNewmont, the world's top gold producer caught headlines last year for its $26.3 billion merger with Australia's \nbiggest gold miner Newcrest, forming a $US59.5 billion dual-listed gold stock and pumping its long list of advisers \nup the M&A league table.\nAt the time, much was also made of its intention to divest six non-core assets once the acquisition wrapped up in \nNovember including WA's ageing Telfer gold mine and Havieron, which Newmont operates under a joint venture \nagreement with Greatland Gold (70 per cent/30 per cent). This was aimed at generating $US2 billion-plus ($3.05 \nbillion) in cash.\nWhile the sale of its Akyem gold mine in Ghana has reportedly drawn Chinese interest, investors haven't heard a \npeep about the local assets. Street Talk understands sell-side adviser Macquarie started preliminary preparation for \na sale process earlier in the year, but iced the mooted deal after processing operations at Telfer were suspended. \nHowever, it is understood MacCap's resources bankers are back on the tools, and soft soundings are under way.\nTelfer is a larger scale, producing asset, but it's best days are behind it. The mine hasn't made a lot of cash over the \nlast several years and would require a substantial commitment to rehabilitate it. However, its interaction with \nHavieron is interesting; one has the infrastructure, the other has the orebody. As such, they'll likely be sold together \nwith estimates around the $500 million mark.\nGiven its interest in Havieron, Greatland Gold is the obvious buyer. The London-listed firm also has pre-emptive \nrights, acquired when Newcrest and Greatland began the joint venture in 2020. Street Talk understands the Andrew \nForrest-backed company has been meeting with fund managers for months, making no secret of the fact they're \nkeen to consolidate its stake - and would use the associated raise to peg their Australian float. Investor sources told \nStreet Talk the last time they heard from Greatland was May when they were told the company was still waiting on \nsale terms from Newmont.

The $20 billion Northern Star owns the nearby land.\nSources said a deal could see Lakewood valued at between $70 million and $95 million, and would be welcomed \nby investors who've watched the shares fall almost 16 per cent this year. Unlike plenty of its listed peers, Westgold \nhasn't benefited from higher gold prices given issues around digesting the Karora acquisition.\nWestgold CEO Wayne Bramwell plans to use sale proceeds to increase capacity at its Higginsville mill from 1.6 \nmillion tonnes a year to well above the 2 million mark. A spokesperson declined to comment.\nThe up-for-grabs Lakewood was acquired by Karora to add an extra million tonnes in capacity for its flagship Beta \nHunt gold mine, on top of the 1.6 million tonnes capacity at its existing Higginsville mill, amid a production ramp-up.\nSources said since the merger, Westgold has narrowed its focus on fewer but bigger mills, which are fed by fewer \nbut bigger mines - in a bid to finetune its cost base against movements in gold pricing. This strategy, at its Beta \nHunt mine, means processing the ore via the lower-cost and larger Higginsville mill.\nProcessing a tonne of ore via the Lakewood mill costs $50, while Higginsville can handle the same amount for $30 \nor more. Should Westgold expand Higginsville as expected, this cost could be brought down to the $20 range, the \nsources said.\nPage 2 of 2\nWestgold shops gold mill acquired in $2.5b Karora merger; Street Talk\nThe mooted deal comes after Westgold and rival Ramelius Resources locked horns last year over Karora, as \nrevealed by Street Talk. The stoush ended when the $3 billion Ramelius decided to walk away, while Westgold \nprogressed and took the keys to Karora in August. But the proceedings also outed the fact that Ramelius had \napproached Westgold with a merger proposal but was knocked back.\nA fortnight ago, Westgold shares tanked after the miner cut its 2025 production guidance by as much as one-fifth \nand warned of higher costs after paying big for Karora. It said it would produce between 330,000 ounces and \n350,000 ounces this financial year, down from its previous forecast of between 400,000 ounces and 420,000 \nounces. Costs were also expected to be higher, up from a range of $2000 to $2300 per ounce to $2400 to $2600. \nThe miner attributed the production cuts to teething problems in production at its two main mines Beta Hunt near \nKambalda, and Bluebird-South Junction near Meekatharra.\nLoad-Date: February 21, 2025\nEnd of Document\n  Tone: Negative\n  Sentiment Score: -2\n\n\nJournalist: Jack Quail\nArticles:\n- Content: Page 1 of 2\nStocks on a high as rates peak\nStocks on a high as rates peak\nThe Australian\nMarch 9, 2024 Saturday\nAustralian Edition\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKETWATCH; Pg. 39\nLength: 463 words\nByline: JACK QUAIL\nBody\nEQUITIES Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 finished the week at a record high as traders bolstered their bets \nfor rate cuts later in the year and bank stocks surged.\nThe S&P/ASX200 rallied to an all-time intraday peak of 7853.1 points before retreating to end the session at a \nrecord closing high of 7847, up 1.1 per cent for the day and 1.3 per cent over the week.\nMeanwhile, the broader All Ordinaries also reset its record, closing up 1 per cent to 8107.5 points.
