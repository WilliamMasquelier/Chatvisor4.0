She joined Fortescue as general manager at its Cloudbreak mine in Western Australia in 2013. \nShe also ran the Solomon mine before being appointed as deputy chief executive in February 2018.\nMs Shuttleworth said she was grateful for her time at Fortescue and leaving to spend more time with her family.\n\"It's time to spend more quality time with my family and that will include some great adventures while travelling \ntogether,\" Ms Shuttleworth said yesterday.\n\"I have really loved my 11 years with Fortescue and the experiences that I've had during this time - from sitting with \nthe excavator and dump truck operators at Cloudbreak, to travelling the globe with the chairman [Dr Forrest] \nmeeting presidents and prime ministers, to working in the jungle in Gabon and everything in between.\n\"I have had amazing career growth and worked with thousands of incredible people.\"\nMs Shuttleworth said she had no immediate plans to work elsewhere.\nFortescue confirmed Ms Shuttleworth had opted to end her time at the company to spend some time travelling \noverseas with her family.\nPage 2 of 2\nTrusted Forrest lieutenant leaves Fortescue after a decade\n\"Julie has been an integral part of Fortescue's success.
