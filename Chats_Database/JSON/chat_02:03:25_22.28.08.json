The company's business was further disrupted by global supply disruptions, \nand Orsted has abandoned several projects in recent years.\nOver the past decade, Orsted has transformed itself into a renewable energy company, having previously operated \nprimarily in the fossil fuel market.\nSome other renewable energy developers are also setting less ambitious targets. For example, Orsted shareholder \nand Norwegian state energy company Equinor announced that it would lower its renewable energy targets and \nincrease oil and gas production by 10%.
