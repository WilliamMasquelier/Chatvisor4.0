All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 95\nLength: 143 words\nByline: GeoffHo\nBody\nOFFSHORE wind giant Orsted has dumped its chief executive as it looks to reverse the 80pc collapse in its share \nprice that he oversaw.\nOrsted, which operates 12 wind farms in the UK, said Mads Nipper will be replaced by deputy Rasmus Errboe \ntoday. Nipper (pictured) took charge in January 2021.\nUnder his watch, a share price fall has seen \u00a348bn wiped off Orsted's value. The industry has struggled with rising \ncosts, supply chain snags, higher interest rates and regulatory changes.\nOrsted's push into the US market has been hit by delays - and further complicated by the election of Donald \nTrump, an opponent of wind power. Chairman Lene Skole said: 'The impacts of the increasingly challenging \nsituation in the offshore wind industry mean that our focus has shifted. Therefore, the board has agreed with Mads \nNipper that it's the right time for him to step down.'\nLoad-Date: February 1, 2025\nEnd of Document\n\nOnly output one of these values: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and nothing else.\n                ",
