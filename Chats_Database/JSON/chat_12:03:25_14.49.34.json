Energy is the future. And we've got a great opportunity, but we mustn't \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 squander our \ntraditional strengths.\" She said an agreement covering business, government and consumers was required to \ntraverse the complex energy transition, which wouldn't happen without trade-offs, costs and difficult choices.\n\"We just need to have that clear-eyed, transparent dialogue.\" Ms Wake also noted the energy policy debate would \nneed to broach subjects including incentives, subsidies and production credits.\nShell is one of the dominant players in Australia's -energy sector, operating the QCLNG export plant in \nQueensland, the Prelude floating LNG project off northern Australia and also has stakes in WA's North West Shelf \nand Gorgon LNG ventures and gas business Arrow.\nMs Wake called for a pragmatic approach and a \"shared vision\" among stakeholders for the nation to best navigate \nand capitalise on the energy transition happening across markets globally.\nPage 2 of 2\nRED TAPE DRAIN ON ENERGY\n\"We need to stop demonising gas, we need to look more broadly than simply the \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 renewable penetration in the \nelectricity mix, we need to look to biofuels. We need to at least have a conversation around nuclear,\" she said, \nnoting Shell did not operate in the nuclear space as it wasn't a competitive strength.\nWednesday's forum was held amid rising speculation of an early election and a flare-up in the energy and climate \nwars.\nLarge Australian and offshore-based companies are also positioning to benefit from burgeoning industries and \npolicies that emerge as a result of the changes.
