OFFSHORE wind giant Orsted has dumped its chief executive as it looks to reverse the 80pc collapse in its share 
price that he oversaw.
Orsted, which operates 12 wind farms in the UK, said Mads Nipper will be replaced by deputy Rasmus Errboe 
today. Nipper (pictured) took charge in January 2021.
Under his watch, a share price fall has seen Â£48bn wiped off Orsted's value. The industry has struggled with rising 
costs, supply chain snags, higher interest rates and regulatory changes.
Orsted's push into the US market has been hit by delays - and further complicated by the election of Donald 
Trump, an opponent of wind power. Chairman Lene Skole said: 'The impacts of the increasingly challenging 
situation in the offshore wind industry mean that our focus has shifted. Therefore, the board has agreed with Mads 
Nipper that it's the right time for him to step down.'
