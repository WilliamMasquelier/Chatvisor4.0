Here is the document section to analyze:

The company posted sales of 
$US212bn in the last fiscal year.
Some state-owned companies are dragging their feet on orders to replace foreign IT products that are essential to 
their core businesses over concerns about the stability and performance of domestic alternatives.
But in addition to becoming more advanced, China's own technology is also plugged into the local ecosystem. 
Providers of domestic business software allow interoperability with WeChat, a ubiquitous chat messaging app 
widely used in place of email among Chinese businesses.
The buy-local policy is trickling down to privately run companies, which are showing greater inclination to buy 
domestic software, according to Morgan Stanley's CIO survey.
A shift towards hosting and managing data on cloud servers instead of servers on the premises has also allowed 
Chinese companies to narrow the gap. Oracle, IBM and Microsoft dominated the database software market in 
China in 2010. Since then, Chinese companies including Alibaba and Huawei have come up with their own 
database management products to replace American technology.
China-based vendors took more than half of that market in China - worth $US6.3bn overall - for the first time in 
2022, and continue to grow, according to researcher Gartner. Tenders examined by the Journal show more state-
linked entities and companies have opted for Huawei's databases in recent years.
China's banks, brokerage firms and insurers had sped up procurement of homegrown databases, Yang Bing, chief 
executive of Chinese database company OceanBase, said at a Beijing conference in November. OceanBase, 
developed by Alibaba and its fintech affiliate Ant Group, replaced Oracle databases at Alibaba and Ant in 2016.
Western companies are being replaced not just by Chinese national champions such as Huawei but also more 
specialised companies. Yonyou Network Technology, a Shanghai-listed firm with a market value of $US6bn, 
provides systems to manage human resources, inventory and finances. Yonyou has been gaining users at the 
expense of Oracle and SAP, which together used to dominate more than half the market.

Cisco Systems has completed its $US28bn ($42.8bn) all-cash acquisition of cyber security and analytics company 
Splunk.
The deal, the largest in Cisco's history, was closed months earlier than projected, reflecting the extraordinary effort 
many companies are undertaking as they remake their businesses around data and artificial intelligence.
Cisco chief executive Chuck Robbins and former Splunk CEO Gary Steele - now an executive vice-president at 
Cisco - said in an interview that AI would be deeply woven into the combined companies, and that they saw no hint 
that the current wave of business AI adoption was going to slow down or reverse course.
The combined company will use AI to help customers draw correlations in intelligence coming from different vendor 
platforms, so that they can take a more predictive approach to cyber security. While that predictive capability has 
been developing for some time, the company also plans to launch more capabilities that make use of generative AI 
to simplify their software and make it easier for people without technical training to operate the tools.
Splunk, launched in 2003, developed a dashboard that allows users to search, monitor and analyse machine-
generated data. It takes training to use it and generative AI helps reduce the learning curve, according to Mr Steele. 
"Splunk has its own proprietary language, the way in which you issue commands, and you have to be reasonably 
technical to do that," he said.
"With the AI assistance that we've launched, you can use English language to automatically generate that 
proprietary language. You can get outcomes without having all the advanced knowledge." Splunk's AI would benefit 
from Cisco's massive amounts of data, not to mention its global presence and sales and marketing channels, Mr 
Steele said.
Generative AI will have other applications across Cisco's business, such as simplifying the complex task of setting 
a configuration screen for a company's security policy, according to Mr Robbins. "It's very technical. We're going to 
enable our customers to just use English language to describe what security capabilities they would like â€¦ and 
then we will translate that into a policy that they would review," he said.

The software will function as an assistant, simplifying and speeding up the deployment of security policy and other 
resources without replacing human operators, according to Mr Robbins.
When the deal was announced in September 2023, the companies said it expected it to be completed by the end of 
September 2024. The process was completed in roughly half a year. Last week, the European Union gave the deal 
unconditional antitrust approval, after regulators found it wouldn't pose barriers to competition. Networking 
equipment pioneer Cisco, founded in 1984, rode the telecommunications boom of the 1990s. It was for a time the 
most valuable company in the world.

Highlight: Cisco will reportedly eliminate 4000 jobs in a second round of layoffs this year, as it moves its focus to 
areas such as cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.
Body
Cisco Systems plans to eliminate thousands more jobs in a second round of layoffs this year, Reuters reported, as 
the networking equipment maker shifts its focus to faster-growing businesses such as cybersecurity and artificial 
intelligence.
The news follows Cisco's move to cut about 4000 jobs in February after a slowdown in corporate tech spending 
wiped out its sales growth. The company had almost 85,000 workers at the end of fiscal 2023, which ran to July of 
that year.
Cisco joins other tech companies in paring jobs as they cope with uneven demand. Though AI spending has 
helped fuel growth in some areas, traditional information technology giants have not benefited as much.
Intel announced plans this month to slash 15,000 jobs as it contends with sluggish sales. Dell Technologies is also 
cutting positions as part of a reorganisation of its sales teams.
Cisco shares fell as much as 1.3 per cent to $US45.24 in New York. They were down 9.3 per cent this year 
heading into Friday's session.
The latest job cuts could be announced as early as Wednesday when the company reports fourth-quarter results, 
according to Reuters.
Three months ago, an upbeat Cisco forecast sparked hope that IT customers had picked up spending again. But 
the broader tech industry has been dogged by more recent concerns about the economy - and the idea that AI 
spending might not have a near-term payoff.
A representative for Cisco declined to comment on layoff plans.
Over the longer term, chief executive Chuck Robbins has been trying to transform Cisco into a provider of 
networking services and software, rather than a company focused on one-time sales of hardware.
It also looks to capitalise more on the AI boom that has fuelled sales for companies such as Nvidia. Last year, the 
company made a big move into the cybersecurity market with the $US28 billion acquisition of software firm Splunk.

Highlight: AI systems more intelligent than humans in some ways already exist - but general-purpose superhuman 
intelligence is probably still a long way off.
Body
In 2014, the British philosopher Nick Bostrom published a book about the future of artificial intelligence (AI) with the 
ominous title Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies. It proved highly influential in promoting the idea that 
advanced AI systems - "superintelligences" more capable than humans - might one day take over the world and 
destroy humanity.
A decade later, OpenAI boss Sam Altman says superintelligence may only be " a few thousand days" away. A year 
ago, Altman's OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever set up a team within the company to focus on " safe 
superintelligence", but he and his team have now raised a billion dollars to create a startup of their own to pursue 
this goal.
What exactly are they talking about? Broadly speaking, superintelligence is anything more intelligent than humans. 
But unpacking what that might mean in practice can get a bit tricky.
Different kinds of AI
In my view the most useful way to think about different levels and kinds of intelligence in AI was developed by US 
computer scientist Meredith Ringel Morris and her colleagues at Google.
Their framework lists six levels of AI performance: no AI, emerging, competent, expert, virtuoso and superhuman. It 
also makes an important distinction between narrow systems, which can carry out a small range of tasks, and more 
general systems.
A narrow, no-AI system is something like a calculator. It carries out various mathematical tasks according to a set of 
explicitly programmed rules.
Page 2 of 3
What is AI superintelligence? Could it destroy humanity? And is it really almost here?
There are already plenty of very successful narrow AI systems. Morris gives the Deep Blue chess program that 
famously defeated world champion Garry Kasparov way back in 1997 as an example of a virtuoso-level narrow AI 
system.
