You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| My-Linh Tran | Salon owner | "Nederlandse vrouwen, van arm tot rijk, besteden steeds meer aandacht aan hun uiterlijk." | "Dutch women, from poor to rich, are paying more and more attention to their appearance." |
| Thomas Rustemeyer | Allergologist | "Om allergieën te voorkomen, mogen vloeibare lakproducten nooit de huid raken." | "To prevent allergies, liquid nail products must never touch the skin." |
| Thomas Rustemeyer | Allergologist | "Als allergologen lopen we daarom altijd achter de feiten aan." | "As allergologists, we are always behind the facts." |
| My-Linh Tran | Salon owner | "Mensen kopen hier een stukje identiteit." | "People buy a piece of identity here." |
| My-Linh Tran | Salon owner | "Het voelt elke drie weken alsof je nieuwe schoenen hebt." | "It feels like you have new shoes every three weeks." |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Acrylnagelproducten.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Acrylnagelproducten or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
