Stars raise 50k to fly Teo home

A power list of NRL stars has raised almost $50,000 to bring the six-week premature baby of Jesse Ramien home 
safely from a Bali hospital to Australia.
The story that has stirred the emotions of the general public, including parents, fans and teammates, has triggered 
more than 630 donations. Ramien and fiancee Shell have also been helped by the Cronulla Sharks and the NRL.
In a major development, the efforts of the Sharks and NRL to work with the Australian Embassy in Indonesia to fast-
track paperwork have been promising. The documentation is crucial for baby Teo to be transported back to 
Australia.
Ramien and Shell are desperate to coordinate a care flight to fly medically induced Teo back to Australia at an 
estimated cost of $130,000.
Shavaun Hunt, the wife of Sharks forward Royce Hunt, organised a Go Fund Me fundraising campaign, which has 
prompted the rugby league community to respond, far beyond Ramien's Cronulla team.
Among the list of NRL players to donate are AJ Brimson, Keaon Koloamatangi, Isaiah Tass, Sitili Tupouniua, Jack 
Hetherington, Jacob Saifiti, Taane Milne and Hame Sele.
Sharks players have also donated, including Nicho Hynes, Siosifa Talakai, Briton Nikora, Jack Williams, Braden 
Hamlin-Uele, Blayke Brailey, Billy Burns and Hunt.
Former NRL stars Luke Lewis, Andrew Fifita and Denan Kemp have also made a financial pledge.
The well-paid Sharks star is not personally responsible for creating the Go Fund Me page but some fans have 
questioned why he would require financial assistance.
Despite the huge costs to bring their baby home, Ramien made it clear where he stood as a concerned father.

Stars raise 50k to fly Teo home
"I'll play for nothing just to get our baby boy home safely," he said. Teo needed to be resuscitated for five minutes 
after being born six weeks premature at a Bali hospital last Friday night.
Shell was 33 weeks pregnant and before leaving Sydney for Cronulla player Briton Nikora's wedding, the couple 
secured clearance from Shell's obstetrician, as well as the airline, and travel insurance cover for her pregnancy.
Shell went into early labour last Friday and needed an emergency C-section. She had to be put under anaesthesia 
and doctors needed to revive Teo for five minutes before he started breathing. He was born just after 11pm and 
immediately rushed to NICU, where he remains under close watch.
