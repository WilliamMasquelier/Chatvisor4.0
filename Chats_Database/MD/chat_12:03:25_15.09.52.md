Shell is exploring a potential sale of its chemicals assets in Europe and the US, part of a continuing drive to refocus 
the company's business on its most profitable operations.
The oil and gas company is working with bankers at Morgan Stanley on a strategic review of its chemicals 
operations. The process is in the early stages and Shell has yet to commit to any final decisions.
Among the assets included in the review is Shell's Deer Park -facility in Texas. The site produces a range of 
chemicals such as light and heavy olefins, which can be used to make pharmaceuticals, detergents, adhesives and 
wire coating. The operation is -located adjacent to a refinery, which Shell previously sold its stake in. Shell also has 
chemical facilities in Pennsylvania and Louisiana in the US, and in -Europe it has plants in the UK, Germany and 
The Netherlands.
Potential bidders for the assets could range from private-equity firms to Middle Eastern buyers wanting to expand 
into the West.
Since chief executive Wael Sawan took the helm of Shell at the start of 2023, the company has worked to focus 
more on its most profitable operations. To that end, the company has rolled back some of its green-energy targets 
and pledged to pump more oil and gas. Shell's chemicals business has been seen as lagging behind for years. It is 
capital-heavy and subject to cyclical ups and downs, resulting in losses in recent years that have weighed on the 
company's overall performance. Anaemic gas prices and rising capacity in chemical manufacturing have caused 
the petrochemical market to languish recently. The company has already signalled its willingness to shed lower-
margin chemicals operations. Last year, it struck a deal to sell its chemicals park in Singapore to a joint venture that 
includes Glencore, the mining company, and Chandra Asri, an Indonesia-based chemicals producer.
