You could row a coconut raft to the reef it was so calm. I remember the day, the few clouds were reflected in the 
deep, the shimmer of reef colour in the shallows, I loved it.
It simply made you want to immerse yourself in its hidden wonders. Our skipper Col Hodson asked me to come for 
a snorkel over the reef bowl, it was only 4 or 5 metres, and as clear as a spring dawn after the rain.
Myrmidon reef is truly one of our local natural masterpieces. When I say local, I don't mean you can whip out there 
on an orange scooter, a little far out (like this column), it's a magnificent wilderness on the outer reef. We went 
snorkelling to see the giant clams. Transplanted from Orpheus Island apparently and now what appeared to be 
acres of them, spread across the clear sands of the sheltered area of Myrmidon.
I doubt they are there now, after all these years and the many cyclones. It was an incredible sight, blessed to see it. 
They are the most magnificent creatures, incredible colour, size of a volksy , and with a mantle that makes velvet 
feel like sandpaper.
But what of the shell when the occupier moves on? Yes they break-up and turn to sand, or maybe the smaller ones 
wash up on the beach and become mobiles or candle holders. I've always wondered the laws on shell collecting. 
National Parks and Marine Parks are a no no which is fair, sacred land as well, and of course if they are occupied! 
But what of our local beachesâ€¦. I reckon why not? Herewith, a probable letter to the Editor begins about Pricey 
and his shells. No worries, its Steven with a V.
My girl finds heaps of cowries, the cowrie queen I call her, why let them be battered into rubble when we can 
admire the greatest of artisans work. I love the local shell club exhibits, my dear mum had heaps, and I have no 
idea where she got them. They're beauties. Now all over the house for the dog to trip over. I told of mum s love for 
shells to a wonderful mate of mine years ago, a trawler man, and he gave mum the most amazing cone shell 
brought up empty from the deep. The owner moving on to better premises I guess. He would polish them up 
wonderfully, better for mum to enjoy than be lost to eternity, and I reckon the builder would be proud to. Thanks to 
the late Neil Thomson, I still have the shell, and I think of mum and Neil whenever I look at it. It takes two of us to

lift the thing so I can listen to the oceanâ€¦the size of it I can hear all oceans. On that point, do mums and dads still 
tell the kids to lift a shell to their ear to hear the ocean???? Make sure its empty first if you do by the way.
I still listen, and I still believe itâ€¦fair dinkum, but then again, I can hear the seagulls too. Better than a mobile 
phone eh.
As Berty Boy said: "Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life's coming attractions". Albert Einstein.
There was another occasion when someone found a shell. We were diving off Bay Rock collecting algae rock for 
the aquarium, a wonderful man Chick Henderson surfaced and said "Pricey, heaps shells down here, want one?" I 
said "No Chick, leave them if they are alive". Typical Chick, great diver, he bought up the shell staying "I hope its 
dead Pricey" It was a bomb shell.
There's heaps out there. Don't listen to the ocean in one of them!!!! Happy Days Ooroo
