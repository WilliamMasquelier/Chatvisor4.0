Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber's statement, "We are what we do, not what we say," suggests a critical stance towards companies like Shell that may face scrutiny over the gap between their climate commitments and actual actions, indicating a consistent emphasis on accountability in the energy sector; this perspective, given his influential role as both ADNOC CEO and COP28 President, could pressure Shell to demonstrate tangible progress on sustainability, potentially impacting its reputation and strategic decisions, with a notably skeptical or negative sentiment towards mere rhetoric without substantive action.
