Shell and PetroChina's joint venture Arrow Energy will -expand its Surat Gas Project as it moves to capitalise on -
growing demand.
The expansion will be welcomed by Australia's energy industry, which is struggling to lock-in supplies along the 
country's east coast.
Arrow said it would expand the project in Queensland's Western Downs to produce 4000PJ of gas for the domestic 
market. The joint venture said 450 new gas -production wells, a new field compression station, 27km pipeline and 
road and infrastructure upgrades over two phases would be developed.
Arrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said first gas from the expansion has been targeted for 2026.
"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify 
Arrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast," he said.
The gas from the project would flow to the Shell-operated QCLNG liquefied natural gas facility on Curtis Island, 
near Gladstone, to meet long-term contracts and supply domestic customers, the joint venture partners said.
Shell integrated gas and upstream director Zoe Yujnovich said the expansion underscored its commitment to the 
domestic market. "QCLNG marked its 1000th cargo at the end of last year, reflecting its significance as a gas 
supplier for Australia and the region,' she said.
