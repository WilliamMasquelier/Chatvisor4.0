NRL star Jesse Ramien says his family will be forever indebted to supporters who contributed to the safe return of 
newborn baby Teo from a Bali hospital.
The Sharks centre has confirmed he and fiancee Shell are back in Australia after a traumatic fortnight, which 
included Teo needing to be resuscitated for five minutes after being born six weeks premature.
The harrowing experience led to a distraught Ramien contacting the Australian Embassy in Indonesia in a 
desperate attempt to source a care flight for their medically-induced baby back to Australia at an estimated cost of 
$130,000.
A GoFundMe page was set up by Ramien's friend Shavaun Hunt, the partner of Cronulla Sharks teammate Royce 
Hunt, to help fund the costs of getting the family back to Australia.
Just over $59,000 was raised by a huge contingent of NRL players. The general public also donated funds to aid 
the safe return home of Teo.
It is understood Ramien used care flight operator NETS to transport Teo home under the close watch of doctors.
"We're back home in Australia now and we just want to say thank you to all our friends, family and everyone who 
reached out, sent a message, liked, shared, donated and did anything to help out in anyway," Ramien said via his 
Instagram account.
"We couldn't have done it without everyone and we couldn't have got home without everyone's support." As first 
revealed by The Daily Telegraph, Shell was 33-weeks' pregnant and before leaving Sydney for the wedding of 
Cronulla player Briton Nikora, the couple secured clearance from Shell's obstetrician, as well as clearance from the 
airline and travel insurance cover for her pregnancy.
The ordeal unfolded when Shell went into early labour and needed to have an emergency C-section.

During this time, Shell had to be put under anaesthesia. Doctors then needed to revive their newborn son for five 
minutes until he started breathing.
