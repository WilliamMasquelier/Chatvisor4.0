Port Phillip Bay It's a highlight of the year for diver Violeta Hristova: the mass aggregation of Giant Spider Crabs in 
the shallows of Port Phillip Bay. Their cue is the full moon in June. That's when huge numbers of these native 
crabs, which grow up to 70cm across their long, spidery legs, march into shallow water to moult en masse. Like all 
crabs, they need to shed their old shell in order to grow, and while waiting for their new shell to harden - the soft-
shell phase - they're vulnerable to being gobbled up predators such as rays, sharks and octopus. (Let's face it, we 
all love soft-shell crab.) Aggregating in this way offers safety in numbers: each crab has a slightly better chance of 
not being eaten.
Where exactly in the bay they'll turn up around the June full moon is something that keeps divers guessing every 
year. And where these crabs go afterwards is a mystery: -marine -scientists don't know whether they hang out in 
the bay's deeper waters, or disperse throughout Bass Strait.
Hristova, 37, is pictured admiring last month's aggregation on the bay side of the Mornington Peninsula. "There 
were thousands of them, like a big red carpet," she says. She loves to observe the moulting process, in which each 
crab does what she describes as "a funny backwards shuffle" out of its old shell over the course of an hour or so.
Born in Sarajevo, Hristova was five when the Bosnian War broke out. She and her family fled, arriving in Australia 
as refugees. These days she's a disability worker ("It's very rewarding," she says) and also a musician, composing 
and performing under the name V Don Dada (the V's for Violeta, and "Don Dada" is Jamaican patois for boss, she -
explains; but mostly she just likes the cadence of it). She's been a -regular busker at Melbourne's Bourke Street 
Mall for years. It's a 90-minute drive each way from her home in -Preston to the Mornington Peninsula, but she 
does the journey every weekend in order to dive at spots like Blairgowrie, Sorrento and Rosebud. "It's what I live 
for," she says. "The ocean is my passion, my place of peace." The cold water is punishing in winter - even with a 
4mm wetty. But she's been saving up all those hard-earned busking dollars for a dream trip in a few months. "In 
October I'm going diving with tiger sharks in the Maldives!"
