Shell, PetroChina plan to expand Surat gas project

Shell and PetroChina will expand the huge Surat coal seam gas project in Queensland, a decision that will be met 
with dismay from environmental activists but which should provide supply for an increasingly stretched market.
Gas from the project extension will supply both domestic and export customers through the Queensland Curtis LNG 
plant near Gladstone.
The project, the second phase of the Arrow Energy joint venture, is expected to supply 130 million cubic feet a day 
of gas at peak production, enough to power almost 1 million homes.
The first phase of the project, some 90 billion cubic feet a year, began in 2020 and is now in production. It is 
expected to cost about $2 billion. Shell did not give an estimated cost for the second phase, but it is also expected 
to reach into the billions of dollars.
The decision to proceed with the second phase of the Arrow project follows increasingly urgent warnings from the 
Australian Energy Market Operator about the need for investment in new gas supply to head off shortages 
expected later this decade on peak-demand winter days.
"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to 
market," said Zoe Yujnovich, director of integrated gas and upstream for Shell.
"This investment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a lower-
emissions alternative."
Still, the drilling of the up to 450 new wells involved will only maintain existing supplies rather than increase 
production and does not address shortfalls that are looming because of declines in supplies in the southern states, 
said Rick Wilkinson, chief executive of consultancy EnergyQuest.
"This makes no change at all to the supply-demand balance and the requirement for new gas to come on for the 
east coast of Australia," he said.

Mr Wilkinson said that for the full development of the project, thousands of wells needed to be drilled, "so this is one 
step of many that are required for capital to be allocated to the project to maintain flat production".
Arrow, jointly owned by Shell and its Chinese state-owned partner, holds the largest reserve of undeveloped gas 
on the east coast, where elevated contract prices and a limited choice of supply have been sources of constant 
complaint among manufacturers.
Shell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said the project would support up to 400 jobs and create opportunities for 
contractors and local suppliers.
"At its core, this project promotes stronger regional communities, and it also has wider benefits for Australian 
manufacturing and industry more broadly," said Ms Wake.
Shell said the project was underpinned by a 27-year sales deal between Arrow and QGC, a division of the London-
based oil and gas giant. In investor briefings last year, the company flagged that it would secure additional gas for 
its LNG facilities in Queensland "to increase value for shareholders". The second phase of the project will require 
the construction of 27 kilometres of pipelines, as well as other infrastructure upgrades.
It is opposed by farming families and landholders in the Darling Downs, who said they were worried about the risk 
of damage to water and land. The project is also opposed by environmental groups, concerned about increased 
emissions from fossil fuel production.
The go-ahead comes despite years of annual losses by Arrow. The company had originally intended to develop four 
LNG export projects in Queensland but abandoned those plans after the first three plants were built.
Shell later took over BG Group in one of the biggest takeovers in the oil sector, giving it ownership of one of those 
three plants, Queensland Curtis LNG.
It opted to use gas from the Arrow project to instead supply that plant, a major facility near Gladstone, Queensland 
that was completed in 2014.
Arrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said production from this second phase was expected to start in 2026. 
Construction will begin later this year. Surat is expected to comprise up to 2500 gas wells and produce 4000 
petajoules of gas in total.
"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify 
Arrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast," Mr Peng said in a statement.

Shell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes
Shell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes

An apparent gas strike by energy giant Shell deep underground in onshore Queensland has fuelled industry hopes 
of a potential major new source of energy that could ease the threat of shortages in the tight east coast market.
Flames from a well drilled by Shell in the Taroom Trough at the southern edge of the Bowen Basin have stoked 
speculation that the little-known region could emerge as a new supply source that lies much closer to pipeline 
infrastructure than the Northern Territory's remote Beetaloo Basin.
The gas flare from the well, a photograph of which has been seen by The Australian Financial Review, signals one 
of the first instances of gas flowing to the surface in the region.
The Taroom Trough lies close to Queensland's gas hub at Wallumbilla, north-west of Brisbane, and wells being 
drilled are targeting unconventional gas at a depth of 2500-3500 metres, much deeper than coal seam gas wells.
While Shell declined to confirm the gas flow, MST Marquee energy analyst Saul Kavonic said the region, which he 
described as the most anticipated exploration play on the east coast over the next two years, held significant 
potential. "If they can prove horizontal wells work in this tight coal seam gas play, it could open up several more tcf 
[trillion cubic feet]) of gas for the east coast," Mr Kavonic said, noting ASX-listed juniors Elixir Energy and Omega 
Oil and Gas Ltd are also in the area.
"This is the only new exploration play with that potential, which is also close to infrastructure," he added, pointing to 
the greater infrastructure and funding constraints around large gas resources in the Beetaloo and the northern 
Bowen Basin.
Shell is drilling three appraisal wells in the area "as part of early-stage exploration in the Bowen Basin", a 
spokeswoman said. "The data will be analysed and will inform any further exploration."
The apparent early success comes as output from the east coast's biggest supply source for the domestic market, 
the mature Bass Strait petroleum fields held by ExxonMobil and Woodside Energy, has started to dive, risking 
shortfalls on gas on peak winter days, especially in Victoria.

Shell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes
Production from the Longford plant that processes Bass Strait gas plunged 18.2 per cent in the June quarter, 
according to consultancy EnergyQuest, noting that peak supply shortfalls hit the east coast in 2022 and again this 
past winter.
The firm said that exploration and appraisal success by Elixir and Omega was raising hopes that the Taroom 
Trough could be "a genuine new source of material supply to the east coast gas market and even backfill for 
Queensland LNG projects".
EnergyQuest CEO Rick Wilkinson said the flare reported at the Shell site "seems to indicate more gas is flowing 
than the vertical well tested recently by Elixir", which he said was a "good sign" for the application of horizontal well 
technology.
Accessing gas held in such deep sands typically requires the use of horizontal drilling - as used in the US shale 
gas industry - and fracking, a controversial process that helps gas to flow.
Elixir and Omega, between them, have almost 3 trillion cubic feet of "contingent resources" - an uncertain measure 
of resource - in "tight" sandstones in the Trough, while Shell advised the Queensland government in 2021 that its 
own acreage in the area could hold three tcf of gas resource, EnergyQuest said.
It said Shell's investment in a program of multiple, stimulated horizontal wells costing between $100 million and 
$200 million "adds a lot of credibility". Elixir, chaired by coal seam gas entrepreneur Richard Cottee, late last month 
reported a successful flow of gas to the surface from its Daydream-2 well in the area.
Omega, which is backed by Queensland coal seam gas pioneer Tri-Star Group and Brian Flannery's Ilwella Group, 
is now moving the rig used by Shell for its wells to its Canyon site where it expects to start drilling a well on 
September 20 to test the flow of gas in its acreage for the first time.
"If we're successful here this could be the next big wave of development post the coal seam gas wave," said 
Omega CEO Trevor Brown, a former vice president geoscience at Santos.
He said that while the Beetaloo Basin was more advanced in terms of proving up the flow of gas, the Taroom 
Trough had several compelling reasons that gave it a quantifiable commercial advantage.

Shell, the oil and gas giant with billions of dollars invested in Australia, says a dysfunctional and enormously 
complicated system of regulations is putting the transition to clean energy at risk even as it readies to spend big on 
renewables.
Shell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said obstacles for gas developments and large renewables projects 
threatened to derail progress towards 2030 climate targets.
Labor wants to cut carbon emissions by 43 per cent on 2005 levels by the end of the decade, a goal that appears 
increasingly unreachable.
"Right now, what we have is a dysfunctional, deharmonised patchwork quilt of regulations that really make it difficult 
to have successful investments," Ms Wake said in an interview.
"Many of the headwinds that we're seeing across our gas business, we are seeing replicated in the large-scale 
renewable part of the business."
The transition away from fossil fuels coal, oil and gas is heading towards another political brawl - like the one that 
consumed former Coalition and Labor governments. Delays in approvals and higher costs of construction have 
slowed the rollout of big renewable energy projects despite plenty of interest from global investors.
The Coalition has proposed a network of nuclear power stations as the best way to move away from fossil fuel as 
coal plants shut. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton will use a speech in Sydney today to again pitch nuclear power as 
a long-term renewable energy solution, hitting back at an attack on the plan last week by Energy Minister Chris 
Bowen.
While conceding nuclear power will have a "significant upfront cost", Mr Dutton will claim that the 80-year lifespan of 
each plant means they will outlast renewable electricity sources many times over. He will not, however, release any 
costings.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, however, is banking on mechanisms which incentivise the development of wind 
and solar projects to hit targets. That, the government says, can be supported by gas to ensure supply if demand 
surges.
Shell has long criticised the investment climate for gas. Ms Wake pointed to duplication between state and federal 
environmental approvals and "ambiguous" requirements on Indigenous consultation as some of the reasons for 
delays and higher costs.
But she said similar hurdles were now evident for wind and solar projects, putting at risk private investment needed 
to underpin the move away from fossil fuels.
"If we're going to reach net zero by 2050, for Australia to really thrive through the energy transition, we're going to 
need not one wave of investment, but a second, a third, a fourth, multiple waves of investment and what that 
requires is successful delivery of projects," she said. "We need a really harmonised set of regulatory settings so that 
we can deliver projects - whether they're in the gas or the renewables or firming space - predictably and deliver the 
lowest cost, most reliable, lowest-emissions energy."
London-listed Shell is one of the country's biggest energy players. It owns the Queensland Curtis LNG venture at 
Gladstone, one of the state's three large gas export projects. It owns gas power and solar plants, the ERM Power 
electricity retailer, which sells to business, and household energy retailer Powershop.
In the west, its portfolio includes the Prelude floating LNG plant, a stake in Chevron's Gorgon LNG venture, and a 
small holding in Woodside Energy's North West Shelf.
Ms Wake said the Australian business represented "quite a powerful microcosm" of a "balanced" energy transition, 
but added that funders of these projects had "choices on where to go", signalling Shell could look elsewhere if 
investing became too difficult.
These issues were raised by Clean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton in a speech earlier this month, 
when he described environmental and planning rules for wind farm development as "not fit for purpose" and one 
reason for a difficult year in 2023, when few decisions were made on whether to proceed with big projects.
The Clean Energy Council, which represents major renewable energy developers, has warned that a big increase in 
commitments for generation projects will be needed by the end of December to reach the level of work needed to 
hit government targets.
"We should have big expectations for the second half of this year," said Mr Thornton. "As a nation, we didn't do a 
great job of preparing for this complex transition. So we now need to draw on every ounce of tenacity to confront 
these challenges."
Ms Wake said the transition away from fossil fuel needed plenty of capital, urging governments to "leave the 
populism and the ideology and the party politics to one side and really get behind what is in Australia's best 
interests".
Ms Wake pointed to Shell's Crux LNG project in Western Australia as one that suffered from the fallout from the 
litigation over Indigenous consultation at Santos' Barossa gas project in the Timor Sea and Woodside's 
Scarborough LNG project.
The $3.6 billion Crux project, which was approved in 2022, is intended to supply replacement gas for Prelude LNG 
off the north-west coast. She said Shell had had to significantly broaden and lengthen consultation, taking in talks 
with 18 traditional owner groups even though none of the project infrastructure will come onshore.
"It felt to me like an example of additional complexity that added delay and costs to projects without delivering a 
significantly better outcome for traditional owner groups, and in fact, put a huge burden on them," she said of the 
project.Page 3 of 3

Shell's clean energy portfolio in Australia has almost 1.5 gigawatts of renewable generation and storage, including 
a 49 per cent interest in developer WestWind Energy, the Gangarri solar farm in Queensland, a battery in the NSW 
Riverina, and the Rangebank battery south-east of Melbourne, which is due online later this year.
But it has a bigger pipeline of projects, including a big battery at Wallerawang in NSW and a smaller storage project 
in WA's Wheatbelt region.
"There's another bit over a gigawatt of other battery projects that are there in the pipeline, so if we hit a permitting or 
a contracting roadblock on one of them, we can shuffle the deck in terms of the sequence," Ms Wake said.
In all, Shell aims to have 4GW of renewables and storage operating by 2032.

Shell takes earnings hit of up to $7.7bn in quarter

Shell said its fourth-quarter earnings took a hit of between $US2.5bn and $US4.5bn ($7.7bn) in impairments, offset 
by significantly higher gas trading, while its overall production volumes are on track to meet targets.
The London-based energy giant said the impairments were primarily driven by macro developments as well as 
portfolio choices, including its Singapore chemicals and products assets, which it has been trying to sell.
The FTSE 100 leader by market capitalisation also said it expected cash flow from operations to take a hit from a 
$US900m charge related to timing of payments of emissions.
Shell expects to report integrated gas production between 880,000 and 920,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day for the 
fourth quarter, which would be in line with its guided range of 870,000-930,000 BOE a day, and compares with 
third-quarter production of 900,000 BOE a day.
Fourth-quarter volumes of liquefied natural gas are expected to be between 6.9 million and 7.3 million tonnes 
compared with 6.9 million tonnes in the preceding quarter. Shell previously expected LNG volumes of 6.7 million-
7.3 million tonnes.
Gains from integrated gas trading are expected to be significantly higher quarter-on-quarter, while the trading result 
from chemicals and crude oil refineries is seen to be significantly lower. The former segment was expected to make 
an adjusted earnings loss, the company said.
However, the expected uptick in fourth-quarter gas trading comes despite declining oil and gas prices throughout 
the period, with oil hitting a five-month low in early December, reflecting supply and demand concerns despite 
support from geopolitical uncertainty.
Upstream production - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - is expected to meet the guided range of 1.75 
million to 1.95 million BOE a day at 1.83 million to 1.93 million a day. It reported 1.75 million BOE a day in the third 
quarter.

Elsewhere, Saudi Aramco said it would cut crude prices to all regions, including its largest market in Asia - a move 
that comes amid weaker global oil prices and increased production by producers outside the Organisation of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
After a summer rally attributed in large part to Saudi Arabia's decision to implement a production cut of one million 
barrels a day on top of existing cuts by other members of OPEC and its allies, including Russia, crude fell sharply in 
the fourth quarter. Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ have extended cuts into 2023.
West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, fell more than 21 per cent in the fourth quarter of the calendar 
year to post a 2023 decline of 10.7 per cent. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell around 19 per cent in the fourth 
quarter to lose 10.3 per cent in 2023. Dow Jones newswires

Shell expects to book up to $US2bn ($3bn) in post-tax impairments after delaying construction of a major biofuels 
plant as European energy majors grapple with weak market conditions, while trading in its core gas division is set to 
fall on quarter.
The British energy giant on Friday said it expected to book an impairment after tax of between $US1.5bn and 
$US2bn mainly due to pausing construction of its biofuels facility in Rotterdam as well as the divestment of its 
chemicals refinery in Singapore.
The paused construction of the Dutch biofuels plant - one of Europe's largest, set to produce 820,000 tonnes of 
biofuels a year - was largely due to weak European market conditions, with profit margins squeezed by a large drop 
in US renewable fuel-credits prices.
Shares in biofuels market leader Neste have shed nearly half their value this year, with the Finnish company in May 
cutting its renewable-fuel margin forecast. Shell's rival BP similarly paused biofuels investment at US and German 
oil refineries recently.
Shell expects to write down between $US600m and $US1bn on the asset, while the impairment after the sale of its 
Singapore refinery is expected to be $US600m-$US800m.
In addition, Europe's largest energy company expects trading results from its integrated-gas segment, usually its 
largest profit centre, to be lower than in the first quarter, when the unit booked $US3.68bn in adjusted earnings, due 
to seasonality.
However, it expects the unit's results to match those of the second quarter last year, when it booked $US2.5bn in 
adjusted earnings - a metric that strips certain commodity price adjustments and one-time charges.
The company also narrowed the segment's liquids and natural-gas production outlook slightly upward to 940,000- 
980,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day for the quarter, from a previously guided range of 920,000- 980,000 BOE a 
day.

Shell warns of $3bn impairment
Shell, the world's largest liquefied natural gas trader, expects its quarterly LNG volumes to be between 6.8 million 
and 7.2 million tonnes, compared with the prior-year's 7.2 million tonnes.
This would mean a decline from the first quarter's 7.6 million tonnes. However, gas prices in Europe have rallied in 
recent months on strong demand in Asia amid heatwaves and outages limiting supply, potentially providing a boon 
to Shell's quarterly results.
On the upstream side - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - Shell is expecting the unit to produce between 
1.72 million and 1.82 million BOE a day ready for sale, versus 1.70 million a year prior and 1.87 million in the first 
quarter. In the first quarter, the segment garnered $US1.93bn in adjusted earnings.

Energy giant Shell is suing Woodside Energy and Paladin Resources for $86.6m for the clean-up bill for the 
Northern Endeavour oil platform, saying it struck agreements almost two decades ago which absolved it of any 
responsibility to pay remediation costs.
The question of who should pay to remediate Northern Endeavour, on Western Australia's North West Shelf, and 
abandoned oil and gas projects more broadly, prompted the previous government to introduce laws to protect 
taxpayers from having to foot the bill, should operators not be able to meet their obligations.
Woodside sold the platform to junior operator Timor Sea Oil and Gas Australia in July 2015, however TSOGA was 
forced to shut down production over a safety issue and subsequently went into voluntary administration.
There were fears the federal government would have to step in and bear the cost of the clean-up. Instead new rules 
around trailing liability provisions were introduced, which could slug former owners of the licence areas with the bill, 
thereby putting the onus on them to do adequate due diligence should the assets change hands.
The exploration permit in the current matter was granted to Woodside, Shell and BHP Billiton Petroleum in 1997, 
with Woodside owning a half share and the other two companies one quarter each.
Production from the Laminaria and Corallina oilfields began in 1999. The writ filed with WA's Supreme Court says 
Shell then sold two-thirds of its interest to Woodside in March 2005, and one-third to British company Paladin.
Shell says in its claim that the agreement with each company "expressly provided ... that Woodside/Paladin is liable 
for all environmental, abandonment, reclamation, remediation and restoration claims". The claim says following the 
failure of TSOGA, neither that company nor its liquidator made any efforts to remediate the platform. Woodside was 
contacted for comment.

Energy giant Shell is suing Woodside Energy and Paladin Resources for $86.6m for the clean-up bill for the 
Northern Endeavour oil platform, saying it struck agreements almost two decades ago which absolved it of any 
responsibility to pay for remediation costs.
The question of who should pay to remediate Northern Endeavour, on Western Australia's North West Shelf, and 
abandoned oil and gas projects more broadly, prompted the Morrison government to introduce new laws to protect 
taxpayers from having to foot the bill, should operators not be able to meet their obligations.
Woodside had sold the platform to junior operator Timor Sea Oil and Gas Australia (TSOGA) in July 2015. The 
junior operator was forced to shut down production over a safety issue and subsequently went into voluntary 
administration.
There were fears the federal government would have to step in and bear the cost of the clean-up, with the Morrison 
government at one point floating the idea of a $250m-plus industry levy to pay for it.
Instead new rules around trailing liability provisions were introduced. These could slug former owners of the licence 
areas with the bills, thereby putting the onus on them to do adequate due diligence should the assets change 
hands.
"The trailing liability provisions will be an action of last resort when all other safeguards have been exhausted and 
will reduce the risk that the financial costs of decommissioning will be left to Australian taxpayers," the then-
resources minister Keith Pitt said at the time.
"It also sets the expectation that sellers will undertake appropriate due diligence before selling assets, titles and 
infrastructure, so they can avoid being called back to decommission and remediate title areas." The exploration 
permit in the current matter was granted to Woodside, Shell and BHP Billiton Petroleum in 1997, with Woodside 
owning a half-share and the other two companies one-quarter each.

The claim says following the failure of TSOGA, neither that company nor its liquidator made any efforts to remediate 
the platform.
"Thereafter the Commonwealth has commenced the process of decommissioning the Northern Endeavour and 
seabed infrastructure," the claim says.
Shell says it received notices of assessment in January 2023 and 2024, for $42.3m and $44.3m respectively, but 
says Woodside and Paladin are liable for those payments under the agreements struck in 2005.
Shell says it wrote to both companies in February last year and March this year, but Woodside denied liability for 
both payments via letter, while Paladin also refused to pay.
Shell is seeking the $86.6m in accrued payments to date, and "A declaration that Woodside/Paladin must 
indemnify Shell for, and hold it harmless against, any or all of the amounts for which Shell is in the future held to be 
liable to the Australian Taxation Office under the Offshore Petroleum Levy Act, plus all costs reasonably incurred by 
Shell with respect to that liability, including legal costs of and associated with this action." Woodside has been 
contacted for comment.

## Assistant

Angela Macdonald-Smith's coverage of Shell is largely neutral to positive, focusing on the company's gas projects and regulatory challenges. Her reporting highlights Shell's role in addressing energy supply concerns in Australia, with a generally factual tone that acknowledges both industry optimism and environmental opposition. Christian Moess Laursen takes a more negative stance, emphasizing Shell's financial struggles, including impairments and market challenges, with a focus on declining profits and strategic setbacks. His articles present Shell as facing significant financial headwinds. Cameron England's reporting is also negative but more legalistic, centering on Shell's lawsuit over environmental cleanup costs. His coverage portrays Shell as embroiled in legal disputes over financial responsibility rather than focusing on its broader business strategy.
