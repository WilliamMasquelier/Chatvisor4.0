The chief executive of Orsted, the multinational energy giant which is one of the UK's biggest offshore wind farm 
developers, has quit.
Mads Nipper will leave the Danish company after a series of vast writedowns and declining share prices in recent 
years.
Rasmus Errboe, his deputy, will take the top job on Saturday, the company said in a statement.
Orsted is developing the largest offshore wind farm in the world about 75 miles off the Norfolk coast in the North 
Sea.
Hornsea 3 is expected to be completed in late 2027, and will sit alongside 12 other wind farms either developed or 
part-developed by Orsted in the UK.
Between them, they can already generate enough electricity to power about six million homes.
But while the UK is pushing ahead with plans to develop wind farms as part of a push to reach net zero in the power 
system by 2030, the situation is more complicated in other countries.
The US, in particular, is a significant doubt for Orsted, after President Donald Trump said he would stop federal 
permission for new offshore wind projects.
The company took a 1.7 billion dollar hit on a project in the country earlier this month, amid rising costs to develop 
one of its wind farms.
"The impacts on our business of the increasingly challenging situation in the offshore wind industry, ranging from 
supply chain bottlenecks, interest rate increases, to a changing regulatory landscape, mean that our focus has 
shifted," said Lene Skole, the company's chair.

Mads Nipper, topman van de grote Deense producten van windmolens Ørsted, wordt direct vervangen na een 
serie zware financiële tegenvallers.
Dat meldt het bedrijf vrijdag. Nipper gold jarenlang als voorloper in de verduurzaming nadat regeringen hun 
handtekening onder het Klimaatakkoord van Parijs hadden gezet.
Ørsted moest recent echter opnieuw een groot aantal afschrijvingen doorvoeren, wat tot verliezen leidde bij het 
Deense bedrijf. Dat moest al honderden banen schrappen. De meest recente tegenvaller kwam na de afboeking 
van $1,7 miljard in de VS op een groot offshore windpark.
Trump schrapt projecten
De koers van het aandeel Ørsted kelderde onder zijn bewind met 80%.
Windparken wereldwijd stuiten nog steeds op hoge kosten en verzet tegen duurzame projecten, zoals in de 
Verenigde Staten, waar president Trump alle offshore windparken ’dead and gone’ heeft verklaard.
Trump stopt de federale vergunningverlening en geeft geen toegang meer tot gebieden voor ’groene gekte’ en laat 
meer olieboringen toe.
Daling koers

Onder Nipper, die de voorloper in de windsector vier jaar heeft geleid, ging de aandelenkoers van het bedrijf van 
1355 Deense kronen naar 277 kronen vrijdag. Na het bericht veerde de koers 2,4% op.
Nipper wordt vervangen door Rasmus Errboe, die verder op kosten zal gaan besparen en grote projecten die in de 
pijplijn zitten vlot moet trekken.
Rentelasten
„De gevolgen voor ons bedrijf worden steeds groter door de uitdagingen in de offshore windindustrie, variërend van 
knelpunten in de toelevering, renteverhogingen en politieke veranderingen”, zo meldt Lene Skole, voorzitter van de 
raad van commissarissen van Ørsted.
Het bedrijf, in 2006 opgebouwd door de fusie van zes Deense energiebedrijven, bouwde ’s werelds eerste offshore 
windpark in Denemarken in het begin van de jaren negentig. Sindsdien groeide zijn portefeuille met orders 
wereldwijd.
Ørsted werd symbool van de duurzaamheidsbelofte. Maar de technologie werd gekopieerd en in handen van 
buitenlandse concurrenten steeds goedkoper.
Hoge kosten
Tijdens de coronapandemie schoten de kosten van de nauwelijks te verkrijgen materialen en grondstoffen voor de 
turbines omhoog. Offshore ontwikkelaars wereldwijd gingen daarop in de lappenmand, maar boegbeeld Ørsted 
stuit intern bij aandeelhouders op de meeste kritiek wat tot het vertrek van Nipper heeft geleid.

Highlight: Orsted scrambles as soaring costs and delays hamper switch to renewables
Body
Britain’s biggest offshore wind developer has replaced its chief executive as the global shift to net zero falters. 
Ørsted, which operates 12 offshore wind farms across the UK and has four more in development, said Mads 
Nipper, its chief executive, will step down with immediate effect.
Mr Nipper, who joined the Danish company in 2021, will be replaced by Rasmus Errboe, who currently serves as 
deputy chief executive and chief commercial officer.
Ørsted is scrambling to turn around its fortunes as soaring costs and delays hamper the move to renewable energy 
sources.
The Danish company has taken a number of major writedowns in recent years  and shares have tumbled more than 
80pc from their peak in 2021.
Lene Skole, Ørsted’s chairman, said: “The impacts on our business of the increasingly challenging situation in the 
offshore wind industry , ranging from supply chain bottlenecks, interest rate increases, to a changing regulatory 
landscape, mean that our focus has shifted.
“Therefore, the board has today agreed with Mads Nipper that it’s the right time for him to step down and the board 
has appointed Rasmus Errboe to take over as chief executive.”
The downturn has already forced Ørsted, which is building the Hornsea 3 windfarm off the Norfolk coast, to cut 
hundreds of jobs and pull out of several international markets.
Ørsted has warned of a significant fall in its wind farm output, meaning it could build 1,500 fewer turbines.

Offshore wind developer axes boss as net zero stalls
The upheaval led to the departure  of the company’s former chairman, finance chief and chief operating officer last 
year. Mr Nipper survived that cull, vowing to “fight with everything I’ve got” to restore investor confidence.
But the company has taken a fresh blow as the outlook to the renewable energy sector darkens with the return of 
Donald Trump as US president.
Mr Trump, who has vowed to reverse the US’s policy on renewables and revert to oil and gas, has already signed 
an executive order suspending new leases for offshore wind.
Ørsted this month announced fresh writedowns of 12.1bn Danish krone (£1.4bn) on its US business, which it 
blamed on rising interest rates and market uncertainties.
Mr Nipper said: “Leading Ørsted through four challenging yet rewarding years has been a great privilege. Despite 
the obstacles we’ve faced, we’ve achieved many significant milestones, and I’m immensely proud of our colleagues’ 
efforts and dedication.”
Mr Errboe, who joined Ørsted in 2012, said: “Ørsted has a strong foundation with unique capabilities, and I’m 
looking forward to taking the lead on the transformation necessary to navigate the headwinds that Ørsted and our 
industry currently face.
“Offshore wind remains crucial for the green transition, and we’re deeply committed to pursuing our vision of a world 
that runs entirely on green energy.”

Le spécialiste danois des énergies renouvelables Ørsted, en difficultés, a annoncé vendredi la démission de son 
patron Mads Nipper et son remplacement par Rasmus Errboe, un dirigeant présent depuis 13 ans dans le groupe. 
«L'impact sur nos activités de la situation de plus en plus difficile du secteur de l'éolien en mer, qui va des goulets 
d'étranglement de la chaîne d'approvisionnement à l'augmentation des taux d'intérêt, en passant par l'évolution du 
paysage réglementaire, implique un changement d'orientation», a souligné la présidente de son conseil 
d'administration Lene Skole.
Le nouveau patron du groupe était jusque-là directeur général adjoint d'Ørsted. Le groupe danois doit affronter une 
situation complexe aux États-Unis où l'administration Trump a récemment gelé les permis d'exploitation des projets 
d'énergie éolienne. Ørsted a annoncé le 20 janvier d'importantes dépréciations (1,6 milliard d'euros) en raison de la 
hausse des taux d'intérêt et de retards dans un projet d'éolien en mer aux États-Unis. Ainsi le projet éolien offshore 
Sunrise Wind, à environ 30 miles à l'est de Montauk (État de New York, nord-est des États-Unis), fait face à des 
retards liés à la chaîne d'approvisionnement, représentant un tiers des dépréciations annoncées.
Un des rares géants du pétrole et du gaz à s'être transformé
Premier groupe à avoir investi massivement dans l'éolien en mer aux États-Unis, Ørsted avait remporté des projets 
à prix fixes dans un environnement de taux bas, qui sont devenus non-rentables sous l'effet combiné de la hausse 
des coûts de construction et des taux d'intérêt. Il a accumulé des retards et a dû renoncer aux projets Ocean Wind 
1 et 2, deux fermes éoliennes qui devaient être installées au large du New Jersey (nord-est).
Ørsted est l'un des rares géants du pétrole et du gaz à s'être transformé radicalement pour devenir un spécialiste 
des énergies renouvelables. Il est passé en moins de dix ans - de 2010 à 2019 - d'une production tirée 
essentiellement des énergies fossiles à une activité composée à 86% d'énergies renouvelables, mais ses déboires 
ont fait plonger le titre depuis 2021, au grand dam des investisseurs. Seule consolation, le géant pétrolier norvégien 
Equinor a acheté une part de 9,8% du groupe en octobre. Ørsted doit publier ses résultats annuels le 6 février.

De topman van Ørsted is opgestapt. 's Werelds grootste windparkbouwer zag kansen in de VS, maar dat blijkt een 
financieel ­fiasco. En onder Trump wordt het er niet beter op. 
Orla McDonald
Amsterdam
Het vertrek van ceo Mads Nipper bij het Deense Ørsted is een zoveelste poging om de grootste 
windparkontwikkelaar ter wereld uit de financiële malaise te krijgen. De recentste tegenslag is de keuze van 
president Donald Trump om een streep te zetten door windenergie, terwijl Ørsted juist vol heeft ingezet op 
uitbreiding in de VS. 
Sinds de verkoop van zijn olie- en gasdivisie in 2017 richt Ørsted zich op de bouw van wind- en zonneparken. Het 
is nu eigenaar van 27 operationele en 7 in aanbouw zijnde windparken op zee in de EU, het VK, Taiwan en de VS. 
In Nederland bezit Ørsted het grootste windpark op zee, bij Borssele. In 2018 begon de uitbreiding naar de VS met 
de over­name van Deepwater Wind en een plan om er tot 2030 $20 mrd in de offshore­sector te steken. Er draaien 
nu twee grote parken voor de oostkust en twee zijn er in aanbouw. 'Een tijd was de offshoresector in de EU 
lucratief', zegt Jasper Jansen, hoofd­econoom bij de Vereniging van Effectenbezitters. 'Ørsted stapte daar als 
eerste in, maar kreeg al snel concurrentie van spelers als Eneco en Siemens. Er waren steeds minder plekken op 
zee om te bouwen en EU-lidstaten schroefden subsidies terug. Ørsted wilde verder groeien in de VS. Dat blijkt nu 
een verkeerde keuze.' Trump heeft alle nieuwe vergunningen voor windparken op pauze gezet. Zijn koers is gericht 
op olie en gas. Dat betekent voorlopig het einde van offshorewind en devaluatie van door energiebedrijven 
verworven oceaanbodem. De dag na Trumps inauguratie kondigde Ørsted een afboeking aan van €1,6 mrd, onder 
meer op een oceaanbodemlease voor de kust van Maryland. Verder vrezen beleggers dat de offshoreparken 
Sunrise Wind en Revolution nooit worden afgebouwd. De koers van het bedrijf zakte die dag met 17%. Maar er zijn 
Page 2 of 2
Uitbreiding Ørsted naar VS blijkt achteraf verkeerde keuze
meer oorzaken van de financiële problemen. Inflatie, opgelopen rente en problemen in de toeleveringsketen zetten 
de sector al zeker drie jaar onder druk, in de VS, maar ook in de EU.  In 2021 noteerde Ørsted een recordkoers 
van DKr 1351 (€181); nu staat die 80% lager. 'De vraag naar groene stroom is door de energiecrisis enorm 
gestegen, maar de toeleveringsketen voor windparken kon niet snel genoeg meegroeien. Dat stuwde de prijzen', 
zegt Barbara Zuiderwijk van Green Giraffe, dat duurzame-energiebedrijven financieel adviseert. Ook heeft inflatie 
de bouwkosten opgejaagd en raakt de oplopende rente duurzame-energiebedrijven hard. Jansen: 'Shell heeft altijd 
gezegd dat op offshorewind niet genoeg rendement te maken is. Nu kosten en rente stijgen zie je inderdaad dat de 
sector kwetsbaar is.' Zuiderwijk: 'Het is onzeker hoe hard de vraag van de industrie naar groene stroom stijgt. Door 
problemen op het stroomnet en ontbrekende overheidssubsidies zijn bedrijven terughoudend met verduurzamen. 
Maar de windenergiesector durft alleen te investeren als die langetermijncontracten voor stroomlevering kan 
afsluiten.' In de EU zijn problemen beter op te vangen dan in de VS, zei Nipper na Trumps inauguratie. Ørsted trok 
zich terug uit de bouw van twee parken bij New Jersey.

- Ørsted's CEO, Mads Nipper, has resigned following a series of major financial setbacks, including significant asset write-downs and a sharp decline in the company's stock price. Under his leadership, Ørsted's share value plummeted by 80%, reflecting investor concerns over the company's financial health and strategic direction. His departure signals instability at the top levels of management, raising questions about Ørsted’s ability to navigate the ongoing challenges in the offshore wind sector. [The Independent, Alex Daniel, January 31, 2025]

- Ørsted has suffered a massive financial impairment of $1.7 billion due to rising costs and regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. offshore wind market. The company had heavily invested in expanding its presence in the U.S., but policy changes under President Donald Trump, including the suspension of federal permits for new offshore wind projects, have rendered many of these investments unviable. This financial hit has further weakened Ørsted’s position in the U.S. renewable energy sector. [De Telegraaf, Theo Besteman, January 31, 2025]

- Ørsted has been forced to cut hundreds of jobs and withdraw from several international markets due to financial difficulties. The company has warned that it may build 1,500 fewer wind turbines than originally planned, which could slow the global transition to renewable energy. These drastic measures highlight the severe financial strain Ørsted is under and raise concerns about its long-term viability in the offshore wind industry. [The Telegraph, James Warrington, January 31, 2025]

- Ørsted has announced fresh writedowns of 12.1 billion Danish kroner (£1.4 billion) on its U.S. business, citing rising interest rates and market uncertainties. This latest financial blow follows a series of impairments and project cancellations, further eroding investor confidence. The company’s stock has already lost more than 80% of its value since its peak in 2021, reflecting deep concerns about its financial stability. [The Telegraph, James Warrington, January 31, 2025]

- Ørsted’s offshore wind expansion strategy in the U.S. has turned into a financial disaster, with the company writing off €1.6 billion due to project delays and regulatory setbacks. The Sunrise Wind project, located off the coast of New York, has been particularly affected by supply chain disruptions and rising interest rates, leading to significant financial losses. This failure underscores the risks associated with large-scale offshore wind investments in an uncertain regulatory environment. [Lefigaro, Anonymous, January 31, 2025]

- Ørsted’s decision to expand aggressively into the U.S. offshore wind market has backfired, with the company now facing major financial losses and project cancellations. The return of Donald Trump to the presidency has resulted in a freeze on new offshore wind permits, effectively halting Ørsted’s expansion plans. The company has already written down €1.6 billion in assets and faces the possibility that key projects like Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind may never be completed. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Orla Mcdonald, February 01, 2025]

- Ørsted’s stock price has plummeted by 80% from its peak in 2021 due to a combination of rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory uncertainty. The company’s financial troubles have been exacerbated by inflation, higher interest rates, and difficulties in securing long-term contracts for its renewable energy projects. These challenges have forced Ørsted to scale back its ambitions and reconsider its investment strategy. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Orla Mcdonald, February 01, 2025]

- Ørsted is facing strong local opposition to its planned wind farm near Bad Orb, Germany, where a wellness company and local politicians are pushing for an alternative development project. Opponents argue that the wind farm would disrupt the region’s identity as a health and wellness destination, and they have launched an expensive media campaign to block the project. This resistance could lead to legal challenges and further delays, complicating Ørsted’s efforts to expand its onshore wind portfolio in Germany.
