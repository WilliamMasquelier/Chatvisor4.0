NRL player's son in ICU after premature birth in Bali NRL player Jesse Ramien and his fiancee Shell have made an 
impassioned plea for help from the Australian Government after their baby needed to be resuscitated for five 
minutes after being born six weeks premature at a Bali hospital.
"It's been as scary as any parent could imagine," Ramien said. The harrowing experience has led to a distraught 
Ramien contacting the Australian Embassy in Indonesia in a desperate attempt to source a care flight for their 
medically-induced baby boy Teo back to Australia at an estimated cost of $130,000.
A GoFundMe page has been set up by Ramien's friend Shavaun Hunt, the partner of Cronulla teammate Royce 
Hunt, to help fund the costs of getting the family back to Australia.
Both Shell and Ramien are yet to hold their newborn for fear of infection and have been left to view him in his 
incubator during two two-hour visiting slots during the morning and afternoon at the Siloam Hospital in Bali.
Ramien is so desperate to help his son, the Sharks centre said: "I'll play for nothing just to get our baby boy home 
safely.
"There's just so much uncertainty here.
"We've been told by doctors it could be four weeks before our baby is okay to travel, but that could quickly change 
to five, six, or seven weeks, who knows.
"We're doing everything to contact the Australian Embassy to see how we can get home both as quickly as 
possible, so that our boy can get the medical attention he needs." Cronulla CEO Dino Mezzatesta and the NRL are 
also working closely with Australian consulate officials to fast track the process.
Shell was 33 weeks pregnant when they left Sydney for Cronulla player Briton Nikora's wedding and was cleared 
by her obstetrician, as well as the airline and travel insurance cover for her pregnancy.
The ordeal unfolded when Shell went into early labour last Friday and needed an emergency C-section.

"That was so worrying being in another hospital in another country," Ramien said.
"I wasn't allowed into the room to be with Shell. It was difficult, especially for Shell." During this time, Shell had to 
be put under anaesthesia, with doctors then needing to revive their newborn son for five minutes until he started 
breathing, when he was born just after 11pm.
He was immediately rushed to the intensive care unit where he remains under close watch with the new parents 
unable to see their boy until 9am the following morning.
"It's been really hard to get some answers, because as every parent knows, you just want the best care for your 
baby, it's certainly been scary for Shell," Ramien said.
"The unfamiliarity of the medical system here and that ability to communicate our concerns in Bali only adds to the 
stress and emotion." NRL players Nicho Hynes, Blayke Brailey, Braden Hamlin-Uele, Connor Tracey, Hame Sele, 
Sitili Tupouniua and former player Denan Kemp have already donated to the Go Fund Me page. "We can't thank 
everyone for their care and generosity, we just want to see our baby home safely," Ramien said.
