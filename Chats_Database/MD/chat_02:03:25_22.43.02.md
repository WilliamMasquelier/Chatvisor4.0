 Opponents of offshore wind around the U.S. are pelting projects with lawsuits seeking to cancel them or tie them 
up for years in costly litigation.
The court cases represent another hurdle the nascent industry must overcome, particularly along the East Coast 
where opposition to offshore wind farms is vocal and well-organized. 
They add another pressure point for an industry already struggling with escalating prices, shaky supply chains, and 
a handful of highly publicized turbine failures that opponents are seizing on as proof that the structures are 
unreliable and unsafe, something the industry denies.
There are 13 cases pending in federal courts targeting offshore wind projects, according to the American Clean 
Power Association, an offshore wind trade group. An undetermined number of additional lawsuits are active in state 
courts, they said.
Robin Shaffer is president of Protect Our Coast NJ, a citizens group that has filed numerous lawsuits in New Jersey 
against two offshore projects currently or previously proposed. 
Shaffer said his group was at least partly responsible for scuttling two New Jersey wind farms proposed by Orsted 
that the Danish wind giant scrapped last October, saying they were no longer financially workable.
"An ancillary benefit of our legal strategy is to give pause or doubt in the minds of investors in the big corporations 
that are undertaking these projects," he said. "Last year, we saw Orsted leave its commitment to build Ocean Wind 
off the southern New Jersey coast amidst the uncertainty of two lawsuits we filed, as well as another filed by Cape 
May County."

Opponents cite altered views of the horizon from wind turbines and concerns about what the structures might do to 
marine life. They also cite rising projected prices for electricity generated from the wind farms, and point to recent 
turbine collapses off Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts and at Doggers Bank off the English coast as proof the 
technology is risky.
Supporters say offshore wind is necessary to combat climate change, which they call the principal threat to the 
ocean and its inhabitants.
"Offshore wind projects undergo rigorous environmental reviews and permitting processes, in addition to a lengthy 
public comment period," said Jason Ryan, a spokesman for the Clean Power Association. "The current slate of U.S. 
offshore wind projects under construction and development are among the most carefully planned and analyzed 
infrastructure projects in U.S. history; we are confident their permits will withstand legal scrutiny."
Paulina O'Connor, executive director of the New Jersey Offshore Wind Alliance, said offshore wind is needed to 
combat climate change.
"On the heels of one of the hottest summers on record, it is disappointing to see another frivolous lawsuit filed by 
those with opposing views," she said of the most recent lawsuit.
That action was filed Friday by Save LBI, another New Jersey citizen group. It claims that Atlantic Shores, the New 
Jersey project furthest along its state's approval path, would violate noise ordinances during pile driving and 
operation of hundreds of wind turbines. The group says it has several other lawsuits on the way. Atlantic Shores 
declined to comment.
Other litigation in New Jersey challenged Orsted's now-scrapped wind farm plan, a state tax break the company 
would have received, and even the placement of a power cable that would bring electricity from the project onshore. 
A group of Jersey Shore towns sued Atlantic Shores, and fishing and environmental groups sued two federal 
agencies overseeing offshore wind projects. They are appealing the dismissal of their suit after a judge ruled they 
had no legal standing to sue.
Offshore wind foes in other states are also turning to the courts.
In March, The National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative watchdog group in Virginia, sued Dominion Energy 
and the federal government hoping to block a wind farm off the coast of Virginia Beach. Dominion called the suit 
meritless and said it employs multiple layers of protection for the marine environment.
Last year, a Rhode Island nonprofit known for its seaside mansions sued the federal government challenging the 
permitting process for offshore wind energy projects off Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. The Preservation 
Society of Newport County said the presence of hundreds of wind turbines off the New England coast would ruin 
ocean views from several of its historic properties.
Also in Rhode Island, the anti-wind group Green Oceans sued the federal government in April, saying it illegally 
gave Orsted permits for its South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects. Orsted declined comment on the 
lawsuit but noted that South Fork is fully operational and Revolution recently installed its first turbine.
On the West Coast, the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians in Oregon, whose 
culture reveres the ocean, sued the federal government Tuesday over plans to hold an offshore wind energy 
auction next month.
And in March, fishermen sued California over plans for three floating wind farms.
