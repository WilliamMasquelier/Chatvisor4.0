Shell, one of Australia's largest foreign investors, has urged the federal government to remove duplication and 
inconsistency across state and national energy regimes to create a "single front door" across all energy projects in 
Australia.
Shell's country chair Cecile Wake told The Australian's Energy Nation Forum a more streamlined process should 
apply beyond renewable energy projects. Her comments come amid growing concerns around regulatory 
bottlenecks and environment planning delays that can stymie and delay energy project time lines.
"The renewable energy agreements that minister (Chris) Bowen was speaking about between himself and the state 
energy ministers, let's broaden them so that we deliver successful projects across the length and breadth of our 
economy," Ms Wake said. "Energy is the economy. Energy is the future. And we've got a great opportunity, but we 
mustn't â€¦ squander our traditional strengths." She said an agreement covering business, government and 
consumers was required to traverse the complex energy transition, which wouldn't happen without trade-offs, costs 
and difficult choices.
"We just need to have that clear-eyed, transparent dialogue." Ms Wake also noted the energy policy debate would 
need to broach subjects including incentives, subsidies and production credits.
Shell is one of the dominant players in Australia's -energy sector, operating the QCLNG export plant in 
Queensland, the Prelude floating LNG project off northern Australia and also has stakes in Western Australia's 
North West Shelf and Gorgon LNG ventures and gas business Arrow.
Ms Wake called for a pragmatic approach and a "shared vision" among stakeholders for the nation to best navigate 
and capitalise on the energy transition happening across markets globally.
"We need to stop demonising gas, we need to look more broadly than simply the â€¦ renewable penetration in the 
electricity mix, we need to look to biofuels. We need to at least have a conversation around nuclear," she said, 
noting Shell did not operate in the nuclear space as it wasn't a competitive strength.

Nation needs to 'streamline' its energy rules
Wednesday's forum was held amid rising speculation of an early election and a flare-up in the energy and climate 
wars. Large Australian and offshore-based companies are also positioning to benefit from burgeoning industries 
and policies that emerge as a result of the changes.
GrainCorp chief executive Robert Spurway told the forum it was up to government to get policy settings right, for 
industries such as biofuels, that would allow Australia to leverage its "natural advantage".
"If you take the canola seed we produce here, it has a carbon intensity benefit about 41 per cent better than the 
global average," he said. "There'll be efficiencies of scale at the right policy settings, but also some real natural 
advantage benefits that Australia can bring to this future industry." GrainCorp last week backed the federal 
government's launch of a consultation process assessing the incentives needed to develop an Australian renewable 
fuels industry.
Mr Spurway last week outlined that the nation's growers produce a surplus average up to 5 million tonnes of the 
oilseed exported annually over the last three years, with more than 60 per cent of that refined into biofuels.
GrainCorp is forging ahead with plans to expand its oilseed crush capacity and has aligned with IFM Investors, who 
are focused on establishing a domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sector as a significant manager of 
investments in Australian and global airports.
Ampol CEO Matt Halliday agreed with Mr Spurway on getting policy settings right for the biofuel sector.
"It's fair to say that what we're talking about from an advanced biofuels and a renewable fuels perspective, will not 
happen without the appropriate policy," he said. "Most of this feedstock today, from an agricultural point of view is 
exported, and that is largely because there is government policy support elsewhere." Mr Halliday noted production 
incentives were one measure that could level the playing field, as he also reiterated his view that government 
policies needed to encourage demand and stamp out additional cost to consumers.

2. Wake highlighted the importance of broadening renewable energy agreements to encompass all energy sectors, indicating that successful energy projects are crucial for the overall economy and future energy landscape in Australia.

3. The discussion at the forum included the necessity for a transparent dialogue among stakeholders regarding energy transition, which would involve trade-offs and difficult choices, underscoring the complexity of navigating the energy landscape.

4. Wake called for a shift in perception regarding gas, urging stakeholders to consider a wider range of energy sources, including biofuels and nuclear energy, despite Shell not being involved in the nuclear sector, indicating a need for diverse energy solutions.

5. The forum took place against a backdrop of rising speculation about early elections and ongoing debates in the energy and climate sectors, suggesting that Shell and other industry players are positioning themselves to adapt to potential policy changes and emerging market opportunities.
