## Assistant

Thomas Rustemeyer holds a negative stance towards acrylnagelproducten, as he associates them with allergic reactions and health concerns. His views appear consistent, as he repeatedly highlights the link between acrylates in nail products and allergic reactions, suggesting an ongoing concern rather than a changing perspective. His statements could negatively impact the reputation of acrylnagelproducten by raising awareness of potential health risks, potentially leading to consumer hesitation or regulatory scrutiny. A notable pattern in his sentiment is predominantly negative, as he emphasizes the adverse effects of these products, while his mention of irritation from other products like sanitary pads suggests a broader concern for allergens in consumer goods.
