You are tasked with extracting stakeholder information and direct quotes from a given news article related to Cisco. Your output should be in the form of a markdown table without column titles or any additional information. Each table row should contain:
1. The name of a real person who has expressed a quote in the provided article
2. His role or relation with regards to Cisco.
3. Their original quote about Cisco exactly as it appears in the article, without any modifications or translations

Guidelines:
- Include only real people: Exclude organizations, companies, or any other non-person entities
- Direct connection: Ensure that each selected individual is explicitly connected to Cisco or explicitly express his opinion on Cisco.
- Only include those whose statements are directly about Cisco
- Exclude individuals whose comments are not directly relevant to Cisco or are too general
- Pertinent stakeholders only: Only include the most relevant individuals
- Do not include stakeholders who are not directly associated with Cisco

Output Format Requirements:
- Each line must contain exactly two columns separated by "|" symbols
- Column 1: Stakeholder's name
- Column 2: Stakeholder's role or link to Cisco. If not described in the article, try to interpret its role. If it is not straightforward to interpret, mention "Not mentioned".
- Column 3: Original quote in its original language

Example of correct formatting:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision de Cisco est très importante." |
| John Smith | Cisco's CEO |"We need to review Cisco's proposal carefully." |
| Hans Weber | Financial analyst | "Die Strategie von Cisco ist überzeugend." |

If no relevant individuals with quotes are found, return "None."

SpaceX on the move Elon Musk's SpaceX is seeking to convert its business incorporation to Texas from Delaware. 
The Secretary of State of Texas on Wednesday issued a certificate evidencing the acceptance and filing of the 
conversion. The rocket company's move comes two weeks after a Delaware court ordered Musk to give up a Tesla 
compensation package valued at $US55.8bn. "Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware," Musk 
wrote on X following the court's decision, noting that shareholders would be able to vote on whether to move 
Tesla's incorporation to Texas.
Publishing spat Arena Group Holdings said it would continue publishing the print and digital editions of Sports 
Illustrated as it continued negotiating with the publication's owner, Authentic Brands Group. Arena, which also 
publishes TheStreet and Men's Journal, said there was an unresolved claim of $US45m against the company by 
Authentic, and it would continue to publish Sports Illustrated until the issue was resolved. The publisher previously 
missed a payment to Authentic, which licenses the Sports Illustrated brand to Arena. Under the publishing deal 
between the two, Authentic has the right to terminate its licensing agreement, which Authentic did. Arena on 
Wednesday also named Cavitt Randall as the company's next chief executive. Arena said in a regulatory filing that 
Randall was appointed chairman of the board January 23 and had previously served as CEO of investment firm 
MBX Clearing and operating chief of SI Capital. Randall, 46, has agreed to an annual salary of $US1, according to 
the filing.
Cisco axes staff Cisco Systems plans to cut about 5 per cent of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan to 
realign its business and enable further investment in key areas. The networking equipment company estimates it 
will recognise pre-tax charges of about $US800m, which will be primarily cash-based. It expects to take the majority 
of these actions in the third quarter and recognise about $US500m of these charges. Cisco expects about 
$US150m of the charges to be recognised in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and the remaining amount primarily 
through the first half of fiscal 2025. Cisco had about 84,900 employees as of July 29.
Morgan Stanley cuts Morgan Stanley plans to cut several hundred jobs in its wealth management division as new 
chief executive Ted Pick seeks to rein in costs in an area that is critical to the Wall Street firm's success but has 
shown signs of weakening lately. The cuts, which include a small number of managing directors as well as non-
customer-facing employees, are expected to hit less than 1 per cent of the wealth unit's employees, which number 
less than 40,000 in total. Affected employees are expected to be notified as soon as this week, according to people
