Previous summaries: - Ørsted has announced the suspension of its dividend payments until at least 2025, marking a significant shift in its financial strategy. The company had been consistently increasing shareholder payouts since 2016, but due to financial struggles, it has decided to halt these payments to focus on investments without raising additional capital. This move could negatively impact investor confidence and stock performance, as dividends are a key attraction for shareholders. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- The company has suffered a major financial setback, reporting an EBITDA of 18.7 billion Danish kroner (€2.5 billion) for 2023, which is below its projected range of 20-23 billion kroner. A significant portion of this shortfall is attributed to a 9.6 billion kroner provision for cancellation costs related to the termination of the Ocean Wind 1 project in the U.S. This financial underperformance highlights the challenges Ørsted faces in managing its offshore wind projects profitably.

The job cuts will have significant social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities, further highlighting the financial strain the company is under. [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]

- The company has announced a suspension of dividend payments until at least 2025, a move that could negatively impact investor confidence. Ørsted had previously been a reliable dividend payer, making this decision a major shift in its financial strategy. The suspension reflects the company’s urgent need to preserve capital amid mounting financial losses, but it may also deter investors who rely on dividends for returns. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]

- Ørsted’s market value has plummeted by 70% over the past three years, reflecting a severe loss of investor confidence.

These economic pressures have made it more difficult for Ørsted to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. The combination of these factors has contributed to the company’s financial downturn and forced it to reassess its investment strategy. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]

- Ørsted’s leadership has been in turmoil, with its chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company’s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning, further complicating Ørsted’s efforts to recover from its financial difficulties. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024] - Ørsted experienced a leadership crisis in late 2023, with the abrupt dismissal of its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Daniel Lerup and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Richard Hunter following a disastrous financial year. The company suffered a massive loss of €2.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to high write-offs from abandoned offshore wind projects on the U.S. East Coast.

Norway's Equinor has bought a 9.8 percent stake, valued at about $2.5 billion, in Danish offshore wind farm 
developer Orsted as it seeks to build out its renewable energy portfolio, Reuters reports.
Orsted shares have fallen 69% from their 2021 all-time high as the offshore wind sector has faced soaring costs 
and technical problems with turbines.
But Equinor said its stake acquisition was a long-term bet on the sector after the Norwegian company made slow 
progress in achieving its ambitious renewable energy targets.
The deal will be factored into Equinor's renewable energy portfolio , adding 1.7GW of clean generation capacity to 
the company's target of 12-16GW by 2030, Chief Executive Anders Opedal told Reuters .
By the end of 2023, the company had less than 1 GW of installed renewable capacity.
"We see this as a good countercyclical move at this time to get a very attractive portfolio," Opedahl added .
Orsted's share price rose more than 8% on the news before paring gains to rise 5.8% at 13:00 GMT. Equinor 
shares fell 3.9%.
Equinor said it does not plan to increase its stake by more than 10% and will not seek board representation.
The world's largest offshore wind developer was hit last year by costs and project delays as inflation pushed up 
prices for turbines and other equipment and services.
" The offshore wind industry currently faces a number of challenges, but we remain confident in the long-term 
prospects of the sector and the critical role offshore wind will play in the energy transition," he said.
Equinor's ownership position has been built over time through a combination of market purchases and block trades, 
the company said.

The investment makes Equinor the second largest shareholder in Orsted after Denmark.
In a bid to restore investor confidence, Orsted in February cut its investment and capacity targets and suspended 
dividend payments as part of a major review.
"Structurally, this does not change anything for the direction in which Orsted is moving ," said a Sydbank analyst. 
Jacob Pedersen .
He said the company had broad political support in Denmark and there was no sign that the state would give up its 
51% stake.
Denmark attracts Goldman Sachs as a strategic shareholder 10 years ago when the company, formerly DONG 
Energy , was focused on oil and gas. The Wall Street bank doubled its 8 billion crown investment just two years 
later when Orsted went public in Copenhagen in 2016. ( Enkorr )

On sait depuis Cervantès ce qu'il peut en coûter de s'attaquer aux moulins à vent. Juché sur ses 64 milliards 
d'euros de capitalisation boursière, Equinor n'a rien du Don Quichotte. Mais il a suffi d'un petit coup de vent sur la 
place d'Oslo (5,6 % pour son titre en deux séances) pour rappeler au pétrolier norvégien que les investisseurs ne 
sont pas avares de coups de pale.
Ceux-ci ont défalqué plus de 4,2 milliards d'euros de sa valeur, soit pas loin de deux fois le montant présumé (2,3 
milliards) de sa prise de participation de 9,8 % au capital du danoisOrsted. A l'inverse, ce soutien au champion 
européen des fermes éoliennes a été perçu, à travers la hausse de plus de 7 % de l'action en deux jours, comme la 
confirmation du tournant après les 3,6 milliards de dépréciations passées l'an dernier et la division par trois du titre 
par rapport aux sommets d'il y a trois ans et demi.
Un ticket avec décote
L'épisode montre que la Bourse n'aime toujours pas le mélange des genres pourtant cher à la Norvège. La patrie 
du « en même temps » énergétique réinvestit les cash-flows des hydrocarbures dans les renouvelables à travers, 
notamment, le contrôle de 67 % d'Equinor.
Elle profite ainsi d'une décote de 16 % sur la valeur du portefeuille d'Orsted, selon BofA, pour y prendre un ticket. 
Mais l'avenir de son pari dépendra d'un autre Etat, le Danemark, qui détient 50 % du capital d'Orsted. Une autre 
bataille de géants.

Het is een bijzonder gezicht. Op een kade in Vlissingen zijn mensen druk bezig om oesters vast te lijmen op een 
betonnen constructie. Met elastiekjes worden ze tijdelijk nog eens stevig aangedrukt. Het is het begin van een proef 
die moet leiden tot de rentree van oesterriffen in de Noordzee.
Het tafereel speelt zich af bij Ørsted, de bouwer en exploitant van windpark Borssele 1 en 2, dat voor de Zeeuwse 
kust ligt. Dagelijks vaart vanaf de kade bij het Vlissingse station een onderhoudsploeg richting het park. Woensdag 
neemt deze voor het eerst een extra lading mee. Het zijn betonnen structuren, tetrapods (vierpoten) genoemd, die 
zo'n vijftig kilogram per stuk wegen. De constructies zijn beplakt met oesters.
Comeback van de oester
Het gaat om een project van Ørsted samen met Van Oord, onder de naam Ocean Health. Zij werken aan een 
comeback van de oester. ,,Vroeger waren er heel veel oesterriffen in de Noordzee", vertelt Nienke Oostenbrink van 
Van Oord. ,,150 jaar geleden was 20 tot 30 procent van de zeebodem bedekt met de platte Europese oester. 
Oesterriffen zijn heel goed voor het ecosysteem. Ze filteren afvalstoffen uit het water en zorgen voor meer 
biodiversiteit."
Door verschillende oorzaken zijn de riffen vrijwel verdwenen, met alle gevolgen van dien voor het ecosysteem. 
Ocean Health probeert de Noordzee weer gezonder te maken. ,,De platte Europese oester is de soort die we willen 
herintroduceren."
Hechten aan harde materialen
Page 2 of 2
Waarom ze in Vlissingen oesters op een betonnen paal plakken
Het windmolenpark is daar bij uitstek de omgeving voor, zegt Oostenbrink. ,,We gaan volwassen oesters uitzetten. 
Die zijn reproductief, dus in de fase van hun leven waarin ze larven produceren. Die larven hechten zich alleen aan 
harde materialen, zoals stenen." De palen waarop de windmolens staan, zijn op de bodem omringd door stenen en 
die liggen ook op plekken waar kabels elkaar kruisen. ,,Daarom zijn windmolenparken heel geschikt. Bovendien zijn 
het relatief onverstoorde gebieden, want er is heel weinig scheepvaart en geen visserij. Dus er is ook geen kans dat 
er iets wordt beschadigd of opgevist."
Ørsted en Van Oord zijn al wat langer bezig om de Europese platte oester terug te brengen. Dat gebeurde tot nu 
toe met relatief grote constructies, waarbij een kraan nodig was om ze in het water te laten zakken. Dat maakte het 
bewerkelijk en kostbaar. Om die reden zijn nu de tetrapods ontwikkeld. Die zijn veel handzamer en kunnen worden 
meegenomen op de onderhoudsschepen. Eenmaal ter plekke worden ze overboord gezet.
Zeker tien jaar vastgeplakt
Hoe goed dat in de praktijk werkt, zal de komende jaren moeten blijken. Woensdag en donderdag worden tientallen 
exemplaren naar het windpark gebracht en op een diepte van 20 tot 25 meter uitgezet. De oesters zijn vastgeplakt 
met lijm die ervoor zorgt dat ze zeker tien jaar vast blijven zitten. ,,Eerst moet blijken of de structuren inderdaad op 
het steenbed landen en niet op het zand", zegt Oostenbrink. ,,Ook is de vraag of zij intact blijven. Je wil niet dat ze 
op één punt neerkomen en dat dan een been van zo'n tetrapod afbreekt. Daar hebben we ze ook al op getest, dus 
ik denk niet dat dat gebeurt, maar we moeten ook zien hoe dat in de praktijk gaat."
Vervolgens komt de belangrijkste vraag in beeld: hoe vergaat het de oesters? ,,We hebben een 
monitoringsprogramma van acht jaar. In die periode gaan we onder water videobeelden maken. Op basis daarvan 
kijkt een extern bureau: wat is de staat van de oesters? Zijn ze er nog allemaal? En vooral de grote vraag: hebben 
zij inderdaad larven geproduceerd die zich hebben gevestigd in de omgeving en zien we dus het ontstaan van 
oesterriffen? Dat is natuurlijk wat we hopen."

Canadian investment firm Brookfield buys stake in Orsted UK Wind Farms for $2.3 billion, one of the largest deals 
in the sector this year.
The deal marks a significant expansion of Brookfield , one of the world's largest investors in the energy transition, 
into offshore wind. It is also the manager's first investment in the sector in the UK. The announcement of a major 
investment in an area critical to the UK's economic growth has been a boost for Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead 
of Wednesday's budget announcement.
The purchase will give Brookfield a minority stake in four operating offshore wind farms. It comes at a critical time 
for Orsted , as the Danish renewable energy company tries to prove to investors that the market still wants offshore 
wind.
Orsted's share price fell sharply last year due to rising costs and supply chain problems related to the company's 
plans to build offshore wind farms in the United States, Bloomberg reports .
This is the second major sign of investor interest in Orsted and its assets this month after Norwegian oil and gas 
company Equinor ASA announced it would buy a stake in the company for $2.5 billion ( Angi.ru )

Highlight: Former Bank of England governor takes a 12.45pc stake in Britain’s biggest wind farms
Body
Mark Carney’s Brookfield Group has bought a £1.8bn stake in four of the UK’s largest wind farms.
The Canada-based asset manager is taking a 12.45pc stake in the North Sea wind farms, which have a collective 
capacity of 3.5 gigawatts (GW) – roughly enough to power 3m homes. Brookfield is purchasing the stake from 
troubled Danish energy giant Ørsted.
Mr Carney, who was governor of the Bank of England  from 2013 to 2020, is now chairman of Brookfield Asset 
Management, which has built up a £60bn UK investment portfolio. He retains strong links with the Labour Party and 
especially with Chancellor Rachel Reeves. 
The deal, which was announced on the same day as Ms Reeves’ inaugural Budget, marks Brookfield’s first move 
into the UK’s offshore wind market.
The transaction includes stakes in the Hornsea 1 and Hornsea 2 wind farms , which are both in the North Sea, and 
the Walney Extension and Burbo Bank Extension projects in the Irish Sea. The deal is expected to close by the end 
of this year.
Mr Carney has long been a strong supporter of investment in clean energy. He was instrumental in making the 
Bank of England focus on the implications of climate change while at the institution.
Brookfield’s support for offshore wind comes as Energy Secretary Ed Miliband seeks to radically expand Britain’s 
renewable energy infrastructure in an effort to decarbonise the country’s electricity grid by 2030. 
Connor Teskey, chief of Brookfield Renewable and president of Brookfield Asset Management, said the company 
was “supporting the country’s decarbonisation objectives”.

He added: “This is Brookfield’s first investment in UK offshore wind, which will continue to be a critical part of the 
energy mix and to support the growing demand we see for clean energy.”
Wind farms are proving increasingly attractive for investors because the UK’s Contract for Difference (CfD) system 
guarantees a minimum price for the power they generate, underwritten by consumer bills. All four farms Brookfield 
is investing in have CfD contracts.
Under the deal Ørsted will retain a 37.55pc ownership interest in the wind farms and will operate and maintain 
them.
For Ørsted, the deal is part of a wider battle to restore investor confidence. Earlier this year it announced that it was 
trimming its investment and capacity targets, pausing dividend payouts and divesting assets, as part of a major 
review following a period of poor performance.
Ørsted has also kicked off a search to raise capital for Hornsea 3, a massive 2.9GW wind farm planned for the 
North Sea that is expected to cost about £9bn. Options include selling a 50pc stake in advance of construction
Mads Nipper, group President and chief executive of Ørsted, said: “We’re pleased to welcome Brookfield, a leading 
renewable energy investor with proven investment and operational expertise, as a partner in four UK offshore wind 
farms in one of Ørsted’s core strategic markets.
“Today’s transaction is an important milestone in the farm-down programme as part of our business plan, 
supporting our significant re-investment in new assets.”
Brookfield’s other UK holdings include Checkatrade, the online trade directory  connecting homeowners with 
tradespeople such as plumbers and electricians.
It also has a 25pc stake in First Hydro, which runs the pumped hydro storage system at Dinorwig in Snowdonia. 
Water is pumped uphill to a reservoir in the Welsh mountains during times of low electricity demand and then 
released to spin electrical turbines when demand surges.
It also has stakes in Westinghouse, a global nuclear business  that owns the Springfields site in Lancashire, the 
UK’s only nuclear fuels manufacturing centre.
Brookfield’s backing of Britain comes as Mr Carney helps the new administration to attract international investment.
The former Bank governor made a star appearance in a video shown at Labour’s 2023 conference praising Ms 
Reeves, then the shadow chancellor, and subsequently advised her on setting up a National Wealth Fund.
More controversially, it recently emerged that he had used his connections to lobby ministers  to relax rules on heat 
pump subsidies to the potential benefit of Homeserve, a heating and plumbing company also owned by Brookfield.
Brookfield has said Mr Carney did not raise the issue in meetings where he was representing the company.

- Ørsted has suffered another financial setback due to delays in its Revolution Wind project in the U.S., which has resulted in a financial impairment of over half a million euros. The delay in connecting the wind farm to the grid has pushed back the project’s timeline by a year, adding to the company’s ongoing financial struggles. This setback further exacerbates Ørsted’s difficulties in managing large-scale offshore wind projects efficiently and profitably, raising concerns about its ability to meet its renewable energy targets. [Energie & Management, Georg Eble, October 07, 2024]

- Ørsted’s stock price has plummeted by 69% from its all-time high in 2021 due to soaring costs and technical problems with turbines. The offshore wind industry has faced significant financial challenges, and Ørsted has been particularly affected by rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, and project delays. These issues have severely impacted investor confidence, forcing the company to cut investment and capacity targets while suspending dividend payments in an attempt to stabilize its finances. [Business World Agency, Anonymous, October 08, 2024]

- Ørsted’s financial troubles have made it an acquisition target, with Norwegian oil and gas giant Equinor purchasing a 9.8% stake in the company for approximately $2.5 billion. While Equinor frames the acquisition as a strategic move to expand its renewable energy portfolio, the purchase highlights Ørsted’s weakened financial position and vulnerability to external takeovers. The deal also raises concerns about the increasing influence of fossil fuel companies in the renewable energy sector, potentially altering Ørsted’s long-term strategic direction. [Les Echos, Les Echos, October 08, 2024]

- Ørsted has been forced to sell a significant stake in its UK offshore wind farms to Brookfield for $2.3 billion. This asset divestment is part of the company’s broader effort to restore investor confidence after a sharp decline in its stock price due to rising costs and supply chain problems. While the sale provides Ørsted with much-needed liquidity, it also reduces its ownership in key renewable energy assets, potentially weakening its long-term market position in the offshore wind sector. [Business World Agency, Anonymous, October 30, 2024]

- Ørsted’s financial struggles have led to a major restructuring effort, including the trimming of investment and capacity targets, the suspension of dividend payments, and the sale of assets. These drastic measures reflect the severe financial strain the company is under, as it struggles with rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and higher interest rates. The restructuring raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to maintain its leadership in the offshore wind sector while managing its financial instability.
