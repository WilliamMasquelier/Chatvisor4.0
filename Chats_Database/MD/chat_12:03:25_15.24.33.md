## System

You are a helpful assistant!

## User


You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| Wael Sawan | Shell's CEO | "there is too much uncertainty at the moment in the energy transition trajectory". | N.A. |
| Wael Sawan | Shell's CEO | "there is going to be a multidimensional energy system in the future, [and] oil and gas will continue to have an important role in stabilising that system for a long, long, long time to come". | N.A. |
| Wael Sawan | Shell's CEO | "We are trying to focus our company, our organisation, and our shareholders on a waypoint that's much clearer ... which is 2030." | N.A. |
| Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber | COP28 President, oil executive | "We are what we do, not what we say." | N.A. |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Shell.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Shell or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
