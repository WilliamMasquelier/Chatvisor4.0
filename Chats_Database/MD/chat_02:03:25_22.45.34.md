Highlight: Orsted scrambles as soaring costs and delays hamper switch to renewables
Body
Britain’s biggest offshore wind developer has replaced its chief executive as the global shift to net zero falters. 
Ørsted, which operates 12 offshore wind farms across the UK and has four more in development, said Mads 
Nipper, its chief executive, will step down with immediate effect.
Mr Nipper, who joined the Danish company in 2021, will be replaced by Rasmus Errboe, who currently serves as 
deputy chief executive and chief commercial officer.
Ørsted is scrambling to turn around its fortunes as soaring costs and delays hamper the move to renewable energy 
sources.
The Danish company has taken a number of major writedowns in recent years  and shares have tumbled more than 
80pc from their peak in 2021.
Lene Skole, Ørsted’s chairman, said: “The impacts on our business of the increasingly challenging situation in the 
offshore wind industry , ranging from supply chain bottlenecks, interest rate increases, to a changing regulatory 
landscape, mean that our focus has shifted.
“Therefore, the board has today agreed with Mads Nipper that it’s the right time for him to step down and the board 
has appointed Rasmus Errboe to take over as chief executive.”
The downturn has already forced Ørsted, which is building the Hornsea 3 windfarm off the Norfolk coast, to cut 
hundreds of jobs and pull out of several international markets.
Ørsted has warned of a significant fall in its wind farm output, meaning it could build 1,500 fewer turbines.

The upheaval led to the departure  of the company’s former chairman, finance chief and chief operating officer last 
year. Mr Nipper survived that cull, vowing to “fight with everything I’ve got” to restore investor confidence.
But the company has taken a fresh blow as the outlook to the renewable energy sector darkens with the return of 
Donald Trump as US president.
Mr Trump, who has vowed to reverse the US’s policy on renewables and revert to oil and gas, has already signed 
an executive order suspending new leases for offshore wind.
Ørsted this month announced fresh writedowns of 12.1bn Danish krone (£1.4bn) on its US business, which it 
blamed on rising interest rates and market uncertainties.
Mr Nipper said: “Leading Ørsted through four challenging yet rewarding years has been a great privilege. Despite 
the obstacles we’ve faced, we’ve achieved many significant milestones, and I’m immensely proud of our colleagues’ 
efforts and dedication.”
Mr Errboe, who joined Ørsted in 2012, said: “Ørsted has a strong foundation with unique capabilities, and I’m 
looking forward to taking the lead on the transformation necessary to navigate the headwinds that Ørsted and our 
industry currently face.
“Offshore wind remains crucial for the green transition, and we’re deeply committed to pursuing our vision of a world 
that runs entirely on green energy.”
