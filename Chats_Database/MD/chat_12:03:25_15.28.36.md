You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| Shell | Energy company | "China is significantly increasing its LNG import capacity and aims to add piped gas connections for 150 million people by 2030 to meet increasing demand." | N.A. |
| Meg O'Neill | Woodside chief executive | "If just 20 per cent of Asia's coal-fired power stations switched to gas, it would reduce carbon emissions by 680 million tonnes a year." | N.A. |
| Christopher Doleman | Analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis | "LNG prices would likely need to fall into the $US4-5 range to compete with coal, a level that is too low for LNG facilities to earn an adequate rate of return." | N.A. |
| Tom Allen | UBS analyst | "We expect a tight LNG market in 2025 with global balances estimated to be in deficit ... before moving into balance in 2026 and an accelerating surplus from 2027." | N.A. |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Shell.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Shell or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
