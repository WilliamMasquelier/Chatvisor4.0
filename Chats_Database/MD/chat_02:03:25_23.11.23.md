Body
Renewable energy company Ørsted (Nasdaq Copenhagen: ORSTED) announced on Wednesday that it has 
entered into a partnership with Stonepeak, an alternative investment firm, to divest its equity ownership stake in four 
US onshore wind farms with a total capacity of 957 MW for approximately USD300m.
The deal, part of Ørsted's farm-down programme, marks the company's second major divestment of multiple 
assets in the US. Stonepeak will receive 80% of the cash distributions, while Ørsted continues to operate the 
portfolio. Ørsted, retaining a unilateral call option, plans to recycle capital for future renewable energy projects. The 
deal underscores Ørsted's flexible approach to divestments and capital redeployment.
The wind farms include Ford Ridge Wind (Illinois), Helena Wind, and Western Trail Wind (Texas), and Sunflower 
Wind (Kansas), collectively providing 957 MW across ERCOT, MISO and SPP markets. All projects have 
operational power purchase agreements. Ørsted manages the partnership and offers asset management services.
David Hardy, EVP and CEO of Region Americas at Ørsted, highlighted the deal's significance in delivering value to 
investors and funding projects aligning with Ørsted's growth in the renewable energy sector. The divestment allows 
Ørsted to maximize capital redeployment while maintaining operational control and long-term flexibility.
Stonepeak's View: Anthony Borreca, Senior Managing Director at Stonepeak, expressed confidence in Ørsted's US 
onshore assets, emphasizing their potential positive impact on communities. Stonepeak, with approximately 
USD61.1bn in assets under management, aims to contribute to the energy transition through strategic investments 
in hard-asset businesses.

for future projects.
Ørsted's extensive portfolio, comprising nearly 6 GW of onshore wind, solar, and battery storage projects in the US, 
contributes to the company's vision of a world running entirely on green energy. The renewable energy giant 
maintains its position as a global leader in climate action, evident through its validated science-based net-zero 
emissions target.
Headquartered in Denmark, Ørsted had a revenue of DKK 79.3bn (EUR10.6bn) in 2023. Stonepeak, based in New 
York, manages approximately USD61.1bn in assets and focuses on infrastructure and real asset investments
