Previous summaries: - Ørsted has announced the suspension of its dividend payments until at least 2025, marking a significant shift in its financial strategy. The company had been consistently increasing shareholder payouts since 2016, but due to financial struggles, it has decided to halt these payments to focus on investments without raising additional capital. This move could negatively impact investor confidence and stock performance, as dividends are a key attraction for shareholders. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- The company has suffered a major financial setback, reporting an EBITDA of 18.7 billion Danish kroner (€2.5 billion) for 2023, which is below its projected range of 20-23 billion kroner. A significant portion of this shortfall is attributed to a 9.6 billion kroner provision for cancellation costs related to the termination of the Ocean Wind 1 project in the U.S. This financial underperformance highlights the challenges Ørsted faces in managing its offshore wind projects profitably. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has decided to cut its renewable energy project targets by at least 24%, reducing its planned capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This reduction signals a retreat from its previous ambitious expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The company is also exiting several emerging offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, limiting its future growth opportunities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- The company is implementing significant job cuts, with up to 800 positions being eliminated globally. The first phase will see 250 layoffs in the coming months. These job losses reflect the financial strain Ørsted is under and could have negative social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted’s market capitalization has plummeted by more than 70% since its peak in early 2021, when it was valued at over €76.5 billion. The company, once the third-largest utility in Europe, now ranks 14th in the sector, with a market value of just €16 billion. This dramatic decline underscores the financial instability and investor concerns surrounding the company. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has incurred massive financial losses, posting around £2.2 billion in losses for 2023. The company has also written off £3.3 billion from its wind farm business, reflecting the severe financial difficulties it faces. These losses are largely due to the abandonment of several offshore wind projects in the U.S., which resulted in billions in impairments. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]

- The company’s financial struggles have forced it to scale back offshore wind projects, which could result in the construction of 1,500 fewer wind turbines than originally planned. This reduction in capacity could slow the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure and impact global climate goals. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted’s chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, is stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company’s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]

- The company has faced significant challenges in the U.S. market, particularly in securing tax credits for its offshore wind projects. Last year, Ørsted canceled two major offshore wind projects, Ocean Wind I and II, due to rising costs, resulting in a financial hit of 28.4 billion Danish kroner (£3.3 billion). These cancellations highlight the financial and regulatory difficulties of expanding renewable energy in the U.S. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for the company to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]

- The company’s financial troubles have led analysts to speculate that it may need to seek additional funding from investors. However, instead of raising capital, Ørsted has opted for cost-cutting measures, which could prolong financial uncertainty and increase risks for the company’s future stability. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has been forced to implement a drastic austerity plan, including a comprehensive review of its project portfolio. The company is prioritizing projects with the highest potential returns while reducing risks in development and execution. This shift in strategy indicates a retreat from aggressive expansion and a more cautious approach to investment. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024]

- The company’s decision to exit key offshore wind markets, including Spain, Portugal, and Norway, as well as to deprioritize certain activities in Japan, represents a significant contraction of its global footprint. This retreat could weaken its competitive position in the rapidly growing offshore wind sector. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024] - Ørsted has suffered a massive financial loss, reporting a net loss of 2.7 billion euros for 2023. This marks a significant downturn from the previous year when the company had recorded a profit of approximately 2 billion euros. The losses stem largely from the cancellation of major offshore wind projects in the U.S., including Ocean Wind 1 and 2, which resulted in impairments of 3.8 billion euros. Additionally, the company has set aside 1.5 billion euros in provisions for potential compensation payments related to these canceled projects. This financial instability raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to sustain its aggressive expansion strategy in the renewable energy sector. [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]

- Ørsted has been forced to implement drastic cost-cutting measures, including the elimination of 600 to 800 jobs worldwide. This decision is part of a broader austerity plan aimed at reducing fixed costs by 130 million euros by 2026. The job cuts will have significant social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities, further highlighting the financial strain the company is under. [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]

- The company has announced a suspension of dividend payments until at least 2025, a move that could negatively impact investor confidence. Ørsted had previously been a reliable dividend payer, making this decision a major shift in its financial strategy. The suspension reflects the company’s urgent need to preserve capital amid mounting financial losses, but it may also deter investors who rely on dividends for returns. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]

- Ørsted’s market value has plummeted by 70% over the past three years, reflecting a severe loss of investor confidence. The company, once a leader in the offshore wind sector, has seen its stock price decline sharply due to financial struggles, project cancellations, and rising costs. This decline in market capitalization raises concerns about Ørsted’s long-term viability and its ability to attract new investments. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]

- The company has been forced to scale back its renewable energy ambitions, reducing its planned offshore wind capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This represents a significant retreat from its previous expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The reduction in capacity means fewer wind turbines will be built, potentially impacting the broader offshore wind industry. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024]

- Ørsted has exited several key offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, as part of its cost-cutting strategy. This retreat limits the company’s future growth opportunities and weakens its competitive position in the rapidly expanding offshore wind sector. The decision to withdraw from these markets reflects the financial pressures Ørsted is facing and its need to focus on more profitable projects. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024]

- The company has incurred significant financial losses due to the cancellation of major offshore wind projects in the U.S. The abandonment of Ocean Wind 1 and 2 alone resulted in a financial hit of 3.7 billion euros. These cancellations were driven by rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and higher interest rates, which made the projects financially unviable. The failure to complete these projects raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. [de Volkskrant, Marc van Den Eerenbeemt, February 08, 2024]

- Ørsted’s financial struggles have forced it to sell off assets worth 15 billion euros in an effort to stabilize its balance sheet. This asset divestment strategy indicates the severity of the company’s financial difficulties and its need to generate liquidity. However, selling off key assets could weaken Ørsted’s long-term growth potential and reduce its influence in the offshore wind sector. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]

- The company has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have significantly increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for Ørsted to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. The combination of these factors has contributed to the company’s financial downturn and forced it to reassess its investment strategy. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]

- Ørsted’s leadership has been in turmoil, with its chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company’s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning, further complicating Ørsted’s efforts to recover from its financial difficulties.

Orsted will mit zwei neuen Chefs aus der Krise
Interims-COO Andrew Brown, bislang Vorstandsmitglied von Orsted, zieht sich Ende März vollständig aus dem 
operativen Geschäft zurück. Er soll auf Empfehlung des Verwaltungsrats als Vizechef in das Kontrollorgan 
aufrücken, die erforderliche Wahl steht auf der Jahreshauptversammlung am 5. März an.
Trond Weslie gibt für Orsted seinen aktuellen Posten des Vorstandsvorsitzenden von Arendals Fossekompani auf, 
einer industriellen Investmentgesellschaft aus Norwegen. Zuvor regelte er bereits die Finanzen bei anderen 
börsennotierten, weltweit tätigen Unternehmen, etwa beim Logistiker Möller-Maersk (Dänemark), bei den 
Telekommunikationsunternehmen Veon (Niederlande) und Telenor (Norwegen) sowie beim norwegischen 
Bohrtechnik-Konzern Aker Solutions (früher Aker Kvaerner).
Der neue COO Patrick Harnett macht Karriere innerhalb von Orsted, er rückt von der derzeitigen Position des 
Head of European Execution Programmes auf. Als solcher trug er die Verantwortung etwa für den Offshore-
Windpark „Hornsea II“ vor der britischen Ostküste. Dieser Meerespark kam bei seiner Inbetriebnahme 2022 auf 
eine Leistung von 1.386 MW und war damit der weltweit größte. Er wird vermutlich 2027 als Rekordhalter von 
„Hornsea III“ abgelöst, der auf 2.852 MW kommt.
Von Patrick Harnett erwartet Orsted, das neue Projekt-Betriebsmodell zum Erfolg zu führen. Es sieht nach den 
enormen Verlusten nun ein stärkeres Risikomanagement, eine Notfallplanung und eine bessere Steuerung vor.

Renewable energy company Ørsted (Nasdaq Copenhagen: ORSTED) announced on Wednesday that it has 
entered into a partnership with Stonepeak, an alternative investment firm, to divest its equity ownership stake in four 
US onshore wind farms with a total capacity of 957 MW for approximately USD300m.
The deal, part of Ørsted's farm-down programme, marks the company's second major divestment of multiple 
assets in the US. Stonepeak will receive 80% of the cash distributions, while Ørsted continues to operate the 
portfolio. Ørsted, retaining a unilateral call option, plans to recycle capital for future renewable energy projects. The 
deal underscores Ørsted's flexible approach to divestments and capital redeployment.
The wind farms include Ford Ridge Wind (Illinois), Helena Wind, and Western Trail Wind (Texas), and Sunflower 
Wind (Kansas), collectively providing 957 MW across ERCOT, MISO and SPP markets. All projects have 
operational power purchase agreements. Ørsted manages the partnership and offers asset management services.
David Hardy, EVP and CEO of Region Americas at Ørsted, highlighted the deal's significance in delivering value to 
investors and funding projects aligning with Ørsted's growth in the renewable energy sector. The divestment allows 
Ørsted to maximize capital redeployment while maintaining operational control and long-term flexibility.
Stonepeak's View: Anthony Borreca, Senior Managing Director at Stonepeak, expressed confidence in Ørsted's US 
onshore assets, emphasizing their potential positive impact on communities. Stonepeak, with approximately 
USD61.1bn in assets under management, aims to contribute to the energy transition through strategic investments 
in hard-asset businesses.

The value of the deal is approximately USD300m, with Ørsted having previously raised USD700m in tax equity 
proceeds for the portfolio. The transaction aligns with Ørsted's farm-down approach, optimizing capital utilization 
for future projects.
Ørsted's extensive portfolio, comprising nearly 6 GW of onshore wind, solar, and battery storage projects in the US, 
contributes to the company's vision of a world running entirely on green energy. The renewable energy giant 
maintains its position as a global leader in climate action, evident through its validated science-based net-zero 
emissions target.
Headquartered in Denmark, Ørsted had a revenue of DKK 79.3bn (EUR10.6bn) in 2023. Stonepeak, based in New 
York, manages approximately USD61.1bn in assets and focuses on infrastructure and real asset investments 
globally.

Body
America's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm is officially open, a long-awaited moment that helps pave the 
way for a succession of large wind farms.
Danish wind energy developer Ørsted and the utility Eversource built a 12-turbine wind farm called South Fork 
Wind 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Montauk Point, New York.  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul  will be on Long 
Island Thursday to announce that the turbines are delivering clean power to the local electric grid. Interior Secretary 
Deb Haaland  is expected to attend. 
Achieving commercial scale is a turning point for the industry, but what's next? Experts say the nation needs a 
major buildout of this type of clean electricity to address climate change. 
Offshore wind is central to both national and state plans to transition to a carbon-free electricity system. The Biden 
administration has approved six commercial-scale offshore wind energy projects, and auctioned lease areas for 
offshore wind for the first time off the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico coasts. New York picked two more projects last 
month to power more than 1 million homes. 
This is just the beginning, Hochul said. She said the completion of South Fork shows that New York will 
aggressively pursue climate change solutions to save future generations from a world that otherwise could be 
dangerous. South Fork can generate 132 megawatts of offshore wind energy to power more than 70,000 homes. 
“It’s great to be first, we want to make sure we’re not the last. That’s why we’re showing other states how it can be 
done, why we're moving forward, on to other projects,” Hochul told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview 
before the announcement. 
“This is the date and the time that people will look back in the history of our nation and say, ‘This is when it 
changed,’” Hochul added.

The United States has its first large offshore wind farm, with more to come
Ørsted CEO Mads Nipper called the opening a major milestone that proves large offshore wind farms can be built, 
both in the United States  and in other countries with little or no offshore wind energy currently. 
With South Fork finished, Ørsted and Eversource are turning their attention to the work they will do offshore 
beginning this spring for a wind farm more than five times its size. Revolution Wind will be Rhode Island and 
Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes next year. 
The site where the cable will connect in Rhode Island is already under construction.
In New York, the state said last month it would negotiate a contract with Ørsted and Eversource for an even larger 
wind farm, Sunrise Wind, to power 600,000 homes. The Norwegian company Equinor was picked for its Empire 
Wind 1 project to power more than 500,000 New York homes. Both aim to start providing power in 2026. 
After years of planning and development, 2024 is a year of action— building projects that will deliver sizeable 
amounts of clean power to the grid, said David Hardy, group executive vice president and CEO Americas at 
Ørsted.
Ørsted, formerly DONG Energy, for Danish Oil and Natural Gas, started aggressively building wind farms off the 
coast of Denmark, the U.K. and Germany in 2008. The company sold off the North Sea oil and gas assets on which 
it had built its identity to focus on clean energy, becoming Ørsted. It’s now one of the biggest wind power 
developers.
The first U.S. offshore wind farm was supposed to be a project off the coast of Massachusetts known as Cape 
Wind. A Massachusetts developer proposed the project in 2001. It failed after years of local opposition and 
litigation. 
Turbines began spinning off Rhode Island’s Block Island as a pilot project in 2016. But with just five of them, it’s not 
a commercial-scale wind farm.
Last year brought challenges for the nascent U.S. offshore wind industry, as Ørsted and other developers canceled 
projects in the Northeast that they said were no longer financially feasible. High inflation, supply chain disruptions 
and the rising cost of capital and building materials were making projects more expensive as developers were trying 
to get the first large U.S. offshore wind farms opened. 
Industry leaders expect 2024 to be a better year, as interest rates come down and states ask for more offshore 
wind to meet their climate goals. 
The nation's second large offshore wind farm, Vineyard Wind, is expected to open later this year off the coast of 
Massachusetts, too. The first five turbines are providing power for about 30,000 homes and businesses in 
Massachusetts. When all 62 turbines are spinning, they'll generate enough electricity for 400,000 homes and 
businesses. Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners are the joint owners of that project.
The Biden administration wants enough offshore wind energy to power 10 million homes by 2030. Interior Secretary 
Haaland said in a statement that "America’s clean energy transition is not a dream for a distant future— it's 
happening right here and now.”

Body
In the Arizona  desert, a Danish company is building a massive solar farm that includes batteries that charge when 
the sun is shining and supply energy back to the electric grid when it's not. 
Combining batteries with green energy is a fast-growing climate solution.
“Solar farms only produce when the sun shines, and the turbines only produce when the wind blows,” said Ørsted 
CEO Mads Nipper. “For us to maximize the availability of the green power, 24-7, we have to store some of it too.” 
The United States is rapidly adding batteries, mostly lithium-ion type, to store energy at large scale. Increasingly, 
these are getting paired with solar and wind projects, like in Arizona. The agencies that run electric grids, utility 
companies and developers of renewable energies say combining technologies is essential for a green energy 
future. 
Batteries  allow renewables to replace fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, while keeping a steady flow of power when 
sources like wind and solar are not producing. For example, when people are sleeping and thus using less 
electricity, the energy produced from wind blowing through the night can be stored in batteries — and used when 
demand is high during the day. 
Juan Mendez, a resident of Tempe, Arizona, gets power from local utility Salt River Project, which is collaborating 
with Ørsted on the Eleven Mile Solar Center. As a state senator, Mendez pushed SRP to move to renewable 
energies.
He thinks the power company is still investing too much in gas and coal plants, including a major expansion 
planned for a natural gas plant in Coolidge, Arizona, near the solar center.

Across the US , batteries and green energies like wind and solar combine for major climate solution
“This solar-plus-storage is a good step, but SRP needs to do more to provide clean energy and clean up our air and 
help address climate change," Mendez said. 
The utility said it’s adding more renewables to its energy mix and recently pledged to zero out its emissions by 
2050. 
The U.S. has the second most electrical storage in the world, after China. In 2023, the U.S. added an estimated 7.5 
gigawatts — 62% more than in 2022, according to the BloombergNEF and the Business Council for Sustainable 
Energy factbook. That amount can power 750,000 homes for a day and brings the total amount of installed capacity 
nationwide to nearly enough for 2 million homes for one day, according to BloombergNEF.
In the U.S., California  leads in energy storage as it aggressively cuts greenhouse gas emissions. It has twice as 
much as any other state. Residential, commercial and utility-scale battery installations increased by 757% there 
over just four years, meaning there's now enough to power 6.6 million homes for up to four hours, according to the 
California Energy Commission. 
That's partly because in 2013, the California Public Utilities Commission told utilities to buy energy storage with a 
target to be met by 2020. Since then, power companies have continued to add more batteries to help the state meet 
clean electricity requirements. 
Southern California Edison is one utility adding thousands of hours of energy storage. It is putting in solar-plus-
batteries to replace some power plants that burn natural gas and would typically supply electricity in the evening. 
“If it’s just clean and not reliable, you really don’t have anything,” said William Walsh, vice president for energy 
procurement and management. “We need both.”
In California, batteries proved their value in September 2022, as the West was experiencing a long heat wave that 
sent temperatures into the triple digits. Electricity demand reached the highest the state had ever seen on Sept. 6, 
2022, as people cranked up air conditioners. 
Walsh credits the batteries added to the grid between 2020 and 2022 with helping to avoid blackouts. Two years 
earlier, there were rolling electricity outages in California during a similar extreme heat wave.
Texas has the second-most battery storage after California. Last month, Schneider Electric  announced it's teaming 
up with energy company ENGIE North America on solar and battery systems in Texas to get closer to the French 
multinational’s 100% renewable energy goal in the U.S. and Canada. Before the Inflation Reduction Act, a major 
climate law passed in 2022, the deal and the necessary $80 million investment would not have been possible, said 
Hans Royal, Schneider Electric's senior director for renewable energy and carbon advisory. 
Royal is advising other global Fortune 500 companies it works with to get into the market.
“The industry needs that, the grid needs it," said Royal. 
Back in Arizona, Ørsted’s Eleven Mile Solar Center covers 2,000 acres in rural Pinal County. It has 857,000 solar 
panels and more than 2,000 cubes that look like large shipping containers but contain battery modules. Ørsted also 
has large solar and storage projects in Texas and Alabama, and in Europe.
When the Arizona facility opens this summer, most power from the solar farm will go to Facebook owner Meta's 
data center in Mesa. The solar power not needed by Meta, in addition to the power stored in the batteries, will go to 
the local utility's customers. The new batteries can ensure power to roughly 65,000 homes during peak hours of 
demand.
“What I think is exciting is just how rapidly this market is moving," said Yayoi Sekine, head of energy storage at 
BloombergNEF. “There's so much pressure for the U.S. and different regions to decarbonize, and storage is one of 
the major technologies to enable that. There's a lot of momentum." Page 3 of 3

- Ørsted experienced a leadership crisis in late 2023, with the abrupt dismissal of its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Daniel Lerup and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Richard Hunter following a disastrous financial year. The company suffered a massive loss of €2.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to high write-offs from abandoned offshore wind projects on the U.S. East Coast. This leadership shake-up reflects the severity of Ørsted’s financial struggles and raises concerns about stability at the top levels of management. Frequent executive turnover can disrupt strategic planning and investor confidence. [Energie & Management, Volker Stephan, February 27, 2024]

- Ørsted has been forced to divest a significant stake in its U.S. onshore wind farms, selling off equity ownership in four wind farms with a total capacity of 957 MW for approximately $300 million. This marks the company’s second major asset divestment in the U.S., highlighting its need to generate liquidity amid financial difficulties. While Ørsted retains operational control, the sale indicates that the company is struggling to maintain its ambitious renewable energy expansion without offloading assets. Such divestments could weaken its long-term market position in the U.S. renewable energy sector. [Nordic Business Report, Anonymous, March 13, 2024]

- Ørsted and other offshore wind developers faced significant financial challenges in 2023, leading to the cancellation of multiple projects in the U.S. Northeast. High inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising costs of capital and building materials made these projects financially unviable. These cancellations represent a major setback for Ørsted’s U.S. expansion strategy and could slow the overall growth of offshore wind energy in the country. The inability to complete these projects raises concerns about the company’s financial resilience and its capacity to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably.
