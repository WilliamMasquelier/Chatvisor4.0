Shell expects to book up to $US2bn ($3bn) in post-tax impairments after delaying construction of a major biofuels 
plant as European energy majors grapple with weak market conditions, while trading in its core gas division is set to 
fall on quarter.
The British energy giant on Friday said it expected to book an impairment after tax of between $US1.5bn and 
$US2bn mainly due to pausing construction of its biofuels facility in Rotterdam as well as the divestment of its 
chemicals refinery in Singapore.
The paused construction of the Dutch biofuels plant - one of Europe's largest, set to produce 820,000 tonnes of 
biofuels a year - was largely due to weak European market conditions, with profit margins squeezed by a large drop 
in US renewable fuel-credits prices.
Shares in biofuels market leader Neste have shed nearly half their value this year, with the Finnish company in May 
cutting its renewable-fuel margin forecast. Shell's rival BP similarly paused biofuels investment at US and German 
oil refineries recently.
Shell expects to write down between $US600m and $US1bn on the asset, while the impairment after the sale of its 
Singapore refinery is expected to be $US600m-$US800m.
In addition, Europe's largest energy company expects trading results from its integrated-gas segment, usually its 
largest profit centre, to be lower than in the first quarter, when the unit booked $US3.68bn in adjusted earnings, due 
to seasonality.
However, it expects the unit's results to match those of the second quarter last year, when it booked $US2.5bn in 
adjusted earnings - a metric that strips certain commodity price adjustments and one-time charges.
The company also narrowed the segment's liquids and natural-gas production outlook slightly upward to 940,000- 
980,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day for the quarter, from a previously guided range of 920,000- 980,000 BOE a 
day.

Shell warns of $3bn impairment
Shell, the world's largest liquefied natural gas trader, expects its quarterly LNG volumes to be between 6.8 million 
and 7.2 million tonnes, compared with the prior-year's 7.2 million tonnes.
This would mean a decline from the first quarter's 7.6 million tonnes. However, gas prices in Europe have rallied in 
recent months on strong demand in Asia amid heatwaves and outages limiting supply, potentially providing a boon 
to Shell's quarterly results.
On the upstream side - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - Shell is expecting the unit to produce between 
1.72 million and 1.82 million BOE a day ready for sale, versus 1.70 million a year prior and 1.87 million in the first 
quarter. In the first quarter, the segment garnered $US1.93bn in adjusted earnings.
