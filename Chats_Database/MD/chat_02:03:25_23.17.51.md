Canadian investment firm Brookfield buys stake in Orsted UK Wind Farms for $2.3 billion, one of the largest deals 
in the sector this year.
The deal marks a significant expansion of Brookfield , one of the world's largest investors in the energy transition, 
into offshore wind. It is also the manager's first investment in the sector in the UK. The announcement of a major 
investment in an area critical to the UK's economic growth has been a boost for Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead 
of Wednesday's budget announcement.
The purchase will give Brookfield a minority stake in four operating offshore wind farms. It comes at a critical time 
for Orsted , as the Danish renewable energy company tries to prove to investors that the market still wants offshore 
wind.
Orsted's share price fell sharply last year due to rising costs and supply chain problems related to the company's 
plans to build offshore wind farms in the United States, Bloomberg reports .
This is the second major sign of investor interest in Orsted and its assets this month after Norwegian oil and gas 
company Equinor ASA announced it would buy a stake in the company for $2.5 billion ( Angi.ru )
