In the market for a new suitcase? There's a big choice to be made right from the get-go, between hard-shell or soft-
sided luggage. Soft-sided luggage was once the big seller but most of the cases flopping onto the baggage 
carousels these days are hard-shell. Each has its pros and cons.

Materials and durability
Soft-sided luggage is most commonly made from one of several versions of woven nylon, which might be ripstop, 
cordura or ballistic.
They're all heavy-duty and durable but cordura is softer and more durable and performs better in puncture tests 
while ballistic is smooth and glossy and more resistant to scuffs and scratches than cordura.
Ripstop is less common, it gets its name from the way the fabric is woven in a crosshatch pattern at intervals, 
making it more resistant to tears. It's lighter than both cordura and ballistic nylon but it looks more industrial.
The material of choice for hard-side cases these days is polycarbonate, a strong, tough thermoplastic that 
maintains its rigidity in very high or low temperatures. It's also lightweight and flexes without cracking, making it 
ideal for suitcases that might get rough treatment in the baggage hold.
Some high-end hard-shell cases are constructed from sheets of polycarbonate with an aluminium skeleton which 
makes them both durable and relatively light. Aluminium cases are more frequently seen on the baggage carousels 
these days, although this probably has more to do with fashion than functionality.
Aluminium dents and scratches but for connoisseurs that only adds to its rugged good looks, and many 
manufacturers will replace damaged panels and wheels. As a far more expensive material, it commands a price of 
up to $2000 for a top-of-the-line model. Unless you plan to do a lot of travelling over the next 20 years, it's a 
questionable investment. A quality hard case costs a quarter the price, and a decent soft case can be had for half 
the price of a hard model.

Hard or soft, light or heavy-duty: Which is the best suitcase for you?
Weight is not likely to be a factor in anyone's choice between hard and soft luggage, except for metal cases. A soft-
sided case weighs less than a hard-shell case of equivalent size but not by much. A soft case with a capacity of 85 
litres might weigh 2.8 kilograms but a polycarbonate hard case the same size will probably weigh just half a kilo 
more.
If absolute minimum weight is what you're after, it's hard to go past a wheeled duffle. The Eagle Creek Migrate 
Wheeled Duffel Bag weighs in at just 2.27 kilograms yet it swallows a massive 110 litre payload.
Heaviest of all are metal cases. Even though they're made from aluminium, a metal suitcase takes a big bite out of 
your checked baggage allowance. The Rimowa Check-in L (large) weighs 6.2 kilograms, and even its downsized 
brother, the Rimowa Check-in M (Medium) is no lightweight at 5.4 kilograms. These cases are fine if you're 
travelling in a style in which others handle your bags but if you're going to be schlepping your own luggage on and 
off trains and buses, a metal case might not be the best choice.
Hard-shell cases do a better job of protecting whatever might be inside. If you're travelling with camera gear or 
bottles of wine, the extra insulation that comes with a hard case buys you peace of mind. Even so, it's best to 
surround fragile items with soft clothing that will absorb impact if they come in for rough treatment. Although they're 
not totally water and dust resistant, hard cases do a better job of withstanding rain, snow and spills. There are no 
integrated locks on soft-sided cases, but a small padlock does the same job. However zips can be prised apart 
without too much difficulty. If security is an issue, a hinged metal case offers massively better protection.

Two wheels good, four wheels better
Most hard cases have four wheels, soft-sided luggage usually has two. Those four wheels are typically 360-degree 
spinners which makes it a breeze to manoeuvre even heavy cases through crowded airport terminals, railway 
stations and anywhere else they're on a smooth surface. If it's rough underfoot - pavements, cobblestoned streets - 
you'll probably find it easier to tip your case onto two wheels and the advantages of four wheels are nullified.
Hard-shell cases split down the middle and open into two equal halves, the so-called clamshell design. So 
ubiquitous is the clamshell that it's unusual to find hard cases that open any other way. This makes it easy to pack 
and unpack the two halves. Soft-sided luggage has a zipper that opens around the top and you might have to dig to 
find what you're looking for. Also, packing is not so neat as with a hard case.

Both hard and soft cases can often be expanded by a few extra litres by opening a zip on top of the case, allowing 
you to cram just a little more inside. Even though a hard and soft case might have the same capacity, the soft 
version has slightly more give. If you find yourself sitting on your case to close it, a soft case will serve you better.
