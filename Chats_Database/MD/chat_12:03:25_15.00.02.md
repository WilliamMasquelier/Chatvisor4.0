Shell said its fourth-quarter earnings took a hit of between $US2.5bn and $US4.5bn ($7.7bn) in impairments, offset 
by significantly higher gas trading, while its overall production volumes are on track to meet targets.
The London-based energy giant said the impairments were primarily driven by macro developments as well as 
portfolio choices, including its Singapore chemicals and products assets, which it has been trying to sell.
The FTSE 100 leader by market capitalisation also said it expected cash flow from operations to take a hit from a 
$US900m charge related to timing of payments of emissions.
Shell expects to report integrated gas production between 880,000 and 920,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day for the 
fourth quarter, which would be in line with its guided range of 870,000-930,000 BOE a day, and compares with 
third-quarter production of 900,000 BOE a day.
Fourth-quarter volumes of liquefied natural gas are expected to be between 6.9 million and 7.3 million tonnes 
compared with 6.9 million tonnes in the preceding quarter. Shell previously expected LNG volumes of 6.7 million-
7.3 million tonnes.
Gains from integrated gas trading are expected to be significantly higher quarter-on-quarter, while the trading result 
from chemicals and crude oil refineries is seen to be significantly lower. The former segment was expected to make 
an adjusted earnings loss, the company said.
However, the expected uptick in fourth-quarter gas trading comes despite declining oil and gas prices throughout 
the period, with oil hitting a five-month low in early December, reflecting supply and demand concerns despite 
support from geopolitical uncertainty.
Upstream production - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - is expected to meet the guided range of 1.75 
million to 1.95 million BOE a day at 1.83 million to 1.93 million a day. It reported 1.75 million BOE a day in the third 
quarter.

Elsewhere, Saudi Aramco said it would cut crude prices to all regions, including its largest market in Asia - a move 
that comes amid weaker global oil prices and increased production by producers outside the Organisation of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
After a summer rally attributed in large part to Saudi Arabia's decision to implement a production cut of one million 
barrels a day on top of existing cuts by other members of OPEC and its allies, including Russia, crude fell sharply in 
the fourth quarter. Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ have extended cuts into 2023.
West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, fell more than 21 per cent in the fourth quarter of the calendar 
year to post a 2023 decline of 10.7 per cent. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell around 19 per cent in the fourth 
quarter to lose 10.3 per cent in 2023. Dow Jones newswires

British oil major Shell has suspended all shipments through the Red Sea indefinitely after US and UK strikes on 
Yemen's Houthi rebels triggered fears of further escalation, according to sources.
The West's targeting of the Iranian-ally militia came after the Houthis launched dozens of missiles and drones at 
commercial vessels around the Red Sea and the nearby Bab el-Mandeb. The militia has said the attacks are in 
response to the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip.
About 12 per cent of total global seaborne oil trade goes through the Red Sea. Last month, a tanker chartered by 
Shell to move Indian jet fuel was targeted by a drone in the Red Sea and harassed by Houthi boats, according to 
shipping officials.
Shell declined to comment on the suspension of transit and the attack. But the company last week halted all 
crossings over concerns that a successful -attack could trigger a massive spill in the region, as well as present risks 
to the safety of crews on the ships, sources said.
Shell joins other global shippers in deciding to avoid the Red Sea, including other energy companies.
BP last month said it would pause all shipments through the key shipping lane, and Qatar Energy did the same this 
week.
Qatar, which has acted as a mediator for the Houthis in the past, halted the use of the Red Sea route for its 
liquefied natural gas exports for fear of being caught in the conflict, according to a Qatari energy official and 
shipping trackers.
Recent Houthi attacks, initially directed against Israeli-linked vessels, have rattled global markets, upended 
international shipping routes and become more indiscriminate. The rebels have attacked vessels from 
containerships to tankers moving sanctioned Russian oil, as the global shipping nexus complicates their ability to 
identify specific targets.

They have vowed to continue their campaign against US and international targets in the region in response to 
Israel's actions in Gaza. "Anyone attempting to hinder us from doing so will fail," a Houthi official said on Monday. 
After the US-led strike, several captains of chartered vessels heading for Europe via the Suez Canal have refused 
to enter the Red Sea, forcing them to sail through a lengthy route around southern Africa. The Singapore ship 
registry and Intertanko, an industry lobby group, said the waterway should be avoided.

Leaders Paul Keating reserves special praise for visionary change-makers in banking, mining and 
entrepreneurship, writes Michael Stutchbury.
When asked to name the business people who impressed him the most during his long political career, Paul 
Keating starts with Keith Campbell, former head of the Hooker real estate company. Campbell's landmark financial 
system review in the late 1970s laid out the intellectual case for Labor's financial deregulation and the floating of the 
dollar.
Rod Carnegie, now 91, also draws praise from Keating in an exclusive interview with The Australian Financial 
Review to mark his 80th birthday. Carnegie set up McKinsey in Australia and sought to Australianise CRA, now 
known as Rio Tinto, as CEO in the 1980s. "He was a progressive thinking guy and an economic nationalist," 
Keating says.
On the other hand, it's hard to pick a banker given the banks hold public licences, Keating says.
Another on Keating's list of business greats is former BHP boss Marius Kloppers, who "broke the back" of 
negotiating contract pricing in 2010 in favour of using market spot prices for Australia's iron ore exports. "You've got 
to give him big, big marks for that," Keating says.
Pressed about his complaint about a lack of outward-looking entrepreneurs in the modern Australian economy that 
he helped create, Keating accepts there are some. He points to Fortescue Minerals' Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest, 
along with Atlassian founders Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, and Canva founders Melanie Perkins and 
Cliff Obrecht.
But the business person that merits a story is Ian McLennan, general manager and chairman of BHP between 1967 
and 1977. McLennan helped drive the company's search for oil in Bass Strait and gas in the North West Shelf.
The story takes place in 1975 - just after the defeat of the Whitlam government - when Keating was appointed 
shadow minister for minerals and resources.

Movers, shakers caught PM's eye
McLennan caught a train to Keating's electorate office in Bankstown, a suburb in south-west Sydney, on a Saturday 
morning. He told the young Labor frontbencher that BHP had a chance of buying the exploration leases of the 
troubled British oil company, Burmah, in the highly prospective North West Shelf.
But with the prospect of a very long lead time for the major gas development, McLennan said BHP would not make 
the investment if the Labor opposition held to the policy of its previous resources minister, Rex Connor, that the gas 
should be controlled by the government and used for local industry rather than be exported to Japan.
"I said, 'Sir Ian, you will be very pleased with my answer'," Keating said. "I thought that Rex had made huge 
mistakes in this because this is a gas-prone continent. And anyone who puts a contract before us, we should sign 
and anyone who wants to capitalise on it, we should grab in a foot tackle and get their signature on the page."
That convinced BHP to buy part of Burmah's stake in what became Australia's biggest ever resource project. And 
so began the nation's liquefied natural gas export industry.
Keating then wrote support for the North West Shelf project into the Labor Party's policy platform at its 1977 
conference in Perth. The other part of the stake was bought by Shell, which played a big role in building the project. 
Keating recalls travelling to Tokyo three times with Shell's Ric Charlton to talk to Japanese bankers and gas 
buyers. And he was impressed with Shell Australia boss and International Olympic Committee member Kevan 
Gosper. AFR

Highlight: Fossil fuel majors are choosing profits over plans to bring a clean future closer.
Body
This month, Shell made its move. The world's second-largest oil and gas company and largest LNG producer 
announced it was watering down its climate targets, its chief executive Wael Sawan fretting to Reuters that it was 
"perilous" for Shell to set 2035 emission reduction targets because, "there is too much uncertainty at the moment in 
the energy transition trajectory".
Voicing his confidence that fossils would remain integral to the global energy mix in the longer-term Sawan added 
that, "there is going to be a multidimensional energy system in the future, [and] oil and gas will continue to have an 
important role in stabilising that system for a long, long, long time to come".

"We are trying to focus our company, our organisation, and our shareholders on a waypoint that's much clearer ... 
which is 2030," Sawan said. He also announced a reduction in the company's 2030 targets.
In 2020, as oil prices plunged towards zero, BP was at the forefront of a push by the oil and gas majors to remake 
themselves as "diversified energy" companies and drive faster into a renewable future.
Its then chief executive Bernard Looney announced that the company would not only reach net zero by 2050, but 
that it would actively lobby for international carbon taxes.
But a lot has changed since then. Looney was moved on, fairly unceremoniously, by his board in September 2023.
More significantly, Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022, effectively knocking the second-largest fossil 
fuel exporter on earth out of the West's oil and gas market. By 2022 crude oil prices had surged to more than 
US$120 ($184) a barrel, and it remains healthily above $80 a barrel today.
In February last year, BP backtracked. During a quarterly earnings report BP announced that it had made a record 
profit of US$27.7 billion over the previous year, more than double its 2021 profit, and that it was reducing its goals 
to cut oil production.

In March last year, ExxonMobil abandoned its research to create low emissions fuel from algae. Since 2009 the 
company had spent US$350 million on the effort, which it had used extensively in marketing to burnish its green 
credentials.
"The dirty secret nobody talks about is how much all this is going to cost and who's willing to pay for it,"  chief 
executive Darren Woods told Fortune last month of the world's quest to decarbonise. "The people who are 
generating those emissions need to be aware of and pay the price for generating those emissions. That is ultimately 
how you solve the problem."
That might be the case, but climate observers were unimpressed, particularly because ExxonMobil was already 
infamous for doing accurate cutting edge early research into climate change, only to downplay the science publicly.
"It's like a drug lord blaming everyone but himself for drug problems," Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at 
Columbia Business School, told The Guardian.
Then, as though to clarify the fossil sector's position, or perhaps to take its gloves off, the chief executive of the 
biggest of them all, Saudi Aramco, spoke even more bluntly during a panel discussion at a global energy 
conference in Texas earlier this month.
"We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas," Amin Nasser said, to applause from the audience.
"A transition strategy reset is urgently needed, and my proposal is this: We should abandon the fantasy of phasing 
out oil and gas and instead invest in them adequately reflecting realistic demand assumptions."
Nasser spoke of "hard realities" and said that "in the real world, the current transition strategy is visibly failing on 
most fronts". He said alternative energy sources had failed to displace hydrocarbons at scale, noting that oil 
demand had increased by 100 million barrels of oil equivalent a day this century and would reach an all-time high 
this year.
The increasing energy needs of developing nations would see demand remain high, and grow until 2045, he said.
"We should phase in new energy sources and technologies when they are genuinely ready, economically 
competitive and with the right infrastructure," Nasser said.
"All this strengthens the view that peak oil and gas is unlikely for some time to come, let alone 2030," he said. "No 
one is betting the farm on that."
For governments and policy-makers the problem with Nasser's real world is it conflicts with the other one, which 
has just sweltered through its hottest year in history due to carbon dioxide emissions, 70 per cent of which come 
from the burning of fossil fuels.
In this real world, global leaders gathered in Dubai in December for climate talks and after two weeks of hard fought 
negotiations agreed to begin "transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable 
manner ... so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science".
The language was significant because fossil fuels have never before been explicitly referred to in a declaration of 
the UN climate talks, but talk of "transitioning away" fell far short of the language that around 130 of the 198 
countries represented at the talks had called for. Those countries wanted fossil fuel companies and their invested 
to be put on notice with an agreement to "phase out" oil and gas.

"We have made an incremental advancement over business as usual when what we really needed is an 
exponential step change in our actions," said Anne Rasmussen from Samoa, the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Page 3 of 4

Small Islands States, to a standing ovation on the floor of the plenary session. "It is not enough for us to reference 
the science and then make agreements that ignore what the science is telling us we need to do."
The US climate envoy, John Kerry, who pushed hard to secure the compromise, was more upbeat. "For the very 
first time at a COP, fossil fuels have been on the table as a major part of our negotiations," he said. "And the 
decision that came out of this clearly embraces transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, so as to 
achieve net zero by 2050."
Nasser's position also contradicts that of the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organisation that 
has traditionally been closely identified with the fossil fuel industry.
More recently in its analysis the IEA has been blunt about the need for the world to transition, and about its capacity 
to do so.
In its annual World Energy Outlook report last year the IEA predicted that fossil fuel demand would peak by 2030, 
before entering a plateau and slow decline.
"The transition to clean energy is happening worldwide, and it's unstoppable," IEA chief Fatih Birol said in a 
statement at the time. "Claims that oil and gas represent safe or secure choices for the world's energy and climate 
future look weaker than ever."
As the IEA's position on fossils has drifted from that of the industry, criticism of it has ramped up. In Dubai the 
OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais  accused Birol of "unjustly vilifying" the industry as being behind the 
climate crisis.
But the IEA's analysis of the industry remains world leading, and its data suggest that whatever the fossil majors 
are saying about long-term demand, their shareholders might not hold the same confidence.
An IEA report on energy investment showed a significant decline in the amount of cash the industry was reinvesting 
in its production. Between 2008 and 2017 the figure hovered between 80 and 100 per cent, then it declines. Last 
year the sector ploughed just 50 per cent of its cash back into the business, with the rest being doled out to 
shareholders.
