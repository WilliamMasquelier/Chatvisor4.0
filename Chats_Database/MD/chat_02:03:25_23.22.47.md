## Assistant

Fred van Beers, as CEO of Sif, expresses a strongly negative sentiment, criticizing the Dutch government's stance as "politiek opportunisme" and implying a disconnect from market realities, which suggests frustration with regulatory or policy decisions affecting the industry, potentially including Orsted. His consistent critical tone could influence industry perceptions by reinforcing skepticism towards government interventions, indirectly impacting Orstedâ€™s operations if such policies create uncertainty or challenges for offshore wind development.
