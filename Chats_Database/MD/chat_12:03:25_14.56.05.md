The Murraylands' newest summer festival will rev up holidaymakers in the region next weekend, with the inaugural 
Festival State Nationals providing two days of entertainment on and off the race track at The Bend.
The second National Drag Racing Championship round to be held at Dragway at The Bend is geared not only 
towards motorsport fans but those who want to take their summer holidays in the region to a new level.
Free buses will run from Mannum, Murray Bridge, Tailem Bend and Wellington across the two days to bring 
spectators to and from Shell V-Power Motorsport Park, making it even easier for those staying in the region at 
shacks or caravan parks to attend.
Shell V-Power Motorsport Park chief executive Alistair MacDonald said the event would cater to holidaymakers of 
all ages.
A Kids Zone, live entertainment and Games Station will be family-friendly highlights off-track, while helicopter rides 
above Shell V-Power Motorsport Park and hot laps on the motor racing circuit will provide activities for adults. On 
track, up to 150 competitors across Nitro Funny Car, Top Fuel Motorcycle, Top Doorslammer and a host of 
Sportsman categories will compete in drag racing qualifying and eliminations.
"January is one of the best times of the year to be in the Murray River Lakes and Coorong region so the opportunity 
to offer free buses and make it easy for everyone enjoying their holidays to attend our major drag racing event is 
fantastic," MacDonald said.
"The free shuttle buses have become a well-known asset to our major events making it easy for patrons to move 
around the region and on-site at the venue creating an immersive experience." Adult general admission tickets start 
at $45 while children aged 15 and under have free general admission access. Buses will pick up passengers from 
dedicated pick-up points in the morning and return them in the afternoon or evening. Bus schedule and locations at
