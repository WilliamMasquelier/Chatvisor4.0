If you're employed at an office where working from home has not been welcome after COVID lockdowns, asking for 
flexible working conditions may feel daunting.
People and management experts in Canberra have some suggestions that may help you ask for what you need.
Those who can complete their official duties just as well from home, it is worthwhile reminding yourself of the 
benefits of flexible working to build confidence. There's also evidence you can use.
A survey by tech firm CISCO in 2022 reported on Australian experiences in hybrid workplaces. Respondents 
belonged to industries including public service, healthcare, agriculture, IT, NGOs, finance, and food and beverage 
workers.
About 84 per cent of 1042 Australians who participated in the study said they saved $US180 (now $AU268) on 
average per week.
Some also reported eating healthier (65 per cent), becoming physically fitter (69.5 per cent), feeling happier (84.7 
per cent) and improving their work-life balance (82.4 per cent) . More than half of them also said their relationships 
with family and friends had improved.
Empower yourself with solutions and evidence Once you've decided to speak to your manager, review your job 
description and see which parts allowed for remote working.
Dr Jennifer Loh, professor in management at the University of Canberra, said it's good to be prepared with solutions 
for your boss, of how you plan to complete your duties. This will give them confidence you are capable of 
performing well even from home.
"It opens up that discussion in terms of, 'this task does not need me to be on site, can I maybe work from home half 
a day? I'll take care of everything, I can use the computer'," she said.

Want to work from home? Here's how to ask your boss
"The employer will then obviously have to recognize they need to be flexible because the responsibility of that 
particular employees does not need them to be on site," she said.
According to demographer Dr Liz Allen, from the Australian National University, ACT's population flows and 
workforce suggest that employees possess significant power.
"If you are a good employee, and you have demonstrated that loyalty with your employer, you should not fear 
asking for flexible working arrangements," Dr Allen said.
"From a demographic point of view, they have a lot more power than they realise, particularly in Canberra. Workers 
who are not having success in their current workplace might have the opportunity to go and negotiate more flexible 
working arrangements elsewhere."
"At the end of the day, data tends not to lie and the data is very clear - Australian workers want and need flexibility," 
Dr Allen said. "We will be living with Covid for the future time and we need to be better at responding and dealing 
with the challenges that that poses."
What can employers do? Dr Loh said employers could help facilitate this conversation by being transparent with 
their staff. Providing a forum, not during a one-on-one chat, for open communication where employees find out 
about their rights, enterprise agreements and relevant processes.
"[Managers] need to disseminate information, widely and officially ... where everybody appreciates their approach 
towards managing and leading," she said.
On the other hand, the CISCO study also reported about 58 per cent of Australian respondents believed they faced 
challenges in fully engaging with their company and coworkers during hybrid working.
To address this issue, employers and employees needed to work together creatively and flexibly to maintain a good 
standard of productivity and job satisfaction, Dr Loh said.

to the experts Ask yourself if it's safe for you to have this conversation (if it's a very rigid workplace, consider 
speaking to a union representative)
Gather evidence you can use to mount your case (loyalty, productivity, job description)
Provide solutions and arrangements that serve you and your employer (WFH on designated days/ half days/ one 
week on, one week off)
Give examples of how other businesses in your industry are being flexible

More than a quarter of Australian companies have banned artificial intelligence tools in the workplace, citing privacy 
concerns, including the potential for corporate secrets to be shared with competitors, according to a new study.
Communications technology titan Cisco surveyed more than 2600 security and privacy professionals across 12 
countries, which revealed businesses were unplugging the much-hyped technology - for now.
This is despite bigger businesses beginning to reap productivity gains from the much-hyped technology, which the 
Albanese government expects will inject up to $600bn a year into the national economy by 2030. But, Cisco ANZ's 
director of cybersecurity Corien Vermaak said trust remains a big hurdle in fuelling AI's widespread adoption. Ms 
Vermaak said 27 per cent of Australian companies surveyed had banned the use of generative AI applications due 
to privacy risks.
Of that number, 77 per cent were worried corporate information entered into AI apps could be shared publicly or 
with competitors, while 69 per cent were concerned it could hurt their legal or intellectual property rights.
"As we do security awareness training, we now need to focus on that narrative on AI as well," Ms Vermaak said.
The Productivity Commission also found low levels of public trust in AI technologies could pose a "significant 
barrier" to uptake. But, it said governments should act as "exemplars" to demonstrate the safe and effective uses of 
AI in service delivery.

"As we do security awareness training, we now need to focus on that narrative on AI as well," Ms Vermaak said.
"Where organisations are unsure, they've banned it. What that tells me is a lot of organisations are looking to put 
the controls in place, are looking to educate, message and see where they can improve their processes before 
allowing it. My sense would be over the next few years we will see that decreasing." While bigger companies have 
signed up to tailored enterprise AI products, like Microsoft's Copilot, which has guardrails built in to protect 
corporate data, others do not have a clear strategy, with employees at some using publicly available AI platforms, 
sometimes without their managers' knowledge.
"One of the examples in our framework is that when an employee uses any generative AI tool, they have to actually 
disclose it. And, and that's a really important thing, because it changes the perception of the receiver of that work," 
Ms Vermaak said.

"There's two things that organisations and companies need to start with. That is the education part, which is 
critically important. And then putting in policies and frameworks to put guardrails up for when is it OK to use it.
" 'Can I use ChatGPT? Yes, you can use it for private things on your work device, but you can't use it for any work-
related matters' if that is what the company's risk acceptance is." The Productivity Commission also found that low 
levels of public trust in AI technologies could pose a "significant barrier" to uptake. But, it said governments should 
act as "exemplars" to demonstrate the safe and effective uses of AI in service delivery. Collete Stallbaumer, general 
manager of Microsoft 365, said it was still early days and companies were moving at different speeds.

SpaceX on the move Elon Musk's SpaceX is seeking to convert its business incorporation to Texas from Delaware. 
The Secretary of State of Texas on Wednesday issued a certificate evidencing the acceptance and filing of the 
conversion. The rocket company's move comes two weeks after a Delaware court ordered Musk to give up a Tesla 
compensation package valued at $US55.8bn. "Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware," Musk 
wrote on X following the court's decision, noting that shareholders would be able to vote on whether to move 
Tesla's incorporation to Texas.
Publishing spat Arena Group Holdings said it would continue publishing the print and digital editions of Sports 
Illustrated as it continued negotiating with the publication's owner, Authentic Brands Group. Arena, which also 
publishes TheStreet and Men's Journal, said there was an unresolved claim of $US45m against the company by 
Authentic, and it would continue to publish Sports Illustrated until the issue was resolved. The publisher previously 
missed a payment to Authentic, which licenses the Sports Illustrated brand to Arena. Under the publishing deal 
between the two, Authentic has the right to terminate its licensing agreement, which Authentic did. Arena on 
Wednesday also named Cavitt Randall as the company's next chief executive. Arena said in a regulatory filing that 
Randall was appointed chairman of the board January 23 and had previously served as CEO of investment firm 
MBX Clearing and operating chief of SI Capital. Randall, 46, has agreed to an annual salary of $US1, according to 
the filing.
Cisco axes staff Cisco Systems plans to cut about 5 per cent of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan to 
realign its business and enable further investment in key areas. The networking equipment company estimates it 
will recognise pre-tax charges of about $US800m, which will be primarily cash-based. It expects to take the majority 
of these actions in the third quarter and recognise about $US500m of these charges. Cisco expects about 
$US150m of the charges to be recognised in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and the remaining amount primarily 
through the first half of fiscal 2025. Cisco had about 84,900 employees as of July 29.
Morgan Stanley cuts Morgan Stanley plans to cut several hundred jobs in its wealth management division as new 
chief executive Ted Pick seeks to rein in costs in an area that is critical to the Wall Street firm's success but has 
shown signs of weakening lately. The cuts, which include a small number of managing directors as well as non-
customer-facing employees, are expected to hit less than 1 per cent of the wealth unit's employees, which number 
less than 40,000 in total.
