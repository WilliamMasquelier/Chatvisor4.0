Canberra couple Shell Abdoo and Berin Denham have written a musical about their relationship - and the season 
will end with them getting married in the theatre in which they are performing the show.
Only Everything opens at The Courtyard Studio at the Canberra Theatre Centre on October 17, with a 10-show 
season.
And like any good rom-com, it will end with a wedding - but this time in real life, the nuptials taking place at the end 
of the season, in The Courtyard Studio, the couple surrounded by an audience of family and friends.
"We realised we had a lot of family who would be coming from out of town. They're going to want to see the show 
and they're going to want to come to our wedding, so let's not make them do two trips and do it in the same 
weekend," Berin said.
It will be a fitting finale to a musical inspired by their own fortysomething romance. They are calling it the 
"Generation X musical" - the one about a second chance at love after divorce, when there are kids and ex-partners 
and emotional baggage in tow, when everything is not always rainbows and unicorns and when dating comes down 
to a swipe right or left.
Shell and Berin say it's more of a dramedy, their story about falling in love later in life, blending existing families and 
navigating the emotional landscape of their life now and what went before. "We felt that was such a relatable story 
that isn't being told," Shell said. "Let's do a love story when you've got a few more grey hairs but you've also got 
some beautiful experiences to draw on. It's deeper. It's got some grit to it."
Shell, 46, is a self-taught musician and well-known singer in live venues around Canberra. A producer and 
performer, Berin, 48, grew up in the theatre in Canberra, the son of well-known thespian Barbara Denham.
The couple actually met 10 years ago when they both had parts in Rock of Ages at the Erindale Theatre. They 
didn't connect romantically until five years later.

A real-life romance takes to the stage
And only after some sliding-doors moments, when things could have easily gone another way. The universe instead 
conspired to get them together. In a very rom-com kind of way. So, cue a musical that tells their story. "Write what 
you know!" Shell said, with a laugh.
The couple both star in the musical as characters - Tori and Aaron - rather than themselves.
Directed by Rachel Thornton, with musical direction by Nicholas Griffin, Only Everything also stars Louiza Blomfield 
as Tori's sister Emma and David Pearson as Aaron's friend Simon.
They have made lots of Canberra references but believe the story is universal, and they've produced the show with 
a view to touring it.
Shell, who has five children, and Berin, who has two children, have created a blended family, with the three 
youngest children living with them at home in Waramanga.
Berin, who has a day job as a public servant, said they workshopped the musical with friends and colleagues, 
editing and rewriting to make it even more true to life. And the feedback had been positive.
"One of our friends was in tears during one of the read-throughs," Berin said.
"He said, 'This is the musical for Gen-X! We need this musical'.
The title - Only Everything - came from a real-life conversation between the couple when Shell was starting to 
doubt herself.
"I said to Berin, 'Am I getting any of this right? What am I getting right in this relationship'?" Shell said.
"And he would say, 'Only everything' to reassure me and then it became a thing that we would often say to each 
other."
