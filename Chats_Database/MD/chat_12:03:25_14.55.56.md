## User


You will be provided with a news media article and a company, topic or industry name. Here is the company or industry of interest: Shell. It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: "Yes" or "No". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:

Centrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.

If Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.

Retrofits As the focus shifts from operational carbon use to embodied emissions, companies are rethinking designs, 
writes Michael Bleby.
In March, landlord ISPT opened the doors to a new office offering in central Melbourne. The 34-level tower in the 
heart of the city's legal and financial district is net zero in its operational carbon use, has no gas and is powered by 
renewable energy.
And it is 44 years old. The $21.5 billion fund manager opted to reuse the existing shell of the 500 Bourke Street 
building - fully occupied by NAB until 2021 - strip it out and refit the shell of the building, removing gas and making 
it fully electric.
ISPT's retrofit at 500 Bourke is part of a growing trend to extend the life of existing office structures rather than 
demolish and rebuild. It is the company's third retrofit project, and ASX-listed developer and landlord Stockland has 
plans for a similar project.
The decision to spend $160 million on a retrofit of the 1977 building - one of the featured sites in this year's Open 
House Melbourne public architecture weekend - reflected the growing need to tackle embodied carbon emissions, 
says chief sustainability officer Steven Peters.
"There's been a strong focus on operational emissions," Peters says, referring to the carbon emissions associated 
with ongoing energy use from systems such as heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting.
"Now we're seeing operational emissions starting to reduce ... we now have to shift our attention to the materials 
that go into the building."
Retaining the concrete and carbon shell of the Fender Katsalidis-redesigned Bourke Street tower saved an 
estimated 57,000 tonnes that ISPT estimates it would have generated by manufacturing and constructing a new 
structure.

To put that in context, ISPT's 94-building portfolio - with a net lettable area of 1.7 million square metres - has an 
annual operational emissions output of 31,000 tonnes.
"Almost double the operational emissions of the portfolio were saved by retaining the building," he says.
The cost difference is also striking. ISPT could have demolished the building and built a new tower of 85,000 
square metres on the 4000-square-metre site, a build that industry estimates put at between $338 million and $383 
million in 2021 dollars ($412 million-$467 million today).
As operational carbon emissions reduce, driven by landlords and tenants mindful of meeting their own sustainability 
commitments, the significance of embodied carbon will grow. Life insurer TAL signed up as anchor tenant to 500 
Bourke Street in 2022.
By 2050 embodied carbon will account for 85 per cent of Australia's built environment emissions, up from 16 per 
cent in 2019, federal buildings rating scheme NABERS says.
And rules around embodied carbon are tightening. Legislation supporting Australian Sustainability Reporting 
Standards requiring tighter carbon disclosure - through an additional "sustainability report" that will be included in 
annual financial reporting - kicks in from this financial year.
The very largest companies - those with more than $1 billion in assets, $500 million in revenue or 500 employees - 
are first off the rank, with the disclosure requirements expanding to smaller companies over the following three 
years. Small- and medium-sized businesses are not included.
"This sustainability report primarily requires businesses to outline climate resilience risks and opportunities relating 
to their physical premises or business activities," says Tim Spies, the managing director for community and place at 
consultancy Aurecon, which advised ISPT on the 500 Bourke Street project.
"It also requires businesses to disclose their operational emissions footprint, and it is in collecting this data and in 
defining the scope boundaries considered that companies will require concerted effort and industry standardisation 
over the next few years, until this becomes business-as-usual operations."
The market for office buildings is putting a premium on more sustainable buildings.
"We're starting to see the tenants pushing and advocating for these as well," says Nicole Ward, head of ISPT's 
office portfolio. "We're starting to see the tenants pushing and advocating for these as well. If you're not doing it, the 
risk is that you don't get the tenants."
An EY report this year, Zeroing in on net zero buildings, showed that buildings with Green Star design (pre-
construction) and as-built (post-construction) ratings had higher occupancy rates, longer weighted average lease 
expiries and lower capitalisation rates (reflecting yield).
ASX-listed developer and landlord Stockland changed tack this year on plans to demolish and rebuild its 133 
Castlereagh Street head office tower in Sydney, declaring it instead planned to preserve about 23,000 tonnes of 
embodied carbon by preserving the substructure as well as the concrete and steel structure of the adjoining 32-
storey and 14-storey office towers.
ISPT is on its third retrofit project. In Sydney, it is doing a ground plane and facade upgrade at 477 Pitt Street, 
which should be complete in April, and at its 25-storey tower at 270 Pitt Street it has embarked on a full retrofit akin 
to 500 Bourke Street, costing $170 million.
But the decision about any building has to be specific to the building and what the next tenant would pay, Ward 
says. That informed the decision to go ahead with 270 Pitt Street.Page 3 of 3

"Where does the building sit within the market? What is the likely target tenant for the building? Where would the 
likely rent be sitting?" she says. "That influences how much capital we put into the building to ensure it is a viable 
outcome for investors."AFR
