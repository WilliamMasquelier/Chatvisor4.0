Shell and PetroChina's joint venture Arrow Energy will -expand its Surat Gas Project as it moves to capitalise on -
growing demand.
The expansion will be welcomed by Australia's energy industry, which is struggling to lock-in supplies along the 
country's east coast.
Arrow said it would expand the project in Queensland's Western Downs to produce 4000PJ of gas for the domestic 
market. The joint venture said 450 new gas -production wells, a new field compression station, 27km pipeline and 
road and infrastructure upgrades over two phases would be developed.
Arrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said first gas from the expansion has been targeted for 2026.
"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify 
Arrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast," he said.
The gas from the project would flow to the Shell-operated QCLNG liquefied natural gas facility on Curtis Island, 
near Gladstone, to meet long-term contracts and supply domestic customers, the joint venture partners said.
Shell integrated gas and upstream director Zoe Yujnovich said the expansion underscored its commitment to the 
domestic market. "QCLNG marked its 1000th cargo at the end of last year, reflecting its significance as a gas 
supplier for Australia and the region,' she said.

Shell and PetroChina's joint venture Arrow Energy will expand its Surat Gas Project as it moves to capitalise on 
growing demand, a move likely to stoke opposition from environmentalists.
The expansion will be welcomed by Australia's energy industry, which is struggling to lock in supplies amid rapidly 
depleting stocks across the east coast.
Arrow said it would expand the project in Queensland's Western Downs to produce 4000PJ of gas for long-term 
contracts and to supply the domestic market.
The JV said 450 new gas production wells, a new field compression station, 27km pipeline, and road and 
infrastructure upgrades over two phases would be developed.
Arrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said first gas from the expansion was targeted for 2026.
"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify 
Arrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast," Mr Peng said.
"Natural gas is an important part of the energy transition, and the expansion demonstrates the faith our 
shareholders have in our ability to manage and deliver large-scale projects." Gas from the project will flow to the 
Shell-operated QCLNG liquefied natural gas facility on Curtis Island, near Gladstone, to meet long-term contracts 
and supply domestic customers, the joint venture partners said.
Zoe Yujnovich, Shell's integrated gas and upstream director, said the expansion underscored its commitment to 
the domestic market.
"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to 
market," she said.
"QCLNG marked its 1000th cargo at the end of last year, reflecting its significance as a gas supplier for Australia 
and the region. This investment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a

lower emissions alternative to options like coal." Shell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said the expansion would 
be boon for the local community.
"At its core, this project promotes stronger regional communities, and it also has wider benefits for Australian 
manufacturing and industry more broadly," she said.
The expansion will inflame environmentalists, who oppose any new gas drilling. But Australia's east coast faces a 
looming crisis as offshore gas from Victoria's Bass Strait - the traditional bedrock of the country's supplies - rapidly 
depletes.
The Australian Energy Market Operator has warned the country must urgently unlock new supplies to prevent a 
catastrophic shortfall but new developments are struggling to secure regulatory approvals and/or the support of 
local communities.
Analysts have warned the country's $2.5 trillion economy will be significant harmed by a shortfall. The 
manufacturing sector is particularly exposed with gas its only viable energy source, and any interruptions could 
threaten their viability.
Households could also be disrupted. Victoria is the most gas-dependent state, relying on the fuel source to heat 
homes, and a shortfall could make heating prohibitively expensive.
Other states will also be hit. Gas is used as a so-called peaker, burnt to provide electricity during periods of high 
demand or low supply from other fossil fuels or renewables. If Australia's National Electricity Market has insufficient 
gas on hand, the price of electricity will spike. Higher electricity bills was a key driver behind Australia's spike in 
inflation, which in turn forced the Reserve Bank of Australia to raise interest rates 13 times.
With a looming shortfall, gas developers have insisted governments fast-track applications, a request that the 
federal Labor government has refused - insisting it must properly assess each application. The gas industry has 
accused the government of slow walking, which indicates its support for gas - a claim denied by Labor.

Shell and PetroChina will expand the huge Surat coal seam gas project in Queensland, a decision that will be met 
with dismay from environmental activists but which should provide supply for an increasingly stretched market.
Gas from the project extension will supply both domestic and export customers through the Queensland Curtis LNG 
plant near Gladstone.
The project, the second phase of the Arrow Energy joint venture, is expected to supply 130 million cubic feet a day 
of gas at peak production, enough to power almost 1 million homes.
The first phase of the project, some 90 billion cubic feet a year, began in 2020 and is now in production. It is 
expected to cost about $2 billion. Shell did not give an estimated cost for the second phase, but it is also expected 
to reach into the billions of dollars.
The decision to proceed with the second phase of the Arrow project follows increasingly urgent warnings from the 
Australian Energy Market Operator about the need for investment in new gas supply to head off shortages 
expected later this decade on peak-demand winter days.
"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to 
market," said Zoe Yujnovich, director of integrated gas and upstream for Shell.
"This investment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a lower-
emissions alternative."
Still, the drilling of the up to 450 new wells involved will only maintain existing supplies rather than increase 
production and does not address shortfalls that are looming because of declines in supplies in the southern states, 
said Rick Wilkinson, chief executive of consultancy EnergyQuest.
"This makes no change at all to the supply-demand balance and the requirement for new gas to come on for the 
east coast of Australia," he said.

Shell, PetroChina plan to expand Surat gas project
Mr Wilkinson said that for the full development of the project, thousands of wells needed to be drilled, "so this is one 
step of many that are required for capital to be allocated to the project to maintain flat production".
Arrow, jointly owned by Shell and its Chinese state-owned partner, holds the largest reserve of undeveloped gas 
on the east coast, where elevated contract prices and a limited choice of supply have been sources of constant 
complaint among manufacturers.
Shell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said the project would support up to 400 jobs and create opportunities for 
contractors and local suppliers.
"At its core, this project promotes stronger regional communities, and it also has wider benefits for Australian 
manufacturing and industry more broadly," said Ms Wake.
Shell said the project was underpinned by a 27-year sales deal between Arrow and QGC, a division of the London-
based oil and gas giant. In investor briefings last year, the company flagged that it would secure additional gas for 
its LNG facilities in Queensland "to increase value for shareholders". The second phase of the project will require 
the construction of 27 kilometres of pipelines, as well as other infrastructure upgrades.
It is opposed by farming families and landholders in the Darling Downs, who said they were worried about the risk 
of damage to water and land. The project is also opposed by environmental groups, concerned about increased 
emissions from fossil fuel production.
The go-ahead comes despite years of annual losses by Arrow. The company had originally intended to develop four 
LNG export projects in Queensland but abandoned those plans after the first three plants were built.
Shell later took over BG Group in one of the biggest takeovers in the oil sector, giving it ownership of one of those 
three plants, Queensland Curtis LNG.
It opted to use gas from the Arrow project to instead supply that plant, a major facility near Gladstone, Queensland 
that was completed in 2014.
Arrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said production from this second phase was expected to start in 2026. 
Construction will begin later this year. Surat is expected to comprise up to 2500 gas wells and produce 4000 
petajoules of gas in total.
"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify 
Arrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast," Mr Peng said in a statement.

An apparent gas strike by energy giant Shell deep underground in onshore Queensland has fuelled industry hopes 
of a potential major new source of energy that could ease the threat of shortages in the tight east coast market.
Flames from a well drilled by Shell in the Taroom Trough at the southern edge of the Bowen Basin have stoked 
speculation that the little-known region could emerge as a new supply source that lies much closer to pipeline 
infrastructure than the Northern Territory's remote Beetaloo Basin.
The gas flare from the well, a photograph of which has been seen by The Australian Financial Review, signals one 
of the first instances of gas flowing to the surface in the region.
The Taroom Trough lies close to Queensland's gas hub at Wallumbilla, north-west of Brisbane, and wells being 
drilled are targeting unconventional gas at a depth of 2500-3500 metres, much deeper than coal seam gas wells.
While Shell declined to confirm the gas flow, MST Marquee energy analyst Saul Kavonic said the region, which he 
described as the most anticipated exploration play on the east coast over the next two years, held significant 
potential. "If they can prove horizontal wells work in this tight coal seam gas play, it could open up several more tcf 
[trillion cubic feet]) of gas for the east coast," Mr Kavonic said, noting ASX-listed juniors Elixir Energy and Omega 
Oil and Gas Ltd are also in the area.
"This is the only new exploration play with that potential, which is also close to infrastructure," he added, pointing to 
the greater infrastructure and funding constraints around large gas resources in the Beetaloo and the northern 
Bowen Basin.
Shell is drilling three appraisal wells in the area "as part of early-stage exploration in the Bowen Basin", a 
spokeswoman said. "The data will be analysed and will inform any further exploration."
The apparent early success comes as output from the east coast's biggest supply source for the domestic market, 
the mature Bass Strait petroleum fields held by ExxonMobil and Woodside Energy, has started to dive, risking 
shortfalls on gas on peak winter days, especially in Victoria.
Page 2 of 2
Shell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes
Production from the Longford plant that processes Bass Strait gas plunged 18.2 per cent in the June quarter, 
according to consultancy EnergyQuest, noting that peak supply shortfalls hit the east coast in 2022 and again this 
past winter.
The firm said that exploration and appraisal success by Elixir and Omega was raising hopes that the Taroom 
Trough could be "a genuine new source of material supply to the east coast gas market and even backfill for 
Queensland LNG projects".
EnergyQuest CEO Rick Wilkinson said the flare reported at the Shell site "seems to indicate more gas is flowing 
than the vertical well tested recently by Elixir", which he said was a "good sign" for the application of horizontal well 
technology.
Accessing gas held in such deep sands typically requires the use of horizontal drilling - as used in the US shale 
gas industry - and fracking, a controversial process that helps gas to flow.
Elixir and Omega, between them, have almost 3 trillion cubic feet of "contingent resources" - an uncertain measure 
of resource - in "tight" sandstones in the Trough, while Shell advised the Queensland government in 2021 that its 
own acreage in the area could hold three tcf of gas resource, EnergyQuest said.
It said Shell's investment in a program of multiple, stimulated horizontal wells costing between $100 million and 
$200 million "adds a lot of credibility". Elixir, chaired by coal seam gas entrepreneur Richard Cottee, late last month 
reported a successful flow of gas to the surface from its Daydream-2 well in the area.
Omega, which is backed by Queensland coal seam gas pioneer Tri-Star Group and Brian Flannery's Ilwella Group, 
is now moving the rig used by Shell for its wells to its Canyon site where it expects to start drilling a well on 
September 20 to test the flow of gas in its acreage for the first time.
"If we're successful here this could be the next big wave of development post the coal seam gas wave," said 
Omega CEO Trevor Brown, a former vice president geoscience at Santos.
He said that while the Beetaloo Basin was more advanced in terms of proving up the flow of gas, the Taroom 
Trough had several compelling reasons that gave it a quantifiable commercial advantage.

Highlight: Fossil fuel producers are buying large stakes in carbon companies and land to run their own carbon 
offset projects. Experts and insiders want that banned.
Body
Large fossil fuel companies are making multimillion-dollar investments in carbon companies and offset projects, 
raising concerns among industry insiders and experts that the sector is funding lowest-cost and lower-quality 
emission offsets, rather than tackling climate change as was intended.
An investigation by this masthead has found fossil fuel companies, including Shell and Woodside, are increasingly 
entering the supply chain of the Australian carbon offsets market, buying stakes in carbon companies, registering 
projects, trading credits or purchasing swathes of land to run their own carbon abatement projects.

Under the federal government's flagship policy for reducing industrial emissions, the country's top polluters can 
achieve all required emissions reductions through buying Australian carbon credits. Experts question allowing those 
polluters to have a role in the creation and sale of those credits.
"The guys who are doing the emitting, are now getting profits from the solution? It couldn't be more perverse. 
They're profiting from the problem they created," said Daryl Killin, who previously held senior roles at major carbon 
companies Select Carbon and Natural Carbon.
