1. The name of a real person who has expressed a quote in the provided article
2. His role or relation with regards to Orsted.
3. Their original quote about Orsted exactly as it appears in the article, without any modifications or translations

Guidelines:
- Include only real people: Exclude organizations, companies, or any other non-person entities
- Direct connection: Ensure that each selected individual is explicitly connected to Orsted or explicitly express his opinion on Orsted.
- Only include those whose statements are directly about Orsted
- Exclude individuals whose comments are not directly relevant to Orsted or are too general
- Pertinent stakeholders only: Only include the most relevant individuals
- Do not include stakeholders who are not directly associated with Orsted

Output Format Requirements:
- Each line must contain exactly two columns separated by "|" symbols

- Column 2: Stakeholder's role or link to Orsted. If not described in the article, try to interpret its role. If it is not straightforward to interpret, mention "Not mentioned".

Body
Renewables group Ørsted is to install a Tesla-made energy storage system in East Anglia that it said would 
increase stability of the country's energy supply and reduce price volatility.
The Danish company said the Tesla Megapack would give Britain one of the largest battery energy storage systems 
in Europe. It said that the 600 MWh facility would hold the energy for 80,000 UK homes for a day.
The storage will be in Swardeston, Norfolk, at the onshore converter station of the Hornsea 3 offshore wind farm. 
Duncan Clark, Ørsted's UK boss, said: "The battery will help ensure that renewable energy is used in the best 
possible way by storing it when demand is lower and then releasing it back into the system when it's needed."
