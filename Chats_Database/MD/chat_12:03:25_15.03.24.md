Here is the document section to analyze:

Some narrow systems even have superhuman capabilities. One example is Alphafold, which uses machine learning 
to predict the structure of protein molecules, and whose creators won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry this year. 
What about general systems? This is software that can tackle a much wider range of tasks, including things like 
learning new skills. 
A general no-AI system might be something like Amazon's Mechanical Turk: it can do a wide range of things, but it 
does them by asking real people. 
Overall, general AI systems are far less advanced than their narrow cousins. According to Morris, the state-of-the-
art language models behind chatbots such as ChatGPT are general AI - but they are so far at the "emerging" level 
(meaning they are  "equal to or somewhat better than an unskilled human"), and yet to reach "competent" (as good 
as 50% of skilled adults). 
So by this reckoning, we are still some distance from general superintelligence.
How intelligent is AI right now?
As Morris points out, precisely determining where any given system sits would depend on having reliable tests or 
benchmarks. 
Depending on our benchmarks, an image-generating system such as DALL-E might be at virtuoso level (because it 
can produce images 99% of humans could not draw or paint), or it might be emerging (because it produces errors 
no human would, such as mutant hands and impossible objects). 
There is significant debate even about the capabilities of current systems. One notable 2023 paper argued GPT-4 
showed "sparks of artificial general intelligence".
OpenAI says its latest language model, o1, can "perform complex reasoning" and "rivals the performance of human 
experts" on many benchmarks.
However, a recent paper from Apple researchers found o1 and many other language models have significant 
trouble solving genuine mathematical reasoning problems. Their experiments show the outputs of these models 
seem to resemble sophisticated pattern-matching rather than true advanced reasoning. This indicates 
superintelligence is not as imminent as many have suggested.
Will AI keep getting smarter?
Some people think the rapid pace of AI progress over the past few years will continue or even accelerate. Tech 
companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in AI hardware and capabilities, so this doesn't seem 
impossible.
If this happens, we may indeed see general superintelligence within the "few thousand days" proposed by Sam 
Altman (that's a decade or so in less scifi terms). Sutskever and his team mentioned a similar timeframe in their 
superalignment article.
Many recent successes in AI have come from the application of a technique called "deep learning", which, in 
simplistic terms, finds associative patterns in gigantic collections of data. Indeed, this year's Nobel Prize in Physics 
has been awarded to John Hopfield and also the " Godfather of AI" Geoffrey Hinton, for their invention of Hopfield 
Networks and Boltzmann machine, which are the foundation for many powerful deep learning models used today.  Page 3 of 3
What is AI superintelligence? Could it destroy humanity? And is it really almost here?
General systems such as ChatGPT have relied on data generated by humans, much of it in the form of text from 
books and websites. Improvements in their capabilities have largely come from increasing the scale of the systems 
and the amount of data on which they are trained. 
However, there may not be enough human-generated data to take this process much further (although efforts to 
use data more efficiently, generate synthetic data, and improve transfer of skills between different domains may 
bring improvements). Even if there were enough data, some researchers say language models such as ChatGPT 
are fundamentally incapable of reaching what Morris would call general competence. 
One recent paper has suggested an essential feature of superintelligence would be open-endedness, at least from 
a human perspective. It would need to be able to continuously generate outputs that a human observer would 
regard as novel and be able to learn from. 
Existing foundation models are not trained in an open-ended way, and existing open-ended systems are quite 
narrow. This paper also highlights how either novelty or learnability alone is not enough. A new type of open-ended 
foundation model is needed to achieve superintelligence.
What are the risks?
So what does all this mean for the risks of AI? In the short term, at least, we don't need to worry about 
superintelligent AI taking over the world.
But that's not to say AI doesn't present risks. Again, Morris and co have thought this through: as AI systems gain 
great capability, they may also gain greater autonomy. Different levels of capability and autonomy present different 
risks.
For example, when AI systems have little autonomy and people use them as a kind of consultant - when we ask 
ChatGPT to summarise documents, say, or let the YouTube algorithm shape our viewing habits - we might face a 
risk of over-trusting or over-relying on them. 
In the meantime, Morris points out other risks to watch out for as AI systems become more capable, ranging from 
people forming parasocial relationships with AI systems to mass job displacement and society-wide ennui. 
What's next?
Let's suppose we do one day have superintelligent, fully autonomous AI agents. Will we then face the risk they 
could concentrate power or act against human interests?
Not necessarily. Autonomy and control can go hand in hand. A system can be highly automated, yet provide a high 
level of human control. 
Like many in the AI research community, I believe safe superintelligence is feasible. However, building it will be a 
complex and multidisciplinary task, and researchers will have to tread unbeaten paths to get there.

Australian companies have been given an artificial intelligence reality check, with 58 per cent that have invested in 
artificial programs and applications saying the technology has fallen short of expectations.
Meanwhile, about 70 per cent of investors have pulled out of active deals due to AI consideration. Cisco's AI 
readiness index, undertaken for the second time this year, found 38 per cent of companies had allocated between 
10 to 30 per cent of their IT budget to AI, despite many not seeing a return on the investment.
The firm's Australian chief technology officer Carl Solder said Cisco's index found about half of the companies 
surveyed found assistance from AI with processes and operations did not hit the mark. About 44 per cent saw either 
no or not enough improvement in the technology automating their business.
"I think the reality is that they started to appreciate the work and effort involved in getting all those building blocks 
squared away, and the strategy, infrastructure data governance, talent and culture," he said. "The reality is that 
maybe there is a bit more work that we have to do to be fully prepared." Cisco's Index measured the responses of 
3660 senior business leaders from companies with 500 or more staff across 14 countries in the Asia Pacific. The 
index found just 4 per cent of the country was in a position to leverage AI, a figure that dropped from 5 per cent the 
previous year. Mr Solder said 92 per cent of companies were facing increasing pressure to adopt AI despite much 
of it not showing a return on investment over the past year. Most of that pressure came from company chief 
executives and boards.

La Trobe University, Media Release, 5 December 2024
A smart irrigation system powered by artificial intelligence will tell sugarcane farmers when and where to water their 
crops in an advance that could one day revolutionise agriculture – and help preserve the health of the Great Barrier 
Reef.
Developed by Victoria’s La Trobe University for far-north Queensland ag-tech company Aglantis, the intelligent 
irrigation system uses the Internet of Things to automate water pump management and monitor sunlight, 
temperature and humidity levels without human interaction.

The system was initially conceived as a project to improve land management and prevent fertiliser run-off from 
farms into the Great Barrier Reef, but with new technology making smart irrigation more affordable, Aglantis 
managing director Luke Malan said the potential of the product was almost limitless.
In addition to saving water, future AI additions could teach the system how to conserve energy, responding to solar 
or energy tariffs. It could also examine soil profiles and make intelligent choices around crop selection and yields.
“It essentially takes the guesswork out of farming,” Luke said. “With growing pressures on profitability, it’s more 
imperative to know what you’re doing and how you can do it better. This flips conventional thinking on its head and 
opens the doorway to new possibilities.”

Professor Wei Xiang, Cisco Research Chair and Director of La Trobe University’s Cisco Centre for AI and the 
Internet of Things, said the smart irrigation system was the centre’s first commercial product and showed how 
industry could drive research to tangible and groundbreaking results.
La Trobe is already working with the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), creating the world’s first AI-
powered three-dimensional digital twin of the Great Barrier Reef to monitor its health.
The new smart irrigation system – developed in a one-metre plastic tub housed in the Digital Innovation Hub at La 
Trobe’s Melbourne campus - further enhances the University’s reputation in the AI research space.
The University recently announced its bold ambition to transform research, education, student support and business 
operations by applying an “AI-first” approach.
“Now we've proven the technology, the next step is to add additional features to improve productivity and crop 
yields through leveraging cutting-edge AI technology,” Professor Xiang said. “This will make farming on the whole 
more sustainable."
IoT researchers Kamyar Karimi and Aravindan Madasamy, who developed the system for La Trobe under the 
supervision of Professor Xiang, said it would reduce labour costs, increase water efficiency and allow more 
precision in farm decision-making.
Ultimately, the system design could include intelligent sequencing to determine the perfect order of irrigation across 
different farm sections, predictive maintenance and continuous learning from historical data, seasonal patterns and 
crop responses.

"This technology represents a major shift towards data-driven, sustainable agriculture where AI and IoT optimise 
every drop of water for maximum farming efficiency," Kamyar said.
Aravindan said the development of the smart irrigation system was a transformative step forward for farmers.
"By automating labour-intensive processes and putting control in the hands of advanced technology, farmers can 
save time, conserve resources and focus on other priorities without the stress of manual management.”
The system features an ultra-compact design and precision valve control adjustable to any degree.
It is currently installed on an 80-hectare plot of Mark and Andrew Castelanelli’s farm in the Burdekin region near 
Townsville.
For Mark, who has been a sugarcane farmer for 55 years, smart irrigation heralds the future of farming.
Mark said while other smart systems had been on the market for a few years, this was the first that had been 
purpose-built for the sugarcane industry.
The veteran farmer previously racked up 15,000 kilometres each year driving to irrigate crops within a six-kilometre 
radius on his farm.
Mark said using the smart system to irrigate with precision would save labour costs, increase efficiency and leave 
time to focus on other things.
"There's endless opportunity and the power of computing is just getting smarter."

Second thoughts on AI as results fall short
Meanwhile, Bain has found that investors believe generative artificial intelligence will not add much value in 2025, 
believing it will take up to three years to see the full benefit.
A number of investors said that just 20 per cent of their portfolio companies had Generative AI use cases that were 
"delivering value". About 30 per cent of portfolio companies are still testing or developing AI use cases.
Similarly to Cisco, Bain found that AI investments are four times more likely to disappoint investors than they are to 
exceed -expectations.
Over the past 12 months, AI agents - chatbots that use "large language models" to undertake tasks such as reading 
and responding to emails - have been cited as one of the first major uses of the technology.
But Australian workers disagree, with a recent EY report finding that just 37 per cent of employees are comfortable 
with their companies introducing AI assistants and just 31 per cent thinking AI chatbots are helpful for customer 
service.
That report says the integration of AI in the workplace has been met with mixed responses.
More than half of those surveyed are deeply concerned that AI could result in job losses. That fear is greater for 
women: 59 per cent are concerned about job losses, compared to 51 per cent of men.
Meanwhile, 40 per cent are "deeply uncomfortable" with AI being used to monitor their behaviour and 46 per cent 
don't want AI to provide efficiency -recommendations.
Almost half of respondents are uncomfortable with AI taking on employee performance reviews and 52 per cent 
don't wish to be interviewed by a chatbot when going for a new role.
Almost two thirds of respondents - 62 per cent - are worried that employees will attempt to manipulate the way they 
think with AI applications.
EY chief technology officer Katherine Boiciuc said there were real "innovation versus insecurity" and "progress 
versus privacy" issues.
"On the one hand, there's recognition of the benefits AI can bring to business and people, suggesting an openness 
to the potential for it to enhance productivity and improve work-life balance," she said.
"On the other hand, there is a level of discomfort and concern among Australians about the broader implications AI 
might have on their employment, workplace culture and privacy." It was clear AI used in a supervisor-type role "has 
also struck a nerve" and the technology was fuelling "insecurities" in the workplace, especially "among those in 
manual labour/skilled trades and among women".
