## Assistant

Daphne Gommans' statement is neutral, as it simply mentions testing PJR Care nail polish without expressing a clear opinion on Acrylnagelproducten, suggesting no strong stance for or against it. Given the lack of evaluative language, her views appear consistent and unlikely to significantly impact Acrylnagelproducten's reputation or operations.
