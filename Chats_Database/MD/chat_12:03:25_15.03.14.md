Nvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang said artificial intelligence had hit a "tipping point," sending the stock to 
new dizzying heights.
The renewed rally has Huang, known for his love of wearing leather jackets, on the verge of his own breakthrough: 
becoming one of the 20 richest people in the world.
Huang's wealth jumped $US9.6 billion ($14.7 billion) to $US69.2 billion, a gain that leapfrogged him ahead of 
Charles Koch and Chinese bottled-water tycoon Zhong Shanshan to 21st place on the Bloomberg Billionaires 
Index. It's a remarkable rise for the co-founder of the semiconductor company, who was ranked 128th with a net 
worth of $US13.5 billion as recently as early last year.
Nvidia surged 16 per cent to a record high on Thursday in New York, adding about $US277 billion in market value. 
That was the biggest single-session increase in market history, beating Meta's $US197 billion gain earlier this 
month. The company was able to exceed sky-high investor expectations with a revenue forecast that was more 
than $US2 billion ahead of analyst expectations.
Nvidia's rally boosted the fortunes of the 30 billionaires on Bloomberg's wealth list who attribute at least some of 
their wealth to AI by a combined $US42.8 billion. Charles Liang, CEO of Super Micro Computer, was the biggest 
winner on a percentage basis with a 33 per cent jump.
Nvidia's outlook extends a streak of the company shattering expectations, thanks to insatiable demand for its 
artificial intelligence accelerators - highly prized chips that crunch data for AI models. The technology has helped 
power a proliferation of chatbots and other generative AI services, which can create text and graphics based on 
simple prompts.
"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point," Huang said. "Demand is surging worldwide 
across companies, industries and nations."

Nvidia's market capitalisation has now increased by more than $US650 billion this year - bringing its valuation to 
$US1.89 trillion - as investors bet that the company will remain the prime beneficiary of an AI computing boom.
That turned Wednesday's report into a highly anticipated event for both Wall Street and the tech world. And the 
numbers - along with the upbeat tone from Huang - renewed confidence that spending will stay strong.
"The entire market is watching this report and expectations have been elevated," Wolfe Research analyst Chris 
Caso said.
Guidance was strong enough to "demonstrate continued momentum, while also leaving room for continued upside 
through the second half."
Nvidia, co-founded by Huang in 1993, got its start as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. Its profile 
blew up in the last two years, when its technology proved adept at handling heavy AI workloads. The company's 
H100 accelerators have become legendary in the tech world, with customers scrambling to get their hands on as 
many as possible.
Companies such as Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet's Google are Nvidia's largest customers, 
accounting for nearly 40 per cent of its revenue, as they rush to invest in hardware for AI computing.
In the US fiscal fourth quarter, which ended January 28, Nvidia's revenue more than tripled to $US22.1 billion. Profit 
excluding certain items was $US5.16 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $US20.4 billion and earnings 
of $US4.60 a share. Underscoring the magnitude of its recent growth streak: As recently as 2021, Nvidia didn't 
generate that much revenue in an entire year.
Nvidia's data centre division, now by far its largest source of sales, generated $US18.4 billion of revenue, up 409 
per cent from the same period a year earlier. Gaming chips provided $US2.87 billion of sales.
Nvidia is now working to spread its AI technology beyond the big data-centre companies. Huang, 61, has travelled 
the globe arguing that governments and corporations need their own AI systems - both to protect their data and 
gain a competitive advantage.
Nvidia announced a deal with Cisco Systems earlier this month that gives it a new distribution channel. As part of 
that deal, Cisco, the world's biggest provider of networking gear, will help sell complete AI systems to companies.
But Nvidia faces risks, including mounting competition and a push by some customers to develop their own AI 
chips.
"We're going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in the marketplace," Huang said.

AI is far better than managers at writing rosters - and it won't forget who's away, who can't work nights and to give 
part-timers a minimum of 12 hours a week.
The technology has for several months done just that for customers of Australian tech company Deputy, which 
provides rostering and employment advice for more than a quarter of a million businesses in over half the world's 
countries.
The technology was proving particularly good in hospitality settings, especially busy cafes that had high turnover, 
said Deepesh Banerji, who oversees the product as chief product officer.
"One of the most crushing things for employee engagement is having to work when you're busy or having to come 
into work when you didn't know you had to," he said.
AI Auto Scheduling is one of several products that Mr Banerji - as Deputy's resident AI chief - helped to shape, 
including a tool that can write job descriptions based on the data Deputy has about a business.
The 41-year-old, who studied maths and engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada, is one of dozens of 
executives across the country who have been tasked with managing one of the fastest-growing technologies in the 
world.
Sometimes it can be hard to explain, Mr Banerji simply says: "It's all about intelligent machines that are making 
decisions, understanding information and recommending things." Mr Banerji said he tells friends the best way to 
understand the technology is to use it, and often recommends they try ChatGPT.
The technology had made several changes to the way the Deputy staff worked in recent years, with the company 
having developed its own large language model. "Our knowledge bases have the ability to ask questions on our 
internal internet," he said.

Working out staff rosters 'best left to AI'
As for his AI prediction for the year, Mr Banerji has a similar view to Seek AI chief Grant Wright - "AI agents helping 
in the workplace," he said. Agents would not only schedule staff but make assessments of who might be the best at 
a particular role, choosing who might work the register and who might be better on the floor selling clothes.
At big four bank ANZ, chief technology officer Tim Hogarth, who studied business information systems and 
information technology at the University of South Australia, holds the reins on AI.
Prior to ANZ he worked as vice-president of innovation at TD bank in Canada and as head of application platform at 
CBA.
While most financial institutions have major technology teams, Mr Hogarth said it was important to remember "we're 
a bank first". He said: "When people write code it's 'if this, then that' - it's deterministic. But there's a whole bunch of 
problems we can't solve with 'if this, then that'.
"The way I explain it is I have both Taylor Swift and AC/DC in my playlist. You can't write rules to say 'this chief 
technical officer used to work in Canada, then play these songs'. But Spotify uses patterns and they discover music 
I like and overlap that with what other people like and it finds patterns between them." When it came to banking, he 
said: "AI can essentially find trends and implement solutions faster than we can interpret them and write the code 
ourselves." And in 2024, the technology is now brought several times a day. "It has changed from being one of the 
technologies that was occasionally mentioned to every single conversation," he said.
Mr Hogarth said he believed Australia had not yet seen the full innovation AI would bring. "We're at the bottom of 
the S curve," he said.
He wants Australia to be at the forefront of the revolution rather than "play catch-up", and that could happen if 
Australia didn't capitalise on the opportunity.
US multinational Cisco might have one of Australia's most senior AI executives, with 28-year veteran Carl Solder 
leading the charge.
Mr Solder is chief technology officer of ANZ, a role he took up after briefly leaving Cisco after spending several 
years as vice-president of engineering, based in Silicon Valley in California.
"AI is software that intends to mimic human intelligence," Mr Solder said. "A traditional computer program follows a 
set of fixed instructions to perform an outcome that's always the same. With AI, the outcome you'll get is going to be 
a little bit more fluid." Last year Cisco conducted a global AI readiness that found just 5 per cent of Australian 
customers were ready to adopt AI. That same report found 59 per cent of respondents believed they had just 12 
months to adopt AI, which leaves him to the conclusion that companies would race to adopt the technology either 
through off-the-shelf products from the company or going out creating their own AI product.

Beiling's buy-local policy has hit US tech giants hard For American tech companies in China, the writing is on the 
wall. It's also on paper, in Document 79.
The 2022 Chinese government directive expands a drive that is muscling US technology out of the country - an 
effort some refer to as "Delete A", for Delete America.
Document 79 was so sensitive that high-ranking officials and executives were only shown the order and weren't 
allowed to make copies, sources say. It requires state-owned companies in finance, energy and other sectors to 
replace foreign software in their IT systems by 2027.
American tech giants had long thrived in China as they hot-wired the country's meteoric industrial rise with 
computers, operating systems and software. Chinese leaders want to sever that relationship, driven by a push for 
self-sufficiency and concerns over the country's long-term security.
The first targets were hardware makers. Dell, IBM and Cisco Systems have gradually seen much of their 
equipment replaced by products from Chinese competitors.
Document 79, named for the numbering on the paper, targets companies that provide the software enabling daily 
business operations from basic office tools to supply chain management. The likes of Microsoft and Oracle are 
losing ground in the field, one of the last bastions of foreign tech profitability in the country.
The effort is just one salvo in a year-long push by Chinese leader Xi Jinping for self-sufficiency in everything from 
critical technology such as semiconductors and fighter jets to the production of grain and oilseeds. The broader 
strategy is to make China less dependent on the West for food, raw materials and energy, and instead focus on 
domestic supply chains.
Officials in Beijing issued Document 79 in September 2022, as the US was ratcheting up chip export restrictions 
and sanctions on Chinese tech companies. It requires state-owned firms to provide quarterly updates on their

progress in replacing foreign software used for email, human resources and business manage-ment with Chinese 
alternatives.
The directive came down from the agency overseeing the country's massive state-owned enterprise sector - a 
group that includes more than 60 of China's 100 largest listed companies.
That agency, the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, and the country's national 
cabinet, the State Council, didn't respond to requests for comment.
Spending by China's state sector topped 48 trillion yuan ($10 trillion) in 2022. The directive leverages that 
purchasing power to support Chinese tech companies, which in turn can improve their products and narrow the 
technology gap with US rivals.
State firms have ramped up their buying of domestic brands, even if the Chinese substitutes sometimes aren't as 
good. The buyers include banks, financial brokerages and public services such as the postal system.
Back in 2006, "China was the land of milk and honey, and intellectual property was the main challenge", says a 
former US Trade Representative official involved in previous technology discussions with the Chinese. "Now, there 
is a feeling that the sense of opportunity is off. Companies are merely hanging on." The push to localise tech is 
known as Xinchuang, loosely translated as "IT innovation" with a reference to technology that is secure and 
trustworthy. The policy has gained urgency amid an escalating tech and trade war with Washington, which has cut 
many Chinese entities off from American technologies.
Premier Li Qiang reiterated the push during China's annual legislative sessions this week. China's central 
government plans to increase its spending on science and technology by 10 per cent to about $US51bn ($77bn) 
this year, according to a budget report released on Tuesday - up from a 2 per cent increase last year.
At some trade fairs across the country, vendors tout homegrown tech as an alternative to foreign brands. One 
semiconductor equipment maker stall in Nanjing put it bluntly, offering to help buyers "Delete A" from their supply 
chain.
Domestic alternatives are growing more user-friendly. A local official recalled how in 2016, it took a whole day to 
open and close a spreadsheet on a computer with an operating system known as KylinOS, developed by a Chinese 
military-linked company. He compares the usability of the latest KylinOS version to Microsoft's Windows 7, 
introduced in 2009 - workable if not great.
As recently as six years ago, most government tenders sought hardware, chips and software from Western brands. 
By 2023, many were seeking Chinese tech products instead. When the customs department in the eastern Chinese 
city of Ningbo sought to purchase rack servers in 2018, it stated a preference for brands such as Dell and Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise, and for hardware powered by Intel's Xeon central processing units. Five years later, the same 
agency asked for rack servers made by Chinese companies and equipped with Huawei chips.
These servers are typically assembled by state-owned tech manufacturers that barely sell equipment overseas, 
such as Beijing-based Tsinghua Tongfang. Tongfang's controlling shareholder is a state-owned company in charge 
of China's civilian and military nuclear programs.
Some government officials in China's capital had their foreign-branded PCs replaced with those made by Tongfang 
and officials last year were told to use Chinese phones instead of Apple's iPhones for work.
Over the past decade, Xi has repeatedly emphasised technological innovation and the use of trusted homegrown 
technology in government departments and industry. Revelations by former National Security Agency contractor 
Edward Snowden in 2013 that US authorities had hacked into Chinese mobile phone communications, universities 
and private companies strengthened Xi's resolve. More recently, he has told senior officials that China should 
leverage its strengths and market to break bottlenecks in the development of essential software such as operating 
systems.Page 3 of 4
Chinese push to delete US technology
As China focused on replacing hardware, IBM's China revenues have steadily declined. It downsized its China 
research operations in Beijing in 2021, more than two decades after it opened.
Cisco, once a technology powerhouse in China, said in 2019 that it was losing orders in the country to local 
vendors. PC maker Dell's market share in China has almost halved in the past five years, to 8 per cent. Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise, which makes servers, storage and networks, got 14.1 per cent of its revenue from China in 
2018, according to estimates from FactSet. By 2023, that had fallen to 4 per cent.
In May, HPE said it would sell its 49 per cent stake in its Chinese joint venture. The company continues to sell direct 
to multinational customers in China and sells selected products to the broader mainland market through its Chinese 
partner.
In software, Adobe, Citrix parent Cloud Software Group and Salesforce have pulled out or downsized direct 
operations in the country over the past two years.
Microsoft, the world's biggest software provider, historically dominated computer operating systems in China. A 
Morgan Stanley poll of 135 chief information officers in China found that many expected the share of computers 
powered by Microsoft's Windows operating system installed in their companies to fall over the next three years. 
They expected Linux-based UOS, or Unity Operating System, an effort co-led by a state-owned company, to gain in 
the shift. Even as Microsoft's top executives and co-founder Bill Gates have frequently travelled to Beijing for high-
profile meetings with Chinese leaders on subjects like co-operation on AI and US-China trade relations in recent 
years, the company has decreased its offerings in China. Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a subcommittee 
hearing last September that China made up just 1.5 per cent of its overall sales.
