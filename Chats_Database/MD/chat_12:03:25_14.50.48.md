Renewables developer Ampyr Energy Global is set to become the sole owner of NSW's 1000MWh Wellington 
battery energy storage system after agreeing to buy out co-investor Shell's 50 per cent stake, as it shoots for a 20 
per cent market share of Australia's 16GW battery supply by 2030.
Ampyr Australia, whose Singaporean parent is backed by infrastructure investor Stonepeak, was able to lap up the 
stake via private negotiations with Shell. The duo in 2022 began developing Wellington, which has ticked off all 
approvals and is preparing to kick off construction in July or August.
The battery's first stage, which will cost about $400 million to build, will see Ampyr turn on 600MWh by mid-2026 
with the remaining capacity to follow in 2027.
The site is located close to the central nodes in Trangrid's transmission backbone and geographically within the 
Central West Orana Renewable Energy Zone. About two thirds of its capacity is expected to be taken up by the 
nearby 300MW Wellington solar farm, which is owned by Lightsource BP.
"We're grateful for Shell's contributions to the Wellington BESS project, and we are excited about accelerating its 
development to bring this vital project to market," Ampyr Australia CEO Alex Wonhas told Street Talk. "Reliable, 
cost competitive electricity is a cornerstone of Australia's economic growth."
Of note, Ampyr Australia is actively hunting through M&A as well as organic opportunities as it aims for a 3GW 
battery portfolio by 2050, or about 18 per cent of the 16GW that the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) 
has forecast the country needs to support the shift from coal-fired plants to renewable sources.
The Ampyr Energy Group is the renewables platform of Singapore-headquarted AGP Sustainable Real Assets, 
which in late 2023 attracted a billion-dollar investment from US's Stonepeak.

1. Ampyr Energy Global has acquired Shell's 50% stake in the Wellington battery energy storage system in New South Wales, indicating a strategic shift for Shell away from direct involvement in battery storage projects in Australia.

2. The sale of Shell's stake reflects the company's ongoing transition and potential divestment from certain renewable energy assets, as it focuses on its core oil and gas operations amidst a changing energy landscape.

3. Ampyr's plans to develop the Wellington battery system, which is expected to contribute significantly to Australia's renewable energy goals, highlight the competitive landscape in the battery storage market, where Shell's previous involvement is now being replaced by other players.

4. The transaction underscores the growing importance of battery storage in Australia's energy transition, with Ampyr aiming for a substantial market share, which may impact Shell's future strategies in the renewable sector. 

5. Shell's exit from the Wellington project may raise questions about its commitment to renewable energy initiatives in Australia, especially as the country moves towards a more sustainable energy framework.
