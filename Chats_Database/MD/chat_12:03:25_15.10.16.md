Highlight: BP and Shell led Big Oil's push into renewable energy. Now they are leading the retreat.
Body
BP and Shell led Big Oil's push into renewable energy. Now they are leading the retreat.
Last week BP announced that it had sold its offshore wind assets into a joint venture with Japan's JERA, itself a 
joint venture between Tokyo Electric Power and Chubu Electric Power, to create one of the world's largest offshore 
wind businesses.
That followed an earlier BP announcement, in September, that it planned to sell its US onshore wind farms.
Under former chief executive, Bernard Looney, BP had been building its wind farm portfolio as part of an ambitious 
strategy to cut its hydrocarbon production by 40 per cent by 2030, reduce its emissions and those of its customers 
by 35 to 40 per cent by the end of this decade and become a "net zero"-emissions company by 2050.
Last year it started backing away from those commitments, saying it would cut production by only 25 per cent by 
2030 and its emissions by 20 to 30 per cent.
This year, under a new chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, it now appears even those reduced targets are being 
wound back.
It's not just BP.
Shell has scaled back its investment in renewables, including offshore wind and hydrogen; it has reduced its 
emissions' intensity targets and it has abandoned its objective of becoming the world's largest electricity company. 
Norway's energy giant, Equinor, has also announced plans to shrink its renewable energy division.
As they retreat from their push into renewable energy and downgrade their ambitions to build major exposures to 
electricity generation, the UK and European oil companies are refocusing on their traditional oil and gas 
businesses.
Where previously they planned to cap or reduce their production, now they are planning and investing to increase it.

Big Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare
Last year BP raised its forecast of oil equivalent production from 1.5 billion barrels a day by 2030 to 2 million 
barrels a day, planning to invest $US8 billion ($12.6 billion) more than previously budgeted on new oil and gas 
investments. Since Auchincloss became CEO, that focus on lifting hydrocarbon production has intensified.
The commercial logic in what they are doing is clear. BP generates returns of 15 to 20 per cent on its fossil fuel 
investments but only 6 to 8 per cent from its renewable assets, with wind's returns inferior to solar's.
Ploughing billions each year into wind, solar and hydrogen dilutes the overall returns on capital and reduces the 
returns to shareholders, making them most unhappy. Having invested about $US18 billion over the past five years 
in lower-returning renewables between them, BP and Shell investors have become increasingly unhappy.
Moreover, the UK and European energy majors are always compared with their US counterparts.
Exxon and Chevron haven't been anywhere near as committed to lowering the carbon intensity of their portfolios as 
their transatlantic rivals. The US majors were committed to the "drill, baby, drill" mantra before Donald Trump and 
saw that reflected in their share price relativities with their UK and European counterparts.
Where, over the past five years, Exxon's share price has risen 54 per cent and Chevron's 23 per cent, BP's has 
fallen 22 per cent and Shell's more than 6 per cent. That kind of disparity in performance tends to galvanise 
shareholders, along with executives motivated by their remuneration.
By moving its offshore wind assets into a joint venture vehicle and off its own balance sheet BP will keep an 
exposure to wind but significantly reduce the amounts of capital devoted to it and the levels of debt supporting it.
Between them, BP and JERA plan to spend up to $US5.8 billion on their combined portfolios (which includes the 
proposed Blue Mackerel offshore wind farm in Bass Strait) by the end of 2030. With shared investment and non-
recourse funding, BP's capital commitment will be modest relative to what it would otherwise have been.
Both BP and Shell still seem committed to solar, which is less capital intensive than wind, but that won't help them 
escape the criticism from climate activist groups and ESG (environmental, social and governance) investors, who 
are particularly vocal and litigious in Europe and the UK.
The problem, of course, is that the companies can't satisfy both constituencies and in a contest between emissions 
and returns is one that ultimately shareholders will always win.
With Trump about to return to the White House and open up US federal lands to more drilling for oil and gas, and 
the incoming Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, having a "3-3-3" plan that includes lifting US energy production by 
three million barrels of oil equivalent a day, the contrast between the environment for the US producers and their 
competitors elsewhere will only become starker and the pressure from shareholders on companies like BP and 
Shell will only intensify.
Trump also plans to remove the generous 10-year tax credits for renewables within Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction 
Act, which, if he is successful, would make the returns from investment in US renewables even less competitive 
with those from fossil fuels.
Any increase in US oil production would add to the existing glut in the oil market and depress prices that are 
already under pressure, despite the withdrawal of about six million barrels a day of supply by the OPEC+ cartel.
The lower prices being experienced now and likely to continue into at least the first half of next year, however, 
aren't an argument for the oil majors to invest in renewables.
Returns from oil and gas will still be superior to those from renewables and, if oil and gas prices and profits are 
under pressure, there will be even more of an incentive to invest only in the highest-returning assets.
Those who invest purely in renewables appear unconcerned about the gradual withdrawal of the oil majors who 
gatecrashed their sector and, seeking to gain scale rapidly, drove up the costs of developing greenfields projects.Page 3 of 3
Big Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare
Ploughing billions each year into wind, solar and hydrogen dilutes the overall returns on capital and reduces the 
returns to shareholders, making them most unhappy.
There are a lot of environmentally-sensitive and patient investment funds available from sources other than the oil 
majors that are willing to trade off returns for their convictions and/or consistent long-term returns, so losing some 
investment from the oil companies shouldn't retard renewables developments.
It was always going to be difficult for BP and Shell to try to produce a balance of their traditional oil and gas 
businesses and renewable energy portfolios while satisfying both financially-motivated and ESG-driven investors.
It has been particularly difficult for the UK and Europeans, with their lower returns but better environmental 
credentials, to attract investors in the US. There's been a backlash against ESG investing in the US where, 
because there is no significant stigma associated with the oil and gas industry, valuation metrics tend to be higher.
If BP and Shell want better access to those more attractive metrics, improved share price performances and 
access to cheaper capital, they have no realistic option but to shed, and invest less in, low-returning assets. That's 
what they are now doing.

Oil group Equinor cuts green spending

The Norwegian state-backed oil company that is attempting to develop one of the largest untapped oil fields in 
British waters has dramatically scaled back its investment in renewables and raised its fossil fuel production 
targets, becoming the latest of the world's energy giants to resist the push towards green power.
Equinor, which changed its name from Statoil in 2018, has said it will halve its spending on renewable energy 
projects to $US5bn between this year and 2027, excluding project financing, and has cut its target to grow clean 
power capacity from 7 gigawatts to 10-12GW by 2030, from a previous goal of 12-16GW.
It aims to produce 2.2 million barrels of oil a day by the end of the decade, up from about 2 million barrels 
previously forecast.
The decision makes the Oslo-based group the latest of the world's oil and gas giants to dilute renewables 
ambitions. BP, the FTSE 100 constituent, is set to unwind 2030 targets to cut oil and gas production targets and 
drop its low-carbon deployment goal when it updates its capital allocation strategy later this month.
Equinor chief executive Anders Opedal said that cutting capital expenditure on renewables would help address 
challenges in the offshore wind industry, and increase "value creation". The company expects to produce free 
cashflow of $US23bn by 2027, $US11n of which will be returned to shareholders as dividends.
In December, Equinor combined its British oil and gas assets with Shell under a new 50-50 joint venture, which 
they claimed would create the largest independent producer in the maturing North Sea.
However, its ambitions in the North Sea were dealt a blow last week when the Scottish courts quashed consent for 
Rosebank, which is co-owned by Ithaca Energy, and Shell's Jackdaw field after a legal challenge brought by the 
campaign groups Greenpeace and Uplift against the government's decision in 2023 to greenlight the projects.
Shell's Jackdaw gas field and Equinor's Rosebank oilfield must now reapply for government permission because 
their original approvals failed to consider the emissions that will be generated when the oil and gas is burnt.

However, the companies have been allowed to continue development work in the meantime. Equinor has spent 
Ã‚Â£2.2bn on Rosebank so far.
Philippe Mathieu, executive vice-president for exploration and production international, said that the project would 
contribute to Britain's growth agenda and create about 2000 jobs in the construction phase.
The fate of the fields will be a test of the government's approach to the North Sea. British Energy Secretary Ed 
Miliband has vowed to stop issuing new North Sea oil and gas licences and described Rosebank as a "colossal 
waste of taxpayer money and climate vandalism" while in opposition.
Mr Mathieu said the project would boost domestically produced oil and gas and reduce reliance on imports.
"If you don't have Rosebank oil for the UK, then you have to import it from somewhere else â€¦ how much CO2 is 
that going to cost?" he said. The Times

Leaders Paul Keating reserves special praise for visionary change-makers in banking, mining and 
entrepreneurship, writes Michael Stutchbury.
When asked to name the business people who impressed him the most during his long political career, Paul 
Keating starts with Keith Campbell, former head of the Hooker real estate company. Campbell's landmark financial 
system review in the late 1970s laid out the intellectual case for Labor's financial deregulation and the floating of the 
dollar.
Rod Carnegie, now 91, also draws praise from Keating in an exclusive interview with The Australian Financial 
Review to mark his 80th birthday. Carnegie set up McKinsey in Australia and sought to Australianise CRA, now 
known as Rio Tinto, as CEO in the 1980s. "He was a progressive thinking guy and an economic nationalist," 
Keating says.
On the other hand, it's hard to pick a banker given the banks hold public licences, Keating says.
Another on Keating's list of business greats is former BHP boss Marius Kloppers, who "broke the back" of 
negotiating contract pricing in 2010 in favour of using market spot prices for Australia's iron ore exports. "You've got 
to give him big, big marks for that," Keating says.
Pressed about his complaint about a lack of outward-looking entrepreneurs in the modern Australian economy that 
he helped create, Keating accepts there are some. He points to Fortescue Minerals' Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest, 
along with Atlassian founders Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, and Canva founders Melanie Perkins and 
Cliff Obrecht.
But the business person that merits a story is Ian McLennan, general manager and chairman of BHP between 1967 
and 1977. McLennan helped drive the company's search for oil in Bass Strait and gas in the North West Shelf.
The story takes place in 1975 - just after the defeat of the Whitlam government - when Keating was appointed 
shadow minister for minerals and resources.
Page 2 of 2
Movers, shakers caught PM's eye
McLennan caught a train to Keating's electorate office in Bankstown, a suburb in south-west Sydney, on a Saturday 
morning. He told the young Labor frontbencher that BHP had a chance of buying the exploration leases of the 
troubled British oil company, Burmah, in the highly prospective North West Shelf.
But with the prospect of a very long lead time for the major gas development, McLennan said BHP would not make 
the investment if the Labor opposition held to the policy of its previous resources minister, Rex Connor, that the gas 
should be controlled by the government and used for local industry rather than be exported to Japan.
"I said, 'Sir Ian, you will be very pleased with my answer'," Keating said. "I thought that Rex had made huge 
mistakes in this because this is a gas-prone continent. And anyone who puts a contract before us, we should sign 
and anyone who wants to capitalise on it, we should grab in a foot tackle and get their signature on the page."
That convinced BHP to buy part of Burmah's stake in what became Australia's biggest ever resource project. And 
so began the nation's liquefied natural gas export industry.
Keating then wrote support for the North West Shelf project into the Labor Party's policy platform at its 1977 
conference in Perth. The other part of the stake was bought by Shell, which played a big role in building the project. 
Keating recalls travelling to Tokyo three times with Shell's Ric Charlton to talk to Japanese bankers and gas 
buyers. And he was impressed with Shell Australia boss and International Olympic Committee member Kevan 
Gosper. AFR

Shell and PetroChina's joint venture Arrow Energy will -expand its Surat Gas Project as it moves to capitalise on -
growing demand.
The expansion will be welcomed by Australia's energy industry, which is struggling to lock-in supplies along the 
country's east coast.
Arrow said it would expand the project in Queensland's Western Downs to produce 4000PJ of gas for the domestic 
market. The joint venture said 450 new gas -production wells, a new field compression station, 27km pipeline and 
road and infrastructure upgrades over two phases would be developed.
Arrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said first gas from the expansion has been targeted for 2026.
"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify 
Arrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast," he said.
The gas from the project would flow to the Shell-operated QCLNG liquefied natural gas facility on Curtis Island, 
near Gladstone, to meet long-term contracts and supply domestic customers, the joint venture partners said.
Shell integrated gas and upstream director Zoe Yujnovich said the expansion underscored its commitment to the 
domestic market. "QCLNG marked its 1000th cargo at the end of last year, reflecting its significance as a gas 
supplier for Australia and the region,' she said.

Shell and PetroChina's joint venture Arrow Energy will expand its Surat Gas Project as it moves to capitalise on 
growing demand, a move likely to stoke opposition from environmentalists.
The expansion will be welcomed by Australia's energy industry, which is struggling to lock in supplies amid rapidly 
depleting stocks across the east coast.
Arrow said it would expand the project in Queensland's Western Downs to produce 4000PJ of gas for long-term 
contracts and to supply the domestic market.
The JV said 450 new gas production wells, a new field compression station, 27km pipeline, and road and 
infrastructure upgrades over two phases would be developed.
Arrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said first gas from the expansion was targeted for 2026.
"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify 
Arrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast," Mr Peng said.
"Natural gas is an important part of the energy transition, and the expansion demonstrates the faith our 
shareholders have in our ability to manage and deliver large-scale projects." Gas from the project will flow to the 
Shell-operated QCLNG liquefied natural gas facility on Curtis Island, near Gladstone, to meet long-term contracts 
and supply domestic customers, the joint venture partners said.
Zoe Yujnovich, Shell's integrated gas and upstream director, said the expansion underscored its commitment to 
the domestic market.
"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to 
market," she said.
"QCLNG marked its 1000th cargo at the end of last year, reflecting its significance as a gas supplier for Australia 
and the region. This investment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a

lower emissions alternative to options like coal." Shell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said the expansion would 
be boon for the local community.
"At its core, this project promotes stronger regional communities, and it also has wider benefits for Australian 
manufacturing and industry more broadly," she said.
The expansion will inflame environmentalists, who oppose any new gas drilling. But Australia's east coast faces a 
looming crisis as offshore gas from Victoria's Bass Strait - the traditional bedrock of the country's supplies - rapidly 
depletes.
The Australian Energy Market Operator has warned the country must urgently unlock new supplies to prevent a 
catastrophic shortfall but new developments are struggling to secure regulatory approvals and/or the support of 
local communities.
Analysts have warned the country's $2.5 trillion economy will be significant harmed by a shortfall. The 
manufacturing sector is particularly exposed with gas its only viable energy source, and any interruptions could 
threaten their viability.
Households could also be disrupted. Victoria is the most gas-dependent state, relying on the fuel source to heat 
homes, and a shortfall could make heating prohibitively expensive.
Other states will also be hit. Gas is used as a so-called peaker, burnt to provide electricity during periods of high 
demand or low supply from other fossil fuels or renewables. If Australia's National Electricity Market has insufficient 
gas on hand, the price of electricity will spike. Higher electricity bills was a key driver behind Australia's spike in 
inflation, which in turn forced the Reserve Bank of Australia to raise interest rates 13 times.
With a looming shortfall, gas developers have insisted governments fast-track applications, a request that the 
federal Labor government has refused - insisting it must properly assess each application. The gas industry has 
accused the government of slow walking, which indicates its support for gas - a claim denied by Labor.

## Assistant

Among the most negative journalists, Stephen Bartholomeusz presents Shell as a company retreating from its renewable energy commitments due to financial pressures and shareholder dissatisfaction. His narrative emphasizes Shell's shift back to fossil fuel investments, portraying this as a failure of its green strategy and a capitulation to market forces. The article repeatedly highlights the financial underperformance of renewables compared to oil and gas, the pressure from US competitors, and the broader industry trend of scaling back sustainability goals. His tone is particularly critical of Shell’s inability to balance financial returns with environmental commitments, making his coverage more negative than others. Emma Powell also adopts a critical stance, focusing on Shell’s involvement in joint ventures that prioritize fossil fuel expansion over renewables. However, her coverage is slightly less negative as it presents Shell’s actions within the broader industry trend rather than singling it out as aggressively as Bartholomeusz does.

Among the most positive journalists, Michael Stutchbury frames Shell as a key player in Australia’s energy development, particularly in historical contexts such as the North West Shelf project. His article highlights Shell’s role in securing energy exports and economic growth, portraying the company as a visionary force in the industry. This historical perspective, combined with a focus on Shell’s contributions to national economic policy, results in a more favorable sentiment. Colin Packham also presents Shell positively, emphasizing its role in expanding domestic gas supply through the Arrow Energy joint venture. His coverage highlights the economic and energy security benefits of Shell’s projects, portraying the company as a responsible and necessary player in addressing Australia’s energy needs. However, Stutchbury’s coverage is judged more positive because it ties Shell’s actions to broader economic progress and national development, whereas Packham’s reporting, while favorable, remains more focused on specific projects.
