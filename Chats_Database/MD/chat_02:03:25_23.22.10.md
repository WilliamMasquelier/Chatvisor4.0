## Assistant

Andrew Brown's decision to fully step back from Orsted's operations by the end of March suggests a neutral to slightly negative sentiment, as it indicates a disengagement from the company's future direction. While there is no explicit criticism, his departure could signal internal challenges or strategic disagreements, potentially impacting Orsted's stability and investor confidence.
