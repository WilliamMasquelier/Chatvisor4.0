THE world's largest offshore wind developer Orsted has ditched plans for a mega plant to develop green fuels - 
becoming the latest company to scale back commitments to switch to cleaner energy such as hydrogen and wind.
It had been building a hub in Sweden for use by sectors from shipping to aviation.
Through combined hydrogen and carbon dioxide, the facility would have produced 55,000 tons per year of e-
methane.
But chief executive Mads Nipper said: 'The business case has deteriorated due to the inability to sign long-term 
offtake contracts at sustainable pricing and significantly higher project costs.'
The move to halt work has cost £172m. Orsted is a major player in the sector and is set to build an £8bn offshore 
wind farm in the North Sea by the end of 2027 to power more than 3.3m UK homes.

1. Orsted has abandoned its plans for a mega plant aimed at developing green fuels, marking a significant retreat from its commitment to cleaner energy initiatives, including hydrogen production.

2. The decision to halt the project, which was intended to produce 55,000 tons of e-methane annually, was influenced by deteriorating business conditions, including challenges in securing long-term offtake contracts at sustainable prices and rising project costs.

3. The cancellation of the green fuels project has resulted in a financial loss of £172 million for Orsted, highlighting the economic risks associated with large-scale renewable energy investments.

4. Despite this setback, Orsted remains a key player in the renewable energy sector, with plans to construct an £8 billion offshore wind farm in the North Sea, expected to power over 3.3 million homes in the UK by 2027.
