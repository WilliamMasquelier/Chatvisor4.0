Scientists  have collected samples from the seabed at one of the UK’s oldest active offshore wind farms.
The project, led by the University of Essex , will explore the environmental impact of the turbines on the seabed 
amid plans to build thousands more to reach net zero by 2050.
The samples, taken from as close as 50m to the turbines and as far as one mile away, are now being analysed, 
with findings to follow.
Researchers chartered a private survey vessel to carry out their expedition to the site off the coast of Cumbria.
The active wind farm, which has been operational for more than 15 years and is one of the oldest offshore sites in 
the UK, is run by Danish energy firm Orsted.
Dr Natalie Hicks, of the University of Essex’s school of life sciences, said the research was “hugely important”.
“There are not enough specialist scientific vessels to gather the evidence in time, so collaborating with industry is 
key to gathering data,” she said.
“We know our demand for net zero energy targets means we have seen an increase in offshore wind farms, so 
understanding any environmental effects of these wind farms is urgent.
“We hope this research will feed directly into policy decision-making around offshore wind consenting.
“We know we are going to see an increase in offshore wind, so timely and evidence-based decisions are going to 
need to be made by policymakers.

Scientists explore impact of offshore wind farms on seabed
“This science will hopefully underpin their decision-making, and impact on Government  policy.”
The team took samples from the sea floor and hope to discover how the turbines may affect biodiversity, carbon 
storage and seabed composition.
Research is being carried out with Orsted, the University of St Andrews  and the Government’s marine experts, the 
Centre of Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS).
A CEFAS spokesman said it was “critical to scientifically understand offshore structures and their effects and 
impacts on the environment”.
“Too often we make assumptions about what is occurring in our marine environment when considering human 
activities, we need the type of research activity highlighted here to determine whether our assumptions are correct 
and to provide more confidence in our understanding,” the spokesman said.
“Such improved confidence is a vital element of the integrated scientific understanding needed for informed 
decision-making towards ensuring the long-term future of our marine environment.”
Marine scientists will also compare the effects of decommissioned oil platforms to get a snapshot of how fossil fuel 
and renewable energy assets vary in their impacts.
Professor David Paterson , of the University of St Andrews, said: “It’s important we take learnings from the oil and 
gas industry on the environmental effects of oil and gas operations and decommissioning and effectively apply 
these to the offshore wind industry as projects mature towards later life phases.”
A spokesman for Orsted said: “Developing renewable energy in harmony with nature is both possible and 
necessary to address the twin challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.
“Through collaboration with academic bodies and other stakeholders, our aim is to help develop wider scientific 
understanding of the potential ecological benefits and impacts of developing critical green energy projects.
“By taking a science-led approach, we can ensure that renewable energy, such as offshore wind, continues to be 
deployed sensitively and sustainably.”

Highlight: Profits from record-breaking green expansion will go to foreign energy firms
Body
Bill payers are to spend as much as £150 per household on new wind turbines as Ed Miliband oversees a record-
breaking expansion of green energy. 
The money – a total of £3bn, which will ultimately come from consumers – is to fund the construction or expansion 
of nine offshore wind sites between 2027 and 2031, most of them owned by foreign energy companies, plus other 
green technologies such as onshore wind and solar.
Denmark’s state-controlled energy company Orsted is among the biggest winners, along with ScottishPower, which 
is owned by Spanish utility Iberdrola.
The money for wind turbines has been agreed as part of a government auction for renewable energy contracts 
known as the Allocation Round 6 (AR6). Under this system, the Government encourages companies to build low-
carbon energy plants such as solar and wind farms by offering a minimum price for the electricity generated. The 
money for such subsidies is eventually added to bills.
The UK’s power grid operator, National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO), calculates “budget impact” of the 
subsidies for offshore wind and other renewables at £4bn from 2026 to 2031, in today’s money. 
The costs given exclude the additional expense of transmission lines and the expansion of the national grid to 
handle the extra power. 
It means more than five gigawatts (GW) of new offshore wind is now set for construction – a stark contrast to last 
year’s botched auction round when there were no bids.  The Tories offered subsidies so low – at £40 per megawatt 
hour (MWh) – that no offshore wind developers came forward. Subsidies under Mr Miliband will be more than 
doubled to more than £82 per MWh.

Solar farms will get £70/Mwh, with newer technologies like floating wind handed £195/Mwh and tidal stream 
projects given £239/Mwh.
A total of 131 clean energy projects have won state subsidies in this year’s auction, including 115 solar projects 
across England and onshore wind projects mainly in Scotland and Wales. 
Many of the onshore projects are likely to prove highly controversial, with homeowners and environmentalists 
objecting to the industrialisation of landscapes with panels and turbines. 
However, Mr Miliband hailed the auction results as a triumph. The Energy Secretary said: “We inherited a broken 
energy policy ... Today we have a record-setting round for enough renewable power for 11m homes, essential to 
give energy security to families across the country. 
“It is another significant step forward in our mission for clean power by 2030 – bringing Britain energy independence 
and lower bills for good.” 
However, much will depend on the market value of electricity in coming years. If the market value rises above the 
values offered under the contracts for difference (CfDs), the energy companies could end up refunding part of the 
extra money.
Orsted  is one of the biggest winners. It has been allowed to shunt much of its Hornsea 3 project out of contracts 
signed under previous allocation rounds, where lower subsidies were offered, into this year’s auction.
A spokesman for Mr Miliband said the move had been permitted because otherwise Hornsea 3 – potentially the 
world’s largest wind farm at 3GW  – might never have been built.
Critics will argue that such contracts become meaningless if companies can simply move them from one auction 
round if a subsequent one offers better terms. 
Orsted was also awarded a 2.4GW CfD for Hornsea 4. Rasmus Errboe, of Orsted, said: “We look forward to 
delivering these landmark projects, which will supply renewable power at a large scale to UK consumers and 
businesses and help the UK Government achieve its target of quadrupling offshore wind capacity to 60GW by 
2030.”
ScottishPower, owned by Spanish utility giant Iberdrola, has been offered contracts for another two large wind 
farms, East Anglia Two and East Anglia Three. As with Orsted, it was allowed to move its East Anglia Three project 
out of the contracts signed under a previous and less lucrative auction into this year’s round. 
Keith Anderson, the chief executive of ScottishPower, said: “Offshore wind is back on track after last year’s misstep.
“This auction’s success shows this tried and tested investment mechanism, replicated globally, delivers exactly the 
scale of action needed, with billions of pounds to be pumped into the British economy replacing ageing, polluting 
infrastructure.”
However profits from ScottishPower’s projects will go to Iberdrola’s shareholders – largely in Spain.
Responding to today’s CfD auction AR6 results, Emma Pinchbeck, Energy UK’s chief executive, said: “AR6 
represents a crucial step in the journey to clean power by 2030. As we recover from an energy crisis caused by our 
exposure to international fossil fuel prices, it’s more important than ever that we build a clean energy system that 
can ensure our energy security and protect homes and businesses across the country from unaffordable energy 
bills.”
She added: “This is by far the cheapest way to power the UK.”
Claire Coutinho, the shadow energy secretary, said: “I welcome the 5GW of offshore wind contracted in the latest 
renewable auction which I started last year. Page 3 of 3

“Under the Conservatives, Britain built more offshore wind than any other country bar China, thanks to the 
competition enabled by CfDs – which the Conservatives introduced in 2014.”
John Constable, director of Renewable Energy Foundation, a UK charity publishing data on the renewables sector, 
said: “Ed Miliband is spending consumer funds on a scale that is as reckless as it will be eye-wateringly painful. 
Billions in new subsidies on an offshore wind industry that was only recently claiming to have slashed costs, billions 
to make nuclear viable in markets distorted by wind and solar, and yet more in charges to pay for grid and 
constraint payments.”
He concluded: “This cannot end well.”
A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesman said it did not recognise the costs per household, but 
renewable energy remained essential to boost UK energy security. 
“Investing in renewables is crucial to reverse the legacy of a broken energy policy, so we are no longer reliant on 
volatile fossil fuel prices which left us vulnerable to a cost of living crisis. These projects will help protect bill payers 
permanently.”
Industry experts said the 3.4GW of generation capacity delivered by the auction was far short of what the 
Government needed – leaving a gap of 28GW to be filled by 2026. 
Sam Hollister, of energy consultancy LCP Delta said: “This auction only delivered 3.4GW of new offshore wind 
projects, with another 1.5GW already in the pipeline. This is well below the levels that were needed in this auction 
for the UK to reach its target of 55GW of offshore wind by 2030.”

Highlight: Le gouvernement dirigé par le Labour a relevé le prix garanti de revente de l'électricité produite. Des 
accords pour 131 projets, essentiellement dans l'éolien et le solaire, ont été signés, notamment par le danois 
Orsted.
Body
Si le nouveau gouvernement britannique menace l'industrie pétrolière en mer du Nord d'une hausse de la taxation 
des « surprofits », de dégrèvements fiscaux moins généreux sur les investissements et se montre prêt à geler de 
nouvelles licences d'exploration, il accélère sur l'énergie décarbonée.
Après s'être dit prêt à cofinancer à hauteur de 5,5 milliards de livres (6,5 milliards d'euros) le projet d'EPR par EDF 
à Sizewell la semaine dernière, il a annoncé ce mardi avoir signé des accords facilitant la construction de 131 
projets de productions d'énergie renouvelable, éolien et solaire. Quand ils seront menés à bien, ces projets 
totaliseront 9,6 gigawatts, une puissance permettant par exemple d'alimenter 11 millions de foyers, s'est félicité le 
gouvernement.
Prix en hausse
Après un appel d'offres similaire raté l'an dernier car le prix minimum de revente de l'électricité garanti par l'Etat 
n'était jugé suffisant par aucun opérateur, Londres a revu à la hausse son budget, notamment le mois dernier, pour 
relever son prix garanti sur 15 ans. Le gouvernement a autorisé des opérateurs s'étant déjà vu attribuer des projets 
ces deux dernières années à recandidater avec les prix plus élevés proposés aujourd'hui.
Le 1,6 giga accordé aujourd'hui est dans cette configuration. Pour l'éolien offshore, par exemple, le prix était 
compris entre 54 et 59 livres par mégawattheure (hors inflation), contre 37 livres en 2022 et sachant que le prix de 
gros actuel spot de l'électricité est autour de 80 livres, selon le « FT ».

Londres veut décarboner sa production d'électricité d'ici à 2030 et mettre le pays en « net zero » d'ici à 2050. A 
cette échéance, il s'est notamment fixé comme objectif d'avoir 60 gigawatts de puissance installée dans l'éolien en 
mer, selon la BBC. Selon un expert d'Aurora Energy Research interrogé par le média public, il faudra encore 
construire 31 gigawatts après les annonces d'aujourd'hui, ce qui n'est pas gagné et met la pression sur l'appel 
d'offres de l'an prochain. Le Royaume-Uni va créer une nouvelle entreprise publique dans les énergies 
décarbonées : Great British Energy, dotée de 8,3 milliards de livres, qui doit lancer des projets.
Orsted gagnant
Dans le détail, les 9,6 gigawatts se décomposent ainsi : 5 gigawatts pour l'éolien offshore, 3,3 gigawatts pour le 
solaire et 1 milliard pour l'éolien terrestre.
Parmi les groupes ayant toppé avec Londres, le danois Orsted, à majorité détenu par l'Etat, se distingue avec des 
contrats pour deux fermes géantes d'éoliennes offshore sur les côtes du Yorkshire. Scottish Power, qui appartient 
au groupe espagnol Iberdrola, a également trouvé un accord pour un projet de presque 1 gigawatt sur la côte du 
Suffolk, celle-là même où se trouve la centrale nucléaire Sizewell.

Some £10 billion worth of public money will be spent on new offshore wind contracts over the coming years as the 
government chases 2030 renewable energy targets.
Nine project subsidies were awarded under the UK's latest allocation round on Tuesday, guaranteeing prices for the 
energy they produce.
Developments by Orsted and ScottishPower were among the nine contracts awarded as the government aims to 
boost offshore wind capacity from 15 gigawatts currently to 55 by 2030.
Britain's energy security department hailed the auction, which stretched to other green technologies, as the largest 
ever, after no bids were received for offshore wind in 2023.
Low offers on subsidies, ensuring £40 per megawatt hour, had seen developers avoid last year's auction, but the 
base price this time was much higher.
Indeed, Orsted secured a strike price of £58.90 for power produced from the Hornsea 4 wind farm, though given 
this was based on 2012 prices the actual figure will be up at £74.
This means it will receive subsidies funded by consumer bills if wholesale prices sit below this and have to refund 
the government in any case it rises above.

Combined with contracts for other offshore Orsted developments, alongside the likes of ScottishPower's East 
Anglia 3, the subsidies are set to be worth billions.
According to National Grid's system operating wing, some £335 million will go to the new 5 gigawatts of offshore 
wind between 2027 and 2028, before rising to £2.7 billion and £2.8 billion respectively in the following two years.
Given these are calculated on 2012 prices, this is set to equate to £10 billion by 2031.
This could well rise too, with Orsted's contracts due to be inflation-indexed over their 15-year terms, alongside 
subsidies for other developers.
Whether the ramped-up funding helps the UK meet 2030 targets remains to be seen, with RenewableUK boss Dan 
McGrail noting future auctions were "crucial".
The industry body added more offshore wind would mitigate growing costs for billpayers to the tune of £3 billion by 
2030 when accounting for the gas it will replace.
Others were less certain about the numbers, with the Renewable Energy Foundation, which has connections to the 
Global Warming Policy Foundation climate denial thinktank, warning the spending was "reckless" given grid 
constraints, which will have to be addressed by National Grid PLC (LSE:NG.).

- Ørsted has been forced to cancel its flagship green fuel factory, the FlagshipONE project in Sweden, due to a lack of demand for e-methanol. The project was intended to supply container ships with 55,000 tonnes of methanol annually, contributing to the global transition away from fossil fuels. However, the company was unable to secure long-term contracts at viable prices, leading to a financial impairment of 1.5 billion Danish kroner (£172 million). This cancellation highlights the challenges Ørsted faces in diversifying beyond offshore wind and raises concerns about the viability of large-scale green fuel projects. The decision also reflects broader struggles in the renewable energy sector, as other energy majors have similarly scaled back ambitious projects. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 16, 2024]

- Ørsted has suffered another financial impairment of 2.1 billion Danish kroner due to delays at its Revolution Wind project near Martha’s Vineyard, off the U.S. East Coast. The delay in constructing the onshore substation has pushed the commercial operation date from 2025 to 2026, leading to additional financial losses. This setback follows the company’s earlier cancellations of two major offshore wind projects in New Jersey, Ocean Wind I and II, which had already resulted in significant financial impairments. The repeated project delays and cancellations raise concerns about Ørsted’s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments efficiently and profitably. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 16, 2024]

- Ørsted’s stock price has plummeted by more than 7% following the announcement of impairment losses totaling 3.2 billion Danish kroner (£370 million) in the second quarter due to project delays in the U.S. The company has faced setbacks with its Revolution Wind project off the coasts of Connecticut and Rhode Island, as well as impairments related to its canceled Ocean Wind project and the abandoned FlagshipONE green e-methanol project in Sweden. These financial hits indicate ongoing difficulties in executing large-scale renewable energy projects profitably, further eroding investor confidence. [Proactive Investors (UK), Josh Lamb, August 15, 2024]

- Ørsted’s withdrawal from the FlagshipONE project in Sweden underscores the broader challenges facing the synthetic fuel market. The company had planned to invest over 500 million euros in the facility, which was expected to produce 55,000 tonnes of e-methanol annually. However, the high costs of production and the reluctance of shipping companies to pay a premium for sustainable methanol led to the project’s cancellation. This failure highlights the economic and regulatory uncertainties surrounding synthetic fuels and raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to successfully diversify its renewable energy portfolio. [Les Echos, Nicolas Rauline, August 23, 2024]

- Ørsted has been allowed to shift parts of its Hornsea 3 offshore wind project into a more recent and lucrative government auction round, raising concerns about the fairness of the UK’s renewable energy subsidy system. Critics argue that such contract adjustments undermine the credibility of the auction process, as companies can move projects to rounds with higher subsidies, potentially inflating costs for consumers. This move has sparked debate over whether the government’s renewable energy policies are being manipulated to benefit large energy firms at the expense of billpayers.
