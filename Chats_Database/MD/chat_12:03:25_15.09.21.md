Shell chairman Sir Andrew Mackenzie says tackling climate change is harder than he realised when he was 
running BHP, and the world must now focus on a few "winning" solutions and invest in them strongly.
In an exclusive interview with the Tech Zero podcast, Sir Andrew said he believed the world could still cut 
greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, but may have a better chance if the problem was tackled "sector by 
sector" across international borders, rather than "country by country" as required by international climate 
agreements.
Sir Andrew's six-year term as BHP chief executive was marked by a simplification of its portfolio and an embrace of 
social issues like gender balance and the "Scope 3" emissions of customers.
He exited Australia's biggest company in December 2019 and became Shell chairman in May 2021; a move he 
said provided a different perspective on the world's carbon challenge.
"The one thing that has struck me, since moving from BHP to Shell, is it is quite a lot harder than I expected," he 
told the Tech Zero podcast.
"At BHP, to some extent, we were not quite in the thick of it in the way that we are at Shell, and you were able to 
talk about a lot of things that made sense to me, technically, that I assumed could happen more easily than actually, 
when you are having to deal with it in a much more full on way, as you are at Shell."
Sir Andrew said he "strongly believed" the world needed to focus on the best solutions rather than be distracted by 
the wide range of potential decarbonisation technologies.
Sir Andrew said he was a "huge advocate" for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in places where renewable 
electricity was incapable of providing the solution. He said electric vehicle adoption needed to be pushed "hard" and 
liquefied natural gas would be "critical" in supporting the roll-out of renewables.
"Because of the urgency, we have to make our choices and decide where we're really going to put our emphasis," 
he said.

"We shouldn't be adding and adding and adding, if at the same time, we're not finding the things that are winning 
and getting behind that with a lot more investment and more focused investment, and just deciding this is going to 
work in this sector, and let's get behind that because we don't have a lot of time."
Shell's business was built on selling oil and petrol for traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, but the 
company has also invested in electric vehicle charging stations, and Sir Andrew said the world needed to push 
"hard" on electric vehicles, and "maybe harder than we're pushing it".
But despite the rise of electric vehicles, he said the internal combustion engines that consume petrol were here to 
stay, and would enjoy longevity as the world embraced "biofuels" from agricultural waste and synthetically created 
"e-fuels".
"In looking at the future of oil, you look at the future of the internal combustion engine, and some would imagine 
that the internal combustion engine would just kind of disappear. That won't happen," he said.
"Even in a world of very successful decarbonisation ... the internal combustion engine will continue, but it will be 
fuelled by biofuels, maybe by hydrogen or indeed e-fuels."
The comments come as big diesel consumers like Rio Tinto are urging the federal government to ramp up support 
for biofuels, in the belief biofuels are the best way to reduce the emissions of iron ore trucks and trains in the 
decade before batteries are expected to be a viable alternative.
Sir Andrew said liquefied natural gas would be "critical" to the energy transition.
"It is available now, it can be shipped everywhere, it is possible to increase its supply, and it is the lowest carbon 
fossil fuel," he said.
International climate agreements were built on "nationally determined contributions", where each nation set a target 
for emission reductions and attempts to deliver on it, he said. But the problem might be better tackled by industry 
sectors that worked collaboratively across borders.
"That's how some of the issues to do with the ozone hole were sorted in the end, trying to move away from CFCs."
