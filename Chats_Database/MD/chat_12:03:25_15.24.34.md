You are tasked with extracting stakeholder information and direct quotes from a given news article related to Cisco. Your output should be in the form of a markdown table without column titles or any additional information. Each table row should contain:
1. The name of a real person who has expressed a quote in the provided article
2. His role or relation with regards to Cisco.
3. Their original quote about Cisco exactly as it appears in the article, without any modifications or translations

Guidelines:
- Include only real people: Exclude organizations, companies, or any other non-person entities
- Direct connection: Ensure that each selected individual is explicitly connected to Cisco or explicitly express his opinion on Cisco.
- Only include those whose statements are directly about Cisco
- Exclude individuals whose comments are not directly relevant to Cisco or are too general
- Pertinent stakeholders only: Only include the most relevant individuals
- Do not include stakeholders who are not directly associated with Cisco

Output Format Requirements:
- Each line must contain exactly two columns separated by "|" symbols
- Column 1: Stakeholder's name
- Column 2: Stakeholder's role or link to Cisco. If not described in the article, try to interpret its role. If it is not straightforward to interpret, mention "Not mentioned".
- Column 3: Original quote in its original language

Example of correct formatting:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision de Cisco est très importante." |
| John Smith | Cisco's CEO |"We need to review Cisco's proposal carefully." |
| Hans Weber | Financial analyst | "Die Strategie von Cisco ist überzeugend." |

If no relevant individuals with quotes are found, return "None."

AI is 'falling short of the mark'
AI is 'falling short of the mark'

Australian companies have been given an artificial intelligence reality check, with 58 per cent that have invested in 
artificial programs and applications saying the technology has fallen short of expectations.
Meanwhile, about 70 per cent of investors have pulled out of active deals due to AI consideration. Cisco's AI 
readiness index, undertaken for the second time this year, found 38 per cent of companies had allocated between 
10 to 30 per cent of their IT budget to AI, despite many not seeing a return on the investment.
The firm's Australian chief technology officer Carl Solder said Cisco's index found about half of the companies 
surveyed found assistance from AI with processes and operations did not hit the mark. About 44 per cent saw either 
no or not enough improvement in the technology automating their business.
"I think the reality is that they started to appreciate the work and effort involved in getting all those building blocks 
squared away, and the strategy, infrastructure data governance, talent and culture," he said. "The reality is that 
maybe there is a bit more work that we have to do to be fully prepared." Cisco's Index measured the responses of 
3660 senior business leaders from companies with 500 or more staff across 14 countries in the Asia Pacific. The 
index found just 4 per cent of the country was in a position to leverage AI, a figure that dropped from 5 per cent the 
previous year. Mr Solder said 92 per cent of companies were facing increasing pressure to adopt AI despite much 
of it not showing a return on investment over the past year. Most of that pressure came from company chief 
executives and boards.
