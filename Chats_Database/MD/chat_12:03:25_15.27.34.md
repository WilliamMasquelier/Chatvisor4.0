You are tasked with adding English translations to a set of stakeholder quotes. For each quote:
- If the quote is in English, add "N.A." as the translation
- If the quote is in any other language, provide an accurate English translation

Input format is a markdown table with stakeholder names and quotes.
Output should be a markdown table with three columns: name, original quote, and translation.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Never translate English quotes to English - use "N.A." instead.
- Only and always translate non-English quotes.
- If the original quote, in the third column of the md table is not in english, translate it and add the translation in the 4th column, as described below, but that is only when the quote is not in English.
- Keep original quotes exactly as they are.
- Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Example input:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision est importante." |
| John Smith | Shell's corporate lawyer | "We need to review this carefully." |

Example output:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision est importante." | "This decision is important." |
| John Smith | Shell's corporate lawyer | "We need to review this carefully." | N.A. |

Example input:
| [Person Name 1] | Person Role 1 | [Original Quote in another language (e.g. Dutch, French, German, Spanish,eyc..)] |
| [person Name 2] | Person Role 2 | [Original Quote in English] |

Example output:
| [person Name 1] | Person Role 1 | [Original Quote in another language (e.g. Dutch, French, German, Spanish,etc..)] | [Translated Quote] |
| [person Name 2] | Person Role 2 | [Original Quote in English] | N.A. |

If the input is "None", return "None". if the original quote is not in English, make sure it is translated. Add "N.A" if the quote is already in English.

Input quotes:
| Cecile Wake | Shell Australia chairwoman | "Right now, what we have is a dysfunctional, deharmonised patchwork quilt of regulations that really make it difficult to have successful investments." |
| Cecile Wake | Shell Australia chairwoman | "If we're going to reach net zero by 2050, for Australia to really thrive through the energy transition, we're going to need not one wave of investment, but a second, a third, a fourth, multiple waves of investment and what that requires is successful delivery of projects." |
| Cecile Wake | Shell Australia chairwoman | "It felt to me like an example of additional complexity that added delay and costs to projects without delivering a significantly better outcome for traditional owner groups, and in fact, put a huge burden on them." |
