This unexpected write-down has led to an 11% drop in its stock price, following an initial plunge of 18%. Investors had hoped that the worst was over after the company’s 2023 financial struggles, but these new impairments have further eroded confidence in Ørsted’s financial stability. The company’s stock has already lost around 80% of its value since its peak in January 2021, representing a market capitalization loss of approximately €65 billion, half of which is borne by the Danish government, which holds a significant stake in the company. This continued financial deterioration raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to maintain its leadership in the renewable energy sector. [Les Echos, Sylvie Ramadier, January 21, 2025]

- Ørsted’s stock price plummeted by 18% after the company announced significant asset write-downs totaling approximately €1.7 billion. The company cited rising interest rates in the U.S. as a key factor negatively impacting its capital costs, leading to a devaluation of its American assets. Additionally, Ørsted has had to write down further due to difficulties in developing several large offshore wind farms in the U.S. This financial hit has alarmed investors, further damaging Ørsted’s already struggling stock performance and raising concerns about the viability of its U.S. expansion strategy. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Arend Clahsen, January 22, 2025]

- Ørsted is facing strong local opposition to its planned wind farm near Bad Orb, Germany, where a wellness company, Alea Park gGmbH, is pushing for an alternative development project focused on medical spa and forest therapy. The opposition has gained significant traction, with local politicians, business leaders, and citizen groups rallying against the wind project. Opponents have launched an expensive media campaign, including full-page ads in major German and Danish newspapers, accusing Ørsted of disregarding local interests and threatening the region’s identity as a health and wellness destination. This resistance could lead to legal challenges and delays, complicating Ørsted’s efforts to expand its onshore wind portfolio in Germany. [Energie & Management, Manfred Fischer, January 20, 2025] - Ørsted has suffered a significant financial setback, announcing new asset impairments amounting to approximately 9% of its market capitalization. This unexpected write-down has led to an 11% drop in its stock price, following an initial plunge of 18%.

- Ørsted’s stock price dropped by 17.6% in a single trading session after the company announced a €1.62 billion impairment due to cost overruns and delays in its Sunrise Wind project, which was supposed to be the largest offshore wind farm in the U.S. Analysts have warned that Ørsted now holds American assets that "no longer have any value," raising serious concerns about the company’s financial health and its ability to execute large-scale offshore wind projects profitably. This latest financial hit follows a series of setbacks in the U.S. market, including the cancellation of other offshore wind projects due to rising costs and regulatory uncertainty. [Les Echos, Nicolas Rauline, January 22, 2025] - Ørsted's CEO, Mads Nipper, has resigned following a series of major financial setbacks, including significant asset write-downs and a sharp decline in the company's stock price. Under his leadership, Ørsted's share value plummeted by 80%, reflecting investor concerns over the company's financial health and strategic direction. His departure signals instability at the top levels of management, raising questions about Ørsted’s ability to navigate the ongoing challenges in the offshore wind sector. [The Independent, Alex Daniel, January 31, 2025]

- Ørsted has suffered a massive financial impairment of $1.7 billion due to rising costs and regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. offshore wind market. The company had heavily invested in expanding its presence in the U.S., but policy changes under President Donald Trump, including the suspension of federal permits for new offshore wind projects, have rendered many of these investments unviable. This financial hit has further weakened Ørsted’s position in the U.S. renewable energy sector. [De Telegraaf, Theo Besteman, January 31, 2025]

- Ørsted has been forced to cut hundreds of jobs and withdraw from several international markets due to financial difficulties. The company has warned that it may build 1,500 fewer wind turbines than originally planned, which could slow the global transition to renewable energy. These drastic measures highlight the severe financial strain Ørsted is under and raise concerns about its long-term viability in the offshore wind industry. [The Telegraph, James Warrington, January 31, 2025]

- Ørsted has announced fresh writedowns of 12.1 billion Danish kroner (£1.4 billion) on its U.S. business, citing rising interest rates and market uncertainties. This latest financial blow follows a series of impairments and project cancellations, further eroding investor confidence. The company’s stock has already lost more than 80% of its value since its peak in 2021, reflecting deep concerns about its financial stability. [The Telegraph, James Warrington, January 31, 2025]

- Ørsted’s offshore wind expansion strategy in the U.S. has turned into a financial disaster, with the company writing off €1.6 billion due to project delays and regulatory setbacks. The Sunrise Wind project, located off the coast of New York, has been particularly affected by supply chain disruptions and rising interest rates, leading to significant financial losses. This failure underscores the risks associated with large-scale offshore wind investments in an uncertain regulatory environment. [Lefigaro, Anonymous, January 31, 2025]

- Ørsted’s decision to expand aggressively into the U.S. offshore wind market has backfired, with the company now facing major financial losses and project cancellations. The return of Donald Trump to the presidency has resulted in a freeze on new offshore wind permits, effectively halting Ørsted’s expansion plans. The company has already written down €1.6 billion in assets and faces the possibility that key projects like Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind may never be completed. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Orla Mcdonald, February 01, 2025]

- Ørsted’s stock price has plummeted by 80% from its peak in 2021 due to a combination of rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory uncertainty. The company’s financial troubles have been exacerbated by inflation, higher interest rates, and difficulties in securing long-term contracts for its renewable energy projects.

This resistance could lead to legal challenges and further delays, complicating Ørsted’s efforts to expand its onshore wind portfolio in Germany. [Energie & Management, Manfred Fischer, January 30, 2025] - Ørsted has suffered a significant financial setback due to the slow permitting process in the U.S., which led to rising construction costs and uncertainty over tax benefits. As a result, the company was forced to write off €4 billion on its U.S. projects. To mitigate financial losses, Ørsted has implemented drastic cost-cutting measures, including suspending dividend payments until at least 2025 and laying off 800 employees. These actions reflect the severe financial strain the company is under and raise concerns about its long-term viability in the U.S. market. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Orla Mcdonald, February 01, 2025]

- Ørsted’s CEO, Mads Nipper, has been ousted after overseeing an 80% collapse in the company’s share price, which resulted in £48 billion being wiped off its market value. The company has struggled with rising costs, supply chain disruptions, higher interest rates, and regulatory changes, particularly in the U.S. market. The leadership change signals a desperate attempt to restore investor confidence, but it also highlights the instability at the top levels of management.

[Business World Agency, Anonymous, February 06, 2025]

- Ørsted has been forced to abandon several offshore wind projects due to financial difficulties, leading to a significant reduction in its renewable energy capacity targets. The company had originally planned to install 50 GW of capacity by 2030 but has now scaled this back to 38 GW, effectively cutting a quarter of its expansion plans. This retreat from its ambitious goals raises concerns about the company’s ability to contribute to the global transition to renewable energy.

Ook Ørsted, de grootste windparkontwikkelaar ter wereld, schroeft investeringen terug, 
maakte het gisteren bekend.  Afgelopen december stelde Denemarken een nieuwe tender uit. Op een eerdere 
tender schreef geen enkele partij in. Zeewindbedrijven waarschuwden eerder het FD dat de investeringen in de 
parken niet meer uit kunnen door de gestegen rente en inflatie. Vorige week maakte de topman van Ørsted, de 
grootste windparkontwikkelaar ter wereld, bekend te vertrekken. Het bedrijf heeft grote verliezen geleden doordat 
het bouwcontracten voor nieuwe windparken moest annuleren.  Ook de overwinning van president Donald Trump in 
de VS doet de sector geen goed. Hij zet alle nieuwe vergunningen voor windparken voorlopig op pauze. In Amerika 
staat de bouw van grote offshorewindparken nog in de kinderschoenen, maar grote Europese spelers als Ørsted 
zagen er groeikansen. Ook Nederlandse spelers als Van Oord, Boskalis, Fugro en Sif zijn betrokken bij de bouw 
van offshorewindparken in de VS. Nederland heeft veel spelers actief in de toeleveringsketen voor 
offshorewindenergie. De grote spelers als Van Oord en Boskalis zouden het volgens analist Thijs Berkelder van 
ABN Amro Oddo BHF moeten kunnen redden. 'Die hebben eigen installatieschepen en een vrij sterke balans, 
waardoor ze zich door deze neergaande markt moeten kunnen slaan.'
De waarde van het contract en of Van Oord een annuleringboete heeft bedongen, is niet bekend

Windparkontwikkelaar Ørsted schroeft zijn investeringen de komende jaren met 25% terug. Het Deense bedrijf 
hoopt daarmee zijn financiële positie te versterken en een forse verslechtering van het kredietoordeel voor te zijn.
Ørsted heeft de afgelopen jaren miljarden moeten afboeken vanwege grote tegenslagen bij de ontwikkeling van 
meerdere windparken. Zo boekte het Deense bedrijf de dag na de inauguratie van Donald Trump nog €1,6 mrd af 
op grond voor de kust van Maryland, waar het windmolens wilde bouwen. Trump trok op zijn eerste dag als 
president alle nieuwe vergunningen voor Amerikaanse windparken op zee in. De vrees is dat er tijdens zijn termijn 
als president geen nieuwe windparken bij zullen komen, een behoorlijke tegenvaller voor Ørsted dat juist vol heeft 
ingezet op uitbreiding in de Verenigde Staten.
In een toelichting op de jaarcijfers van 2024 zei de nieuwe ceo, Rasmus Errboe, te verwachten dat Ørsted de twee 
grote windprojecten in aanbouw in de Verenigde Staten gewoon kan afronden. Voor projecten die zich nog in een 
vroeger stadium bevinden is dat nog maar de vraag. 'We zullen moeten afwachten hoe de nieuwe minister van 
energie het presidentieel decreet om vergunningen in te trekken interpreteert.' Naast politieke problemen spelen 
ook inflatie, opgelopen rente en problemen in de toeleveringsketen het Deense bedrijf al drie jaar parten. Vorige 
week maakte Ørsted bekend topman Mads Nipper te vervangen wegens aanhoudende financiële malaise. Het 
bedrijf is wereldwijd een van de grootste spelers in de markt voor wind op zee met 27 operationele windparken en 
nog eens zeven in aanbouw. In Nederland is Ørsted eigenaar van een groot windpark op zee voor de kust van 
Borssele. Errboe: 'We brengen ons investeringsprogramma tot 2030 terug door strikter te kijken waar we ons

kapitaal inzetten. We investeren voortaan alleen nog maar in de plekken en technologieën die financieel het meest 
aantrekkelijk zijn.'  Hierdoor dalen de geplande investeringen de komende vijf jaar van 270 mrd Deense kronen 
(€36 mrd) naar €28 mrd tot €31 mrd. Projecten in uitvoering worden volgens Errboe niet geraakt. Wel wordt de 
organisatie verder ingekrompen. Een jaar geleden werd al bekend dat achthonderd van de negenduizend banen 
verdwijnen. Financieel staat het bedrijf er wel iets beter voor dan een jaar geleden. Afgelopen jaar maakte het 
windbedrijf net geen verlies, terwijl het in 2023 nog forse verliezen boekte. Volgens Errboe is het bedrijfsresultaat 
van €3,3 mrd in lijn met de verwachtingen van het bedrijf. De windparkontwikkelaar moest in totaal €2 mrd 
afboeken op afgeblazen of te dure projecten, minder dan de afboeking van €3,6 mrd in 2023. Afgelopen jaar streek 
Ørsted ruim €900 mln op aan compensatie voor twee geannuleerde windprojecten voor de kust van New Jersey. 
Beleggers reageren positief op de cijfers. De koers van Ørsted sloot gisteren een kleine 7% in de plus op 300 
Deense kronen (bijna €42), een fractie van de piek in 2021 toen het aandeel 1351 Deense kronen (€181) waard 
was.

Marktsituatie is verslechterd en risico's zijn verhoogd, stellen energiebedrijven
Orla McDonald en Eva Rooijers
Amsterdam
Nederland loopt het risico geen energiebedrijf te vinden voor de bouw van drie grote windparken op de Noordzee. 
Offshorewindparkontwikkelaars als Vattenfall, Ørsted en RWE betwijfelen ten zeerste of een investering zich zal 
terugverdienen. Energiebedrijf Engie laat al weten zich niet in te schrijven voor de aanbesteding die in september 
opent. Nederland zou de tender uit moeten stellen of aan moeten passen, zegt de windenergiesector tegen het FD.
'Het is onder deze voorwaarden niet verantwoord om een bod te doen', zegt ceo van Engie Energie Nederland 
Harry Talen. Het Franse energiebedrijf bezit grote windparken in het Belgische en Britse deel van de Noordzee en 
deed tot nu toe aan de meeste Nederlandse windaanbestedingen mee. 'Voor de komende tender zien we nu al dat 
er geen verdienmodel is en dan heeft het geen zin om miljoenen te investeren in het voorwerk dat nodig is voor een 
bod.' Het gaat om de vergunningenronde van drie kavels voor de kust bij IJmuiden. In totaal moet er 3 gigawatt aan 
windenergie bijkomen, genoeg om drie miljoen huishoudens van stroom te voorzien. Dit komt bovenop de 8,5 
gigawatt aan offshorewind die al draait of vergund is. Wind op zee was tot nu toe juist een van de succesvolste 
pijlers onder de energietransitie in Nederland, maar het verdienmodel voor windparken staat al langer onder druk. 
Ook in de rest van Europa. Inflatie, hoge rente en krapte in de toeleveringsketen hebben de prijzen van de bouw 
opgedreven, terwijl de prijzen die afnemers willen betalen niet zijn gestegen. Verschillende grote energiebedrijven 
schroefden recent hun wereldwijde investeringen in windparken terug. Het Verenigd Koninkrijk en Denemarken 
moesten aanbestedingen afblazen, omdat geen enkel energiebedrijf zich ingeschreven had. Denemarken heeft 
Page 2 of 2

daarop een nieuwe bieding uitgesteld en onderzoekt hoe die aantrekkelijker kan worden gemaakt. 'Ik hoop dat die 
mislukking een voldoende sterk signaal is voor de Nederlandse regering om ook hier aan de knoppen te gaan 
draaien', zegt Ireen Geerbex die bij Vattenfall verantwoordelijk is voor de ontwikkeling van windparken op zee. 'Er is 
een reële kans dat de tender mislukt als het ministerie van Klimaat en Groene Groei die in deze vorm doorzet', zegt 
ze. RWE geeft aan dat de markt 'behoorlijk onder druk' staat en dat het moet bekijken of de businesscase wel 
rendabel te krijgen is. Belangrijkste oorzaak van het probleem is de achterblijvende vraag naar groene stroom, 
zeggen veel van de bedrijven. De industrie heeft moeite met verduurzamen, mede vanwege het volle stroomnet. 
Ook de ontwikkeling van een markt en netwerk voor groene waterstof is vertraagd.  Er zijn nauwelijks partijen die 
grote langjarige stroomcontracten willen afsluiten met de uitbaters van windparken, zogeheten PPA's. Bouwers van 
windparken hebben de contracten nodig om hun businesscase rond te krijgen. 'Er is onvoldoende bereidheid om 
afnameovereenkomsten te sluiten en zeker niet tegen een prijspeil dat voor ons aanvaardbaar is', zegt Joël 
Meggelaars van Ørsted Benelux.  Vattenfall en Ørsted pleiten er daarom voor om windkavels minder snel op de 
markt te brengen. 'De impopulaire boodschap is dat we een tandje terug moeten schakelen. Op deze weg 
doorgaan is geen goed idee. Eerst moet de vraag naar elektriciteit in Nederland groeien', zegt Geerbex van 
Vattenfall. Engie denkt, anders dan zijn concurrenten, dat de oplossing ligt in aanpassing van de aanbesteding, in 
plaats van uitstel.  Engie wil dat Nederland, in navolging van België en het VK, een nieuw subsidiemechanisme 
invoert, in de markt bekend als een contract for difference. Ook RWE ziet daar heil in. Een energiebedrijf krijgt dan 
subsidie als de elektriciteitsprijs onder een minimum zakt. Daar staat tegenover dat de overheid winsten af kan 
romen als de elektriciteitsprijzen heel hoog zijn. Zowel Vattenfall als Ørsted waarschuwen wel dat de kosten voor 
de staat aanzienlijk op kunnen lopen als dit subsidiemechanisme wordt ingevoerd terwijl er niets wordt gedaan om 
de vraag naar groene stroom aan te jagen.  Hoewel de offshorewindsector het in heel Europa lastig heeft, zijn de 
risico's in Nederland extra hoog, zeggen de bedrijven. Dat komt door de voorwaarden die minister Sophie Hermans 
(Klimaat en Groene Groei) aan de tenders stelt. Energiebedrijven moeten in Nederland betalen om een vergunning 
te krijgen. Bijna alle andere landen hebben dit zogeheten financiële bod afgeschaft, om bouwers niet verder op 
kosten te jagen in de huidige marktsituatie. 'Dat Nederland dit nog vraagt, is puur politiek opportunisme. Dan ben je 
als kabinet compleet losgezongen van hoe dat in de markt doorwerkt', zegt Fred van Beers, topman van Sif, de 
Nederlandse bouwer van funderingen voor windmolens.
Energiebedrijf Engie laat al weten zich niet in te schrijven voor de aanbesteding die in september opent

Ook in de toeleveringsketen merken ze minder animo voor de Nederlandse tender. 'Normaal hadden partijen nu al 
wel gepolst of wij kunnen leveren, maar de aandacht is op dit moment gering', zegt Van Beers. 
Hermans schreef eerder een consultatie uit om te horen welke uitdagingen marktpartijen hebben. Ook een motie 
van NSC, VVD en drie oppositiepartijen roept op om de risico's te verminderen. In maart stuurt Hermans een 
Kamerbrief met de stand van zaken, zegt een woordvoerder. Gerust zijn energiebedrijven er niet op dat het kabinet 
op tijd actie onderneemt, zeggen ze.  Ook voor de vorige tender afgelopen juni, genaamd 'IJmuiden Ver', was 
weinig animo. Ørsted en Engie staken tijd en miljoenen in de voorbereidingen van een bod, maar zagen daar op 
het laatste moment van af. Uiteindelijk schreven drie kandidaten zich in voor twee kavels, terwijl het kabinet bij 
eerdere biedingen uit het dubbele aantal gegadigden kon kiezen. 'De laatste tender is uiteindelijk gelukt, maar met 
de hakken over de sloot', aldus Sif-topman Van Beers.

## Assistant

- Ørsted has been forced to cut its planned investments by 25% in an effort to stabilize its financial position. The company has faced significant financial difficulties due to rising interest rates, inflation, and supply chain disruptions, which have made offshore wind projects more expensive and less profitable. This reduction in investment raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to maintain its leadership in the renewable energy sector and meet its long-term growth targets. The company hopes to avoid a further downgrade in its credit rating, but the cutbacks could slow the expansion of offshore wind infrastructure globally. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Eva Rooijers, February 07, 2025]

- Ørsted has suffered massive financial losses, writing off €2 billion in 2024 due to abandoned or overly expensive projects. This follows an even larger write-down of €3.6 billion in 2023, highlighting the company’s ongoing financial struggles. The impairments stem from project cancellations and cost overruns, which have severely impacted Ørsted’s profitability. These repeated financial hits raise concerns about the company’s ability to execute large-scale offshore wind projects efficiently and profitably. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Eva Rooijers, February 07, 2025]

- The return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency has created significant uncertainty for Ørsted’s offshore wind expansion plans. On his first day in office, Trump revoked all new permits for offshore wind projects, forcing Ørsted to write off €1.6 billion on land it had acquired off the coast of Maryland. The company now faces the risk that no new offshore wind projects will be approved during Trump’s term, a major setback for its U.S. growth strategy. This political uncertainty adds to Ørsted’s financial woes and could force the company to scale back its ambitions in the American market. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Eva Rooijers, February 07, 2025]

- Ørsted has been forced to lay off 800 employees as part of its cost-cutting measures to address financial difficulties. The job cuts reflect the severe strain the company is under due to rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and project cancellations. These layoffs will have significant social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities, further highlighting the instability within Ørsted. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Eva Rooijers, February 07, 2025]

- Ørsted’s stock price has plummeted by nearly 80% from its peak in 2021, reflecting a severe loss of investor confidence. The company’s financial struggles, including massive write-downs, project cancellations, and rising costs, have contributed to this sharp decline. Investors remain wary of Ørsted’s ability to recover, and the company’s market value has been significantly eroded, raising concerns about its long-term viability. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Eva Rooijers, February 07, 2025]

- Ørsted and other offshore wind developers are struggling to make new projects financially viable due to inflation, high interest rates, and supply chain constraints. The company has warned that the current market conditions make it difficult to justify new investments, leading to concerns that offshore wind expansion could slow down significantly. This could have broader implications for the global transition to renewable energy, as Ørsted is one of the largest players in the industry. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Orla Mcdonald, Eva Rooijers, February 14, 2025]

- Ørsted has warned that the Dutch government’s current tender conditions for offshore wind projects may lead to a failed auction. The company, along with other major developers like Vattenfall and RWE, has expressed concerns that the financial model for new wind farms is no longer viable under the existing terms. If the Dutch government does not adjust its policies, Ørsted and other companies may be forced to withdraw from bidding, potentially delaying the country’s renewable energy goals. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Orla Mcdonald, Eva Rooijers, February 14, 2025]

- Ørsted’s CEO, Mads Nipper, has resigned following a series of major financial setbacks, including significant asset write-downs and a sharp decline in the company’s stock price. Under his leadership, Ørsted’s share value plummeted by 80%, reflecting investor concerns over the company’s financial health and strategic direction. His departure signals instability at the top levels of management, raising questions about Ørsted’s ability to navigate the ongoing challenges in the offshore wind sector.
