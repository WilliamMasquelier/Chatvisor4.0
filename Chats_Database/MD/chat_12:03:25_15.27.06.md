- Assess how their opinion might affect other stakeholders

SENTIMENT CLASSIFICATION:
Positive (from Shell's perspective):

- Quotes that defend Shell against criticism
- Statements highlighting Shell's strengths or improvements

Negative (from Shell's perspective):
- Statements that could damage Shell's reputation or credibility
- Comments raising concerns about Shell's practices or decisions
- Quotes that could trigger regulatory scrutiny on Shell
- Even positively-worded criticism (e.g., "They're making progress, but still far behind competitors")

Neutral (from Shell's perspective):
- Factual statements without significant impact on Shell
- Balanced observations that neither help nor harm
- Technical or procedural comments without clear implications for Shell

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Maintain the original markdown table format
- Add sentiment classification as the final column
- Use only "Positive," "Negative," or "Neutral" in the sentiment column

Example Analysis:
Original quote: "The company is making impressive progress in sustainability."
Surface tone: Positive
Deeper analysis: Could be Negative if competitors are far ahead or if it implies previous poor performance

Shell and PetroChina will expand the huge Surat coal seam gas project in Queensland, a decision that will be met 
with dismay from environmental activists but which should provide supply for an increasingly stretched market.
Gas from the project extension will supply both domestic and export customers through the Queensland Curtis LNG 
plant near Gladstone.
The project, the second phase of the Arrow Energy joint venture, is expected to supply 130 million cubic feet a day 
of gas at peak production, enough to power almost 1 million homes.
The first phase of the project, some 90 billion cubic feet a year, began in 2020 and is now in production. It is 
expected to cost about $2 billion. Shell did not give an estimated cost for the second phase, but it is also expected 
to reach into the billions of dollars.
The decision to proceed with the second phase of the Arrow project follows increasingly urgent warnings from the 
Australian Energy Market Operator about the need for investment in new gas supply to head off shortages 
expected later this decade on peak-demand winter days.
"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to 
market," said Zoe Yujnovich, director of integrated gas and upstream for Shell.
"This investment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a lower-
emissions alternative."
Still, the drilling of the up to 450 new wells involved will only maintain existing supplies rather than increase 
production and does not address shortfalls that are looming because of declines in supplies in the southern states, 
said Rick Wilkinson, chief executive of consultancy EnergyQuest.
"This makes no change at all to the supply-demand balance and the requirement for new gas to come on for the 
east coast of Australia," he said.

Mr Wilkinson said that for the full development of the project, thousands of wells needed to be drilled, "so this is one 
step of many that are required for capital to be allocated to the project to maintain flat production".
Arrow, jointly owned by Shell and its Chinese state-owned partner, holds the largest reserve of undeveloped gas 
on the east coast, where elevated contract prices and a limited choice of supply have been sources of constant 
complaint among manufacturers.
Shell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said the project would support up to 400 jobs and create opportunities for 
contractors and local suppliers.
"At its core, this project promotes stronger regional communities, and it also has wider benefits for Australian 
manufacturing and industry more broadly," said Ms Wake.
Shell said the project was underpinned by a 27-year sales deal between Arrow and QGC, a division of the London-
based oil and gas giant. In investor briefings last year, the company flagged that it would secure additional gas for 
its LNG facilities in Queensland "to increase value for shareholders". The second phase of the project will require 
the construction of 27 kilometres of pipelines, as well as other infrastructure upgrades.
It is opposed by farming families and landholders in the Darling Downs, who said they were worried about the risk 
of damage to water and land. The project is also opposed by environmental groups, concerned about increased 
emissions from fossil fuel production.
The go-ahead comes despite years of annual losses by Arrow. The company had originally intended to develop four 
LNG export projects in Queensland but abandoned those plans after the first three plants were built.
Shell later took over BG Group in one of the biggest takeovers in the oil sector, giving it ownership of one of those 
three plants, Queensland Curtis LNG.
It opted to use gas from the Arrow project to instead supply that plant, a major facility near Gladstone, Queensland 
that was completed in 2014.
Arrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said production from this second phase was expected to start in 2026. 
Construction will begin later this year. Surat is expected to comprise up to 2500 gas wells and produce 4000 
petajoules of gas in total.
"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify 
Arrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast," Mr Peng said in a statement.
