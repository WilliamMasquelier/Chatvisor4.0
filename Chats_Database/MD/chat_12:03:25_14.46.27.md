What's on in Canberra this weekend.
True love onstage
Some artists really do go all in with their creations. Real-life Canberra couple Shell Abdoo and Berin Denham have 
written a musical about their relationship, in which they explore love, second chances and the dynamics of blending 
families. You learn a touching and distressing amount about the pair's personal lives, and emerge believing in the 
power of love. Only Everything is at the Courtyard Studio until October 26.  canberratheatrecentre.com.au 
Open-air art
You may have noticed some of the interesting new additions to Canberra's public art landscape in the past few 
weeks, all part of the Canberra Art Biennale, the capital's own public art festival in which local artists create works 
that respond in some way to Canberra's history, from 65,000 years to the present day. Look out for works scattered 
outdoors in Braddon, Lake Burley Griffin, Civic, the Canberra Glassworks, Mount Stromlo and the cultural 
institutions in the National Triangle, plus a packed program of events throughout October.  canberrabiennial.com 
Long live Stonefest
It's a name that evokes some awesome stints at the University of Canberra, involving bands and good times all 
round. And looks like nothing's changed in the interim! Stonefest, Canberra's longest-running music festival, is back 
this year with a stellar line-up on the UC lawns. Local talents like Lucy Sugarman, Zach Knows, Sonic Reducer, Jett 
Blyton, and First Nations singer-songwriter Wallabindi are sharing the bill with Aria Award-winning Teenage Dads 
and MAY-A, alongside DJ Mansionair (DJ), Great Gable, and The Buoys. Get the gang together and get over there! 
Saturday, October 19 from 3.30pm.  stonefest.com.au 
Tim Minchin, quadruple threat
There's a reason this triple-threat of a performer has a legion of followers. Actually, make that quadruple threat, 
because Tim Minchin now has a book out, his first work of non-fiction, You Don't Have To Have A Dream. Building 
on the premise that living and loving your life is enough, Minchin - known for his comedy chops and his runaway 
musical success - will be talking to literary star Beejay Silcox about his thoughts on life, art, success and kindness,

among other things. And another show has just been added - get in quick! A Conversation With Tim Minchin is on 
Saturday October 19, 2pm and 7.30pm.  canberratheatrecentre.com.au 
Fashion with a thrifty twist
We should all be buying less new stuff, and working second-hand finds into our carefully curated wardrobes, but 
Fashion Thrift Society really does have the feel of a gamechanger. This year, it's run across 21 cities across 
Australia and the UK, bringing a new mix of fashion and creativity to the racks and racks of handpicked vintage and 
handmade garments. There'll also be food, music, body piercing, a nail bar and haircuts. It's a whole thing! Sunday 
October 20 from 10am at Exhibition Park.  fashionthriftsociety.com.au
