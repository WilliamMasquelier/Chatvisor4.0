WAY WE WERE with Jayne Keogh
The lustrous pearl is the only gem sourced from a living creature. Not as rare as pearl but with its tactile silkiness is 
the nacre shell, Pinctada maxima or mother of pearl. Ancient Egyptians were using it in at least 4200BC and pieces 
have been found in pyramids and tombs of the ruling classes. Closer to home, it has also been important in the 
Torres Strait and New Guinea cultures as intricately carved talismans and adornments.
Then in 1869, the financial value of the shells was discovered almost by accident. Legend has it that Tudu Islanders 
showed "Tongutapu Joe", a Pacific Islander working for Captain William Banner, a rich patch of pearl shell on the 
Warrior Reefs. There was an immediate rush by the Pacific Islander-crewed boats to Torres Strait to dive for the 
new high-profit commodity.
The coveted large gold-lipped shell was already known in Europe and America as a luxury product. Pearl buttons 
were made from Torres shells as well as spoons, knife handles, inlays in fine furniture, inkwells, snuff boxes, fans 
and card cases.
Torres Strait Islander participation began immediately, and men from Mabuiag, Tudu and other places in the central 
and eastern parts of Torres Strait were the first to get involved. Records show that within three years 500 Pacific 
Islanders were working in Torres Strait on pearling luggers. These men, many from the Loyalty Islands of New 
Caledonia and from Vanuatu and Rotumah, were the first speakers of a new language: Beach-la-Mar, or Pacific 
Pidgin English. The labour force for boat-handling, work on the shell-stations, and diving also included Malays, 
Filipinos and Japanese. It was a melting pot of Asian and Pacific cultures driven by a beautiful shell.
Initially the shells in the shallow waters were harvested from the luggers by breath-holding free divers from what 
were known as "swimming boats". The divers would toss the shells into the jib-and-mizzen craft. They were 
assisted by wooden goggle-shaped glasses, which fitted tightly around the eyes for protection and to prevent water 
interfering with the diver's vision, but nothing protected them from shark attacks.

Then, as the shallow reefs were depleted, the more complex method of diving suits were needed to go deeper. By 
1871, a diving suit was designed, allowing access down to 20 fathoms (about 37m). The divers risked their lives in 
rubberised canvas suits, heavy boots laden with lead, and helmets with thick glass. The divers were paid according 
to the amount of shell they collected, so every minute on the bottom was precious. Their lives were in the hands of 
the tenders above, who operated the air pumps to keep them alive. By the end of the 1930s, divers were going 
down to 40 fathoms in areas such as the eerily named Darnley Deeps. The "bends", or decompression sickness, 
killed many divers who diced with death to collect as many shells as possible. Cyclones were also a threat to the 
safety of the pearling fleets, with one cyclone in 1899 sinking more than 50 luggers, and killing 300 men.
The pearling luggers were gaff-rigged ketches constructed of wood measuring 15m-20m in length, with low waists 
and bulwarks to assist diving. The two-masted and vividly coloured pearling luggers with their graceful curved lines 
were a magnificent sight as they entered the open sea under full sail. There were many hundreds of luggers 
working across the north of Australia, from Thursday Island to Broome, many of the luggers built by Japanese 
shipwrights who set up business.
Penguin at the Queensland Maritime Museum is a Thursday Island style of pearling lugger, built by Japanese 
boatbuilder Tsugitaro Furuta from Osaka. Like most of the luggers, Penguin was requisitioned by the Royal 
Australian Navy in WWII to assist the war effort in coastal defence work in the north. After the war, the invention of 
plastics marked the end of the industry and only a handful of the luggers survived. "Penguin is the only lugger of its 
kind left in the world," said John Hockings, descendant of Thursday Island pearling "royalty" whose family ran a 
fleet of 21 luggers from 1868 to 1971. "I spoke the Pacific pidgin as a child, it was the first truly multicultural 
community." Penguin is being restored by an enthusiastic group of volunteers at the Museum.
John Mitchell, of Holland Park, recalls his father working on the engines of the luggers that were introduced in the 
1930s. "After the war, Dad left the Air Force and worked as an onboard mechanic for the luggers. They were 
serviced in the South Brisbane Dry Dock and he sailed with them back to the Strait," he said. "I went with him once 
to Broome and we just slept on the deck - great fun for a kid." The Queensland Pearling exhibition is at the 
Queensland Maritime Museum until February 14.
