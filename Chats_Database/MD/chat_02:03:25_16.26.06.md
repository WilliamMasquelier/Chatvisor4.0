## Assistant

Dr. Griet Voet maintains a neutral stance towards Acrylnagelproducten, as their statement objectively describes acrylates as common chemical components in various products, including acrylic nails, without expressing explicit support or concern. Their consistent, fact-based communication suggests a scientific rather than opinionated perspective, which may limit any direct negative or positive impact on Acrylnagelproducten's reputation, though their expertise could still influence regulatory discussions or consumer awareness.
