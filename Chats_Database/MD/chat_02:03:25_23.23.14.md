John Kerry's statement emphasizing the necessity of oil and gas profits suggests a pragmatic stance on the energy transition, which may contrast with Ørsted's renewable-focused mission, potentially signaling skepticism about the feasibility of a fully green transition without fossil fuel revenues. This perspective could negatively impact Ørsted's reputation among policymakers and investors who prioritize rapid decarbonization, as it may reinforce doubts about the financial viability of large-scale renewable energy projects.
