## User


You will be provided with a document named compiled_sentences. This document contains a series of one-sentence descriptions, each summarizing a news article related to Shell. Your task is to identify a maximum of 10 exclusive, non-overlapping topic categories based on the media coverage of the company. However, it is better and prefered if fewer categories are sufficient to cover the main aspects of the media coverage.

Follow these guidelines:

Topic Categories: Define categories that are neither too general nor too specific. Ensure the categories are mutually exclusive, meaning no two categories should cover the same subject matter.

Clarity: Each category should have a clear focus, reflecting distinct aspects of the media coverage related to Shell.

Output Format: List the categories in a bullet-point format with a brief description (1-2 sentences) explaining each category.

Be sure to focus on key themes present in the document and avoid redundant or overly broad topics. The fewer the number of categories, the better, as long as they are distinct and cover the main aspects of the media coverage.
Avoid defining categories that are too semantically similar or overlapping. For instance, "Financial Performance" and "Economic Growth" are too closely related to be separate categories. For example, Staffing Shortages, Labor Relations, Working Conditions and Recruitment Challenges should be grouped under a single category like "Human Resources Issues".
