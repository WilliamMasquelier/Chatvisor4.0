Previous summaries: - Ørsted has announced the suspension of its dividend payments until at least 2025, marking a significant shift in its financial strategy. The company had been consistently increasing shareholder payouts since 2016, but due to financial struggles, it has decided to halt these payments to focus on investments without raising additional capital. This move could negatively impact investor confidence and stock performance, as dividends are a key attraction for shareholders. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- The company has suffered a major financial setback, reporting an EBITDA of 18.7 billion Danish kroner (€2.5 billion) for 2023, which is below its projected range of 20-23 billion kroner. A significant portion of this shortfall is attributed to a 9.6 billion kroner provision for cancellation costs related to the termination of the Ocean Wind 1 project in the U.S. This financial underperformance highlights the challenges Ørsted faces in managing its offshore wind projects profitably. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has decided to cut its renewable energy project targets by at least 24%, reducing its planned capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This reduction signals a retreat from its previous ambitious expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The company is also exiting several emerging offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, limiting its future growth opportunities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- The company is implementing significant job cuts, with up to 800 positions being eliminated globally. The first phase will see 250 layoffs in the coming months. These job losses reflect the financial strain Ørsted is under and could have negative social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted’s market capitalization has plummeted by more than 70% since its peak in early 2021, when it was valued at over €76.5 billion. The company, once the third-largest utility in Europe, now ranks 14th in the sector, with a market value of just €16 billion. This dramatic decline underscores the financial instability and investor concerns surrounding the company. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has incurred massive financial losses, posting around £2.2 billion in losses for 2023. The company has also written off £3.3 billion from its wind farm business, reflecting the severe financial difficulties it faces. These losses are largely due to the abandonment of several offshore wind projects in the U.S., which resulted in billions in impairments. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]

- The company’s financial struggles have forced it to scale back offshore wind projects, which could result in the construction of 1,500 fewer wind turbines than originally planned. This reduction in capacity could slow the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure and impact global climate goals. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted’s chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, is stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company’s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]

- The company has faced significant challenges in the U.S. market, particularly in securing tax credits for its offshore wind projects. Last year, Ørsted canceled two major offshore wind projects, Ocean Wind I and II, due to rising costs, resulting in a financial hit of 28.4 billion Danish kroner (£3.3 billion). These cancellations highlight the financial and regulatory difficulties of expanding renewable energy in the U.S. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for the company to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]

- The company’s financial troubles have led analysts to speculate that it may need to seek additional funding from investors. However, instead of raising capital, Ørsted has opted for cost-cutting measures, which could prolong financial uncertainty and increase risks for the company’s future stability. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has been forced to implement a drastic austerity plan, including a comprehensive review of its project portfolio. The company is prioritizing projects with the highest potential returns while reducing risks in development and execution. This shift in strategy indicates a retreat from aggressive expansion and a more cautious approach to investment. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024]

- The company’s decision to exit key offshore wind markets, including Spain, Portugal, and Norway, as well as to deprioritize certain activities in Japan, represents a significant contraction of its global footprint. This retreat could weaken its competitive position in the rapidly growing offshore wind sector. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024] - Ørsted has suffered a massive financial loss, reporting a net loss of 2.7 billion euros for 2023. This marks a significant downturn from the previous year when the company had recorded a profit of approximately 2 billion euros. The losses stem largely from the cancellation of major offshore wind projects in the U.S., including Ocean Wind 1 and 2, which resulted in impairments of 3.8 billion euros. Additionally, the company has set aside 1.5 billion euros in provisions for potential compensation payments related to these canceled projects. This financial instability raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to sustain its aggressive expansion strategy in the renewable energy sector. [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]

- Ørsted has been forced to implement drastic cost-cutting measures, including the elimination of 600 to 800 jobs worldwide. This decision is part of a broader austerity plan aimed at reducing fixed costs by 130 million euros by 2026. The job cuts will have significant social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities, further highlighting the financial strain the company is under. [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]

- The company has announced a suspension of dividend payments until at least 2025, a move that could negatively impact investor confidence. Ørsted had previously been a reliable dividend payer, making this decision a major shift in its financial strategy. The suspension reflects the company’s urgent need to preserve capital amid mounting financial losses, but it may also deter investors who rely on dividends for returns. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]

- Ørsted’s market value has plummeted by 70% over the past three years, reflecting a severe loss of investor confidence. The company, once a leader in the offshore wind sector, has seen its stock price decline sharply due to financial struggles, project cancellations, and rising costs. This decline in market capitalization raises concerns about Ørsted’s long-term viability and its ability to attract new investments. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]

- The company has been forced to scale back its renewable energy ambitions, reducing its planned offshore wind capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This represents a significant retreat from its previous expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The reduction in capacity means fewer wind turbines will be built, potentially impacting the broader offshore wind industry. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024]

- Ørsted has exited several key offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, as part of its cost-cutting strategy. This retreat limits the company’s future growth opportunities and weakens its competitive position in the rapidly expanding offshore wind sector. The decision to withdraw from these markets reflects the financial pressures Ørsted is facing and its need to focus on more profitable projects. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024]

- The company has incurred significant financial losses due to the cancellation of major offshore wind projects in the U.S. The abandonment of Ocean Wind 1 and 2 alone resulted in a financial hit of 3.7 billion euros. These cancellations were driven by rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and higher interest rates, which made the projects financially unviable. The failure to complete these projects raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. [de Volkskrant, Marc van Den Eerenbeemt, February 08, 2024]

- Ørsted’s financial struggles have forced it to sell off assets worth 15 billion euros in an effort to stabilize its balance sheet. This asset divestment strategy indicates the severity of the company’s financial difficulties and its need to generate liquidity. However, selling off key assets could weaken Ørsted’s long-term growth potential and reduce its influence in the offshore wind sector. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]

- The company has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have significantly increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for Ørsted to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. The combination of these factors has contributed to the company’s financial downturn and forced it to reassess its investment strategy. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]

- Ørsted’s leadership has been in turmoil, with its chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company’s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning, further complicating Ørsted’s efforts to recover from its financial difficulties. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024] - Ørsted experienced a leadership crisis in late 2023, with the abrupt dismissal of its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Daniel Lerup and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Richard Hunter following a disastrous financial year. The company suffered a massive loss of €2.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to high write-offs from abandoned offshore wind projects on the U.S. East Coast. This leadership shake-up reflects the severity of Ørsted’s financial struggles and raises concerns about stability at the top levels of management. Frequent executive turnover can disrupt strategic planning and investor confidence. [Energie & Management, Volker Stephan, February 27, 2024]

- Ørsted has been forced to divest a significant stake in its U.S. onshore wind farms, selling off equity ownership in four wind farms with a total capacity of 957 MW for approximately $300 million. This marks the company’s second major asset divestment in the U.S., highlighting its need to generate liquidity amid financial difficulties. While Ørsted retains operational control, the sale indicates that the company is struggling to maintain its ambitious renewable energy expansion without offloading assets. Such divestments could weaken its long-term market position in the U.S. renewable energy sector. [Nordic Business Report, Anonymous, March 13, 2024]

- Ørsted and other offshore wind developers faced significant financial challenges in 2023, leading to the cancellation of multiple projects in the U.S. Northeast. High inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising costs of capital and building materials made these projects financially unviable. These cancellations represent a major setback for Ørsted’s U.S. expansion strategy and could slow the overall growth of offshore wind energy in the country. The inability to complete these projects raises concerns about the company’s financial resilience and its capacity to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. [The Independent, Jennifer McDermott, March 14, 2024] There are no negative issues found related to Ørsted in the provided articles. - Ørsted has decided to exit the French renewable energy market by selling its wind and solar assets to Engie. This move is part of a broader strategy to scale back its ambitions and focus on markets where it sees higher value potential. However, this retreat from France signals financial distress and a lack of confidence in its ability to compete in the region. The company had already suffered a significant financial loss of 2.7 billion euros in 2023, largely due to setbacks in the U.S. market. This withdrawal could weaken Ørsted’s position in the European renewable energy sector and limit its future growth opportunities. [Le Figaro, Elsa Bembaron, April 29, 2024] - Ørsted has decided to exit the French renewable energy market by selling its wind and solar assets to Engie. This move is part of a broader strategy to scale back its ambitions and focus on markets where it sees higher value potential. However, this retreat from France signals financial distress and a lack of confidence in its ability to compete in the region.

This withdrawal could weaken Ørsted’s position in the European renewable energy sector and limit its future growth opportunities. [El Economista, Rubén Esteller, April 29, 2024]

- Ørsted’s stock price has plummeted by more than 50% since late 2021, reflecting a severe loss of investor confidence. The company, once a leader in the offshore wind sector, has seen its market value decline sharply due to financial struggles, project cancellations, and rising costs. This decline in market capitalization raises concerns about Ørsted’s long-term viability and its ability to attract new investments. The company’s financial troubles have made it a less attractive option for institutional investors, further exacerbating its difficulties. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, June 01, 2024]

- Ørsted was forced to cancel two major offshore wind projects in New Jersey in October 2023, citing financial infeasibility. These cancellations represent a major setback for the company’s U.S. expansion strategy and could slow the overall growth of offshore wind energy in the country. The failure to complete these projects raises concerns about Ørsted’s financial resilience and its capacity to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. The company had been far along in the approval process before abruptly scrapping the projects, which may damage its reputation with regulators and investors. [The Independent, Wayne Parry, July 17, 2024] - Ørsted has been forced to cancel its flagship green fuel factory, the FlagshipONE project in Sweden, due to a lack of demand for e-methanol. The project was intended to supply container ships with 55,000 tonnes of methanol annually, contributing to the global transition away from fossil fuels. However, the company was unable to secure long-term contracts at viable prices, leading to a financial impairment of 1.5 billion Danish kroner (£172 million). This cancellation highlights the challenges Ørsted faces in diversifying beyond offshore wind and raises concerns about the viability of large-scale green fuel projects. The decision also reflects broader struggles in the renewable energy sector, as other energy majors have similarly scaled back ambitious projects. [Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 15, 2024]

- Ørsted has suffered another financial setback with a 2.1 billion Danish kroner impairment at its Revolution Wind project near Martha’s Vineyard, off the U.S. East Coast. The delay in constructing the onshore substation has pushed the commercial operation date from 2025 to 2026, leading to additional financial losses. This delay follows the company’s earlier cancellations of two major offshore wind projects in New Jersey, Ocean Wind I and II, which had already resulted in significant financial impairments. The repeated project delays and cancellations raise concerns about Ørsted’s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments efficiently and profitably. [Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 15, 2024]

- Ørsted has been forced to delay the start of commercial operations at its 704 MW Revolution Wind project off the U.S. East Coast by a year, now expected to begin in 2026. This delay contributes to an impairment cost of 3.2 billion Danish kroner ($472 million) in its second-quarter financial results. The postponement follows the company’s earlier decision to cancel two major wind farms off the New Jersey coast, Ocean Wind I and II, due to surging costs. These setbacks, combined with Ørsted’s broader financial struggles, including job cuts and market withdrawals, indicate significant instability in its offshore wind expansion strategy. [The Guardian, Jillian Ambrose, August 15, 2024]

- Ørsted’s financial troubles have led to a major restructuring effort, including the elimination of up to 800 jobs and a retreat from key offshore wind markets such as Spain, Portugal, and Norway. The company has also suspended dividend payments for the 2023-2025 financial years in an attempt to stabilize its finances. These drastic measures reflect the severe financial strain Ørsted is under, as it struggles with rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and higher interest rates. The job cuts and market withdrawals could weaken Ørsted’s competitive position in the offshore wind sector and slow the global transition to renewable energy.

De Deense ontwikkelaar van projecten voor hernieuwbare energie Ørsted heeft afgelopen kwartaal ruim $500 
miljoen moeten afschrijven door een tegenvaller bij een Amerikaans offshorewindpark en een geannuleerde 
waterstoffabriek in Zweden.
Financieel gaat het al langer niet goed met de onderneming. Topman Mads Nipper probeert het tij te keren met een 
herstelplan. Ørsted heeft eerder bekendgemaakt rigoureus in te grijpen om de kosten te verlagen. Ook verlaat het 
bedrijf een aantal landen, verkoopt het bezittingen en heeft het wereldwijd honderden banen geschrapt.
Risco’s verminderen
In het tweede kwartaal leed de onderneming een verlies van 3,9 miljard Deense kroon. Toch stelt Nipper dat de 
operationele activiteiten van het bedrijf goed presteren, met gestegen opbrengsten van offshorewindparken. „We 
blijven sterk gericht op het verminderen van risico’s bij de uitvoering van projecten en het prioriteren van groei”, 
zegt de directeur.
Ørsted moest afschrijvingen doen op een windpark in de Verenigde Staten door bouwvertragingen, waardoor de 
oplevering een jaar later plaatsvindt. Het Zweedse waterstofproject, bekend als FlagshipONE, had de grootste 
productiefaciliteit van groene scheepsbrandstof ooit moeten worden. Het bedrijf slaagde er echter niet in afnemers 
voor de producten te vinden.

Höherer Gewinn, aber Abschreibungen in fast gleicher Höhe: Die Halbjahreszahlen des dänischen Ökoenergie-
Konzerns Orsted haben die Geister des Vorjahrs nicht ganz vertreiben können.
Die gute Nachricht für den dänischen Staat zuerst: Orsted hat den Gewinn im ersten Halbjahr 2024 auf 591 
Millionen Euro gesteigert. Das ist ein Plus von 59 Prozent und mehr, als der große dänische Windkraftkonzern 
erwartet hatte. Das Jahr 2023 war mit 2,7 Milliarden Euro Verlust desaströs verlaufen.
Dann wäre da aber noch die schlechte Nachricht, die am 15. und 16. August zunächst zu Kursrutschen an der 
Börse in Kopenhagen beitrug: Orsted gibt ehrgeizige Pläne für die Produktion von synthetischen Kraftstoffen (E-
Fuels) in Schweden auf. Außerdem verzögern sich Arbeiten am Umspannwerk für den US-Offshore-Windpark 
„Revolution Wind“ um ein Jahr. Ergebnis: Der Konzern schreibt im ersten Halbjahr 523 Millionen Euro ab.
Die Wertminderung bezeichnete Orsted-Vorstandsvorsitzender Mads Nipper vor einer Medienrunde am 15. August 
als „frustrierend und unbefriedigend“. Der Markt für E-Fuels entwickele sich in Europa nicht so schnell wie erwartet. 
Dadurch sei die Nachfrage überschaubar, wodurch die hohen Investitionskosten sich nicht wie gewünscht 
einspielen ließen.
Damit ist das Projekt „Flagship-One“ für Orsted zu einer teuren unvollendeten Idee geworden. Die Anlage in 
Schweden sollte E-Fuels auf der Grundlage von grünem Methanol herstellen. Etwa 55.000 Tonnen davon sollten 
ab 2025 jährlich an Abnehmer in Schifffahrt und Industrie gehen.
Der Verlust des Jahres 2023 war maßgeblich auf das Konto aufgegebener Offshore-Windkraftprojekte vor der US-
amerikanischen Ostküste gegangen. Nun muss Orsted auch bei „Revolution Wind“ Geduld beweisen. Das mit dem 
US-Partner Eversource entwickelte Projekt umfasst einen 304-MW-Windpark für den Bundesstaat Connecticut und 
400 MW für Rhode Island. Allerdings ist der Boden für ein Umspannwerk belastet, was den Start für die 
Windfarmen von 2025 auf 2026 verschiebt.

THE world's largest offshore wind developer Orsted has ditched plans for a mega plant to develop green fuels - 
becoming the latest company to scale back commitments to switch to cleaner energy such as hydrogen and wind.
It had been building a hub in Sweden for use by sectors from shipping to aviation.
Through combined hydrogen and carbon dioxide, the facility would have produced 55,000 tons per year of e-
methane.
But chief executive Mads Nipper said: 'The business case has deteriorated due to the inability to sign long-term 
offtake contracts at sustainable pricing and significantly higher project costs.'
The move to halt work has cost £172m. Orsted is a major player in the sector and is set to build an £8bn offshore 
wind farm in the North Sea by the end of 2027 to power more than 3.3m UK homes.

A FLAGSHIP green fuel factory has been scrapped by the renewable energy giant Ørsted amid a lack of demand 
from customers.
Work has halted on the FlagshipONE project, a proposed e-methanol plant in the Swedish town of Ornsköldsvik, 
meant to supply container ships as part of the battle to reach net zero.
The announcement is the latest sign that energy majors are retreating from the mega-projects needed to accelerate 
the global shift from fossil fuels to cleaner substitutes. Ørsted took a 1.5bn Danish kroner (£172m) hit from the 
decision to axe the facility, according to its latest financial results. The business, which is controlled by the Danish 
government, has become one of the UK's leading developers of offshore wind, with 12 wind farms in UK waters.
They include Hornsea 1 and 2 off the Yorkshire coast - together comprising one of the world's largest wind farms.
The company produces 7pc of the UK's power and is planning further expansion including two more wind farms 
near Hornsea and a massive floating one off Scotland. However, its ventures into new technologies and regions 
have hit the company hard this year, with Mads Nipper, group president and chief executive of Ørsted, announcing 
a total of 3.9bn kroner of impairments.
The FlagshipONE project would have used renewable electricity to produce hydrogen that could then be combined 
with CO2 to produce methanol.
The aim was to produce 55,000 tons of methanol a year, enough for one large container vessel, making it a large-
scale pilot project.

Green fuel factory axed in net zero blow
Mr Nipper said the company had been unable to secure long-term contracts to buy its e-methanol at a viable price. 
He said: "The liquid e-fuel market in Europe is developing slower than expected, and we have taken the strategic 
decision to deprioritise our efforts within the market and cease the development of FlagshipONE.
"We will continue our focus and development efforts within renewable hydrogen, which is essential for 
decarbonising key industries in Europe and closer to our core business."
Ørsted suffered a second impairment totalling 2.1bn kroner at its Revolution wind farm project near Martha's 
Vineyard, off the US east coast. Construction delays at its onshore substation are the key cause. Mr Nipper said: 
"Despite encouraging progress on our US offshore wind project, Revolution Wind, the construction of the onshore 
substation for the project has been delayed.
"This means that we have pushed the commercial operation date from 2025 into 2026, which led to an impairment.
"This is, of course, unsatisfactory."
The company reported a pre-tax profit of 3.9bn kroner, up from 2.4bn kroner in the same period last year, and net 
profits of 931m kroner.
Tancrede Fulop, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said Ørsted had outperformed expectations especially in 
offshore wind, but the impairments "underscore the impact of project delays".

Highlight: L'abandon par le danois Orsted de son mégaprojet d'e-fuel en Suède marque le retour à la réalité d'un 
marché sur lequel des centaines de millions d'euros ont été investis. Mais, pour les porteurs de projet de ces 
carburants bas carbone, ce n'est pas forcément une mauvaise nouvelle.
Body
C'est l'un des premiers coups d'arrêt sur un marché prometteur. Au coeur de l'été, le danois Orsted a annoncé 
l'arrêt de son grand projet d'e-fuel en Suède, FlagshipOne. Le premier du genre en Europe, qui avait été lancé il y a 
deux ans. « Nous croyons toujours au marché des e-fuels, sur le long terme, mais l'industrialisation de la 
technologie, ainsi que le développement commercial ont progressé beaucoup plus lentement que prévu », a fait 
savoir le groupe.
Les e-fuels ou carburants synthétiques ont pourtant suscité de gros espoirs pour décarboner les transports. Ils sont 
produits à partir d'hydrogène obtenu par l'électrolyse de l'eau, avec une source d'électricité bas carbone, et du 
CO2. Avec ce processus, on peut obtenir des carburants automobiles, mais aussi du e-méthanol, qui peut 
alimenter le transport maritime ou des procédés chimiques, du e-kérosène, pour faire voler les avions, ou encore 
du e-méthane, pour se substituer au gaz naturel, d'origine fossile. L'avantage, c'est que l'on obtient une molécule 
similaire à celle d'un carburant traditionnel et qu'il n'est pas nécessaire de changer les équipements - mais leurs 
détracteurs avancent que les carburants de synthèse rejettent aussi des gaz à effet de serre. Néanmoins, ils en 
émettent 70 % moins que les carburants d'origine fossile, selon une étude de l'ONG Transport & Environnement.
Le transport maritime hésitant
« Les marchés sont à des degrés de maturité différents, explique Jean-Philippe Héraud, responsable du 
programme biocarburants et e-fuels à l'Ifpen. Pour les carburants de synthèse, le marché existe déjà, il s'agit de 
prendre le relais de produits hydrocarbures pour les décarboner. Pour du e-méthanol, qui alimentera en partie le 
transport maritime, le risque sera plus important, car c'est un marché en devenir. »

FlagshipOne était décrit par Orsted comme « le plus grand projet de e-méthanol en construction en Europe ». Il 
devait permettre la production de 55.000 tonnes de e-méthanol par an à partir de 2025, destiné principalement au 
transport maritime, en utilisant de l'hydrogène d'origine renouvelable et du CO2récupéré sur une centrale à 
biomasse voisine. L'investissement aurait été supérieur à 500 millions d'euros. « Les exploitants de navires ne sont 
pas prêts à accepter les coûts élevés du méthanol durable, avec une marge de manoeuvre limitée pour récupérer 
ces dépenses supplémentaires sur leurs clients », résume S&P dans une note, estimant que le méthanol durable 
serait deux à cinq fois plus cher que le méthanol d'origine fossile.

DECRYPTAGE - Pourquoi les e-fuels peinent encore à convaincre
Pour Elyse Energy, qui développe trois projets de carburants synthétiques en France, dont deux en phase d'études 
d'ingénierie dans le Rhône et à Lacq (Pyrénées-Atlantiques), la décision d'Orsted ne doit toutefois pas jeter le 
discrédit sur l'ensemble du marché. « Ce type d'annonce est naturel dans cette phase du marché. Certains projets 
passent la barre de l'investissement, d'autres non. C'est sain et on a connu cela dans toutes les filières 
émergentes, les énergies renouvelables, le GNL ou le pétrole de schiste », souligne son cofondateur, Benoit 
Decourt. Les projets se multiplieraient même en France.
La question du prix de l'électricité
Reste que les décisions finales d'investissement sont loin d'être prises et que de nombreux points d'interrogation 
subsistent. En premier lieu, la stabilisation du coût des matières premières. « L'électricité est la première d'entre 
elles, elle peut représenter jusqu'à 80 % des coûts, ce qui est très différent d'un actif industriel classique dans le 
secteur, affirme Jean-Philippe Héraud. Mais la sécurisation des sources de CO2sera aussi un enjeu majeur. » La 
réglementation européenne impose qu'à partir de 2040, les procédés industriels soient alimentés en majorité par du 
CO2biogénique (provenant de la biomasse agricole ou forestière ou contenu dans la matière organique du sol). Le 
cadre doit donc s'adapter, alors que le débat sur la biomasse bat son plein, et les projets sécuriser ces sources.

Les incertitudes en France sur le prix de l'électricité future, avec des négociations qui doivent reprendre entre le 
prochain gouvernement et EDF, n'aident pas, non plus, au bouclage des projets. « La compétitivité des projets 
français dépendra de leur capacité à sécuriser des contrats d'achat d'électricité bas carbone sur le long terme à un 
prix suffisamment bas », indique Charlotte de Lorgeril, de Sia Partners, qui dirige le bureau français des e-fuels.
Le cadre réglementaire, qui commence à voir le jour sur certains marchés, doit encore être précisé. « Il y a un 
besoin de règles du jeu claires et stabilisées pour pouvoir prendre des décisions finales d'investissement dès 2025 
ou 2026 », soutient Benoit Decourt. La reconnaissance du nucléaire dans les sources d'énergie bas carbone doit, 
par exemple, encore être transposée dans les textes.
Une concurrence américaine et chinoise ?
Une fois ces conditions réunies, peut-être que les gros acteurs, notamment les pétroliers, s'intéresseront davantage 
à ce marché. Aujourd'hui, l'essentiel des projets est développé par quelques pionniers, et les banques se montrent 
plus prudentes pour financer ce type d'acteurs. « L'Europe nous demande de produire du e-fuel très pur, qui coûte 
huit à dix fois plus cher », insistait récemment, aux Rencontres économiques d'Aix-en-Provence, Patrick Pouyanné. 
Le patron de TotalEnergies a choisi d'explorer cette technologie aux Etats-Unis, avec TES pour du gaz synthétique.

ENQUETE - Décarbonation : l'élan des industriels français s'essouffle
Le risque serait de voir le marché décoller aux Etats-Unis ou en Chine, où les soutiens sont massifs et où quelques 
projets devraient voir le jour dans les prochains mois, alors même que l'Europe est plutôt bien positionnée en 
amont. Selon un récent rapport de Sia Partners, 10 % des projets mondiaux d'envergure se trouvent en France.
Certains appellent en outre à une meilleure concertation des différentes filières. « Nous travaillons sur des unités 
multiproduits, ajoute Jean-Philippe Héraud. En règle générale, les structures doivent s'adapter. Les acheteurs vont 
sans doute devoir s'engager dans la production, afin de partager les risques.

- Ørsted has suffered a significant financial setback, writing off over $500 million due to delays at a U.S. offshore wind farm and the cancellation of its Swedish hydrogen project, FlagshipONE. The company has been struggling financially for some time, prompting CEO Mads Nipper to implement a recovery plan that includes cost-cutting measures, exiting certain markets, selling assets, and laying off hundreds of employees. These drastic steps highlight the severity of Ørsted’s financial difficulties and raise concerns about its long-term stability in the renewable energy sector. [De Telegraaf, Anonymous, August 15, 2024]

- Ørsted has been forced to delay the completion of its Revolution Wind offshore wind project in the U.S. by a year due to construction setbacks at its onshore substation. This delay has resulted in a financial impairment of 3.9 billion Danish kroner, further exacerbating the company’s financial struggles. The postponement of this project, which was developed in partnership with Eversource, raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments efficiently and profitably. [Energie & Management, Volker Stephan, August 16, 2024]

- Ørsted has abandoned its ambitious FlagshipONE project in Sweden, which was intended to be Europe’s largest e-methanol production facility. The company cited an inability to secure long-term contracts at sustainable prices and significantly higher project costs as the primary reasons for the cancellation. This decision has resulted in a financial impairment of £172 million, marking another costly failure in Ørsted’s efforts to expand beyond offshore wind. The cancellation also reflects broader struggles in the renewable energy sector, as other energy majors have similarly scaled back ambitious projects. [The Daily Mail, Emily Hawkins, August 16, 2024]

- Ørsted’s decision to scrap the FlagshipONE project in Sweden represents a major setback for the company’s diversification strategy. The project was expected to produce 55,000 tonnes of e-methanol annually for the shipping industry, but Ørsted was unable to secure buyers at viable prices. This failure highlights the slow development of the e-fuel market in Europe and raises concerns about the company’s ability to successfully expand into new renewable energy technologies. The financial hit from this cancellation, amounting to 1.5 billion Danish kroner, adds to Ørsted’s growing list of impairments. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 16, 2024]

- Ørsted has suffered another financial impairment of 2.1 billion Danish kroner due to delays at its Revolution Wind project near Martha’s Vineyard, off the U.S. East Coast. The delay in constructing the onshore substation has pushed the commercial operation date from 2025 to 2026, leading to additional financial losses. This setback follows the company’s earlier cancellations of two major offshore wind projects in New Jersey, Ocean Wind I and II, which had already resulted in significant financial impairments. The repeated project delays and cancellations raise concerns about Ørsted’s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments efficiently and profitably. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 16, 2024]

- Ørsted’s stock price has plummeted by more than 7% following the announcement of impairment losses totaling 3.2 billion Danish kroner (£370 million) in the second quarter due to project delays in the U.S. The company has faced setbacks with its Revolution Wind project off the coasts of Connecticut and Rhode Island, as well as impairments related to its canceled Ocean Wind project and the abandoned FlagshipONE green e-methanol project in Sweden. These financial hits indicate ongoing difficulties in executing large-scale renewable energy projects profitably, further eroding investor confidence. [Proactive Investors (UK), Josh Lamb, August 15, 2024]

- Ørsted’s withdrawal from the FlagshipONE project in Sweden underscores the broader challenges facing the synthetic fuel market. The company had planned to invest over 500 million euros in the facility, which was expected to produce 55,000 tonnes of e-methanol annually. However, the high costs of production and the reluctance of shipping companies to pay a premium for sustainable methanol led to the project’s cancellation. This failure highlights the economic and regulatory uncertainties surrounding synthetic fuels and raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to successfully diversify its renewable energy portfolio.
