Meg O'Neill's statement reflects a generally positive stance towards Shell, as both Woodside and Shell are major players in the LNG sector and advocate for natural gas as a lower-carbon alternative to coal, demonstrating consistency in their pro-gas position; this alignment could bolster Shell's reputation by reinforcing the narrative that LNG is a viable transition fuel, and the sentiment suggests a broader industry push towards gas as a pragmatic climate solution.
