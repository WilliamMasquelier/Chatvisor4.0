You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| Not mentioned | Not mentioned | "El ebitda en 2023 se vio afectado por una provisión de 9.600 millones de coronas danesas para gastos de cancelación relacionados con nuestra decisión de cesar el desarrollo de Ocean Wind 1" | "EBITDA in 2023 was affected by a provision of 9.6 billion Danish crowns for cancellation costs related to our decision to cease the development of Ocean Wind 1." |
| Not mentioned | Not mentioned | "Las cancelaciones de proyectos y los cambios en los planes de construcción ahorrarán a la empresa 35.000 millones de coronas danesas (5.100 millones de dólares) hasta 2026" | "Project cancellations and changes in construction plans will save the company 35 billion Danish crowns ($5.1 billion) by 2026." |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Orsted.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Orsted or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
