## Assistant

Hester Hendriks maintains a neutral stance towards Acrylnagelproducten, as their statement merely acknowledges the presence of acrylates in nail products without expressing concern or endorsement. Their objective and factual approach as a toxicologist suggests consistency in their views, which may have a limited direct impact on Acrylnagelproducten's reputation or operations unless further commentary on safety or risks emerges.
