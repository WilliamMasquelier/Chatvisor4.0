The billionaire family that co-founded the Westfield shopping centre empire is expanding its lending to the wealthy, 
becoming the latest deep-pocketed investor to push into the fast-growing private credit market.
The late John Saunders founded Westfield with Frank Lowy, but split with the businessman in 1987. The proceeds 
of the split became Terrace Tower Group, which has been controlled by Mr Saunders' daughters - Monica 
Saunders-Weinberg and Betty Saunders-Klimenko - since 1997.
Terrace Tower has assets worth $1.85 billion, but has been secretive about its investments and strategy. In an 
interview with The Australian Financial Review, however, Terrace Tower chief executive Richard Weinberg, the 
husband of Ms Saunders-Weinberg, said he wanted to expand the firm's lending. "We're open for business," Mr 
Weinberg added.
Private credit is expected to have topped $200 billion last year, well above the $188 billion in loans reported in 
2023, as investors chase higher returns and diversify their portfolios out of equities and bonds.
In the United States, there are now more than $US1.7 trillion ($2.7 trillion) in loans made outside the banking 
system, with some of the world's biggest asset managers jostling to launch products that would allow retail 
investors to put money into the strategy. In December, BondBloxx and Virtus Investment Partners launched the first 
exchange-traded fund, which allowed retail investors to back private credit lending. Others are following.
For Terrace Tower, its lending includes a particular niche - the wealthy. Mr Weinberg said the firm was expanding 
into lending against assets rather than real estate developments - the most popular form of private credit - with 
collateral including the investment portfolios of wealthy families, shares in companies or government tax credits.
Many high net worth individuals have experienced liquidity problems as a result of their investments in private 
equity, he said. Dropping values and difficulty selling companies has led to the gating of redemptions.

"These are loans to funds, firms or even individuals secured over a pool of assets, typically a portfolio of 
investments," Mr Weinberg said.
Adam Shell, a senior portfolio manager at Terrace Tower, said: "There's a lack of liquidity from any form of private-
related investment. That doesn't mean the assets are not worth what they're worth, but [they] need the cash for 
whatever reason, so that's what we're trying to take advantage of.
"We believe that we have an edge in terms of assessing a diverse pool of assets. [The wealthy individual] might 
have fund investments, they might have artwork, they might have investment property, they might have residential 
property. Some of those properties might already have debt. We're willing to kind of take a portfolio approach and 
assess the risk there."
Mr Weinberg and Mr Shell said wealthy borrowers have the need for lenders like Terrace Tower in situations such 
as a divorce. "We would be happy to lend against a boat ... within a pool of assets ... and we have a network such 
that we could get a clearing price on that boat," Mr Shell said.
A number of Terrace Tower lending deals would previously be thought of as an ownership situation. "We're 
identifying opportunities that borrowers previously thought would only be sold for equity," Mr Weinberg said.
Mr Shell said Terrace Tower was able to compete with larger private credit firms because clients were happy to pay 
more money for faster service.
"They need the capital for whatever reason, positive or negative reasons. So we can charge extra for that," he said, 
adding another reason borrowers turned to the firm was for secrecy.
"Counterparties don't want their existing lenders and portfolio companies knowing, they don't want the market to 
know, and they don't want journalists to know. That's what we pride ourselves on - confidentiality."
The Saunders family is not the only wealthy family lending to their peers. Gerry Harvey - the retailer with a fortune 
of $3.39 billion, according to the Financial Review Rich List - personally lends for property developments and to 
help wealthy individuals with liquidity problems. In 2022, he acquired some $80 million in New Zealand property 
loans, turning a considerable profit.
He told the Financial Review that while he lent to high net worth individuals, he was cautious about who borrowed 
from him. "You knock a lot back if you think they are a bit risky," Mr Harvey said.
The rapid increase in private credit has, however, left regulators concerned about the risks should borrowers begin 
to default. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in July that transparency in private credit 
would be a key priority, putting together a team to investigate conflicts of interest and determine how firms value the 
assets they have lent against.
In October, the regulator sued Oak Capital, which describes itself as a "mid-tier" non-bank lender with $700 million 
in loans. In Federal Court filings, ASIC alleged Oak Capital lent $37 million as home loans but dressed them up as 
corporate lending to circumvent consumer protections.
Brian Bailison, Terrace Tower's chief financial officer, said the risks were higher in the more competitive real estate 
lending space, where there had been "more aggressiveness" in loan to value ratios. Declining real estate values 
amid high rates have led to problems for some lenders. "I don't expect there to be a meltdown, but do we believe 
there are problems in people's books? Yeah, I do," Mr Weinberg added. "Given the competitive nature of the real 
estate sector and the syndicated loan market and the amount of money that's been raised and [allocated] to those 
two areas, we believe you're not getting the return for risk."That doesn't mean we think that they're problematic."
Terrace Tower reported a $6.9 million profit in the 12 months to June 30, down from $10.9 million a year earlier, 
according to the family's first disclosures since the company was founded almost four decades ago. The accounts 
only had to be disclosed after the government changed rules that had previously allowed Terrace Tower not to file 
documents with ASIC.Page 3 of 3

Despite not focusing on real estate lending, the family office still has a substantial property portfolio. In Sydney, 
Terrace Tower's key assets include Westfield Eastgardens, the Supa Centa in Moore Park and 80 William Street, 
the 20-storey office building on Sydney CBD's fringe known for its three-storey-high neon green Terrace Tower 
Group 80 rooftop signage.
Ms Saunders-Klimenko separately owns the Erebus Motorsport squad in the Supercars Championship and was the 
first female owner to win the Bathurst 1000.
Ms Saunders-Weinberg, who has three sons, works between Los Angeles and Sydney. She chairs the family's 
philanthropic foundation and is involved in other charity endeavours including the Gold Dinner - a major Sydney 
event that raises money for the Sydney Children's Hospital.
