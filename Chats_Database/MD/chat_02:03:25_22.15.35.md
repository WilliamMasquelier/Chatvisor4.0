Tras realizar un profit warning en agosto y finalmente registrar un deterioro en su cartera de proyectos de eólica 
marina en Estados Unidos, Orsted vuelve a asestar un nuevo golpe al sector renovable. Tras constatarse el 
desgaste esperado en sus cuentas anuales, la compañía ha anunciado la suspensión del dividendo, recortes en 
sus proyectos verdes y hasta 800 despidos.
Durante 2023, la subida de tipos de interés y los problemas en la cadena de suministro obligaron a la compañía 
danesa, el mayor desarrollador de energía eólica marina del mundo, a rebajar sus estimaciones para el conjunto 
del ejercicio. La difícil situación económica a la que se enfrentaba la energética derivó en una pérdida de más del 
40% de su valor de mercado durante el año pasado.
Finalmente la compañía ha informado de un ebitda de 18.717 millones de coronas danesas (2.500 millones de 
euros), una cifra incluso por debajo de su horquilla entre los 20-23 millones. "El ebitda en 2023 se vio afectado por 
una provisión de 9.600 millones de coronas danesas para gastos de cancelación relacionados con nuestra decisión 
de cesar el desarrollo de Ocean Wind 1", explican desde la propia compañía.
Ante este escenario, Orsted ha anunciado la suspensión de su dividendo hasta por lo menos 2025. La firma 
llevaba incrementando la retribución a sus accionistas año a año desde 2016, pasando de los 0,8 euros por acción 
que distribuyó sobre los beneficios de entonces a los 1,81 euros que repartió con cargo a 2022 -lo que supone un 
incremento del 126% seis ejercicios-. Desde Bankinter explican que esta cancelación de la retribución a los 
inversores tiene como objetivo centrarse en inversiones sin necesidad de ampliar capital.
Sin embargo, la compañía también ha anunciado que reducirá su objetivo de construcción de proyectos verdes al 
menos un 24%, hasta conseguir una capacidad entre 35 y 38 GW para 2030, frente al objetivo anterior de 50GW. 
Además, Orsted eliminará hasta 800 puestos de trabajo, comenzando por 250 despidos en los siguientes meses, 
saldrá de algunos mercados eólicos emergentes como Noruega, España o Portugal y limitará su cartera de 
pedidos eólicos marinos en Estados Unidos. "Las cancelaciones de proyectos y los cambios en los planes de 
construcción ahorrarán a la empresa 35.000 millones de coronas danesas (5.100 millones de dólares) hasta 2026", 
explican desde Bloomberg.
La compañía llegó a ser hace unos años una de las mayores energéticas de todo el Viejo Continente. A comienzos 
de 2021 y marcando máximos históricos en bolsa, el valor de mercado de Orsted llegó a superar los 76.500 
Page 2 of 2
El nuevo 'susto' de Orsted: suspende el dividendo hasta 'por lo menos' 2025
millones de euros, siendo la tercera utility más grande de Europa en aquel momento, tras Iberdrola y Enel. Desde 
entonces, su capitalización se reduce más de un 70% y actualmente apenas alcanza los 16.000 millones de euros, 
situándose en el puesto 14 del sector eléctrico europeo por valor de mercado.
En 2024, no obstante, la firma danesa consigue revalorizarse alrededor de un 2%, siendo de los pocos valores del 
sector que aguantan en positivo en un año en el que la industria ya se deja casi un 7% de su valor (es la segunda 
más bajista del continente, tras los recursos básicos).
Por el momento, los recortes de la compañía anunciados este miércoles no se están traduciendo en fuertes ventas 
de sus acciones que pierden alrededor de un 1%. Solo hoy han sido cinco casas de análisis las que han reiterado 
su recomendación de mantener posiciones en la firma y dos han reafirmado sus consejos de compra. Con todo, el 
consejo mayoritario continúa siendo el de mantener y el consenso de expertos que recoge Bloomberg ve un 
potencial para sus títulos del 16% durante los siguientes meses, hasta las 449 coronas danesas por acción que 
fijan de precio objetivo medio.
La noticia tampoco está afectando al resto de renovables y lo cierto es que en el parqué español, las verdes del 
Ibex, Solaria y Acciona Energía, aunque con ligeros ascensos que no alcanzan al 0,5% en ambos casos, se sitúan 
entre las más alcistas del índice nacional en la jornada. Iberdrola, por contra, sí que sufre y registra una caída del 
1,4%. En el continente, Veolia también se revaloriza ligeramente y EDP Renováveis retrocede sobre un 0,5%.

Highlight: Ørsted quits several global markets and scales back offshore projects amid strong headwinds
Body
One of Britain’s largest offshore wind developers has been forced to cut hundreds of jobs and quit several global 
markets as it battles spiralling costs. 
Ørsted , which operates 12 wind farms in the UK, announced a raft of cost-cutting measures after posting around 
£2.2bn worth of losses for 2023.
This includes halting dividend payments until 2025 and pulling out of several international markets, including in 
Norway, Spain and Portugal. 
Ørsted’s cash crunch comes after the business abandoned several uncompleted projects in the US  last year after 
incurring billions of pounds of losses. 
Mads Nipper, chief executive of the Danish business, said up to 800 roles will be affected by the cost cuts, with 
expected wind farm output falling from 50 gigawatts to 38 gigawatts by 2030.
This could mean the business builds 1,500 fewer turbines.
Mr Nipper said: “Despite a year with strong underlying business progress, 2023 marked a year with substantial 
challenges for Ørsted. 
“Our financial results are adversely affected by the impairments we took on our US offshore projects in the third 
quarter of 2023.”
The latest update also confirmed that chairman Thomas Thune Andersen will step down in March.

Mr Andersen said: “2023 was a challenging year for Ørsted. We have learned from the challenges and today, we 
are announcing a robust business plan with revised strategic growth ambitions for 2030.”
In total, Ørsted has written off £3.3bn from its wind farm business.
It comes as Siemens Energy , which produces turbines for many UK wind farms, swung to a €1.58bn (£1.35bn) 
profit in its first quarter thanks to a one-off gain relating to the sale of an Indian subsidiary to its parent Siemens for 
£1.8bn. 
The German company is still reeling from cash struggles partly caused by quality issues affecting some of its 
onshore wind turbines.
This led to the business being forced to seek a financial guarantee from the German government last year. 
Siemens Energy has become a vital part of the UK wind industry, owning a turbine blade factory in Hull that 
employs 1,200 people.
Overall, the company employs 6,000 people in the UK.
The company has other profitable divisions, including producing technologies for gas generation and power grids.
However, its business has struggled in the past year due to its troubled wind division, as faults in its 4X and 5X 
onshore wind turbine models led to them being taken off the market.
The problem, linked to faulty rotor blades and bearings, triggered repair costs of £1.4bn.
Christian Bruch, chief executive of Siemens Energy AG, said: “The solid first quarter is encouraging. Our focus 
remains on solving the quality problems in our onshore wind business and making the most of the growth potential 
for the rest of the company.”

Body
In a busy day for the renewable energy sector, Ørsted, Vestas and Siemens Energy reported varying financial 
results, with the latter two returning to profit but the former announcing a strategic pullback, shelving its dividend 
and lowering its renewable energy targets.
Following a challenging year, where its share price collapsed after a warning in August about significantly higher 
costs on US projects, Ørsted said it plans to cut up to 800 jobs and exit offshore wind markets in Norway, Spain, 
and Portugal to become a "leaner and more efficient company."
After an aggressive push into the US faltered on various hurdles, the Danish company said it had "learned from 
these challenges and implemented significant changes", and was now "seeing good signs" for the offshore wind 
industry.
Its shares, having plunged in late summer to below 250 krone but since bounced back to almost 400kr, fell 2% on 
the morning of results.  
There was a mixed update from Vestas, the wind turbine maker, which returned to profit in the fourth quarter but 
withheld its payout for 2023 as it said the profit was so small it "would result in a mere token dividend".
This Denmark-based company's operating profit before special items of (EURO)231 million, recovering from a 
(EURO)1.2 billion loss the previous year.

However, CEO Henrik Andersen said dark clouds were not fully clearing for the industry, saying: "Continued 
geopolitical volatility as well as slow permitting and insufficient grid build-out across markets are expected to cause 
uncertainty in 2024."
Its shares, which fell to a three-year low last September but have recovered more strongly than Orsted, rose 6%.
Germany's Siemens Energy also reported a swing back into the black in its first fiscal quarter, largely attributed to a 
one-off gain from selling a stake in its Indian affiliate.
The company's net profit was (EURO)1.58 billion, compared to a loss of (EURO)282 million last time, with a notable 
increase in orders and a record-high order backlog.
Management again cited ongoing challenges, particularly with its Siemens Gamesa subsidiary, which experienced 
a high cash outflow due to a loss and a build-up of operating net working capital in a seasonally weak quarter, it 
said.
Siemens Energy shares, which hit an all-time low below (EURO)7 in October, continued their recent rally by rising 
1.6% to (EURO)14.47.

Highlight: Company developing world’s largest offshore windfarm in North Sea attempts to recover from turbulent 
yearBusiness live – latest updatesEurope live – latest updates
Body
The Danish company developing the world’s largest offshore windfarm in the North Sea is to cut hundreds of jobs 
and pause its dividend in an attempt to recover from a chaotic 12 months.
Ørsted, which is behind the £8bn Hornsea 3 project off the Yorkshire coast, said on Wednesday it planned to axe 
up to 800 jobs, pull back from markets in Spain, Portugal and Norway and suspend dividend payments to 
shareholders covering the 2023-25 financial years.
The company said it would cut its target for developing renewable energy capacity by 2030, reducing it from 50 
gigawatts to 35-38GW.
Its chair, Thomas Thune Andersen, will step down after almost a decade in the role, following the two senior 
executives who left the business  in November.
The company, which is majority owned by the Danish government, said the “reset plan” was designed to make it a 
“leaner and more efficient company”.
Ørsted has struggled in the face of high inflation, supply-chain disruption and rising interest rates, which have hit 
the windfarm industry. The company has also experienced problems in the US in attempting to secure tax credits.
Last year, Ørsted cancelled two big offshore windfarm projects in the US , the Ocean Wind I and II schemes, 
blaming a sharp rise in costs. It took a 28.4bn Danish kroner (£3.3bn) hit as a result of the decision.
The company had also raised doubts over the cost of the Hornsea 3 project early last year. However, in December 
it reaffirmed its commitment to 2.9GW development, which is expected to supply power to about 3.3m homes.

The RBC analyst Alexander Wheeler said financial markets had been expecting Ørsted to tap investors for funds, 
“which would have resolved the issues quicker and removed future risk in this regard”.
He added: “However, we now have a period where Ørsted needs to execute on various components of its plan to 
improve its balance sheet metrics over the medium term.”
Ørsted has 12 existing windfarms in the UK producing enough energy to power six million UK homes. It is also 
working on a floating offshore wind project  in Scotland.
Separately on Wednesday, the turbine maker Siemens Energy, which was forced to strike a €15bn rescue deal with 
the German government  last year, reported a €1.58bn first-quarter profit after selling a stake in its Indian unit.
It said orders remained lower than forecast in its turbine division, where newer models have suffered technical 
faults, but it hoped to break even in that business in 2026.
The problems affecting the windfarm industry caused the Swedish energy firm Vattenfall to stop work  on the 
multibillion-pound Norfolk Boreas windfarm last year because it was no longer profitable.
The Norwegian oil and gas producer Equinor posted quarterly profits of $8.68bn – down from $17bn a year earlier 
but ahead of City forecasts – due to lower energy prices.
Meanwhile, the British Gas owner Centrica signed an agreement to buy a million metric tonnes of liquified natural 
gas (LNG) from Spain’s Repsol. The cargoes will be delivered to the Isle of Grain terminal in Kent between 2025 
and 2027. Britain has a collection of gas terminals, providing fuel for domestic use and to be re-exported.
Germany has raced to bolster its ability to import shipped LNG  since piped Russian gas supplies dropped after the 
invasion of Ukraine, while the US last month moved to curb gas exports by pausing all pending export permits  amid 
climate concerns.
The new chief executive of BP said on Tuesday  the oil and gas company would take a “more pragmatic” approach 
to reaching its green targets. Shell faced calls to speed up its investment in renewable energy last week, as it 
announced bumper profits and shareholder payouts  and increased oil and gas production.
In January, gas-fired power stations provided the largest share of Great Britain’s electricity supply, at 35.7%, ahead 
of wind power at 33.5%, National Grid said  this week.

Highlight: La cure est radicale : Orsted, le géant mondial de l'éolien en mer, cesse de verser son dividende, revoit 
ses ambitions à la baisse et engage une cure d'austérité sur ses marchés clés.
Body
L'inflation dans l'éolien en mer n'a fini pas de faire tanguer le géant Orsted. Ce mercredi, le groupe danois, mis en 
difficulté par une flambée des coûts inattendus de ses projets phares aux Etats-Unis, a annoncé suspendre le 
versement de son dividende jusqu'à 2025 et lancer une vaste cure d'austérité.
« Nous présentons un business plan actualisé, fondé sur une revue complète de notre portefeuille. Nous priorisons 
les opportunités de croissance avec le meilleur potentiel de rendement et, en même temps, réduisons nos risques 
dans le développement et l'exécution de nos projets », a fait valoir Mads Nipper, le PDG du groupe, qui assure 
toutefois que le groupe veut rester « leader dans l'éolien en mer et un acteur régional dans l'éolien terrestre ».
Moins de projets renouvelables à déployer
Concrètement, ce dernier annonce une très nette révision à la baisse des objectifs de déploiement de nouvelles 
capacités renouvelables. Désormais, Orsted vise 35 à 38 GW de capacités installées d'ici à 2030, contre 50 GW 
jusqu'ici.
Le groupe annonce aussi la suppression de 800 emplois dans le monde, dont 250 dès le mois prochain, avec la 
sortie de plusieurs pays prometteurs dans l'éolien en mer. Il s'agit de l'Espagne, du Portugal, de la Norvège mais 
aussi de la « dépriorisation » de certaines activités au Japon.

- Ørsted has announced the suspension of its dividend payments until at least 2025, marking a significant shift in its financial strategy. The company had been consistently increasing shareholder payouts since 2016, but due to financial struggles, it has decided to halt these payments to focus on investments without raising additional capital. This move could negatively impact investor confidence and stock performance, as dividends are a key attraction for shareholders. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- The company has suffered a major financial setback, reporting an EBITDA of 18.7 billion Danish kroner (€2.5 billion) for 2023, which is below its projected range of 20-23 billion kroner. A significant portion of this shortfall is attributed to a 9.6 billion kroner provision for cancellation costs related to the termination of the Ocean Wind 1 project in the U.S. This financial underperformance highlights the challenges Ørsted faces in managing its offshore wind projects profitably. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has decided to cut its renewable energy project targets by at least 24%, reducing its planned capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This reduction signals a retreat from its previous ambitious expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The company is also exiting several emerging offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, limiting its future growth opportunities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- The company is implementing significant job cuts, with up to 800 positions being eliminated globally. The first phase will see 250 layoffs in the coming months. These job losses reflect the financial strain Ørsted is under and could have negative social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted’s market capitalization has plummeted by more than 70% since its peak in early 2021, when it was valued at over €76.5 billion. The company, once the third-largest utility in Europe, now ranks 14th in the sector, with a market value of just €16 billion. This dramatic decline underscores the financial instability and investor concerns surrounding the company. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has incurred massive financial losses, posting around £2.2 billion in losses for 2023. The company has also written off £3.3 billion from its wind farm business, reflecting the severe financial difficulties it faces. These losses are largely due to the abandonment of several offshore wind projects in the U.S., which resulted in billions in impairments. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]

- The company’s financial struggles have forced it to scale back offshore wind projects, which could result in the construction of 1,500 fewer wind turbines than originally planned. This reduction in capacity could slow the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure and impact global climate goals. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted’s chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, is stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company’s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]

- The company has faced significant challenges in the U.S. market, particularly in securing tax credits for its offshore wind projects. Last year, Ørsted canceled two major offshore wind projects, Ocean Wind I and II, due to rising costs, resulting in a financial hit of 28.4 billion Danish kroner (£3.3 billion). These cancellations highlight the financial and regulatory difficulties of expanding renewable energy in the U.S. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for the company to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]

- The company’s financial troubles have led analysts to speculate that it may need to seek additional funding from investors. However, instead of raising capital, Ørsted has opted for cost-cutting measures, which could prolong financial uncertainty and increase risks for the company’s future stability. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has been forced to implement a drastic austerity plan, including a comprehensive review of its project portfolio. The company is prioritizing projects with the highest potential returns while reducing risks in development and execution. This shift in strategy indicates a retreat from aggressive expansion and a more cautious approach to investment. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024]

- The company’s decision to exit key offshore wind markets, including Spain, Portugal, and Norway, as well as to deprioritize certain activities in Japan, represents a significant contraction of its global footprint. This retreat could weaken its competitive position in the rapidly growing offshore wind sector. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024]
