You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| Daryl Killin | Former senior roles at major carbon companies | "The guys who are doing the emitting, are now getting profits from the solution? It couldn't be more perverse. They're profiting from the problem they created." | N.A. |
| Gary Wyatt | Managing director of Corporate Carbon | "It's not a problem they [the fossil fuel industry] created. It's a problem that's been created by us choosing to live the lifestyle that we do, which has resulted in the consumption of a large amount of fossil fuels." | N.A. |
| Shell spokesperson | Not mentioned | "Offsets are used only where emissions cannot be avoided and that part-owning Corporate Carbon allowed it to maximize quality and integrity of projects that deliver wider benefits to the environment and local communities." | N.A. |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Shell.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Shell or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
