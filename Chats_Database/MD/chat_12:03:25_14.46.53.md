Shell, one of the world's largest energy companies, quietly shelved plans to develop an offshore wind project in 
Victoria, as it implements its strategy to invest in less capital-intensive, mature forms of electricity generation.
The decision is the first known example of a developer walking away from Victoria's offshore wind plans, and it will 
do little to quell concern about the prospect of an industry that Victoria has earmarked as playing a critical role in its 
transition away from fossil fuels.
Victoria in 2022 set a target of generating about 20 per cent of its energy needs from offshore wind within a decade. 
The target then doubles to 4GW by 2035 and 9GW by 2040. In all, Victoria sees potential for 13GW of offshore 
wind capacity by 2050, five times the current renewable generation in Victoria.
The target drew a plethora of some of the world's largest global energy companies to apply for a so-called feasibility 
licence, and Shell was understood to have been informed late last year that it was in line to secure a permit should 
it overcome a boundary dispute.
Untangling the dispute was seen as inevitable, but Shell determined it would not proceed with its initial application 
as it delivers on chief executive's Wael Sawan's commitment to be "ruthless" in focusing on financial performance. 
A Shell spokeswoman confirmed the decision, but said: "Australia's abundant offshore wind resources have strong 
potential to help Australia achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and Shell (has) confidence in the establishment of a 
sustainable Australian offshore wind industry."
