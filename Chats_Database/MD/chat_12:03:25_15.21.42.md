Australian companies have been given an artificial intelligence reality check, with 58 per cent that have invested in 
artificial programs and applications saying the technology has fallen short of expectations.
And about 70 per cent of investors have pulled out of active deals because of AI con-sideration.
Cisco's AI readiness index, undertaken for the second time this year, found 38 per cent of companies had allocated 
between 10 to 30 per cent of their IT budget to AI, despite many not seeing a return on the investment. The 
company's Australian chief technology officer, Carl Solder, said Cisco's index found about half of the companies 
surveyed found help from AI with processes and operations did not hit the mark.
About 44 per cent saw either no or not enough improvement in the technology automating their business.
"I think the reality is that they started to appreciate the work and effort involved in getting all those building blocks 
squared away, and the strategy, infrastructure data governance, talent and culture," Mr Solder said. "The reality is 
that maybe there is a little bit more work that we have to do to be fully prepared." Cisco's Index measured the 
responses of 3660 senior business leaders from companies with 500 or more staff across 14 countries in the Asia 
Pacific.
The index found just 4 per cent of the country was in a position to leverage AI, a figure that dropped from 5 per cent 
the previous year. Mr Solder said 92 per cent of companies were facing increasing pressure to adopt AI, despite 
much of it not showing a return on investment over the past year.
Most of that pressure came from company chief executives and boards and it was found to have risen again over 
the past six months. "Fifty-six per cent of those organisations said that the pressure has increased significantly on 
that number," Mr Solder said.
That pressure has led to more than one-fifth - 21 per cent - of companies planning to allocate 40 per cent of their IT 
budget to AI over the next four to five years.
Meanwhile, some Bain data found investors believed generative AI would not add much value in 2025, instead 
believing it would take up to three years to see the full benefit. That view is influenced by a number of investors

confirming just 20 per cent of their portfolio companies having Gen AI uses that are "delivering value". About 30 per 
cent of portfolio companies are still testing or developing AI use cases.
Similarly to Cisco, Bain found AI investments were four times more likely to disappoint investors than they were to 
exceed expectations. Over the past 12 months, AI agents - chatbots that leverage large language models to 
undertake tasks such as reading and responding to emails - have been framed as one of the first major use cases 
of the technology. But Australian workers disagree, with an EY report finding just 37 per cent of employees were 
comfortable with their companies introducing AI assistants.
