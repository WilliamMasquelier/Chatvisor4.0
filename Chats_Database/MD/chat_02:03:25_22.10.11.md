Renewables group Ørsted is to install a Tesla-made energy storage system in East Anglia that it said would 
increase stability of the country's energy supply and reduce price volatility.
The Danish company said the Tesla Megapack would give Britain one of the largest battery energy storage systems 
in Europe. It said that the 600 MWh facility would hold the energy for 80,000 UK homes for a day.
The storage will be in Swardeston, Norfolk, at the onshore converter station of the Hornsea 3 offshore wind farm. 
Duncan Clark, Ørsted's UK boss, said: "The battery will help ensure that renewable energy is used in the best 
possible way by storing it when demand is lower and then releasing it back into the system when it's needed."
