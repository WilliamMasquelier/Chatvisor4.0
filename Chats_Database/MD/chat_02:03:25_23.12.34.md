You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| Orsted | Not mentioned | "Orsted hat Inbetriebnahme-Daten zwischen dem 18. und dem 29. April angegeben." | "Orsted has provided commissioning data between April 18 and April 29." |
| Glennmont Partners | Not mentioned | "Bei der Windkraft auf See macht sich die kurz bevorstehende Inbetriebnahme der ersten 115 MW im Nordsee-Windpark „Gode Wind 3“ von Orsted und Glennmont Partners bemerkbar." | "In offshore wind power, the imminent commissioning of the first 115 MW at the North Sea wind farm 'Gode Wind 3' by Orsted and Glennmont Partners is noticeable." |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Orsted.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Orsted or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
