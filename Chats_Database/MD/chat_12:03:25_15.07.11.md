# 2. Oil and Gas Operations and Market Positioning  

## 2.1. Overview  

The media coverage of Shell's oil and gas operations and market positioning highlights the company's strategic investments, regulatory challenges, and evolving role in global and regional energy markets. Shell has been actively expanding its natural gas operations, particularly in Australia, through its joint venture with PetroChina, Arrow Energy, to address growing domestic and export demands [International Business Times Australia, August 12, 2024]. Additionally, Shell has pursued consolidation efforts in the North Sea through a joint venture with Equinor, reinforcing its market position in the region [The Australian, February 07, 2025].  

The coverage also underscores the increasing regulatory and environmental scrutiny Shell faces, particularly regarding new gas projects and emissions concerns. Legal challenges, such as those affecting the Jackdaw gas field in the UK, and public opposition to fossil fuel expansion, reflect the broader tensions between energy security and climate commitments [The Australian, February 07, 2025]. Despite these challenges, Shell continues to invest in large-scale gas projects, positioning itself as a key player in securing energy supplies while navigating the transition to lower-emission energy sources [The Australian, August 13, 2024].  

## 2.2. Chronological Analysis  

### 2.2.1 Early Coverage  

The earliest media coverage in this category focuses on Shell’s historical role in shaping Australia’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) export industry. The company played a crucial part in the development of the North West Shelf project, Australia’s largest resource project, by acquiring a stake from the struggling British oil company Burmah [Australian Financial Review, February 22, 2024]. This investment was instrumental in establishing Australia as a major LNG exporter. Former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating recalled his collaboration with Shell’s leadership in securing international partnerships, particularly with Japanese bankers and gas buyers, highlighting Shell’s strategic approach to global energy markets [Australian Financial Review, February 22, 2024].  

### 2.2.2 Developing Trends  

By mid-2024, media coverage shifted towards Shell’s ongoing investments in Australia’s gas sector, particularly through its joint venture with PetroChina, Arrow Energy. The company announced the second phase of the Surat coal seam gas project in Queensland, which aims to produce an additional 130 terajoules of gas per day at peak production, with first gas expected in 2026 [International Business Times Australia, August 12, 2024]. This expansion was framed as a response to increasing domestic gas demand and regulatory calls for more investment in the sector [The Daily Telegraph, August 13, 2024].  

The Surat project’s expansion includes the development of 450 new gas production wells and infrastructure upgrades, reinforcing Shell’s role as a major supplier of natural gas in Australia [The Australian, August 13, 2024]. However, the project has also faced opposition from environmental groups and local farming communities concerned about its impact on water resources and emissions, reflecting the ongoing debate over fossil fuel development [Australian Financial Review, August 13, 2024].  

In September 2024, Shell’s exploration activities in Queensland’s Taroom Trough gained media attention after a gas flare sparked optimism about a potential new energy source for the east coast market. Analysts suggested that if Shell successfully demonstrates the viability of horizontal drilling in the region, it could unlock significant additional gas reserves, potentially alleviating supply shortages [Australian Financial Review, September 10, 2024].  

### 2.2.3 Recent Developments  

By early 2025, media coverage expanded to Shell’s strategic moves in the North Sea. The company entered a 50-50 joint venture with Equinor, consolidating their British oil and gas assets to create the largest independent producer in the region [The Australian, February 07, 2025]. However, Shell faced regulatory hurdles, particularly with its Jackdaw gas field, which required reapplication for government approval due to legal challenges over emissions considerations [The Australian, February 07, 2025].  

Additionally, Shell’s involvement in the Rosebank project attracted political criticism, with the British Energy Secretary labeling it as "climate vandalism" and a "colossal waste of taxpayer money" [The Australian, February 07, 2025]. Despite these challenges, Shell and Equinor defended the project, emphasizing its importance for domestic energy security and reducing reliance on imports [The Australian, February 07, 2025].  

## 2.3. Stakeholder Perspectives  

### 2.3.1 Shell Leadership  

Shell’s leadership has consistently emphasized the company’s commitment to securing energy supplies while transitioning to lower-emission energy sources. Zoë Yujnovich, Shell’s Integrated Gas and Upstream Director, highlighted the Surat Gas Project’s role in meeting domestic demand and supporting long-term contracts through the QCLNG facility [The Daily Telegraph, August 13, 2024]. She also underscored Shell’s focus on sustainability, stating that the Surat project provides a lower-emission alternative to coal [International Business Times Australia, August 12, 2024].  

### 2.3.2 Government and Regulators  

Regulatory bodies and government officials have played a significant role in shaping Shell’s operations. The Australian Energy Market Operator warned of a looming gas supply crisis, reinforcing the importance of projects like the Surat Gas expansion in addressing potential shortfalls [The Australian, August 13, 2024]. However, in the UK, Shell faced regulatory setbacks, particularly with the Jackdaw gas field, which required reapplication for approval due to legal challenges over emissions considerations [The Australian, February 07, 2025].  

### 2.3.3 Environmental and Community Groups  

Environmental groups and local communities have expressed strong opposition to Shell’s fossil fuel projects. The expansion of the Surat Gas Project faced resistance from farming families and environmental activists concerned about its impact on water resources and emissions [Australian Financial Review, August 13, 2024]. Similarly, the Rosebank project in the UK was criticized by the British Energy Secretary, who described it as environmentally harmful and a misuse of taxpayer funds [The Australian, February 07, 2025].  

### 2.3.4 Industry Analysts and Market Observers  

Industry analysts have provided mixed assessments of Shell’s market positioning. While the expansion of the Surat Gas Project and exploration in the Taroom Trough were seen as crucial for addressing Australia’s gas supply challenges, analysts also noted that these efforts alone would not fully resolve anticipated shortfalls [Australian Financial Review, August 13, 2024]. In the UK, analysts viewed Shell’s joint venture with Equinor as a strategic move to consolidate its market position, despite regulatory and political challenges [The Australian, February 07, 2025].  

## 2.4. Implications and Future Outlook  

The media coverage suggests that Shell will continue to play a critical role in global and regional energy markets, particularly in natural gas production. The company’s investments in Australia’s Surat Gas Project and exploration in the Taroom Trough indicate a long-term commitment to securing gas supplies, despite environmental opposition and regulatory scrutiny [Australian Financial Review, September 10, 2024].  

In the UK, Shell’s joint venture with Equinor positions it as a dominant player in the North Sea, but legal and political challenges could impact its operations. The criticism of the Rosebank project and regulatory hurdles for the Jackdaw gas field highlight the growing pressure on fossil fuel companies to align with climate policies [The Australian, February 07, 2025].  

Looking ahead, Shell’s ability to navigate regulatory challenges, address environmental concerns, and maintain its market position will be crucial. The company’s focus on natural gas as a lower-emission alternative to coal suggests a strategic shift towards energy transition, but continued opposition from environmental groups and policymakers could shape its future investments and operations [The Australian, August 13, 2024].
