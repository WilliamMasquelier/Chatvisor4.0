San Cisco have been a band since 2009, releasing five albums and has establishing themselves as an Australian 
indie pop mainstay.
However, as part of their current tour, the Fremantle trio are visiting and performing in places they have never been.
"This is probably one of the most extensive regional runs that we've done," guitarist Josh Biondillo said.
"The Groovin' the Moo dates we were supposed to do were cancelled due to low ticket sales, and we decided to 
visit those same areas. And we thought that while we were in those areas, we might as well expand it." As the tour 
reaches its tail end, Biondillo said he and bandmates Jordi Davieson and Scarlett Stevens had been thrilled with the 
crowds they had played to.
"They don't get too many bands coming out that way, so when we rolled into the different towns, they really 
reciprocated with the enthusiasm and effort that it's taken for us to get there." San Cisco is playing three shows in 
Tasmania - one at Lonnies in the state's North on August 22, another at the Uni Bar in Hobart on August 23, and a 
final gig at The Forth Pub on August 24.
"We love Tasmania. We haven't been down there since Party In the Paddock in February," Biondillo said.
"I wish Tasmania was my second home." The band, which released fifth album Under The Light in March, will return 
to the state in January for the Good Gumnuts Festival in Burnie.
Other acts performing at the festival include Hockey Dad, Alex Lahey, Josh Pyke, Tia Gostelow and Pacific Avenue. 
Tickets are available for the band's forthcoming Tasmanian shows.
