Top NRL stars have helped raise almost $50,000 to bring the six-week premature baby of Jesse Ramien home 
from a Bali hospital to Australia.
The story has triggered more than 630 donations, with Ramien and fiancee Shell also being aided by the Cronulla 
Sharks and the NRL.
In a major development, the efforts of the Sharks and NRL to work with the Australian Embassy in Indonesia to fast-
track paperwork has proven promising, with the documentation crucial for baby Teo to be transported back to 
Australia.
Ramien and Shell remain desperate to co-ordinate a care flight for their medically induced baby boy Teo back to 
Australia at an estimated cost of $130,000.
Shavaun Hunt - the wife of Sharks forward Royce Hunt - organised a fundraising campaign, which prompted the 
NRL community to respond, far beyond Ramien's Cronulla.
Despite not having created the Go Fund Me page, some fans have questioned why the well-paid Sharks star would 
require financial assistance. Ramien, however, has made it clear where he stands.
"I'll play for nothing just to get our baby boy home safely," he said. Teo needed to be resuscitated for five minutes 
after being born six weeks premature at a Bali hospital last Friday night. Shell was 33 weeks pregnant when she 
left Sydney and had clearance from Shell's obstetrician and the airline, as well as travel insurance for her 
pregnancy. Shell went into early labour last Friday.
