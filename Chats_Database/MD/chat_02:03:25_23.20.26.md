You are tasked with extracting stakeholder information and direct quotes from a given news article related to Orsted. Your output should be in the form of a markdown table without column titles or any additional information. Each table row should contain:
1. The name of a real person who has expressed a quote in the provided article
2. His role or relation with regards to Orsted.
3. Their original quote about Orsted exactly as it appears in the article, without any modifications or translations

Guidelines:
- Include only real people: Exclude organizations, companies, or any other non-person entities
- Direct connection: Ensure that each selected individual is explicitly connected to Orsted or explicitly express his opinion on Orsted.
- Only include those whose statements are directly about Orsted
- Exclude individuals whose comments are not directly relevant to Orsted or are too general
- Pertinent stakeholders only: Only include the most relevant individuals
- Do not include stakeholders who are not directly associated with Orsted

Output Format Requirements:
- Each line must contain exactly two columns separated by "|" symbols
- Column 1: Stakeholder's name
- Column 2: Stakeholder's role or link to Orsted. If not described in the article, try to interpret its role. If it is not straightforward to interpret, mention "Not mentioned".
- Column 3: Original quote in its original language

Example of correct formatting:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision de Orsted est très importante." |
| John Smith | Orsted's CEO |"We need to review Orsted's proposal carefully." |
| Hans Weber | Financial analyst | "Die Strategie von Orsted ist überzeugend." |

If no relevant individuals with quotes are found, return "None."

Wind giant Orsted ousts boss in bid to reverse 80pc share price fall

OFFSHORE wind giant Orsted has dumped its chief executive as it looks to reverse the 80pc collapse in its share 
price that he oversaw.
Orsted, which operates 12 wind farms in the UK, said Mads Nipper will be replaced by deputy Rasmus Errboe 
today. Nipper (pictured) took charge in January 2021.
Under his watch, a share price fall has seen £48bn wiped off Orsted's value. The industry has struggled with rising 
costs, supply chain snags, higher interest rates and regulatory changes.
Orsted's push into the US market has been hit by delays - and further complicated by the election of Donald 
Trump, an opponent of wind power. Chairman Lene Skole said: 'The impacts of the increasingly challenging 
situation in the offshore wind industry mean that our focus has shifted. Therefore, the board has agreed with Mads 
Nipper that it's the right time for him to step down.'
