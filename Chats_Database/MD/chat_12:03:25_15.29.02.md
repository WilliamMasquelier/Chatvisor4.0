Daryl Killin holds a strongly negative stance towards Shell, criticizing the company for profiting from both carbon emissions and their solutions, demonstrating a consistent and unwavering view that highlights perceived hypocrisy; this sentiment, coming from a former executive in the carbon industry, could amplify skepticism towards Shellâ€™s sustainability efforts and damage its reputation among stakeholders concerned with corporate accountability.
