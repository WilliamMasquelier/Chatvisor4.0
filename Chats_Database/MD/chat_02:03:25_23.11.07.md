You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| Trond Westlie | CFO of Orsted | "Die neuen Vorstandsmitglieder bei Orsted sind von April 2024 an (v.l.) Trond Westlie (CFO) und Patrick Harnett (COO)" | "The new board members at Orsted from April 2024 are (l.r.) Trond Westlie (CFO) and Patrick Harnett (COO)." |
| Patrick Harnett | COO of Orsted | "Von Patrick Harnett erwartet Orsted, das neue Projekt-Betriebsmodell zum Erfolg zu führen." | "Orsted expects Patrick Harnett to lead the new project operating model to success." |
| Mads Nipper | CEO of Orsted | "Mads Nipper, der seit Anfang 2021 den Vorstandsvorsitz beim halbstaatlichen Energieunternehmen innehat." | "Mads Nipper, who has been the chairman of the board at the semi-state energy company since the beginning of 2021." |
| Rasmus Errboe | Executive Vice President of Orsted | "Rasmus Errboe leitete seither das Finanzressort." | "Rasmus Errboe has since led the finance department." |
| Andrew Brown | Interim COO of Orsted | "Interims-COO Andrew Brown, bislang Vorstandsmitglied von Orsted, zieht sich Ende März vollständig aus dem operativen Geschäft zurück." | "Interim COO Andrew Brown, who has been a board member of Orsted, will completely withdraw from operational business at the end of March." |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Orsted.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Orsted or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
