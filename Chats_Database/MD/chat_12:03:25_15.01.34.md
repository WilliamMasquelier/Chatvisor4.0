Returning to Cairns for the first time in two years, powerhouse indie-pop band San Cisco will kick off their regional 
tour Under The Lights with their Gilligan's debut on Thursday, May 9.
San Cisco singer and guitarist Jordi Davieson, who caught Covid on their last tour of Cairns, said he was looking 
forward to exploring the city ahead of the opening show.
"We've been to Cairns a few times. The last time we played at Tanks was in the middle of Covid times," Davieson 
said.
"We all got sick at different spots in the tour and I ended up getting caught in Cairns for a week." Although the band 
will have limited time in the Far North, Davieson said he was looking forward to taking in the ocean views.
"We're usually in a place for one day on tour, but we like to make the most of it wherever we can. I like to try and 
jump in the ocean if it's nearby and get a bit of vitamin D," he said.
Far North fans will be the first to experience San Cisco's latest hits live, with some crowd favourites.
"I think it's frustrating when a band comes to town after they release a new record and only play the new songs," he 
said.
"We're trying our best to play some of the new tracks, but also not forget about the bigger songs everyone loves 
and listens to, so it's going to be a mixed bag." One of the latest songs Mr Davieson is excited to bring to crowds for 
the first time is called One Percent.
"It's a song I've always liked and it's really fun to play. It's a new one that's going to be really good to play live," he 
said.
The tour marks their fifth studio album, Under the Lights, which was released on March 1. Tickets to San Cisco's 
show at Gilligan's are available via the Oztix website.
