Synthesize the following period analyses into an overall sentiment trajectory:
["The positive sentiment peak in Orsted's media coverage between July 24 and September 2, 2024, was primarily driven by significant advancements in offshore wind projects and technological innovations. A major boost came from Orsted securing contracts in the UK\u2019s latest green energy auction, including for its Hornsea 4 offshore wind farm, as part of a \u00a310 billion investment in renewable energy, which was hailed as a step towards meeting the UK\u2019s 2030 renewable targets (Proactive Investors, September 3, 2024; Les Echos, September 3, 2024). Additionally, Orsted's collaboration with scientists to study the environmental impact of offshore wind farms was positively received, reinforcing its commitment to sustainable energy development (The Independent, September 1, 2024). Another key driver was Orsted\u2019s successful deployment of heavy-lift cargo drones for offshore wind farm maintenance, significantly improving efficiency and safety, which was widely covered in European media (BN/DeStem, August 7, 2024; PZC, August 6, 2024). These developments collectively enhanced Orsted\u2019s public perception as a leader in renewable energy innovation and expansion, counterbalancing previous financial setbacks.", "The significant dip in sentiment regarding \u00d8rsted between December 27, 2024, and February 5, 2025, was driven by multiple negative developments. A major factor was the company's financial struggles, including substantial asset write-downs, particularly in the U.S. market, where \u00d8rsted faced rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory uncertainty under the Trump administration, which suspended new offshore wind leases (Les Echos, January 21, 2025; The Telegraph, January 31, 2025). The company announced a $1.7 billion write-down on its U.S. projects, leading to an 18% stock price drop (Het Financieele Dagblad, January 21, 2025). Additionally, \u00d8rsted's CEO, Mads Nipper, resigned amid mounting financial losses and an 80% decline in the company\u2019s share price since 2021 (The Independent, January 31, 2025; De Telegraaf, January 31, 2025). The company also faced local opposition in Germany, where a planned wind farm near Bad Orb encountered strong resistance from local businesses and politicians, leading to a broader debate on wind energy expansion (Energie & Management, January 29, 2025). These factors combined to create a highly negative media narrative, contributing to the observed sentiment dip."]

## Assistant

Ørsted's sentiment trajectory over the analyzed periods shows a sharp contrast between a peak in positive sentiment (July–September 2024) and a significant downturn (December 2024–February 2025).  

During mid-2024, Ørsted benefited from strong media coverage highlighting its advancements in offshore wind projects, successful contract acquisitions, and technological innovations, particularly in the UK. These developments reinforced its reputation as a leader in renewable energy, counterbalancing prior financial concerns.  

However, by late 2024 and early 2025, sentiment shifted dramatically due to financial struggles, including major asset write-downs in the U.S., supply chain disruptions, and regulatory challenges. The resignation of CEO Mads Nipper and a steep decline in Ørsted’s stock price further fueled negative media coverage. Additionally, local opposition to a wind project in Germany contributed to the worsening sentiment.  

Overall, Ørsted’s sentiment trajectory moved from a period of optimism and innovation-driven positivity to a sharp decline driven by financial instability, leadership changes, and regulatory hurdles.
