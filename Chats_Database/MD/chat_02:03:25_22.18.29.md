The company’s stock has already lost around 80% of its value since its peak in January 2021, representing a market capitalization loss of approximately €65 billion, half of which is borne by the Danish government, which holds a significant stake in the company.

- Ørsted’s stock price plummeted by 18% after the company announced significant asset write-downs totaling approximately €1.7 billion. The company cited rising interest rates in the U.S. as a key factor negatively impacting its capital costs, leading to a devaluation of its American assets. Additionally, Ørsted has had to write down further due to difficulties in developing several large offshore wind farms in the U.S. This financial hit has alarmed investors, further damaging Ørsted’s already struggling stock performance and raising concerns about the viability of its U.S. expansion strategy.

The opposition has gained significant traction, with local politicians, business leaders, and citizen groups rallying against the wind project. Opponents have launched an expensive media campaign, including full-page ads in major German and Danish newspapers, accusing Ørsted of disregarding local interests and threatening the region’s identity as a health and wellness destination. This resistance could lead to legal challenges and delays, complicating Ørsted’s efforts to expand its onshore wind portfolio in Germany. [Energie & Management, Manfred Fischer, January 20, 2025] - Ørsted has suffered a significant financial setback, announcing new asset impairments amounting to approximately 9% of its market capitalization.

[Les Echos, Nicolas Rauline, January 22, 2025] - Ørsted's CEO, Mads Nipper, has resigned following a series of major financial setbacks, including significant asset write-downs and a sharp decline in the company's stock price. Under his leadership, Ørsted's share value plummeted by 80%, reflecting investor concerns over the company's financial health and strategic direction. His departure signals instability at the top levels of management, raising questions about Ørsted’s ability to navigate the ongoing challenges in the offshore wind sector. [The Independent, Alex Daniel, January 31, 2025]

- Ørsted has suffered a massive financial impairment of $1.7 billion due to rising costs and regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. offshore wind market. The company had heavily invested in expanding its presence in the U.S., but policy changes under President Donald Trump, including the suspension of federal permits for new offshore wind projects, have rendered many of these investments unviable. This financial hit has further weakened Ørsted’s position in the U.S. renewable energy sector. [De Telegraaf, Theo Besteman, January 31, 2025]

- Ørsted has been forced to cut hundreds of jobs and withdraw from several international markets due to financial difficulties. The company has warned that it may build 1,500 fewer wind turbines than originally planned, which could slow the global transition to renewable energy. These drastic measures highlight the severe financial strain Ørsted is under and raise concerns about its long-term viability in the offshore wind industry.

- Ørsted’s offshore wind expansion strategy in the U.S. has turned into a financial disaster, with the company writing off €1.6 billion due to project delays and regulatory setbacks. The Sunrise Wind project, located off the coast of New York, has been particularly affected by supply chain disruptions and rising interest rates, leading to significant financial losses. This failure underscores the risks associated with large-scale offshore wind investments in an uncertain regulatory environment. [Lefigaro, Anonymous, January 31, 2025]

- Ørsted’s decision to expand aggressively into the U.S. offshore wind market has backfired, with the company now facing major financial losses and project cancellations. The return of Donald Trump to the presidency has resulted in a freeze on new offshore wind permits, effectively halting Ørsted’s expansion plans. The company has already written down €1.6 billion in assets and faces the possibility that key projects like Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind may never be completed.

Tijdens het trage vergunningsproces stegen de bouwkosten 
en kwam de businesscase niet langer uit. Ook was het onzeker of Ørsted Amerikaanse belastingvoordelen zou 
ontvangen. Het moest hier €4 mrd op afschrijven. Het bedrijf neemt tal van maatregelen om de kosten te 
drukken. Het keert tot 2025 geen dividend uit en ontsloeg achthonderd van de bijna negenduizend medewerkers.  
Nu vertrekt Nipper, ceo sinds 2021. 'Het is zoals de voetbaltrainer die moet vertrekken omdat het team slecht 
speelt. Het vertrouwen was weg, maar je kunt van zijn opvolger niet meteen wonderen verwachten', zegt Jansen. 
Dat is Rasmus Errboe, sinds 2012 werkzaam bij Ørsted en laatstelijk als chief commercial officer. Donderdag 
presenteert Ørsted jaarcijfers. De grote vraag is of het bedrijf in de VS blijft. Analistenbureau Bernstein berekende 
dat het beleid van Trump een koersverlies van €5 tot €9 zou betekenen. Daar zijn importheffingen, verlies van 
belastingvoordelen en, in het zwartste scenario, annuleringskosten van projecten in meegenomen. Dat is minder 
dan het koersverlies sinds de verkiezing van Trump: bijna €19.
'Nu de kosten en rente stijgen, zie je dat de offshore­windsector kwetsbaar is'

OFFSHORE wind giant Orsted has dumped its chief executive as it looks to reverse the 80pc collapse in its share 
price that he oversaw.
Orsted, which operates 12 wind farms in the UK, said Mads Nipper will be replaced by deputy Rasmus Errboe 
today. Nipper (pictured) took charge in January 2021.
Under his watch, a share price fall has seen £48bn wiped off Orsted's value. The industry has struggled with rising 
costs, supply chain snags, higher interest rates and regulatory changes.
Orsted's push into the US market has been hit by delays - and further complicated by the election of Donald 
Trump, an opponent of wind power. Chairman Lene Skole said: 'The impacts of the increasingly challenging 
situation in the offshore wind industry mean that our focus has shifted. Therefore, the board has agreed with Mads 
Nipper that it's the right time for him to step down.'

BRITAIN'S biggest offshore wind developer has replaced its chief executive as the global shift to net zero falters.
Orsted, which operates 12 offshore wind farms across the UK and has four more in development, said Mads 
Nipper, its chief executive, will step down with immediate effect.
Mr Nipper, who joined the Danish company in 2021, will be replaced by Rasmus Errboe, who currently serves as 
deputy chief executive and chief commercial officer.
Orsted is scrambling to turn around its fortunes as soaring costs and delays hamper the move to renewable energy 
sources. The company has taken a number of major writedowns in recent years and shares have tumbled more 
than 80pc from their peak in 2021.
Lene Skole, the chairman of Orsted, said: "The impacts on our business of the increasingly challenging situation in 
the offshore wind industry, ranging from supply chain bottlenecks, interest rate increases, to a changing regulatory 
landscape, mean that our focus has shifted. Therefore, the board has today agreed with Mads Nipper that it's the 
right time for him to step down and the board has appointed Rasmus Errboe to take over as chief executive."
The downturn has already forced Orsted, which is building the Hornsea 3 windfarm off the Norfolk coast, to cut 
hundreds of jobs and pull out of several international markets.
Orsted has warned of a significant fall in its wind farm output, meaning it could build 1,500 fewer turbines.
The upheaval led to the departure of the company's former chairman, finance chief and chief operating officer last 
year. Mr Nipper survived that cull, vowing to "fight with everything I've got" to restore investor confidence.

Offshore wind giant axes top boss as push for net zero stutters
But the company has taken a fresh blow as the outlook to the renewable energy sector darkens with the return of 
Donald Trump as US president. Mr
Trump, who has vowed to reverse the US policy on renewables and revert to oil and gas, has already signed an 
executive order suspending new leases for offshore wind. Orsted this month announced fresh writedowns of 
12.1bn Danish krone (£1.4bn) on its US business, which it blamed on rising interest rates and market uncertainties.
Mr Nipper said: "Leading Orsted through four challenging yet rewarding years has been a great privilege. Despite 
the obstacles we've faced, we've achieved many significant milestones, and I'm immensely proud of our colleagues' 
efforts and dedication."
Mr Errboe, who joined Orsted in 2012, said: "I'm looking forward to taking the lead on the transformation necessary 
to navigate the headwinds that Orsted and our industry currently face."
He added: "Offshore wind remains crucial for the green transition, and we're deeply committed to pursuing our 
vision of a world that runs entirely on green energy."

Het Deense energiebedrijf Orsted, een van Europa's grootste duurzame energieconcerns, heeft zijn topman Mads 
Nipper aan de kant geschoven vanwege de erbarmelijke resultaten van de afgelopen jaren. Het bedrijf zette enkele 
jaren geleden de transitie van fossiel naar duurzaam in en ontwikkelde zich daarna tot 's werelds grootste 
producent van windstroom op zee. Sinds 2021, toen de beurskoers even hoog was gestegen als veel van de 
reuzenwindturbines die het concern liet bouwen, heeft het aandeel Orsted volgens berekeningen van Reuters 83 
procent van zijn waarde verloren.
Na de pandemie en de Russische inval in Oekraïne kampte Orsted net als de rest van de Europese windsector 
met hoge rentes, dure grondstoffen en kostbaar personeel. Waar veel reguliere energieconcerns weer meer 
aandacht kregen voor fossiele brandstoffen en daar flink aan verdienden, stapelde Orsted verlies op verlies. De 
afgelopen weken volgde een nieuwe dreun, nadat de Amerikaanse president Donald Trump zijn banvloek had 
uitgesproken over Amerikaanse offshore windenergie. Orsted zag zich gedwongen een afschrijving op zijn 
Amerikaanse activiteiten te plegen van 1,7 miljard dollar (1,6 miljard euro). Daarop verloor de beurskoers nog eens 
17 procent.
Ook heeft Orsted zijn plannen in de koelkast gezet voor investeringen ter waarde van 20 miljard dollar in de 
Amerikaanse windsector. Nieuwe windparken op zee zijn voor de Verenigde Staten voorlopig niet meer aan de 
orde. Nipper kwam steeds meer onder vuur te liggen, ook vanuit de eigen organisatie. 'De raad van bestuur is 
vandaag met Mads overeengekomen dat dit het juiste moment is voor hem om af te treden', aldus een verklaring 
die Orsted vrijdag uitbracht. Hij wordt vervangen door financieel directeur Rasmus Errboe. Nipper liet vrijdag weten 
dat hij gepassioneerd blijft over het idee de wereld volledig te laten draaien op duurzame energie. Orsted laat 
weten dat het vanwege de uitdagende situatie rond windenergie zijn focus heeft verlegd. Waarheen de nieuwe 
koers leidt, laat het bedrijf in het ongewisse.

Danish energy company and the world's largest offshore wind farm developer Orsted is cutting investments by 
25%.
Orsted recently changed management and announced that it would cut planned investments by 25% by 2030, the 
Financial Times reports.
Orsted is still trying to recover from the effects of its expansion in the US, where it ran into major problems in 2023.
Orsted's new management now wants to raise the company's shares again and is trying to adapt to the changed 
business climate.
Under Orsted's previous CEO, Mads Nipper, the company's shares fell by almost 80% due to rising interest rates 
and the end of the green stock boom. The company's business was further disrupted by global supply disruptions, 
and Orsted has abandoned several projects in recent years.
Over the past decade, Orsted has transformed itself into a renewable energy company, having previously operated 
primarily in the fossil fuel market.
Some other renewable energy developers are also setting less ambitious targets. For example, Orsted shareholder 
and Norwegian state energy company Equinor announced that it would lower its renewable energy targets and 
increase oil and gas production by 10%. (Afn.by)

Ørsted shares were blown almost 5% higher on Thursday after the offshore wind turbine maker announced a 25% 
cut in investment after markets closed last night.
The Danish giant released an updated business plan where it cut planned capital expenditure for the next five years 
in order to avoid raising funds from a share issue, with its shares having more than halved over the past two years 
to return to levels last seen in early 2017.
It cut its 2026 underlying profit guidance 3% and reiterated the reinstatement of dividend is still expected next year.
CEO Rasmus Errboe said investment was being reduced via "a stricter, more value-focused approach to capital 
allocation... to ensure a stronger balance sheet, supporting a solid investment grade rating, and to ensure that we 
only invest our capital in the most financially attractive opportunities".
The cutting back will not affect the work on the 9 gigawatts of renewable projects that Ørsted is currently 
constructing, the company stressed, with a construction portfolio that has 'line of sight' to an expansion of 
renewable capacity from 18 GW to more than 27 GW.
Errboe said the "number one priority throughout the next three years" will be to deliver on this committed offshore 
wind construction programme.
"The market remains challenging, but delivering on this programme will solidify our position as the undisputed 
global leader in offshore wind."

Der auch in Deutschland aktive dänische Offshorewind-Riese Orsted schreibt nach hohen Verlusten im Jahr 2023 
wieder schwarze Zahlen. Der Gewinn für 2024 liegt im erwarteten Rahmen.
Orsted weist wieder Gewinn aus. Das Jahr 2024 beendet der weltgrößte Betreiber von Offshore-Windparks mit 
rund 2,2 Milliarden Euro auf der Habenseite. Das aktuelle Ergebnis der Dänen ist auch eine Folge von 
Kurskorrekturen und Änderungen im Management nach einem desaströsen Jahr 2023 mit 2,7 Milliarden Euro 
Verlust.
Das seit Februar von CEO Rasmus Errboe geführte Unternehmen lenkt in einer Mitteilung vom 6. Februar den Blick 
besonders auf das operative Geschäft (Ebitda). Dieses war auch 2023 noch positiv verlaufen (2,5 Milliarden Euro), 
das Gesamtminus war damals auf das Konto von Abschreibungen auf aufgegebene Offshore-Projekte in den USA 
und Wertberichtigungen gegangen. Der operative Gewinn liegt jetzt bei 4,3 Milliarden Euro (plus 1,8 Milliarden 
Euro).
In diesen Bereich fallen allerdings auch Einnahmen aus Rückstellungen, die Orsted nach dem Aus von Projekten 
auflösen konnte. Dies sind für 2024 rund 1 Million Euro. Ohne Erlöse aus neue Partnerschaften und 
Rücktrittskosten kommen die Dänen auf ein Ebitda von etwa 3,3 Milliarden Euro und damit 700 Millionen Euro 
höher als 2023. Der Wert liege genau im Rahmen der Erwartungen, die mit 3,2 Milliarden bis 3,4 Milliarden Euro 
beziffert waren.
Die Erträge aus dem Offshore-Segment entwickelten sich leicht positiv auf 3,2 Milliarden Euro, der Anstieg beträgt 
knapp eine halbe Milliarde Euro. Orsted schreibt dies vor allem den neu in Betrieb genommenen 
Meereswindfarmen in Taiwan, in den USA und in der deutschen Nordsee zu (Gode Wind 3, nordwestlich der Insel 
Norderney).
Page 2 of 2
Kurskorrektur bei Orsted bringt die erwarteten Ergebnisse
Abgesagte und verzögerte Meereswindparks vor den USA, erschwerte Bedingungen für die Windindustrie und die 
Aufgabe der E-Fuels-Produktion hatten Orsted zu einer einschneidenden Kurskorrektur veranlasst (wir 
berichteten). Vom Ausbaupfad bis 2030, der auf eine installierte Leistung von 50.000 MW hinauslaufen sollte, sind 
noch rund 38.000 MW übrig. Damit ist aus dem Erneuerbaren-Ziel ein sattes Viertel herausgeschnitten.

Mitsubishi herziet plannen voor drie Japanse windparken
Van Oord ondersteunde Mitsubishi al in de beginfase
Orla McDonald
Amsterdam
Mitsubishi heroverweegt de bouw van drie grote windparken voor de kust van Japan. Een grote opdracht voor het 
Nederlandse Van Oord staat daardoor onder druk. De maritiem dienstverlener won in 2022 het contract voor de 
ontwikkeling van de offshoreparken. 
Gisterochtend maakte Mitsubishi bekend dat het 52,2 mrd yen (€330 mln) moet afschrijven op de parken. Ook 
worden de bouwplannen 'herzien vanwege economische veranderingen'. De markt voor offshorewind is veranderd 
na de corona- en energiecrisis, door inflatie, een krappe toeleveringsketen en stijgende rentes, zegt Mitsubishi. Ook 
Chubu, een groot Japans energiebedrijf, kondigt een afschrijving aan op de parken van 18 mrd yen (€110 mln).  
Van Oord ontwikkelt de Japanse parken met een van zijn installatieschepen. Het levert alle ondersteunende 
componenten die nodig zijn voor de bouw, behalve de windturbines. Van Oord doet dat in een joint venture met de 
grootste bouwgroep van Japan, Kajima. Het is de eerste klus van dit formaat in Japan, zei het bedrijf in 2022. Van 
Oord heeft Mitsubishi ondersteund in de beginfase van de projecten, maar de daadwerkelijke bouw moet nog van 
start gaan. Hoeveel het contract waard is en of Van Oord een annuleringboete heeft bedongen, is niet bekend. Van 
Oord wil geen commentaar geven en verwijst naar Mitsubishi.  De dochteronderneming van de Japanse automaker 
kondigde in 2021 de bouw aan van twee parken in Noord-Japan en één voor de kust van Tokio. Eén van de

noordelijk gelegen parken moet het grootste windpark van Japan worden. Samen hebben zij een vermogen van 1,7 
GW, ongeveer net zo groot als het grootste offshorewindpark in Nederland. Oplevering was gepland uiterlijk 2030. 
'Op dit moment is het niet mogelijk om iets te zeggen over de opleverdatum of de start van de bouw', zei ceo 
Katsuya Nakanishi gisteren tegenover persbureau Reuters.  De offshorewindsector staat al langer onder druk. 
Equinor, het Noorse oliebedrijf dat ook in wind investeert, kondigde gisteren aan zijn investeringen in hernieuwbare 
energie te halveren.

- Ørsted has suffered a significant financial setback due to the slow permitting process in the U.S., which led to rising construction costs and uncertainty over tax benefits. As a result, the company was forced to write off €4 billion on its U.S. projects. To mitigate financial losses, Ørsted has implemented drastic cost-cutting measures, including suspending dividend payments until at least 2025 and laying off 800 employees. These actions reflect the severe financial strain the company is under and raise concerns about its long-term viability in the U.S. market.

- Ørsted’s CEO, Mads Nipper, has been ousted after overseeing an 80% collapse in the company’s share price, which resulted in £48 billion being wiped off its market value. The company has struggled with rising costs, supply chain disruptions, higher interest rates, and regulatory changes, particularly in the U.S. market. The leadership change signals a desperate attempt to restore investor confidence, but it also highlights the instability at the top levels of management.

- Ørsted has been forced to cut hundreds of jobs and withdraw from several international markets due to financial difficulties. The company has also warned that it may build 1,500 fewer wind turbines than originally planned, which could slow the global transition to renewable energy. These drastic measures highlight the severe financial strain Ørsted is under and raise concerns about its long-term viability in the offshore wind industry.

- Ørsted has announced fresh writedowns of 12.1 billion Danish kroner (£1.4 billion) on its U.S. business, citing rising interest rates and market uncertainties. This latest financial blow follows a series of impairments and project cancellations, further eroding investor confidence. The company’s stock has already lost more than 80% of its value since its peak in 2021, reflecting deep concerns about its financial stability.

- Ørsted’s offshore wind expansion strategy in the U.S. has turned into a financial disaster, with the company writing off €1.6 billion due to project delays and regulatory setbacks. The Sunrise Wind project, located off the coast of New York, has been particularly affected by supply chain disruptions and rising interest rates, leading to significant financial losses. This failure underscores the risks associated with large-scale offshore wind investments in an uncertain regulatory environment. [de Volkskrant, Bard van de Weijer, February 01, 2025]

- Ørsted’s decision to expand aggressively into the U.S. offshore wind market has backfired, with the company now facing major financial losses and project cancellations. The return of Donald Trump to the presidency has resulted in a freeze on new offshore wind permits, effectively halting Ørsted’s expansion plans. The company has already written down €1.6 billion in assets and faces the possibility that key projects like Sunrise Wind and Revolution Wind may never be completed.

- Ørsted’s stock price has plummeted by 80% from its peak in 2021 due to a combination of rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory uncertainty. The company’s financial troubles have been exacerbated by inflation, higher interest rates, and difficulties in securing long-term contracts for its renewable energy projects. These challenges have forced Ørsted to scale back its ambitions and reconsider its investment strategy. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Orla Mcdonald, February 01, 2025]

- Ørsted has announced a 25% reduction in planned investments by 2030 as part of its efforts to recover from financial difficulties. The company’s previous CEO, Mads Nipper, oversaw an 80% decline in share value due to rising interest rates and the end of the green stock boom. This drastic cut in investment raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to maintain its leadership in the offshore wind sector and meet its renewable energy targets. [Business World Agency, Anonymous, February 06, 2025]

- Ørsted has been forced to abandon several offshore wind projects due to financial difficulties, leading to a significant reduction in its renewable energy capacity targets. The company had originally planned to install 50 GW of capacity by 2030 but has now scaled this back to 38 GW, effectively cutting a quarter of its expansion plans. This retreat from its ambitious goals raises concerns about the company’s ability to contribute to the global transition to renewable energy.
