The spike in media coverage for Shell during the week ending June 23, 2024, appears to be driven by the company's public advocacy for regulatory reforms in Australia's energy sector. According to the article excerpt, Shell's country chair, Cecile Wake, spoke at *The Australian's* Energy Nation Forum, calling for a more streamlined and consistent regulatory framework across state and national energy regimes. Her comments highlighted concerns about regulatory bottlenecks and environmental planning delays that could slow down energy projects, including both traditional and renewable energy developments.  

This public stance on energy policy, particularly from a major foreign investor like Shell, likely attracted media attention due to its implications for the broader energy industry, government policy, and investment in Australia. The discussion around regulatory efficiency and project approvals is a significant issue in the energy sector, and Shell's involvement in this debate would have contributed to the increased media focus during this period.
