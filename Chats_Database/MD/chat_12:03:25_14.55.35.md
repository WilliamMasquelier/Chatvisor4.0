Let the good times roll as Andrew McConnell shares one of Supernormal's most popular menu items.
"CHEFS DON'T GET TO PICK their signature dish," says Andrew McConnell of Melbourne's Trader House 
restaurant group. "The customers decide what dish is their go-to." Over the past 10 years, the legions of customers 
at his modern Asian diner, Supernormal, have decided that their go-to is the New England lobster roll.
And why wouldn't they? The buttery, toasted brioche bun encloses the sweetness of lobster, the tang of shallot, the 
pepper of watercress and the richness of Japanese mayonnaise cut with lemon and mustard.
"It's an electric collision of fast food and luxury," says McConnell, who shares the recipe with AFR Magazine below. 
"The perfect balance of sweet, salt and fat."
So it was a no-brainer for the chef and restaurateur to know what to pack for the Brisbane opening of Supernormal 
in July.
"Something old and something new," he says. The much-loved crispy, salt-cured, twice-cooked duck with steamed 
buns joins the lobster roll in Brisbane, while a new dish of hand-rolled noodles tossed with sweet spanner crab meat 
and a rich, vibrant oil made from the bones of the crab is purposebuilt for Brisbane dining. "The climate is so diff 
erent to Melbourne," says McConnell, "and we really want to connect with that."
This is the fi rst move outside Melbourne for McConnell and partner Jo McGann, and they're blown away by the big 
Brizzie welcome. "We really feel we're in the right place at the right time," says McConnell.
"The stars are all lining up for Brisbane."
Including one very famous lobster roll.
Supernormal, 443 Queen Street, Brisbane.
