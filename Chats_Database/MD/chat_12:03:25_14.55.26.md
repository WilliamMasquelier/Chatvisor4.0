Give that leftover bread a new lease of life by transforming the odds and ends into breadcrumbs that will elevate 
your midweek meals with an extra sprinkle of deliciousness
BRUSSELS SPROUT GRATIN WITH MACADAMIA CRUMB SERVES 4-6 You'll need a large flameproof baking 
dish or frypan.
200g smoked streaky bacon, cut into matchsticks 1kg brussels sprouts, halved lengthways if large Sea salt and 
freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup (125ml) vino cotto (see note), plus extra, to drizzle (optional) Finely grated 
pecorino, to serve MACADAMIA CRUMB 60g butter, chopped 1 tbs each finely chopped rosemary and thyme, plus 
extra fried rosemary sprigs, to serve 1 cup (100g) roughly chopped macadamias 80g stale wholemeal sourdough 
bread, torn into small pieces Preheat the oven to 240Â°C/220Â°C fan-forced.
Heat a large flameproof baking dish or frypan over medium heat. Add the bacon and cook for 4-5 minutes, tossing 
frequently, until it's lightly golden and the fat has melted. Add the brussels sprouts and cook, tossing, for 2-3 
minutes until they're coated in bacon fat. Season with the salt and pepper. Drizzle with the vino cotto and roast in 
the oven for 20-25 minutes, until the sprouts are lightly golden and cooked, but still have some crunch. Meanwhile, 
to make the crumb, heat a medium frypan over high heat. Add the butter, and when it begins to foam, add the 
remaining ingredients and cook, tossing frequently, for 3-4 minutes, until golden. Season to taste. To serve, place 
the sprouts in the centre of the table and scatter with the macadamia crumb and extra rosemary sprigs. Drizzle with 
the extra vino cotto, if desired.
NOTE This dish can be served hot or at room temperature. Vino cotto, which translates to "cooked wine" in Italian, 
is a traditional Italian condiment made by slowly cooking grape must (the freshly crushed grape juice, including 
skins, seeds and stems) until it reduces to a thick, syrupy consistency. This process caramelises the sugars in the 
grape juice, resulting in a sweet and slightly tangy flavour profile with nuances of dried fruit and spices. Vino cotto is 
available from selected supermarkets and specialty grocers.

serve RICOTTA FILLING 500g firm ricotta 60g fresh breadcrumbs 21/2 tbs finely chopped preserved lemon rind, 
plus extra, thinly sliced, to serve 21/2 tbs finely chopped basil
Preheat the oven to 220Â°C/200Â°C fan-forced.
Grease a 2.25L baking dish.
Cook the pasta for 2 minutes less than the packet instructions, then drain and rinse under cold water. Set aside.
Meanwhile, to make the ricotta filling, place all the ingredients in a bowl and mix to combine.
Season to taste. Stuff each pasta shell with the ricotta filling and refrigerate until ready to use.
Heat the oil in a large frypan over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to low and add the bay leaves, onion, garlic 
and salami, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes, or until the onion is softened. Gradually stir in the sugo 
until combined. Transfer the sauce to the prepared dish and top with the pasta shells. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until 
golden. To serve, place the dish on a wooden board and scatter with the fried basil leaves.
NOTE If you have leftover cooked shells, simply place them on the bottom of the dish and top with the stuffed pasta 
shells, then bake.
Sugo semplice translates in Italian to "simple sauce". We used Mutti Sugo Semplice with basil.
It's available from selected supermarkets and specialty grocers. You can make the ricotta stuffing up to 3 days 
ahead. Keep it stored in an airtight container in the fridge. You can also fill the pasta shells a day in advance.
