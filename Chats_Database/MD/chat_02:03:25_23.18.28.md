You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| John Kerry | U.S. Special Climate Envoy | "Sans les profits tirés du pétrole et du gaz, rien n’est possible." | "Without the profits from oil and gas, nothing is possible." |
| Not mentioned | Not mentioned | "Que le pétrolier norvégien Equinor se soit porté au secours ­d’Orsted en prenant 9,8 % de son capital illustre ce paradoxe et la difficulté d’accélérer la décarbonation – pourtant vitale – de l’énergie." | "That the Norwegian oil company Equinor came to the rescue of Orsted by taking 9.8% of its capital illustrates this paradox and the difficulty of accelerating the decarbonization – which is vital – of energy." |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Orsted.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Orsted or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
