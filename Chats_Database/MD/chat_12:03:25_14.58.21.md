Energy giant Shell is suing Woodside Energy and Paladin Resources for $86.6m for the clean-up bill for the 
Northern Endeavour oil platform, saying it struck agreements almost two decades ago which absolved it of any 
responsibility to pay for remediation costs.
The question of who should pay to remediate Northern Endeavour, on Western Australia's North West Shelf, and 
abandoned oil and gas projects more broadly, prompted the Morrison government to introduce new laws to protect 
taxpayers from having to foot the bill, should operators not be able to meet their obligations.
Woodside had sold the platform to junior operator Timor Sea Oil and Gas Australia (TSOGA) in July 2015. The 
junior operator was forced to shut down production over a safety issue and subsequently went into voluntary 
administration.
There were fears the federal government would have to step in and bear the cost of the clean-up, with the Morrison 
government at one point floating the idea of a $250m-plus industry levy to pay for it.
Instead new rules around trailing liability provisions were introduced. These could slug former owners of the licence 
areas with the bills, thereby putting the onus on them to do adequate due diligence should the assets change 
hands.
"The trailing liability provisions will be an action of last resort when all other safeguards have been exhausted and 
will reduce the risk that the financial costs of decommissioning will be left to Australian taxpayers," the then-
resources minister Keith Pitt said at the time.
"It also sets the expectation that sellers will undertake appropriate due diligence before selling assets, titles and 
infrastructure, so they can avoid being called back to decommission and remediate title areas." The exploration 
permit in the current matter was granted to Woodside, Shell and BHP Billiton Petroleum in 1997, with Woodside 
owning a half-share and the other two companies one-quarter each.

Shell sues Woodside over $86m oil platform clean-up
Production from the Laminaria and Corallina oilfields began in 1999. The writ filed with Western Australia's 
Supreme Court says Shell then sold two-thirds of its interest to Woodside in March 2005, and one-third to British 
company Paladin.
Shell says in its claim that the agreement with each company "expressly provided ... that Woodside/Paladin is liable 
for all environmental, abandonment, re-clam-ation, remediation and restoration claims".
The claim says following the failure of TSOGA, neither that company nor its liquidator made any efforts to remediate 
the platform.
"Thereafter the Commonwealth has commenced the process of decommissioning the Northern Endeavour and 
seabed infrastructure," the claim says.
Shell says it received notices of assessment in January 2023 and 2024, for $42.3m and $44.3m respectively, but 
says Woodside and Paladin are liable for those payments under the agreements struck in 2005.
Shell says it wrote to both companies in February last year and March this year, but Woodside denied liability for 
both payments via letter, while Paladin also refused to pay.
Shell is seeking the $86.6m in accrued payments to date, and "A declaration that Woodside/Paladin must 
indemnify Shell for, and hold it harmless against, any or all of the amounts for which Shell is in the future held to be 
liable to the Australian Taxation Office under the Offshore Petroleum Levy Act, plus all costs reasonably incurred by 
Shell with respect to that liability, including legal costs of and associated with this action." Woodside has been 
contacted for comment.

1. Shell is pursuing legal action against Woodside Energy and Paladin Resources for $86.6 million, claiming that previous agreements from 2005 absolve it of responsibility for the clean-up costs associated with the Northern Endeavour oil platform.

2. The case highlights the broader issue of liability for decommissioning abandoned oil and gas projects in Australia, prompting the Morrison government to introduce new laws aimed at protecting taxpayers from bearing the financial burden of such clean-ups.

3. Shell's claim indicates that Woodside and Paladin are liable for environmental remediation costs, as stipulated in their agreements, following the failure of the junior operator Timor Sea Oil and Gas Australia (TSOGA) to manage the platform.

4. The legal dispute underscores the importance of due diligence in asset transfers within the oil and gas sector, as new regulations now hold former owners accountable for decommissioning costs, potentially impacting future transactions in the industry.
