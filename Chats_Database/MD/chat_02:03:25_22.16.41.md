Previous summaries: - Ørsted has announced the suspension of its dividend payments until at least 2025, marking a significant shift in its financial strategy. The company had been consistently increasing shareholder payouts since 2016, but due to financial struggles, it has decided to halt these payments to focus on investments without raising additional capital. This move could negatively impact investor confidence and stock performance, as dividends are a key attraction for shareholders. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- The company has suffered a major financial setback, reporting an EBITDA of 18.7 billion Danish kroner (€2.5 billion) for 2023, which is below its projected range of 20-23 billion kroner. A significant portion of this shortfall is attributed to a 9.6 billion kroner provision for cancellation costs related to the termination of the Ocean Wind 1 project in the U.S. This financial underperformance highlights the challenges Ørsted faces in managing its offshore wind projects profitably. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has decided to cut its renewable energy project targets by at least 24%, reducing its planned capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This reduction signals a retreat from its previous ambitious expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The company is also exiting several emerging offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, limiting its future growth opportunities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- The company is implementing significant job cuts, with up to 800 positions being eliminated globally. The first phase will see 250 layoffs in the coming months. These job losses reflect the financial strain Ørsted is under and could have negative social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted’s market capitalization has plummeted by more than 70% since its peak in early 2021, when it was valued at over €76.5 billion. The company, once the third-largest utility in Europe, now ranks 14th in the sector, with a market value of just €16 billion. This dramatic decline underscores the financial instability and investor concerns surrounding the company. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has incurred massive financial losses, posting around £2.2 billion in losses for 2023. The company has also written off £3.3 billion from its wind farm business, reflecting the severe financial difficulties it faces. These losses are largely due to the abandonment of several offshore wind projects in the U.S., which resulted in billions in impairments. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]

- The company’s financial struggles have forced it to scale back offshore wind projects, which could result in the construction of 1,500 fewer wind turbines than originally planned. This reduction in capacity could slow the expansion of renewable energy infrastructure and impact global climate goals. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted’s chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, is stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company’s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 07, 2024]

- The company has faced significant challenges in the U.S. market, particularly in securing tax credits for its offshore wind projects. Last year, Ørsted canceled two major offshore wind projects, Ocean Wind I and II, due to rising costs, resulting in a financial hit of 28.4 billion Danish kroner (£3.3 billion). These cancellations highlight the financial and regulatory difficulties of expanding renewable energy in the U.S. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for the company to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]

- The company’s financial troubles have led analysts to speculate that it may need to seek additional funding from investors. However, instead of raising capital, Ørsted has opted for cost-cutting measures, which could prolong financial uncertainty and increase risks for the company’s future stability. [The Guardian, Alex Lawson, February 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has been forced to implement a drastic austerity plan, including a comprehensive review of its project portfolio. The company is prioritizing projects with the highest potential returns while reducing risks in development and execution. This shift in strategy indicates a retreat from aggressive expansion and a more cautious approach to investment. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024]

- The company’s decision to exit key offshore wind markets, including Spain, Portugal, and Norway, as well as to deprioritize certain activities in Japan, represents a significant contraction of its global footprint. This retreat could weaken its competitive position in the rapidly growing offshore wind sector. [Les Echos, Sharon Wajsbrot, February 07, 2024] - Ørsted has suffered a massive financial loss, reporting a net loss of 2.7 billion euros for 2023. This marks a significant downturn from the previous year when the company had recorded a profit of approximately 2 billion euros. The losses stem largely from the cancellation of major offshore wind projects in the U.S., including Ocean Wind 1 and 2, which resulted in impairments of 3.8 billion euros. Additionally, the company has set aside 1.5 billion euros in provisions for potential compensation payments related to these canceled projects. This financial instability raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to sustain its aggressive expansion strategy in the renewable energy sector. [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]

- Ørsted has been forced to implement drastic cost-cutting measures, including the elimination of 600 to 800 jobs worldwide. This decision is part of a broader austerity plan aimed at reducing fixed costs by 130 million euros by 2026. The job cuts will have significant social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities, further highlighting the financial strain the company is under. [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]

- The company has announced a suspension of dividend payments until at least 2025, a move that could negatively impact investor confidence. Ørsted had previously been a reliable dividend payer, making this decision a major shift in its financial strategy. The suspension reflects the company’s urgent need to preserve capital amid mounting financial losses, but it may also deter investors who rely on dividends for returns. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]

- Ørsted’s market value has plummeted by 70% over the past three years, reflecting a severe loss of investor confidence. The company, once a leader in the offshore wind sector, has seen its stock price decline sharply due to financial struggles, project cancellations, and rising costs. This decline in market capitalization raises concerns about Ørsted’s long-term viability and its ability to attract new investments. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]

- The company has been forced to scale back its renewable energy ambitions, reducing its planned offshore wind capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This represents a significant retreat from its previous expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The reduction in capacity means fewer wind turbines will be built, potentially impacting the broader offshore wind industry. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024]

- Ørsted has exited several key offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, as part of its cost-cutting strategy. This retreat limits the company’s future growth opportunities and weakens its competitive position in the rapidly expanding offshore wind sector. The decision to withdraw from these markets reflects the financial pressures Ørsted is facing and its need to focus on more profitable projects. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024]

- The company has incurred significant financial losses due to the cancellation of major offshore wind projects in the U.S. The abandonment of Ocean Wind 1 and 2 alone resulted in a financial hit of 3.7 billion euros. These cancellations were driven by rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and higher interest rates, which made the projects financially unviable. The failure to complete these projects raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. [de Volkskrant, Marc van Den Eerenbeemt, February 08, 2024]

- Ørsted’s financial struggles have forced it to sell off assets worth 15 billion euros in an effort to stabilize its balance sheet. This asset divestment strategy indicates the severity of the company’s financial difficulties and its need to generate liquidity. However, selling off key assets could weaken Ørsted’s long-term growth potential and reduce its influence in the offshore wind sector. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]

- The company has been severely impacted by inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising interest rates, which have significantly increased the costs of its wind farm projects. These economic pressures have made it more difficult for Ørsted to maintain profitability and execute its renewable energy plans effectively. The combination of these factors has contributed to the company’s financial downturn and forced it to reassess its investment strategy. [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024]

- Ørsted’s leadership has been in turmoil, with its chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, stepping down in March after nearly a decade in the role. His departure follows the resignation of two senior executives in November, indicating potential instability in the company’s leadership. Frequent leadership changes can create uncertainty and disrupt strategic planning, further complicating Ørsted’s efforts to recover from its financial difficulties. [The Daily Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, February 08, 2024] - Ørsted experienced a leadership crisis in late 2023, with the abrupt dismissal of its Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Daniel Lerup and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Richard Hunter following a disastrous financial year. The company suffered a massive loss of €2.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to high write-offs from abandoned offshore wind projects on the U.S. East Coast. This leadership shake-up reflects the severity of Ørsted’s financial struggles and raises concerns about stability at the top levels of management. Frequent executive turnover can disrupt strategic planning and investor confidence. [Energie & Management, Volker Stephan, February 27, 2024]

- Ørsted has been forced to divest a significant stake in its U.S. onshore wind farms, selling off equity ownership in four wind farms with a total capacity of 957 MW for approximately $300 million. This marks the company’s second major asset divestment in the U.S., highlighting its need to generate liquidity amid financial difficulties. While Ørsted retains operational control, the sale indicates that the company is struggling to maintain its ambitious renewable energy expansion without offloading assets. Such divestments could weaken its long-term market position in the U.S. renewable energy sector. [Nordic Business Report, Anonymous, March 13, 2024]

- Ørsted and other offshore wind developers faced significant financial challenges in 2023, leading to the cancellation of multiple projects in the U.S. Northeast. High inflation, supply chain disruptions, and rising costs of capital and building materials made these projects financially unviable. These cancellations represent a major setback for Ørsted’s U.S. expansion strategy and could slow the overall growth of offshore wind energy in the country. The inability to complete these projects raises concerns about the company’s financial resilience and its capacity to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. [The Independent, Jennifer McDermott, March 14, 2024] There are no negative issues found related to Ørsted in the provided articles. - Ørsted has decided to exit the French renewable energy market by selling its wind and solar assets to Engie. This move is part of a broader strategy to scale back its ambitions and focus on markets where it sees higher value potential. However, this retreat from France signals financial distress and a lack of confidence in its ability to compete in the region. The company had already suffered a significant financial loss of 2.7 billion euros in 2023, largely due to setbacks in the U.S. market. This withdrawal could weaken Ørsted’s position in the European renewable energy sector and limit its future growth opportunities. [Le Figaro, Elsa Bembaron, April 29, 2024] - Ørsted has decided to exit the French renewable energy market by selling its wind and solar assets to Engie. This move is part of a broader strategy to scale back its ambitions and focus on markets where it sees higher value potential. However, this retreat from France signals financial distress and a lack of confidence in its ability to compete in the region. The company had already suffered a significant financial loss of 2.7 billion euros in 2023, largely due to setbacks in the U.S. market. This withdrawal could weaken Ørsted’s position in the European renewable energy sector and limit its future growth opportunities. [El Economista, Rubén Esteller, April 29, 2024]

- Ørsted’s stock price has plummeted by more than 50% since late 2021, reflecting a severe loss of investor confidence. The company, once a leader in the offshore wind sector, has seen its market value decline sharply due to financial struggles, project cancellations, and rising costs. This decline in market capitalization raises concerns about Ørsted’s long-term viability and its ability to attract new investments. The company’s financial troubles have made it a less attractive option for institutional investors, further exacerbating its difficulties. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, June 01, 2024]

- Ørsted was forced to cancel two major offshore wind projects in New Jersey in October 2023, citing financial infeasibility. These cancellations represent a major setback for the company’s U.S. expansion strategy and could slow the overall growth of offshore wind energy in the country. The failure to complete these projects raises concerns about Ørsted’s financial resilience and its capacity to manage large-scale offshore wind developments profitably. The company had been far along in the approval process before abruptly scrapping the projects, which may damage its reputation with regulators and investors. [The Independent, Wayne Parry, July 17, 2024] - Ørsted has been forced to cancel its flagship green fuel factory, the FlagshipONE project in Sweden, due to a lack of demand for e-methanol. The project was intended to supply container ships with 55,000 tonnes of methanol annually, contributing to the global transition away from fossil fuels. However, the company was unable to secure long-term contracts at viable prices, leading to a financial impairment of 1.5 billion Danish kroner (£172 million). This cancellation highlights the challenges Ørsted faces in diversifying beyond offshore wind and raises concerns about the viability of large-scale green fuel projects. The decision also reflects broader struggles in the renewable energy sector, as other energy majors have similarly scaled back ambitious projects. [Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 15, 2024]

- Ørsted has suffered another financial setback with a 2.1 billion Danish kroner impairment at its Revolution Wind project near Martha’s Vineyard, off the U.S. East Coast. The delay in constructing the onshore substation has pushed the commercial operation date from 2025 to 2026, leading to additional financial losses. This delay follows the company’s earlier cancellations of two major offshore wind projects in New Jersey, Ocean Wind I and II, which had already resulted in significant financial impairments. The repeated project delays and cancellations raise concerns about Ørsted’s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments efficiently and profitably. [Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 15, 2024]

- Ørsted has been forced to delay the start of commercial operations at its 704 MW Revolution Wind project off the U.S. East Coast by a year, now expected to begin in 2026. This delay contributes to an impairment cost of 3.2 billion Danish kroner ($472 million) in its second-quarter financial results. The postponement follows the company’s earlier decision to cancel two major wind farms off the New Jersey coast, Ocean Wind I and II, due to surging costs. These setbacks, combined with Ørsted’s broader financial struggles, including job cuts and market withdrawals, indicate significant instability in its offshore wind expansion strategy. [The Guardian, Jillian Ambrose, August 15, 2024]

- Ørsted’s financial troubles have led to a major restructuring effort, including the elimination of up to 800 jobs and a retreat from key offshore wind markets such as Spain, Portugal, and Norway. The company has also suspended dividend payments for the 2023-2025 financial years in an attempt to stabilize its finances. These drastic measures reflect the severe financial strain Ørsted is under, as it struggles with rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and higher interest rates. The job cuts and market withdrawals could weaken Ørsted’s competitive position in the offshore wind sector and slow the global transition to renewable energy.

2.03pm: Orsted delays US windfarm project
Orseted, the Danish energy company, has been forced to delay its project off the north-east coast of the US, 
months after it began a restructuring that paved the way to hundreds of job cuts and two project cancellations. 
Operations at the Revolution Wind project off the coast of Connecticut and Rhode Island have been delayed an 
extra year, with completion now expected in 2026.
Orsted, which is developing the largest offshore wind farm in the North Sea, said the decision, along with the 
choice to scrap two projects off the New Jersey coast, would lead to a US$472 million hit.
Boss Richard Hunter and finance chief Daniel Lerup walked away from the company days after they revealed the 
hit, claiming the business required "new and different capabilities". 
Back in February, the firm said it would slash up to 800 jobs, while moving away from operations in Spain, Portugal 
and Norway.
1.40pm: US lifted by retail sales beat and unemployment dip
Wall Street is on track to lift higher at the open after it was handed a boost from some fresh macroeconomic data. 
All three of the main indexes are set to begin the session in the green, with the Dow Jones up around 150 points. 
The FTSE 100 surged close to 30 points in reaction.
Hopes of a US rate cut have been handed a welcomed boost after it was revealed retail sales had soared ahead of 
expectations in July, while unemployment in August also improved.
Today's readings will offer the Federal Reserve a rosier picture of the US economy, potentially increasing the 
chances of an interest rate cut at the central bank's next meeting in September. 
Retail sales in the world's largest economy rose by 2.7% year-on-year, smashing estimates of a 1.8% rise, while 
month-on-month revenues lifted by 1%, better than the 0.2% increase forecast by Wall Street. 
Initial jobless claims for the week of August 10 also improved on analysts' predictions, after it reached 227,000, 
lower than the 239,000 guidance.  
1.18pm: Fashion brands hit by Bangladesh riots
International fashion brands are diverting orders away from Bangladesh following the turmoil that led to the fall of 
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
The political unrest in Bangladesh, the world's second-largest garment exporter, has caused significant disruptions 
in the country's manufacturing sector, affecting global supply chains.
The chaos began after Sheikh Hasina's government cracked down on student protesters, leading to widespread 
violence that resulted in an estimated 500 deaths.Page 3 of 8
FTSE 100 Live: Index surges as US retail sales surge; GDP up but productivity falls; Admiral soars
The unrest led to the closure of factories across the country, many of which were targeted in retaliatory attacks.
Factories supplying global brands such as H&M and Zara were among those torched.
12.57pm: Vodafone merger needed, Three CFO says 
Three UK's chief financial has claimed its proposed tie-up with Vodafone Group PLC is needed after the company 
reported a £30 million interim operating loss.
Highlighting reduced capital expenditure over the first six months of the year, Three UK chief financial officer Darren 
Purkis warned the merger was the only way for the company to ramp up investment.
This comes after the proposed £15 billion deal, which would see the UK's third and fourth largest mobile networks 
merge, has faced regulatory scrutiny.
"We are having to reduce our capex due to the financial constraints and we've continued to make a loss as a result 
of the increased cost base," Purkis said after the results.
"The only viable way for us to invest in a network is through the proposed merger with Vodafone that would unlock 
£11 billion of investment"... Read more
12.25pm: US stocks seen higher ahead of retail sales figures
US stocks looked to be heading for a positive start on Thursday, as investors awaited the latest insight into US 
economic health in retail sales figures for July.
Futures had the Dow Jones ticking up 0.2% ahead of Thursday's open, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 looked to 
each add 0.1%.
Retail sales figures for July are set to offer the latest picture on the health of the economy, after weak jobs figures 
sent global shares spiralling earlier this month.
Concerns had emerged that the US economy was heading for recession, prompting questions over whether the 
Federal Reserve had put off cutting interest for too long.
Expectations are for sales to have climbed by 0.3% in July, with weekly initial jobless claims data also due. Analysts 
are forecasting these to tick up from 233,000 to 235,000.
An update from Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT, ETR:WMT) is also due on Thursday, with AJ Bell analyst Danni Hewson 
noting this and retail figures "will tell the market plenty about the state of US consumer demand and whether recent 
fears over recession have much credence to them".
12.05pm: Rolls-Royce wins contract for Royal Navy frigate systems
Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LSE:RR.) will supply handling systems for the Royal Navy's next batch of frigates under 
a new contract with BAE Systems PLC (LSE:BA.).
This will see five Mission Bay Handling Systems built for the navy's Type 26 City-class frigates in Peterborough, 
Ontario, taking the total order to eight units.
Such systems replace the need for dockside cranes, according to Rolls-Royce, offering a hydraulic boom which can 
deploy and retrieve small vessels from the frigates.
"This is a huge win for Rolls-Royce in Canada," Rolls-Royce programme executive Jessica Banks said, "our [...] 
system is perfectly designed for modern naval operations".
Rolls-Royce added the new orders would help create skilled jobs, increasing the workforce in Ontario by 10%.Page 4 of 8

11.54am: Ørsted slumps as US wind projects delayed
Danish energy firm Ørsted fell over 7% on Thursday morning after booking 3.2 billion krone (£370 million) in 
impairment losses over the second quarter on delayed projects in the US.
Delays saw the company push back the opening date of its major offshore wind project off the coasts of 
Connecticut and Rhode Island states.
Ørsted added it had taken hits on its US its Ocean Wind project, which was halted last year, alongside the ditched 
Swedish-based green e-methanol FlagshipOne project.
"Despite encouraging progress on our US offshore wind project Revolution Wind, the construction of the onshore 
substation for the project has been delayed," chief executive Mads Nipper said.
"This means that we have pushed the commercial operation date from 2025 into 2026, which led to an impairment."
11.28am: Fall in productivity prompts analyst concern
Productivity fell over the second quarter, despite UK GDP ticking up 0.6%, prompting warnings that sustained 
growth may be a challenge.
ONS data on Thursday showed productivity declined by 0.1% over the three months to June compared to a year 
earlier, as "hours worked increased more than gross value added".
Hailey Low, National Institute of Economic and Social Research economist, warned the slowdown could hinder 
long-term targets, after Britain's new Labour government set aims to secure the highest sustained growth across 
the G7.
"Persistent challenges such as low productivity growth, strained public finances, and inadequate infrastructures 
have acted as barriers to achieving sustained growth," she said.
This comes as Britain already grapples with an increasing rate of economic inactivity, with figures earlier in the 
week showing 9.5 million people work out of and not looking for work... Read more
10.56am: September rate cut 'further justified' by June GDP slowdown - analyst
While UK GDP ticked up 0.6% over the second quarter, flat growth in June could tempt the Bank of England into a 
second successive interest rate cut next month, analysts say.
Sam North, analyst at eToro, noted flat growth in June might "initially raise concerns".
"However," he said, "this could actually provide the Bank of England with further justification to consider cutting 
interest rates next month".
Markets are split over when the Bank of England will next cut interest rates, with analysts noting two further cuts 
this year were likely after a soft inflation reading on Wednesday.
Further data is due before the Monetary Policy Committee's next meeting on September 19 though, leaving the 
timing of the next cut, from 5% currently, up in the air.
9.58am: UK showing brighter prospects - analysts
Analysts say prospects in the UK are looking up after GDP data on Thursday showed the economy grew by 0.6% 
over the second quarter.
Deutsche Bank analysts noted the near-term economic outlook had improved on the figures, which came after a 
0.7% increase in GDP during the first quarter.Page 5 of 8
FTSE 100 Live: Index surges as US retail sales surge; GDP up but productivity falls; Admiral soars
"The good news is that this should lift the overall size of the economy, leaving the chancellor with a slightly better 
near-term outlook than what the Office for Budget Responsibility presented in March," Deutsche said.
"For the Bank of England, the slightly lower growth rate should leave the door open to further rate cuts - particularly 
given yesterday's weaker inflation data."
Investec echoed the view, adding: "The political landscape is more stable than some of the UK's allies, economic 
activity is much stronger relative to this point last year and the monetary policy easing cycle has commenced.
"When it comes to the UK, the sun appears to be breaking through the storm clouds."
Deutsche warned growth over the second half of the year would likely be slower though, given GDP flatlined in 
June.
The bank predicted the economy to grow by 1.2% in 2024, stretching to 1.6% over the next two years.
9.37am: Rail dispute end looms as train drivers offered pay rise
Train drivers have been offered a 14% pay rise by ministers in a bid to end more than two years of strikes on the 
railways.
Transport secretary Louise Haigh unveiled the above-inflation three-year offer on Wednesday, which would take 
drivers' average salaries from £60,000 to near £70,000.
Union Aslef said it had agreed to the deal with the Department for Transport, with a vote now set to be put to 
drivers.
Were this passed, it would bring an end to the long-running dispute between drivers and 16 rail operators, which 
began in July 2022.
Drivers have walked out on 18 separate days during the dispute, causing delays and cancellations across the

Whelan commented, adding members would be recommended to approve the deal.

Mecca Bingo owner Rank Group PLC gained over 5% on Thursday after reporting a return to profit on a rebound

ticked up 8% to £734.7 million.
This was driven by increased revenues across its Grosvenor casino sites, with those in London recording a 10% 
jump in turnover.
Rank also it would reinstate dividend payments on the improved figures, with 0.85p per share being recommended 
for the year just gone.

FTSE 100 Live: Index surges as US retail sales surge; GDP up but productivity falls; Admiral soars
This will be the first payment from a £100 million fund to aid those hit by Tata's restructuring, which is set to cost 
2,800 jobs.
Welsh secretary Jo Stevens announced the funding on Thursday, commenting "this government will not wait for a 
crisis to overtake us before acting".
Tata closed the first of the two blast furnaces last month, with the second set to be shut down in September.
This is as the company looks to install greener electric furnaces next year, with the previous government pledging 
£500 million to support the plan.
Stevens added government negotiations over job losses would continue separately, with funding set to support 
suppliers in finding new markets and help redundant workers.
8.41am: UK grows third-fastest in the G7
GDP data on Thursday showed the UK economy grew third-fastest among G7 nations during the second quarter.
This was after Japan and the US, which saw growth of 0.8% and 0.7% over the three months to June respectively 
against the UK's 0.6%.
Britain's new Labour government has set targets for the UK to secure the highest sustained growth across the G7 
after coming into power last month.
Chancellor Rachel Reeves commented: "We have made economic growth our national mission and we are taking 
the tough decisions now to fix the foundations," following the GDP figures on Thursday.
Based on the ONS data, Britain sat ahead of Canada, France, Italy and Germany in terms of growth over the 
second quarter.
This is as Canadian GDP was estimated to have climbed 0.5%, while the French and Italian economies expanded 
by 0.3% and 0.2% respectively as Germany contracted.
8.21am: Admiral jumps, FTSE 100 in green

IG analyst Chris Beauchamp noted "the good times are back for insurers it seems, and for their investors too," after 
rival Aviva PLC (LSE:AV.) also reported an uptick in profit on Wednesday.
He added: "While another UK rate cut isn't on the cards yet, a gradual decline in income from interest rates will 
keep the sector on investors' radars."
Aviva PLC (LSE:AV.) and Beazley PLC (LSE:BEZ) also gained early on following Admiral's report.
Overall, the FTSE 100 enjoyed a positive start as ONS data showed UK GDP increased by 0.6% over the second 
quarter, with the index adding 7 points to reach 8,288.

Against the dollar, sterling was up 0.1% at US$1.285 on Thursday morning. It strengthened against the euro too, by 
0.1% to 85.7p.
The data from the ONS had shown UK GDP climbed 0.6% over the three months to June, after a 0.7% rise in the 
first quarter of the year.
PwC economist Jake Finney noted the figures may have confirmed that the UK economy had now turned a corner, 
following negative growth over the second half of last year.
"There is good reason to expect that the second half of 2024 will be strong too, given that wages are growing in real 
terms and the Bank of England has started to loosen monetary policy," he said.
7.56am: Admiral ups dividend on better profit and customer numbers
Admiral Group PLC has hiked its interim dividend from 51p to 71p per share on stronger profits over the first half of 
the year.
Group pre-tax profit climbed 32% to £309.8 million over the six months to June, the UK-based insurer announced 
on Wednesday, on the back of a 43% uptick in revenue to 3.21 billion.
This was as group customers ticked up 12% to 10.53 million, with Admiral having faced a drop in recent years after 
hiking premiums ahead of peers.
According to the group, the increase was driven by its UK motor insurance segment, which saw a record 5.5 million 
vehicles on its coverage... Read more
7.32am: GDP stagnated in June
Digging into today's GDP data, the ONS figures show the economy is estimated to have stagnated in June.
The unrevised figures also reiterated that April saw no growth, while GDP ticked up by 0.4% in May.
Confederation of British Industry economist Ben Jones commented: "After a strong performance in May, a 
slowdown in GDP growth was always on the cards for June.
"But a second successive quarter of above-trend growth suggests the UK economy has finally shaken off its 
slumber of recent years.
"We think the quarterly data probably overstates the underlying momentum in the economy, with recent CBI 
surveys of activity remaining fairly subdued. But firms nonetheless appear confident that the recovery will continue."
7.22am: UK economy grows in second quarter
Office for National Statistics data on Thursday morning confirmed the UK economy grew over the second quarter.
GDP expanded by 0.6% during the three months to June, following a 0.7% rise during the second quarter.
This was as the service sector grew 0.8%, offsetting declines across the production and construction industries.

- Ørsted has been forced to delay the start of commercial operations at its 704 MW Revolution Wind project off the U.S. East Coast by a year, now expected to begin in 2026. This delay contributes to an impairment cost of 3.2 billion Danish kroner ($472 million) in its second-quarter financial results. The postponement follows the company’s earlier decision to cancel two major wind farms off the New Jersey coast, Ocean Wind I and II, due to surging costs. These setbacks, combined with Ørsted’s broader financial struggles, including job cuts and market withdrawals, indicate significant instability in its offshore wind expansion strategy. [The Guardian, Jillian Ambrose, August 15, 2024]

- Ørsted’s financial troubles have led to a major restructuring effort, including the elimination of up to 800 jobs and a retreat from key offshore wind markets such as Spain, Portugal, and Norway. The company has also suspended dividend payments for the 2023-2025 financial years in an attempt to stabilize its finances. These drastic measures reflect the severe financial strain Ørsted is under, as it struggles with rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and higher interest rates. The job cuts and market withdrawals could weaken Ørsted’s competitive position in the offshore wind sector and slow the global transition to renewable energy. [The Guardian, Jillian Ambrose, August 15, 2024]

- Ørsted has suffered another financial setback with a 2.1 billion Danish kroner impairment at its Revolution Wind project near Martha’s Vineyard, off the U.S. East Coast. The delay in constructing the onshore substation has pushed the commercial operation date from 2025 to 2026, leading to additional financial losses. This delay follows the company’s earlier cancellations of two major offshore wind projects in New Jersey, Ocean Wind I and II, which had already resulted in significant financial impairments. The repeated project delays and cancellations raise concerns about Ørsted’s ability to manage large-scale offshore wind developments efficiently and profitably. [Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 15, 2024]

- Ørsted has been forced to cancel its flagship green fuel factory, the FlagshipONE project in Sweden, due to a lack of demand for e-methanol. The project was intended to supply container ships with 55,000 tonnes of methanol annually, contributing to the global transition away from fossil fuels. However, the company was unable to secure long-term contracts at viable prices, leading to a financial impairment of 1.5 billion Danish kroner (£172 million). This cancellation highlights the challenges Ørsted faces in diversifying beyond offshore wind and raises concerns about the viability of large-scale green fuel projects. The decision also reflects broader struggles in the renewable energy sector, as other energy majors have similarly scaled back ambitious projects. [Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, August 15, 2024]

- Ørsted’s stock price has plummeted by more than 7% following the announcement of impairment losses totaling 3.2 billion Danish kroner (£370 million) in the second quarter due to project delays in the U.S. The company has faced setbacks with its Revolution Wind project off the coasts of Connecticut and Rhode Island, as well as impairments related to its canceled Ocean Wind project and the abandoned FlagshipONE green e-methanol project in Sweden. These financial hits indicate ongoing difficulties in executing large-scale renewable energy projects profitably, further eroding investor confidence.
