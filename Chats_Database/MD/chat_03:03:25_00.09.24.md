You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| Dr. Griet Voet | Dermatologist | "Acrylaten zijn een groep van chemische stoffen die vaak zitten in producten als bindmiddel of filmvormer, bijvoorbeeld in verf op waterbasis, nagellak, gelnagels, acrylnagels of zelfs brilmonturen." | "Acrylates are a group of chemical substances that are often found in products such as binders or film formers, for example in water-based paint, nail polish, gel nails, acrylic nails, or even eyeglass frames." |
| Dr. Sven Lanssens | Dermatologist | "Een acrylatenallergie is een vorm van contactallergie." | "An acrylate allergy is a form of contact allergy." |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Acrylnagelproducten.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Acrylnagelproducten or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
