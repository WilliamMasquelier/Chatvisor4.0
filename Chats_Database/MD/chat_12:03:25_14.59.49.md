### **Shell’s Business Model in the Australian Oil and Gas Market**  

Shell operates as a vertically integrated energy company in Australia, engaging in upstream (exploration and production), midstream (transportation and processing), and downstream (refining, distribution, and retail) activities. The company plays a significant role in the Australian oil and gas industry, leveraging its global expertise, technological capabilities, and strategic partnerships to maintain a competitive edge.

### **Midstream and Downstream Operations: Processing, Distribution, and Retail**  
Shell’s midstream and downstream operations in Australia include refining, fuel distribution, and retail services. While Shell sold its Australian refining business to Viva Energy in 2014, it continues to operate in fuel distribution and retail through partnerships.
