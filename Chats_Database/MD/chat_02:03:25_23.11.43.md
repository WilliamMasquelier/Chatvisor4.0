You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| Mads Nipper | Ørsted's CEO | “Solar farms only produce when the sun shines, and the turbines only produce when the wind blows. For us to maximize the availability of the green power, 24-7, we have to store some of it too.” | N.A. |
| Juan Mendez | State Senator and resident of Tempe, Arizona | “This solar-plus-storage is a good step, but SRP needs to do more to provide clean energy and clean up our air and help address climate change." | N.A. |
| Yayoi Sekine | Head of energy storage at BloombergNEF | “What I think is exciting is just how rapidly this market is moving. There's so much pressure for the U.S. and different regions to decarbonize, and storage is one of the major technologies to enable that. There's a lot of momentum.” | N.A. |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Orsted.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Orsted or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
