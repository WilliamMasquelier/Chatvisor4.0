You are tasked with extracting stakeholder information and direct quotes from a given news article related to Shell. Your output should be in the form of a markdown table without column titles or any additional information. Each table row should contain:
1. The name of a real person who has expressed a quote in the provided article
2. His role or relation with regards to Shell.
3. Their original quote about Shell exactly as it appears in the article, without any modifications or translations

Guidelines:
- Include only real people: Exclude organizations, companies, or any other non-person entities
- Direct connection: Ensure that each selected individual is explicitly connected to Shell or explicitly express his opinion on Shell.
- Only include those whose statements are directly about Shell
- Exclude individuals whose comments are not directly relevant to Shell or are too general
- Pertinent stakeholders only: Only include the most relevant individuals
- Do not include stakeholders who are not directly associated with Shell

Output Format Requirements:
- Each line must contain exactly two columns separated by "|" symbols
- Column 1: Stakeholder's name
- Column 2: Stakeholder's role or link to Shell. If not described in the article, try to interpret its role. If it is not straightforward to interpret, mention "Not mentioned".
- Column 3: Original quote in its original language

Example of correct formatting:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision de Shell est très importante." |
| John Smith | Shell's CEO |"We need to review Shell's proposal carefully." |
| Hans Weber | Financial analyst | "Die Strategie von Shell ist überzeugend." |

If no relevant individuals with quotes are found, return "None."

Leaders Paul Keating reserves special praise for visionary change-makers in banking, mining and 
entrepreneurship, writes Michael Stutchbury.
When asked to name the business people who impressed him the most during his long political career, Paul 
Keating starts with Keith Campbell, former head of the Hooker real estate company. Campbell's landmark financial 
system review in the late 1970s laid out the intellectual case for Labor's financial deregulation and the floating of the 
dollar.
Rod Carnegie, now 91, also draws praise from Keating in an exclusive interview with The Australian Financial 
Review to mark his 80th birthday. Carnegie set up McKinsey in Australia and sought to Australianise CRA, now 
known as Rio Tinto, as CEO in the 1980s. "He was a progressive thinking guy and an economic nationalist," 
Keating says.
On the other hand, it's hard to pick a banker given the banks hold public licences, Keating says.
Another on Keating's list of business greats is former BHP boss Marius Kloppers, who "broke the back" of 
negotiating contract pricing in 2010 in favour of using market spot prices for Australia's iron ore exports. "You've got 
to give him big, big marks for that," Keating says.
Pressed about his complaint about a lack of outward-looking entrepreneurs in the modern Australian economy that 
he helped create, Keating accepts there are some. He points to Fortescue Minerals' Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest, 
along with Atlassian founders Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, and Canva founders Melanie Perkins and 
Cliff Obrecht.
But the business person that merits a story is Ian McLennan, general manager and chairman of BHP between 1967 
and 1977. McLennan helped drive the company's search for oil in Bass Strait and gas in the North West Shelf.
The story takes place in 1975 - just after the defeat of the Whitlam government - when Keating was appointed 
shadow minister for minerals and resources.

McLennan caught a train to Keating's electorate office in Bankstown, a suburb in south-west Sydney, on a Saturday 
morning. He told the young Labor frontbencher that BHP had a chance of buying the exploration leases of the 
troubled British oil company, Burmah, in the highly prospective North West Shelf.
But with the prospect of a very long lead time for the major gas development, McLennan said BHP would not make 
the investment if the Labor opposition held to the policy of its previous resources minister, Rex Connor, that the gas 
should be controlled by the government and used for local industry rather than be exported to Japan.
"I said, 'Sir Ian, you will be very pleased with my answer'," Keating said. "I thought that Rex had made huge 
mistakes in this because this is a gas-prone continent. And anyone who puts a contract before us, we should sign 
and anyone who wants to capitalise on it, we should grab in a foot tackle and get their signature on the page."
That convinced BHP to buy part of Burmah's stake in what became Australia's biggest ever resource project. And 
so began the nation's liquefied natural gas export industry.
Keating then wrote support for the North West Shelf project into the Labor Party's policy platform at its 1977 
conference in Perth. The other part of the stake was bought by Shell, which played a big role in building the project. 
Keating recalls travelling to Tokyo three times with Shell's Ric Charlton to talk to Japanese bankers and gas 
buyers. And he was impressed with Shell Australia boss and International Olympic Committee member Kevan 
Gosper. AFR
