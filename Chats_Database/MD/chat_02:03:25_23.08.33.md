It said it would suspend dividend payments to shareholders \ncovering the 2023-25 financial years in an attempt to recover from a chaotic 12 months.\nThe company, which is majority owned by the Danish government, said the \u201creset plan\u201d was designed to make it \nleaner and more efficient after soaring cost inflation and higher interest rates collided with supply chain disruptions \nto upend construction plans across the industry.\nPage 2 of 2\nDanish wind power giant \u00d8rsted delays major US offshore project\n\u00d8rsted\u2019s chief executive, Mads Nipper, pointed to the company\u2019s better than expected earnings from its portfolio of \noperating windfarms as evidence its existing business was performing well.\nEarnings for the second quarter rose to 5.27bn kroner, up almost 60% from the same months last year and well \nabove the average forecast of 4.41bn kroner predicted by industry analysts.\nThe company remains on track to deliver potentially the world\u2019s biggest offshore windfarm, the 2.9GW Hornsea 3, \nalso off the Yorkshire coast, by 2027, in a major boost to the new Labour government\u2019s goal to quadruple the UK\u2019s \noffshore wind capacity. \nThe \u00a38.3bn project is expected to generate enough green electricity to power the equivalent of 3m UK homes. The \nproject will join the 1.3GW Hornsea 1 offshore windfarm  and the 1.3GW Hornsea 2, which together are capable of \ngenerating enough electricity to provide 2.5m UK homes with green power. The final development, Hornsea 4, \nreceived approval last year  and could have a capacity of up to 2.6GW.\nIn total, the Hornsea offshore wind zone will generate enough clean electricity to power the equivalent of 8m UK \nhomes.\nLoad-Date: August 15, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The money for wind turbines has been agreed as part of a government \nauction for renewable energy contracts known as the allocation round 6 (AR6). Under this system, the Government \nencourages companies to build low-carbon energy plants such as solar and wind farms by offering a minimum price \nfor the electricity generated. The money for such subsidies is eventually added to bills. The UK's power grid \noperator, National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO), calculates \"budget impact\" of the subsidies for offshore \nwind and other renewables at \u00a34bn from 2026 to 2031, in today's money.\nThe costs given exclude the additional expense of transmission lines and the expansion of the national grid to \nhandle the extra power.\nIt means more than five gigawatts (GW) of new offshore wind power is now set for construction - a stark contrast to \nlast year's botched auction round when there were no bids. The Tories offered subsidies so low - at \u00a340 per \nmegawatt hour (MWh) - that no off- shore wind developers came forward.\nPage 2 of 2\nMiliband's wind farms to cost families \u00a3150; Households to pick up \u00a33bn bill as Energy Secretary oversees \nrecord expansion of renewables\nSubsidies under Mr Miliband will be more than doubled to over \u00a382 per MWh. Solar farms will get \u00a370/MWh, with \nnewer technologies such as floating wind handed \u00a3195/MWh and tidal stream projects given \u00a3239/MWh.\nA total of 131 clean energy projects have won state subsidies in this year's auction, including 115 solar projects \nacross England and onshore wind projects mainly in Scotland and Wales.\nMany of the onshore projects are likely to prove highly controversial, with homeowners and environmentalists \nobjecting to the industrialisation of landscapes with panels and turbines.\nHowever, Mr Miliband hailed the auction results as a triumph. He said: \"We inherited a broken energy policy. Today \nwe have a record-setting round for enough renewable power for 11m homes, essential to give energy security to \nfamilies across the country. It is another significant step forward in our mission for clean power by 2030.\"\nOrsted is one of the biggest winners.\nIt has been allowed to shunt much of its Hornsea 3 project out of contracts signed under previous allocation rounds, \nwhere lower subsidies were offered, into this year's auction. A spokesman for Mr Miliband said the move had been \npermitted because otherwise Hornsea 3 - potentially the world's largest wind farm at 3GW - might never have been \nbuilt.\nCritics will argue that such contracts become meaningless if companies can simply move them from one auction \nround if a subsequent one offers better terms. Orsted was also awarded a 2.4GW CfD for Hornsea 4. Rasmus \nErrboe, of Orsted, said: \"We look forward to delivering these landmark projects, which will supply renewable power \nat a large scale to UK consumers and businesses and help the UK Government achieve its target of quadrupling \noffshore wind capacity to 60GW by 2030.\"\nScottishPower has been offered contracts for another two large wind farms, East Anglia Two and East Anglia \nThree. As with Orsted, it was allowed to move its East Anglia Three project out of the contracts signed under a \nprevious and less lucrative auction.\nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesman said it did not recognise the costs per household, but \nrenewable energy remained essential to boost UK energy security.\nLoad-Date: September 4, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The money for wind turbines has been agreed as part of a government \nauction for renewable energy contracts known as the allocation round 6 (AR6). Under this system, the Government \nencourages companies to build low-carbon energy plants such as solar and wind farms by offering a minimum price \nfor the electricity generated. The money for such subsidies is eventually added to bills. The UK's power grid \noperator, National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO), calculates \"budget impact\" of the subsidies for offshore \nwind and other renewables at \u00a34bn from 2026 to 2031, in today's money.\nThe costs given exclude the additional expense of transmission lines and the expansion of the national grid to \nhandle the extra power.\nIt means more than five gigawatts (GW) of new offshore wind power is now set for construction - a stark contrast to \nlast year's botched auction round when there were no bids. The Tories offered subsidies so low - at \u00a340 per \nmegawatt hour (MWh) - that no off- shore wind developers came forward.\nPage 2 of 2\nMiliband's wind farms to cost families \u00a3150; Households to pick up \u00a33bn bill as Energy Secretary oversees \nrecord expansion of renewables\nSubsidies under Mr Miliband will be more than doubled to over \u00a382 per MWh. Solar farms will get \u00a370/MWh, with \nnewer technologies such as floating wind handed \u00a3195/MWh and tidal stream projects given \u00a3239/MWh.\nA total of 131 clean energy projects have won state subsidies in this year's auction, including 115 solar projects \nacross England and onshore wind projects mainly in Scotland and Wales.\nMany of the onshore projects are likely to prove highly controversial, with homeowners and environmentalists \nobjecting to the industrialisation of landscapes with panels and turbines.\nHowever, Mr Miliband hailed the auction results as a triumph. He said: \"We inherited a broken energy policy. Today \nwe have a record-setting round for enough renewable power for 11m homes, essential to give energy security to \nfamilies across the country. It is another significant step forward in our mission for clean power by 2030.\"\nOrsted is one of the biggest winners.\nIt has been allowed to shunt much of its Hornsea 3 project out of contracts signed under previous allocation rounds, \nwhere lower subsidies were offered, into this year's auction. A spokesman for Mr Miliband said the move had been \npermitted because otherwise Hornsea 3 - potentially the world's largest wind farm at 3GW - might never have been \nbuilt.\nCritics will argue that such contracts become meaningless if companies can simply move them from one auction \nround if a subsequent one offers better terms. Orsted was also awarded a 2.4GW CfD for Hornsea 4. Rasmus \nErrboe, of Orsted, said: \"We look forward to delivering these landmark projects, which will supply renewable power \nat a large scale to UK consumers and businesses and help the UK Government achieve its target of quadrupling \noffshore wind capacity to 60GW by 2030.\"\nScottishPower has been offered contracts for another two large wind farms, East Anglia Two and East Anglia \nThree. As with Orsted, it was allowed to move its East Anglia Three project out of the contracts signed under a \nprevious and less lucrative auction.\nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesman said it did not recognise the costs per household, but \nrenewable energy remained essential to boost UK energy security.\nLoad-Date: September 4, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Mais, pour les porteurs de projet de ces \ncarburants bas carbone, ce n'est pas forc\u00e9ment une mauvaise nouvelle.\nBody\nC'est l'un des premiers coups d'arr\u00eat sur un march\u00e9 prometteur. Au coeur de l'\u00e9t\u00e9, le danois Orsted a annonc\u00e9 \nl'arr\u00eat de son grand projet d'e-fuel en Su\u00e8de, FlagshipOne. Le premier du genre en Europe, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9 il y a \ndeux ans. \u00ab Nous croyons toujours au march\u00e9 des e-fuels, sur le long terme, mais l'industrialisation de la \ntechnologie, ainsi que le d\u00e9veloppement commercial ont progress\u00e9 beaucoup plus lentement que pr\u00e9vu \u00bb, a fait \nsavoir le groupe.\nLes e-fuels ou carburants synth\u00e9tiques ont pourtant suscit\u00e9 de gros espoirs pour d\u00e9carboner les transports. Ils sont \nproduits \u00e0 partir d'hydrog\u00e8ne obtenu par l'\u00e9lectrolyse de l'eau, avec une source d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 bas carbone, et du \nCO2. Avec ce processus, on peut obtenir des carburants automobiles, mais aussi du e-m\u00e9thanol, qui peut \nalimenter le transport maritime ou des proc\u00e9d\u00e9s chimiques, du e-k\u00e9ros\u00e8ne, pour faire voler les avions, ou encore \ndu e-m\u00e9thane, pour se substituer au gaz naturel, d'origine fossile. L'avantage, c'est que l'on obtient une mol\u00e9cule \nsimilaire \u00e0 celle d'un carburant traditionnel et qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de changer les \u00e9quipements - mais leurs \nd\u00e9tracteurs avancent que les carburants de synth\u00e8se rejettent aussi des gaz \u00e0 effet de serre. N\u00e9anmoins, ils en \n\u00e9mettent 70 % moins que les carburants d'origine fossile, selon une \u00e9tude de l'ONG Transport & Environnement.\nLe transport maritime h\u00e9sitant\n\u00ab Les march\u00e9s sont \u00e0 des degr\u00e9s de maturit\u00e9 diff\u00e9rents, explique Jean-Philippe H\u00e9raud, responsable du \nprogramme biocarburants et e-fuels \u00e0 l'Ifpen. Pour les carburants de synth\u00e8se, le march\u00e9 existe d\u00e9j\u00e0, il s'agit de \nprendre le relais de produits hydrocarbures pour les d\u00e9carboner. Pour du e-m\u00e9thanol, qui alimentera en partie le \ntransport maritime, le risque sera plus important, car c'est un march\u00e9 en devenir. \u00bb\nPage 2 of 3\nLes carburants de synth\u00e8se tanguent face aux incertitudes \u00e9conomiques et r\u00e9glementaires\nFlagshipOne \u00e9tait d\u00e9crit par Orsted comme \u00ab le plus grand projet de e-m\u00e9thanol en construction en Europe \u00bb. Il \ndevait permettre la production de 55.000 tonnes de e-m\u00e9thanol par an \u00e0 partir de 2025, destin\u00e9 principalement au \ntransport maritime, en utilisant de l'hydrog\u00e8ne d'origine renouvelable et du CO2r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 sur une centrale \u00e0 \nbiomasse voisine. L'investissement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 500 millions d'euros. \u00ab Les exploitants de navires ne sont \npas pr\u00eats \u00e0 accepter les co\u00fbts \u00e9lev\u00e9s du m\u00e9thanol durable, avec une marge de manoeuvre limit\u00e9e pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer \nces d\u00e9penses suppl\u00e9mentaires sur leurs clients \u00bb, r\u00e9sume S&P dans une note, estimant que le m\u00e9thanol durable \nserait deux \u00e0 cinq fois plus cher que le m\u00e9thanol d'origine fossile.\nLire aussi :\nEN CHIFFRES - Carburants de synth\u00e8se : la France place ses pions\nDECRYPTAGE - Pourquoi les e-fuels peinent encore \u00e0 convaincre\nPour Elyse Energy, qui d\u00e9veloppe trois projets de carburants synth\u00e9tiques en France, dont deux en phase d'\u00e9tudes \nd'ing\u00e9nierie dans le Rh\u00f4ne et \u00e0 Lacq (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques), la d\u00e9cision d'Orsted ne doit toutefois pas jeter le \ndiscr\u00e9dit sur l'ensemble du march\u00e9. \u00ab Ce type d'annonce est naturel dans cette phase du march\u00e9. Certains projets \npassent la barre de l'investissement, d'autres non. C'est sain et on a connu cela dans toutes les fili\u00e8res \n\u00e9mergentes, les \u00e9nergies renouvelables, le GNL ou le p\u00e9trole de schiste \u00bb, souligne son cofondateur, Benoit \nDecourt. Les projets se multiplieraient m\u00eame en France.\nLa question du prix de l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9\nReste que les d\u00e9cisions finales d'investissement sont loin d'\u00eatre prises et que de nombreux points d'interrogation \nsubsistent. En premier lieu, la stabilisation du co\u00fbt des mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res. \u00ab L'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 est la premi\u00e8re d'entre \nelles, elle peut repr\u00e9senter jusqu'\u00e0 80 % des co\u00fbts, ce qui est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent d'un actif industriel classique dans le \nsecteur, affirme Jean-Philippe H\u00e9raud. Mais la s\u00e9curisation des sources de CO2sera aussi un enjeu majeur. \u00bb La \nr\u00e9glementation europ\u00e9enne impose qu'\u00e0 partir de 2040, les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s industriels soient aliment\u00e9s en majorit\u00e9 par du \nCO2biog\u00e9nique (provenant de la biomasse agricole ou foresti\u00e8re ou contenu dans la mati\u00e8re organique du sol). Le \ncadre doit donc s'adapter, alors que le d\u00e9bat sur la biomasse bat son plein, et les projets s\u00e9curiser ces sources.\nLire aussi :\nDECRYPTAGE - Climat : 6 choses \u00e0 savoir sur les carburants de synth\u00e8se d\u00e9fendus par l'Allemagne\nLes incertitudes en France sur le prix de l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 future, avec des n\u00e9gociations qui doivent reprendre entre le \nprochain gouvernement et EDF, n'aident pas, non plus, au bouclage des projets. \u00ab La comp\u00e9titivit\u00e9 des projets \nfran\u00e7ais d\u00e9pendra de leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u00e9curiser des contrats d'achat d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 bas carbone sur le long terme \u00e0 un \nprix suffisamment bas \u00bb, indique Charlotte de Lorgeril, de Sia Partners, qui dirige le bureau fran\u00e7ais des e-fuels.\nLe cadre r\u00e9glementaire, qui commence \u00e0 voir le jour sur certains march\u00e9s, doit encore \u00eatre pr\u00e9cis\u00e9. \u00ab Il y a un \nbesoin de r\u00e8gles du jeu claires et stabilis\u00e9es pour pouvoir prendre des d\u00e9cisions finales d'investissement d\u00e8s 2025 \nou 2026 \u00bb, soutient Benoit Decourt. La reconnaissance du nucl\u00e9aire dans les sources d'\u00e9nergie bas carbone doit, \npar exemple, encore \u00eatre transpos\u00e9e dans les textes.\nUne concurrence am\u00e9ricaine et chinoise ?\nUne fois ces conditions r\u00e9unies, peut-\u00eatre que les gros acteurs, notamment les p\u00e9troliers, s'int\u00e9resseront davantage \n\u00e0 ce march\u00e9. Aujourd'hui, l'essentiel des projets est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par quelques pionniers, et les banques se montrent \nplus prudentes pour financer ce type d'acteurs. \u00ab L'Europe nous demande de produire du e-fuel tr\u00e8s pur, qui co\u00fbte \nhuit \u00e0 dix fois plus cher \u00bb, insistait r\u00e9cemment, aux Rencontres \u00e9conomiques d'Aix-en-Provence, Patrick Pouyann\u00e9. \nLe patron de TotalEnergies a choisi d'explorer cette technologie aux Etats-Unis, avec TES pour du gaz synth\u00e9tique.\nLire aussi :Page 3 of 3\nLes carburants de synth\u00e8se tanguent face aux incertitudes \u00e9conomiques et r\u00e9glementaires\nENQUETE - D\u00e9carbonation : l'\u00e9lan des industriels fran\u00e7ais s'essouffle\nLe risque serait de voir le march\u00e9 d\u00e9coller aux Etats-Unis ou en Chine, o\u00f9 les soutiens sont massifs et o\u00f9 quelques \nprojets devraient voir le jour dans les prochains mois, alors m\u00eame que l'Europe est plut\u00f4t bien positionn\u00e9e en \namont.

Dans la foul\u00e9e de sa prise de fonction, Donald Trump a ouvert le front des guerres \ncommerciales en confirmant sa volont\u00e9 d'imposer des droits de douane de 25 % sur les produits mexicains et \ncanadiens.

Tour d'horizon.\n\u00b7 Automobile : le mod\u00e8le des constructeurs am\u00e9ricains menac\u00e9\nLa mise en place de taxes douani\u00e8res de 25 % pour les importations canadiennes et mexicaines devrait fortement \nperturber les op\u00e9rations des constructeurs. Ces derniers ont largement exploit\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rences de co\u00fbts de \nproduction au sein de la zone de libre-\u00e9change constitu\u00e9e par le Mexique, les Etats-Unis et le Canada.\nCes nouvelles barri\u00e8res douani\u00e8res pourraient \u00ab paralyser \u00bb l'industrie automobile nord-am\u00e9ricaine, pr\u00e9vient Maeva \nCousin, de Bloomberg Economics.

De plus, le groupe \nam\u00e9ricano-franco-italien avait initialement pour objectif de sourcer 80 % de ses pi\u00e8ces dans des pays \u00e0 bas co\u00fbts, \navait-il annonc\u00e9 en juin dernier.\nFin 2024, Chris Feuell, le patron de RAM, la marque de pick-up de Stellantis, avait cependant pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le \ngroupe \u00e9tudiait comment modifier son approvisionnement et r\u00e9organiser ses sites d'assemblage en cas de mise en \nplace de taxes douani\u00e8res. L'ampleur des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts d\u00e9pendra grandement des d\u00e9tails de la mesure, relativise \nSPGlobal. Leur effet demeure incertain en fonction de l'int\u00e9gration ou non dans leur p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre des pi\u00e8ces \nd\u00e9tach\u00e9es, expliquent-ils.\nDonald Trump a \u00e9galement annonc\u00e9 qu'il r\u00e9voquait un d\u00e9cret de son pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur visant, \u00e0 titre indicatif, 50 % de \nventes d'\u00e9lectriques en 2030. Plus important, il veut supprimer les objectifs de r\u00e9duction des \u00e9missions de CO2mis \nen place dans les transports par la Californie et une dizaine d'autres Etats. De quoi remettre en cause les politiques \nd'\u00e9lectrification des constructeurs. Mais une telle d\u00e9cision ne manquera pas d'\u00eatre contest\u00e9e devant les tribunaux \npar les Etats concern\u00e9s, rel\u00e8vent les analystes.\n\u00b7 Les \u00e9nerg\u00e9ticiens dans le flou\nWall Street a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tonnamment calme, ce mardi, pour les valeurs p\u00e9troli\u00e8res et gazi\u00e8res.

Mais les march\u00e9s avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 largement anticip\u00e9 la nouvelle et tous les \np\u00e9troliers am\u00e9ricains ont finalement ouvert en baisse (-0,4 % pour ExxonMobil, -1,4 % pour Chevron), de m\u00eame \nque les Europ\u00e9ens les plus expos\u00e9s au march\u00e9 du GNL, comme Shell (-0,8 %) ou TotalEnergies (-0,9 %).\nLes cons\u00e9quences sont en effet incertaines pour ces soci\u00e9t\u00e9s : elles pourraient b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'incitations \nsuppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 produire, d'autorisations plus rapides pour explorer de nouvelles r\u00e9gions, sans compter la fin du \nmoratoire de l'administration Biden sur les nouveaux projets de GNL, qui pourraient faire red\u00e9marrer des sites en \nsuspens. Mais l'urgence nationale pourrait fl\u00e9cher une partie de la production am\u00e9ricaine de gaz vers le march\u00e9 \ndomestique, privant les acteurs du GNL de g\u00e9n\u00e9reux profits, les prix \u00e9tant nettement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s sur les march\u00e9s \ninternationaux qu'aux Etats-Unis.\nLire aussi :\nDECRYPTAGE - Le GNL, nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment perturbateur des relations commerciales entre l'Europe et les Etats-Unis\nLa guerre commerciale avec le Canada pourrait, en outre, entra\u00eener l'Am\u00e9rique dans une surench\u00e8re.

Or, le Canada exporte 4 millions de barils de p\u00e9trole brut par jour vers son voisin.\nL'absence de ces barils pourrait faire grimper les prix et serait difficilement compensable par une hausse de la \nproduction am\u00e9ricaine, car les raffineries am\u00e9ricaines ne sont pas toujours calibr\u00e9es pour raffiner le p\u00e9trole \nam\u00e9ricain, plus l\u00e9ger. Il faudrait donc continuer \u00e0 importer d'autres r\u00e9gions, ou se lancer dans un long et co\u00fbteux \nrenouvellement de l'outil de raffinage.

The media portrayal of Hornsea 3, ScottishPower, and TotalEnergies reflects a generally positive sentiment, though with varying degrees of enthusiasm and challenges. Hornsea 3 is depicted as a groundbreaking offshore wind project with significant contributions to the UK's renewable energy goals, despite financial and leadership struggles at Ørsted. ScottishPower is recognized as a key player in the offshore wind sector, securing major contracts, though some coverage highlights concerns over consumer costs and foreign ownership. TotalEnergies is framed as a major energy transition player, leveraging hydrocarbon profits to expand into renewables, but facing regulatory and economic uncertainties, particularly in the U.S. Overall, these organizations are portrayed as leaders in the green energy transition, albeit with financial, regulatory, and political hurdles.
