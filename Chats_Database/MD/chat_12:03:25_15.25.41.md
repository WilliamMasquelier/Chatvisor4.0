Eric Marais holds a generally positive view of Cisco, acknowledging its long-term success in revenue and profit growth, but maintains a critical stance on its stock performance by highlighting its failure to regain its peak price after 25 years, suggesting a consistent perspective that could influence investor sentiment by reinforcing concerns about Cisco's long-term stock value despite its operational success.
