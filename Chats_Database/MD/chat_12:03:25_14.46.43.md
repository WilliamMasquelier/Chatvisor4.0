Australian businesses raised 708,640 warning flags in a review of shell company activity by Moody's Analytics, in a 
sign many local companies may be structured to enable financial crime.
In a review of global corporate arrangements, Moody's has found Australia is the second-worst country in the Asia-
Pacific for shell company structures.
Shell companies often have legitimate purposes, but Moody's notes they are often used to complicate corporate 
arrangements and are associated with financial crime.
Moody's has sent more than 1485 money-laundering risk alerts to subscribers concerning Australian companies 
since January 2018.
The credit rating and research group notes a profusion of shell companies presents significant challenges for 
compliance teams in attempting to understand a company's arrangements, "given the level of opaqueness often 
associated with them".
In its Shell Company Indicator, Moody's says seven key features associated with shell company activity may 
indicate "illicit activity".
"These span atypical directorships, mass registration, jurisdictional risk, dormancy, financial anomalies, outlier 
ultimate beneficial ownership, and circular ownership," Moody's notes.
Moody's review found more than 21 million risk activity flags raised across its survey of 472 million different 
companies.
Britain ranks as the worst country in the world for shell company activity, with more than five million flags recorded 
by Moody's. This is followed by China with 3.4 million flags against companies.
Australia ranks as the second worst in the Asia-Pacific region and well above near neighbours Singapore and New 
Zealand.

Moody's discovers financial red flags
Moody's notes companies which were flagged for two or more unusual corporate structures or features were "at a 
heightened risk of being a shell company".
"The indication that an entity is a shell company gives customers the ability to further investigate whether the 
company is potentially being used for illicit activities," the report said.
Moody's data found 650,729 flags for atypical or outlier directorships in Australia, representing individuals with an 
"unrealistic number of directorships".
The agency warned directors having a "prolific involvement" in many companies "can prompt further investigation".
The survey also flagged 769 companies for directors with "outlier ages", either improbably young or extremely old.
Moody's found 12,177 companies had mass registration issues for sharing names, addresses or directors in what 
may "suggest systematic efforts to obfuscate ownership".
The global survey found that more than 22,000 different companies had been registered to the Pyramids of Giza, 
outside Egypt's capital Cairo, while a further 61,000 were supposedly based in a row of shops in South Africa.
Moody's review also flagged 2542 Australian companies for "circular ownership" - tangled ownership structures 
"which can be a sign of fraudulent transactions and money laundering".
Moody's Analytics head of financial crime compliance practice for Europe, Africa, and Americas, Ted Datta, said 
companies were facing increasingly complex operating environments which made it difficult to detect "risk corporate 
relationships".
"Our goal is to leverage our global data to arm organisations globally - across banking, insurance, corporations and 
government sectors - with unprecedented detection of hidden networks of shell companies that span the globe.," 
he said.
"By detecting these discrepancies, we can equip investigators and analysts with the tools to better investigate fraud, 
unmask the beneficiaries of financial crime, and take action against bad -actors." Australia has been criticised for its 
lax financial controls, with the country one of three failing to sign on to new controls to stop money laundering and 
terrorism financing, alongside Haiti and Madagascar. Consultations on proposals to modernise the country's anti-
money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime in April last year.
