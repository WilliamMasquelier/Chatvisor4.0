David Ellison mastered flying planes in his teens. Now, Hollywood's newest mogul has to avoid a hard landing in 
merging his -Skydance Media and Paramount Global.
Hours after the merger was announced, Ellison made the kind of cautious remarks one would expect from someone 
seeking to win over sceptics across the entertainment industry, on Wall Street and among Paramount executives.
"We really want Paramount to be the first stop for creatives," he said, adding that he envisions turning the 
beleaguered entertainment company into what he calls "a media and tech hybrid" to make it a viable competitor 
against the likes of Disney, Netflix and Warner Bros Discovery.
But before any of that is likely to happen, Ellison and his team are continuing plans put in place by Paramount's 
current management amid a difficult media environment: cost-cutting, asset sales and layoffs.
Ellison's team has identified $US2bn in cost savings and says it will make the company cashflow positive by the 
end of 2026.
When he takes over Paramount, Ellison will be rubbing shoulders with the likes of Disney CEO Bob Iger and 
Warner Bros Discovery chief David Zaslav, a remarkable ascension for the 41-year-old. The son of Oracle co-
founder Larry Ellison, he relied on his billionaire father's largesse to create a production company, and managed to 
turn it into a reliable maker of box office hits, an unusual feat for a company of its size.
Like many of its peers, Paramount has been struggling with the decline in traditional TV networks while investing in 
Paramount+. Cord-cutting has greatly reduced the reach of its cable networks, such as MTV and Comedy Central, 
which means less revenue from subscriber fees and fewer advertising dollars.
As a result, spending on programming for the networks has been reduced, creating something of a vicious cycle for 
the company: less original programming means more cord-cutting, which leads to less investment.

Ellison can help Paramount navigate the challenging media landscape in that he understands and appreciates the 
movie business but also has a technical background to help grow its streaming service, says Ari Emanuel, chief 
executive of sports and entertainment companies Endeavour and TKO Group.
"A lot of people with the success he has had would never risk that to do what he is doing," he said. "I take my hat 
off to him." Paramount's efforts to sell its BET cable network will continue as the deal progresses. Other channels 
could also potentially go on the market, says Jeff Shell, the former NBCUniversal chief who is set to be president of 
Paramount after the Skydance deal closes.
Potential assets for sale could include TV stations owned by CBS that aren't affiliated with the broadcast network 
and hence are not core to its business.
One challenge facing Ellison and his team is how to make sure its Paramount+ streaming service can compete with 
bigger rivals. The service has seen decent subscriber growth over the past few years and was profitable in the US 
in the quarter that just ended. But the competitive nature of streaming requires constant investment to compete with 
the likes of Netflix and Prime.
Skydance said it would continue to pursue the strategy set out by Paramount's current leadership for the streaming 
service, including exploring an international joint venture, which is where much of the financial strain lies. Shell also 
said Paramount+ can benefit by doing more deals to bundle itself with other streaming services.
"There is going to have to be some form of bundled solution" to streaming, Shell told investors, adding that right 
now "they are sorting their way through the muck" of how streaming services are currently distributed.
Ellison also said that the Paramount+ platform needs to be overhauled and become more user-friendly, which can 
be done by improving the algorithms that make sure consumers get served the shows and movies they are most 
likely to watch.
Ellison has been a would-be Hollywood mogul for more than a decade. He built Skydance, a production company 
that was launched in 2010, into a powerful and profitable maker of big--budget movies and TV shows.
Although Hollywood is littered with the carcasses of scions with dreams of being a player, -Ellison and Skydance 
have thrived when much of the industry is in contraction.
Part of the reason for Skydance's success was that it positioned itself as something of a boutique purveyor of big-
budget fare for streamers such as Netflix and Prime. As other studios were shying away from selling to competitors 
to focus on building their own streaming platform, Skydance saw an opening.
People who have worked closely with Ellison say he is a soft-spoken and thoughtful executive and not a 
stereotypical billionaire's son. That doesn't mean he is a pushover. Ellison gets in the weeds of producing, and 
while his attention to detail is praised by those who have worked with him, some say he can be inflexible in a 
business often based on making compromises. Some of his mentors, including the late Steve Jobs and David 
Geffen, were cut from similar cloth.
Ellison is entrusting much of the day-to-day operation of the combined companies to Shell, for whom the deal 
represents something of a comeback. He left NBCUniversal in 2023 after admitting to an inappropriate relationship 
with a woman at the company. Shell joined RedBird Capital Partners earlier this year to lead its sports and 
entertainment businesses. Now, he will essentially hold the same position he held at NBCUniversal with a very 
similar portfolio of broadcast, cable, movie and television production and streaming assets.
For Skydance, explaining to investors the rationale behind the deal is key to potentially fending off shareholder 
lawsuits. Earlier this year, many of Paramount's non-voting shareholders expressed dismay about an earlier offer 
from Skydance, which they said was only good for Paramount controlling shareholder Shari Redstone.
Skydance will acquire National Amusements, Redstone's private company through which she controls Paramount, 
in a deal with an equity value of $US1.75bn. Then in a second step of the transaction, Paramount will acquire Page 3 of 3

Skydance at a valuation of around $US4.7bn. Skydance and its backers, including Larry Ellison and RedBird 
Capital Partners, will inject $US1.5bn into Paramount's balance sheet, which it can use to pay down debt.
