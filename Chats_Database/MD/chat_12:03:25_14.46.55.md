## User


You will be provided with a news media article and a company, topic or industry name. Here is the company or industry of interest: Shell. It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: "Yes" or "No". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:

Centrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.

If Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.

Walking past new hydraulic presses and orange robots handling semi-finished artillery shells, US Army Secretary 
Christine Wormuth had a question for a manufacturing company executive.
"Do the Russians have this technology?" Wormuth asked Ibrahim Kulekci, chief executive of the Turkish firm that 
designed and installed key machinery in the Mesquite, Texas plant.
Kulekci said they wouldn't get it from his firm. "Keep it that way," Wormuth responded.
The conflict in Ukraine has left the US military and allies wanting for shells and other firepower, triggering a push to 
quickly boost production. Long reliant on World War II-era plants, the Pentagon is spending $US6bn ($9bn) to 
revamp them with modern equipment and expand output at new facilities that can churn out a variety of munitions, 
from shells to mortars.
Armed with a slice of a $US1bn contract, defence contractor General Dynamics is leaning on complex machines to 
make ammu-nition faster and more efficiently.
When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the US each month produced about 14,000 of the commonly used 
155mm shells, which are about 60cm long and weigh about 45kg. Ukraine has been firing thousands of shells a day 
from US-made M777 howitzers, weapons designed to hit targets as far as 32km away.
The Pentagon is seeking to boost US output of 155mm shells from about 30,000 a month currently to 100,000 by 
the end of 2025. The Texas plant will take the nation more than halfway to that target, with the first of three 
production lines set to start this northern autumn.
The shell factory is among US efforts to bring home the production of materials deemed critical to national security, 
such as explosives, rare-earth minerals and semiconductors. Lockheed Martin is doubling output of its Javelin and 
Himars rockets at -facilities in Camden, Arkansas. A subsidiary of L3Harris Technologies is expanding a nearby 
solid rocket motor plant.

The push to quickly expand domestic manufacturing will rely heavily on foreign countries. -Machine tools and other 
critical gear needed to run domestic factories come from plants in countries such as Japan, Germany and Turkey. 
Defence supply chains that took decades to develop outside the US could take as long to replicate domestically, 
industry executives said.
The facility here is far removed from decades-old shell plants in the US that feature cacophonous clanking from 
ageing machines or fiery blast furnaces.
The new plant is quiet and compact, sitting next to a Frito-Lay distribution facility in a modern industrial park east of 
Dallas. General Dynamics targeted the Mesquite area as it operates a -munitions plant about 20km north in 
Garland, providing a trained workforce and access to nearby suppliers.
"You have all the elements here necessary to get the job done," General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic said.
Inside the plant, 9m green-painted presses fashion steel bars into the shape of shell casings. A small furnace heats 
the partly finished shells to 1090C, allowing them to be shaped more precisely. They are then transferred to cooling 
tunnels and quality-checked.
Most of the process is automated. Roughly 27 machine operators are required, with the bulk of the planned 
workforce of 400 focused on maintaining the computer-controlled equipment.
General Dynamics selected Repkon, whose headquarters are in Turkey, to supply the presses because no US-
based vendor could meet the deadline of having the plant up and running in two years.
Turkey has emerged as a big defence-equipment producer, including drones widely used in Ukraine. Its close ties 
with US defence companies were interrupted in 2019 when Turkey bought a Russian-made missile defence 
system, triggering its ejection from the F-35 fighter jet program. Diplomatic relations have since improved.
"Without the support from Turkey, this facility would be empty," Wormuth said after a plant tour with Novakovic.
The robots are made in Germany by Kuka. The firm was bought in 2016 by Midea, a Chinese appliance maker. The 
equipment wasn't subject to any of the sanctions imposed on some Chinese machinery and raw materials, an Army 
spokesman said.
"US companies could have -duplicated a lot of the machinery, but not quickly enough," said John Kelly, CEO of the 
US arm of Hanwha Defence. The South Korean company has worked with General Dynamics, though it was not 
involved in the Mesquite project.
The Texas plant is one link of the shell supply chain. The steel shell casings produced here are trucked to an Army 
plant in Iowa. There, the casings are packed with explosives made at facilities in Pennsylvania and Tennessee. 
When completed, the 155mm shells are shipped to Army warehouses or directly to Ukraine.
For years when the Pentagon needed to cut its budget, orders for munitions were among the first items on the 
chopping block. A different approach is under way, as the Pentagon seeks for the US to be self-sufficient in 
producing key ammunition.
