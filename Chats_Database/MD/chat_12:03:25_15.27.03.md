You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| Zoe Yujnovich | Director of integrated gas and upstream for Shell | "Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to market." | N.A. |
| Rick Wilkinson | Chief executive of consultancy EnergyQuest | "This makes no change at all to the supply-demand balance and the requirement for new gas to come on for the east coast of Australia." | N.A. |
| Cecile Wake | Shell Australia chairwoman | "At its core, this project promotes stronger regional communities, and it also has wider benefits for Australian manufacturing and industry more broadly." | N.A. |
| Zhengxin Peng | Chief executive of Arrow | "At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify Arrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast." | N.A. |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Shell.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Shell or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
