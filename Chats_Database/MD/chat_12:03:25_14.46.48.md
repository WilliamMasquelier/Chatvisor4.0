The Townsville Shell Club is getting its best finds ready for its annual Shell Show, showcasing various types of 
shells, marine art and photography.
Club president Jack Worsfold said the annual event was much-loved by the community, with hundreds attending 
over the two days.
"There's 150,000 species of shells and Queensland has 5000 or 6000 different marine seashells, so it's a 
fascination. There are so many beautiful types in many different shapes and sizes," he said.
"Many of our club members have large collections and have been enthusiasts their whole lives." Mr Worsfold said a 
competition would be held across the weekend, with 30 different category places up for grabs.
Other offerings will include art, educational and junior sections, as well as books and photography.
With Townsville just a step away from the Great Barrier Reef, Mr Worsfold said it was the "perfect place" to be 
interested in shells and marine life.
"We as a club have a big emphasis on showing our shells to the public," he said. "Shells are a great thing to collect, 
and it's accessible to anyone, especially with the beach on our doorstep." There will also be opportunities to buy 
shells and shell-related items, participate in raffles, obtain advice on shell collecting as a hobby, learn about shells, 
or have shells identified by local experts.
The Townsville Shell Club Show will be held on Saturday from 10am to 4pm and on Sunday from 9am to 2pm at 
the Orchid Society Hall in Kirwan. Entry is $3 for adults and $1 for children.
