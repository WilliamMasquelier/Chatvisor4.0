Philippe Mathieu's stance appears neutral to supportive of Shell, as his argument emphasizes the necessity of domestic oil production like Rosebank to avoid higher carbon costs from imports, suggesting a pragmatic rather than adversarial view; his position aligns with industry interests and has remained consistent, potentially reinforcing Shell's justification for continued oil projects, though it may also attract criticism from environmental groups who view such arguments as downplaying broader climate concerns.
