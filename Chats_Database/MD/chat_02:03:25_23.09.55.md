You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| Thonas Thune Andersen | CEO of Ørsted | "Het doel van Ørsted om in 2030 met al zijn windparkprojecten 50 gigawatt stroom te produceren wordt verlaagd naar 38 gigawatt." | "The goal of Ørsted to produce 50 gigawatts of electricity with all its wind farm projects by 2030 is being lowered to 38 gigawatts." |
| Christian Bruch | Director at Siemens | "Volgens directeur Christian Bruch maakten hogere materiaalkosten de exploitatie nog moeilijker, net als de gestegen rente." | "According to director Christian Bruch, higher material costs made operations even more difficult, just like the increased interest rates." |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Orsted.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Orsted or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
