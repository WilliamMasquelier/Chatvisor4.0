More than a quarter of Australian companies have banned artificial intelligence tools in the workplace, citing privacy 
concerns - including the potential for corporate secrets to be shared with competitors, according to a new study.
Communications technology titan Cisco surveyed more than 2600 security and privacy professionals across 12 
countries, finding businesses were unplugging the much-hyped technology - for now.
This is despite bigger businesses beginning to reap productivity gains from AI, which the Albanese government 
expects to inject up to $600bn a year into the national economy by 2030.
Cisco ANZ director of cybersecurity Corien Vermaak said trust remained a big obstacle to AI's widespread 
adoption.
Ms Vermaak said 27 per cent of Australian companies surveyed had banned the use of generative AI applications 
over privacy risks. Of them, 77 per cent were worried corporate information entered into AI apps could be shared 
publicly or with competitors, while 69 per cent were concerned it could hurt their legal or intellectual property rights.
"As we do security awareness training, we now need to focus on that narrative on AI as well," Ms Vermaak said.
"Where organisations are unsure, they've banned it. What that tells me is a lot of organisations are looking to put 
the controls in place, are looking to educate, message and see where they can improve their processes before 
allowing it. My sense would be over the next few years we will see that decreasing." While bigger companies have 
signed up to tailored enterprise AI products, like Microsoft's Copilot, which has guardrails built in to protect 
corporate data, others do not have a clear strategy, with employees at some using publicly available AI platforms, 
sometimes without their managers' knowledge.
"One of the examples in our framework is that when an employee uses any generative AI tool, they have to actually 
disclose it. And, and that's a really important thing, because it changes the perception of the receiver of that work," 
Ms Vermaak said.

"There's two things that organisations and companies need to start with. That is the education part, which is 
critically important. And then putting in policies and frameworks to put guardrails up for when is it OK to use it.
" 'Can I use ChatGPT? Yes, you can use it for private things on your work device, but you can't use it for any work-
related matters' if that is what the company's risk acceptance is." The Productivity Commission also found that low 
levels of public trust in AI technologies could pose a "significant barrier" to uptake. But, it said governments should 
act as "exemplars" to demonstrate the safe and effective uses of AI in service delivery. Collete Stallbaumer, general 
manager of Microsoft 365, said it was still early days and companies were moving at different speeds.

1. A significant 27% of Australian companies have prohibited the use of generative AI tools due to privacy concerns, as highlighted in a Cisco survey of over 2,600 security and privacy professionals. This indicates a cautious approach towards AI adoption in the corporate sector.

2. Cisco's ANZ director of cybersecurity, Corien Vermaak, emphasized that trust issues are a major barrier to AI's widespread implementation, with many organizations opting to ban AI until they can establish proper controls and educate their workforce.

3. The survey revealed that 77% of companies banning AI are worried about the potential exposure of corporate information, while 69% fear it could infringe on their legal or intellectual property rights, showcasing the critical privacy concerns surrounding AI technologies.

4. Cisco advocates for the development of policies and frameworks to guide the responsible use of AI in organizations, suggesting that education and clear guidelines are essential for mitigating risks associated with AI deployment.

5. The article notes that while larger companies are adopting tailored AI solutions with built-in safeguards, many smaller organizations lack a clear strategy, leading to unauthorized use of public AI platforms by employees, which raises further privacy and security issues.
