Barbara Zuiderwijk's statement highlights the challenges faced by the wind energy sector, particularly supply chain constraints and rising costs, without directly criticizing Ørsted, suggesting a neutral to slightly negative stance. While her view acknowledges the growing demand for green energy, the emphasis on supply chain limitations and price increases could contribute to concerns about Ørsted's ability to scale efficiently, potentially impacting investor confidence and market perception.
