Highlight: BP and Shell led Big Oil's push into renewable energy. Now they are leading the retreat.
Body
BP and Shell led Big Oil's push into renewable energy. Now they are leading the retreat.
Last week BP announced that it had sold its offshore wind assets into a joint venture with Japan's JERA, itself a 
joint venture between Tokyo Electric Power and Chubu Electric Power, to create one of the world's largest offshore 
wind businesses.
That followed an earlier BP announcement, in September, that it planned to sell its US onshore wind farms.
Under former chief executive, Bernard Looney, BP had been building its wind farm portfolio as part of an ambitious 
strategy to cut its hydrocarbon production by 40 per cent by 2030, reduce its emissions and those of its customers 
by 35 to 40 per cent by the end of this decade and become a "net zero"-emissions company by 2050.
Last year it started backing away from those commitments, saying it would cut production by only 25 per cent by 
2030 and its emissions by 20 to 30 per cent.
This year, under a new chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, it now appears even those reduced targets are being 
wound back.
It's not just BP.
Shell has scaled back its investment in renewables, including offshore wind and hydrogen; it has reduced its 
emissions' intensity targets and it has abandoned its objective of becoming the world's largest electricity company. 
Norway's energy giant, Equinor, has also announced plans to shrink its renewable energy division.
As they retreat from their push into renewable energy and downgrade their ambitions to build major exposures to 
electricity generation, the UK and European oil companies are refocusing on their traditional oil and gas 
businesses.
Where previously they planned to cap or reduce their production, now they are planning and investing to increase it.

Big Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare
Last year BP raised its forecast of oil equivalent production from 1.5 billion barrels a day by 2030 to 2 million barrels 
a day, planning to invest $US8 billion ($12.6 billion) more than previously budgeted on new oil and gas investments. 
Since Auchincloss became CEO, that focus on lifting hydrocarbon production has intensified.
The commercial logic in what they are doing is clear. BP generates returns of 15 to 20 per cent on its fossil fuel 
investments but only 6 to 8 per cent from its renewable assets, with wind's returns inferior to solar's.
Ploughing billions each year into wind, solar and hydrogen dilutes the overall returns on capital and reduces the 
returns to shareholders, making them most unhappy. Having invested about $US18 billion over the past five years 
in lower-returning renewables between them, BP and Shell investors have become increasingly unhappy.
Moreover, the UK and European energy majors are always compared with their US counterparts.
Exxon and Chevron haven't been anywhere near as committed to lowering the carbon intensity of their portfolios as 
their transatlantic rivals. The US majors were committed to the "drill, baby, drill" mantra before Donald Trump and 
saw that reflected in their share price relativities with their UK and European counterparts.
Where, over the past five years, Exxon's share price has risen 54 per cent and Chevron's 23 per cent, BP's has 
fallen 22 per cent and Shell's more than 6 per cent. That kind of disparity in performance tends to galvanise 
shareholders, along with executives motivated by their remuneration.
By moving its offshore wind assets into a joint venture vehicle and off its own balance sheet BP will keep an 
exposure to wind but significantly reduce the amounts of capital devoted to it and the levels of debt supporting it.
Between them, BP and JERA plan to spend up to $US5.8 billion on their combined portfolios (which includes the 
proposed Blue Mackerel offshore wind farm in Bass Strait) by the end of 2030. With shared investment and non-
recourse funding, BP's capital commitment will be modest relative to what it would otherwise have been.
Both BP and Shell still seem committed to solar, which is less capital intensive than wind, but that won't help them 
escape the criticism from climate activist groups and ESG (environmental, social and governance) investors, who 
are particularly vocal and litigious in Europe and the UK.
The problem, of course, is that the companies can't satisfy both constituencies and in a contest between emissions 
and returns is one that ultimately shareholders will always win.
With Trump about to return to the White House and open up US federal lands to more drilling for oil and gas, and 
the incoming Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, having a "3-3-3" plan that includes lifting US energy production by 
three million barrels of oil equivalent a day, the contrast between the environment for the US producers and their 
competitors elsewhere will only become starker and the pressure from shareholders on companies like BP and 
Shell will only intensify.
Trump also plans to remove the generous 10-year tax credits for renewables within Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction 
Act, which, if he is successful, would make the returns from investment in US renewables even less competitive 
with those from fossil fuels.
Any increase in US oil production would add to the existing glut in the oil market and depress prices that are already 
under pressure, despite the withdrawal of about six million barrels a day of supply by the OPEC+ cartel.
The lower prices being experienced now and likely to continue into at least the first half of next year, however, 
aren't an argument for the oil majors to invest in renewables.
Returns from oil and gas will still be superior to those from renewables and, if oil and gas prices and profits are 
under pressure, there will be even more of an incentive to invest only in the highest-returning assets.
Those who invest purely in renewables appear unconcerned about the gradual withdrawal of the oil majors who 
gatecrashed their sector and, seeking to gain scale rapidly, drove up the costs of developing greenfields projects.Page 3 of 3
Big Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare
Ploughing billions each year into wind, solar and hydrogen dilutes the overall returns on capital and reduces the 
returns to shareholders, making them most unhappy.
There are a lot of environmentally-sensitive and patient investment funds available from sources other than the oil 
majors that are willing to trade off returns for their convictions and/or consistent long-term returns, so losing some 
investment from the oil companies shouldn't retard renewables developments.
It was always going to be difficult for BP and Shell to try to produce a balance of their traditional oil and gas 
businesses and renewable energy portfolios while satisfying both financially-motivated and ESG-driven investors.
It has been particularly difficult for the UK and Europeans, with their lower returns but better environmental 
credentials, to attract investors in the US. There's been a backlash against ESG investing in the US where, 
because there is no significant stigma associated with the oil and gas industry, valuation metrics tend to be higher.
If BP and Shell want better access to those more attractive metrics, improved share price performances and 
access to cheaper capital, they have no realistic option but to shed, and invest less in, low-returning assets. That's 
what they are now doing.

With two flights narrowly escaping disaster just months apart, Alaska Airlines was again in the national spotlight 
over the weekend, this time with a "Saturday Night Live" skit.
Featuring "Saltburn" star Jacob Elordi and "SNL" regulars Kenan Thompson and Heidi Gardner, the skit, which 
aired last weekend, parodied an Alaska Airlines ad. "Our new slogan is 'Alaska Airlines: You didn't die, and you got

Embraer starts E190F flight testing
Converted freighter makes maiden sortie, as airframer touts potential of civil cargo role for C-390 military transport
Alfred Chua Sao Jose dos Campos
Howard Hardee Sacramento
Embraer has performed the first flight of its passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion, with the modified E190 taking 
to the skies over Sao Jose dos Campos on 5 April.
The E190F – a 2010-built example first operated by Avianca El Salvador – flew for about 2h, allowing the Embraer 
team to complete an ­initial evaluation of the aircraft. A second sortie followed five days later.
The jet will undergo further flight testing ­before being delivered to US lessor Regional One, ­Embraer says.
Previously, the company had stated its intention to deliver the E190F in the second quarter of 2024.
“We are very pleased with E190F’s and E195F’s fast progress during the testing period,” says Embraer chief 
­executive Francisco Gomes Neto.....

Vervolg van pagina 1
Philips maakte de schikking gisterochtend bekend, gelijktijdig met de presentatie van zijn cijfers over het eerste 
kwartaal. In het akkoord erkent Philips geen schuld voor mogelijke schade bij patiënten, die vreesden dat ze 
kanker, astma en andere aandoeningen hadden opgelopen door het gebruik van de Philips-apparaten. Het 
concern kondigde gisteren ook aan dat zijn verzekeraars ruim €0,5 mrd van de kosten zullen vergoeden.
De schikking betreft zowel de claims voor medische schade als voor medische controle voor patiënten. 
Claimadvocaten hadden meer dan 760 zaken aangebracht. Nog eens 60.000 patiënten hadden zich laten 
registreren om in een later stadium aanspraak te kunnen maken op een vergoeding. Hoeveel geld afzonderlijke 
patiënten ontvangen, is nog niet duidelijk. Het is aan de advocaten om het totaalbedrag onder hun cliënten te 
verdelen. Philips heeft zich stevig verweerd tegen de schadeclaims. Volgens het bedrijf is uit onderzoek gebleken 
dat de uitstoot van schadelijke stoffen te gering was om ernstige gezondheidsschade te kunnen veroorzaken. 
Philips stemde toch in met een schikking omdat de uitkomst van rechtszaken moeilijk te voorspellen is. In het 
Amerikaanse rechtssysteem kunnen jury's soms onverwacht grote schadevergoedingen toekennen. Eerder 
bereikte Philips al een akkoord over economische schade voor patiënten, evenals een schikkingsakkoord met de 
Amerikaanse medische toezichthouder, de FDA. Met de nieuwe, tweeledige schikking zijn de totale kosten voor het 
afhandelen van de apneuaffaire opgelopen tot €5,2 mrd, zo blijkt uit berekeningen van het FD.....
