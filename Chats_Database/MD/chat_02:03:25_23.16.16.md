You are tasked with adding English translations to a set of stakeholder quotes. For each quote:
- If the quote is in English, add "N.A." as the translation
- If the quote is in any other language, provide an accurate English translation

Input format is a markdown table with stakeholder names and quotes.
Output should be a markdown table with three columns: name, original quote, and translation.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Never translate English quotes to English - use "N.A." instead.
- Only and always translate non-English quotes.
- If the original quote, in the third column of the md table is not in english, translate it and add the tranlsation in the 4th column, as described below, but that is only when the quote is not in English.
- Keep original quotes exactly as they are.
- Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Example input:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision est importante." |
| John Smith | Orsted's corporate lawyer | "We need to review this carefully." |

Example output:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision est importante." | "This decision is important." |
| John Smith | Orsted's corporate lawyer | "We need to review this carefully." | N.A. |

If the input is "None", return "None".

Input quotes:
| Dr Natalie Hicks | Researcher at University of Essex | "There are not enough specialist scientific vessels to gather the evidence in time, so collaborating with industry is key to gathering data." |
| A CEFAS spokesman | Spokesman for CEFAS | "Too often we make assumptions about what is occurring in our marine environment when considering human activities, we need the type of research activity highlighted here to determine whether our assumptions are correct and to provide more confidence in our understanding." |
| Professor David Paterson | Professor at University of St Andrews | "It’s important we take learnings from the oil and gas industry on the environmental effects of oil and gas operations and decommissioning and effectively apply these to the offshore wind industry as projects mature towards later life phases." |
| Spokesman for Orsted | Spokesman for Orsted | "Developing renewable energy in harmony with nature is both possible and necessary to address the twin challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss." |
