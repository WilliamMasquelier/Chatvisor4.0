## Assistant

Carla Joustra maintains a neutral stance towards Shell, acknowledging the company's special responsibility as a major oil and gas entity while also emphasizing the limitations of imposing a broad 45% reduction target, suggesting a consistent and balanced judicial approach that may temper the immediate reputational or operational impact on Shell by framing the ruling within legal constraints rather than activist demands.
