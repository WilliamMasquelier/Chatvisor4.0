Katsuya Nakanishi's statement is neutral, as it does not express direct support or criticism towards Ørsted but rather indicates uncertainty regarding project timelines. This neutrality suggests a cautious stance that, while not damaging Ørsted’s reputation, could contribute to uncertainty among stakeholders and investors if delays or lack of clarity persist.
