show for the last night of 2024.

Is your New Year's resolution to try new venues, or to be more spontaneous? Start now with these 14 events 
across Sydney where you can walk in, or still make a booking (if you're quick). There's water views, champagne 
deals, and killer-value set menus to get the party started. 
Genzo
Our pick to celebrate the year's final moments is this bold Japanese diner. In the new Walker Street precinct, 
Genzo is the perfect pit stop for those on their way to see the fireworks on the lower north shore. The neon, 
colourfully lit space and group-friendly modern Japanese menu is a guaranteed hit. Kids eat free between 5pm and 
6pm, and if you pre-order a bottle of MoÃ«t & Chandon, you'll get upgraded to a Magnum.
Price: A la carte menu
Walk-ins available or book here. 168 Walker Street, North Sydney

Odd Culture
Our favourite fermentation-forward bar is doing New Year's Eve in their signature cool and carefree style. Follow 
the sound of DJs spinning vinyl down to Odd Culture from noon into the night (no booking required!) for a bite from 
their small but perfectly formed snack menu, where oysters, and their well-loved cucumber with whipped tofu are 
highlights. For something more substantial, get around their cheeseburger on pillowy potato rolls.
Price: A la carte menu
Walk-ins only. 266 King Street, Newtown 
Felons Brewing Co.

Watch the final 2024 sunset over North Harbour, then have front-row seats to Manly's 9pm fireworks at Felons. 
Book now to lock in a set menu feast to send off the year for $149 per person. It includes an arrival drink, and 
summery dishes like scallop and tuna crudo, and passionfruit pavlova. Or just rock up at any time and dance the 
night away to the disco tunes of Groove City. 
Price: A la carte menu, or $149 set menu including a welcome drink

Loam
Hidden in plain sight in the foyer of the Ace Hotel, Loam is a gem for cool, casual catch-ups with a bit of class. 
Come here for your New Year's Eve celebrations if you want the vibes of a chilled-out, fashionable house party 
without the hosting responsibilities. An a la carte menu is available, and we're keen to try their summery specials 
such as stracciatella with grilled peaches and pistachio pesto, and grilled Yamba prawns with Calabrian chilli butter. 
Cheers to that with a chilled red or an olive leaf martini.
Price: A la carte menu
Walk-ins available or book here. 47/53 Wentworth Avenue, Sydney 
Taphouse 
If you're after a celebratory feast that's more budget than blow-out, head to the roof of Darlinghurst boozer the 
Taphouse and choose between their Chinese a la carte and banquet menu. The banquet menu hits all the nostalgic 
classics, including the Irish fave the spice bag that blew up this year. Their a la carte menu offers more NYE-worthy 
centrepieces such as wok-fried mud crab. For a bit of extra fun, trivia will be running in the Public Bar, so grab your 
team and get ready to test your knowledge as you sip and snack the night away.
Price: A la carte menu or $65 per person banquet menu

Nick & Nora's
If you want a bit of Gatsby glamour, this rooftop bar is just the place to celebrate New Year's Eve. Head up to level 
26 from 4pm onwards to enjoy city views, and their extensive drinks list where champagne, whiskey, and cocktails 
reign supreme. In a Cinderella-meets-Australia moment, try their "champagne shoey". Order any bottle of 
champagne, and drink it from specially made glass shoes. For food, their globe-spanning a la carte and set menu 
will be available for $70 per person.
Price: A la carte menu or $70 per person set menu

Otto 
Beyond the million-dollar water views, Otto is the perfect spot to catch the last sun rays of 2024. Those with packed 
NYE agendas can take advantage of the Italian stalwart's full a la carte menu at their first seating at 5pm. From 
7.30pm, diners will be offered a four-course menu, plus a glass of champagne on arrival. Standouts include 
zucchini flowers filled with scallops and prawn and wagyu chuck tail flap MBS 9+ steak. Page 3 of 5

Junda Khoo's supercharged Malaysian "playground" has a luxurious a la carte menu that seems like it was made 
for celebrating New Year's Eve. Go all out with jasmine rice smoked oysters and bone marrow roti, or choose your 
own adventure with a selection of finessed Malaysian sauces to accompany NT mud crab and WA marron. That is, 
if you can look past the expertly executed classics such as Hainanese chicken and swimmer crab char kwai teow. 
Banquet menus are also on offer if it all sounds too good to make a decision. 
Price: A la carte menu, or $98/$128 per person for the banquet menu.

preserved lemon. Their second option is bookended with luxurious seafood starters like oysters and their "scallops 
on scallops" dish, and a cheese platter.
