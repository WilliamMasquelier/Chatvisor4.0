You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| Katsuya Nakanishi | CEO of Mitsubishi | "Op dit moment is het niet mogelijk om iets te zeggen over de opleverdatum of de start van de bouw." | "At this moment, it is not possible to say anything about the delivery date or the start of construction." |
| Not mentioned | Not mentioned | "Ørsted, de grootste windparkontwikkelaar ter wereld, schroeft investeringen terug, maakte het gisteren bekend." | "Ørsted, the largest wind farm developer in the world, announced yesterday that it is scaling back investments." |
| Thijs Berkelder | Analyst at ABN Amro Oddo BHF | "Die hebben eigen installatieschepen en een vrij sterke balans, waardoor ze zich door deze neergaande markt moeten kunnen slaan." | "They have their own installation vessels and a fairly strong balance sheet, which should allow them to weather this declining market." |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Orsted.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Orsted or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
