The Norwegian state-backed oil company that is attempting to develop one of the largest untapped oil fields in 
British waters has dramatically scaled back its investment in renewables and raised its fossil fuel production 
targets, becoming the latest of the world's energy giants to resist the push towards green power.
Equinor, which changed its name from Statoil in 2018, has said it will halve its spending on renewable energy 
projects to $US5bn between this year and 2027, excluding project financing, and has cut its target to grow clean 
power capacity from 7 gigawatts to 10-12GW by 2030, from a previous goal of 12-16GW.
It aims to produce 2.2 million barrels of oil a day by the end of the decade, up from about 2 million barrels 
previously forecast.
The decision makes the Oslo-based group the latest of the world's oil and gas giants to dilute renewables 
ambitions. BP, the FTSE 100 constituent, is set to unwind 2030 targets to cut oil and gas production targets and 
drop its low-carbon deployment goal when it updates its capital allocation strategy later this month.
Equinor chief executive Anders Opedal said that cutting capital expenditure on renewables would help address 
challenges in the offshore wind industry, and increase "value creation". The company expects to produce free 
cashflow of $US23bn by 2027, $US11n of which will be returned to shareholders as dividends.
In December, Equinor combined its British oil and gas assets with Shell under a new 50-50 joint venture, which 
they claimed would create the largest independent producer in the maturing North Sea.
However, its ambitions in the North Sea were dealt a blow last week when the Scottish courts quashed consent for 
Rosebank, which is co-owned by Ithaca Energy, and Shell's Jackdaw field after a legal challenge brought by the 
campaign groups Greenpeace and Uplift against the government's decision in 2023 to greenlight the projects.
Shell's Jackdaw gas field and Equinor's Rosebank oilfield must now reapply for government permission because 
their original approvals failed to consider the emissions that will be generated when the oil and gas is burnt.

Oil group Equinor cuts green spending
However, the companies have been allowed to continue development work in the meantime. Equinor has spent 
Ã‚Â£2.2bn on Rosebank so far.
Philippe Mathieu, executive vice-president for exploration and production international, said that the project would 
contribute to Britain's growth agenda and create about 2000 jobs in the construction phase.
The fate of the fields will be a test of the government's approach to the North Sea. British Energy Secretary Ed 
Miliband has vowed to stop issuing new North Sea oil and gas licences and described Rosebank as a "colossal 
waste of taxpayer money and climate vandalism" while in opposition.
Mr Mathieu said the project would boost domestically produced oil and gas and reduce reliance on imports.
"If you don't have Rosebank oil for the UK, then you have to import it from somewhere else â€¦ how much CO2 is 
that going to cost?" he said. The Times

Highlight: Australia's top gas shippers forecast a huge lift in demand over the next decade, even as debate 
continues about the role of gas in the clean energy shift.
Body
Australia's biggest oil and gas exporters forecast a significant lift in demand for liquefied gas over the next decade, 
even as debate continues about the role of the fossil fuel in the transition to cleaner energy.
Shell, which produces natural gas off the coast of Western Australia and in Queensland, bumped up its long-term 
demand predictions last week, saying it now expects the world's consumption of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to 
increase 60 per cent by 2040 amid faster economic growth in Asia.
The energy giant's revised outlook for LNG is 10 percentage points higher than at the same time last year
"China is significantly increasing its LNG import capacity and aims to add piped gas connections for 150 million 
people by 2030 to meet increasing demand," Shell said. "India is also moving ahead with building natural gas 
infrastructure and adding gas connections to 30 million people over the next five years."
Woodside, the largest Australian LNG producer, said Asian population growth, economic development and rising 
living standards would underpin a demand increase of at least 50 per cent by 2034. At the same time, a wave of 
new LNG projects threatening to cause a glut in coming years was unlikely to materialise as quickly as first thought 
because of delays faced by developers, the company said.
"Asia is going to be the engine room for LNG growth," Woodside chief executive Meg O'Neill said.
LNG - natural gas super-chilled down to a liquid so it can be loaded onto special ships - is one of Australia's biggest 
exports, raking in at least $64 billion in revenue this financial year. Demand and prices for Australia's LNG, which is 
mainly sold to Japan, China, Taiwan and South Korea, surged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 as 
efforts to replace Russian piped gas to Europe unleashed a global scramble for spare shipments of the fuel to keep 
lights and heaters on.
While gas remains widely used in electricity generation, heating and manufacturing, its longer-term demand could 
vary significantly depending on how aggressively the world decides to ratchet up goals to slash planet-heating 
greenhouse gas emissions.

Asia wants to cut emissions, so why is it still buying so much Australian gas?
According to some forecasts of how the energy transition could play out, gas demand may be driven sharply higher 
for its use as a "transition" fuel - one that's cleaner than coal, but can still be used to back up intermittent 
renewables during periods of low wind and sunlight.
But other pathways suggest the role of gas could be limited, especially if Asian nations pursue plans to reduce the 
use of fossil fuels in their electrical grids and if the world doubles down on efforts to electrify the economy as much 
as possible.
Woodside said it believed LNG, rather than being negatively affected by the shift to lower-carbon energy, would be 
increasingly needed to decarbonise Asia, as governments and utilities stepped up efforts to cut emissions by 
replacing coal-fired generators with gas-powered plants, which are less-emitting.
"If just 20 per cent of Asia's coal-fired power stations switched to gas, it would reduce carbon emissions by 680 
million tonnes a year," O'Neill said. "That's more than one-and-a-half times Australia's annual net greenhouse gas 
emissions."
But forecasts of significant growth overlook the risk of several "tangible barriers", said Christopher Doleman, an 
analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, which discourages further investment in LNG.
While Shell identifies coal-to-gas switching as a key driver of LNG demand growth, Doleman said the cost of LNG 
was likely to limit its ability to displace coal across Asia. One-off deliveries of LNG cargoes in Asia are selling for 
around $US13 per million British thermal units today.
"LNG prices would likely need to fall into the $US4-5 range to compete with coal, a level that is too low for LNG 
facilities to earn an adequate rate of return," Doleman said.
Vietnam had reduced the scale of its LNG-to-power plans in a recent update, he said. Meanwhile, LNG demand in 
Japan, the biggest customer of Australian cargoes, had fallen 20 per cent since 2018 and could fall further under its 
plans to cut thermal electricity generation from 70 per cent of the energy mix to a range of 30-40 per cent by 2040, 
he said.
Although demand remains uncertain, investment analysts expect an influx of new LNG to hit the market later this 
decade as new projects come online in the US and Qatar, and raise the risk of an oversupply.
"We expect a tight LNG market in 2025 with global balances estimated to be in deficit ... before moving into balance 
in 2026 and an accelerating surplus from 2027," UBS analyst Tom Allen said.

Body
Shell is exploring a potential sale of its chemicals assets in Europe and the US, part of a continuing drive to refocus 
the company's business on its most profitable operations.
The oil and gas company is working with bankers at Morgan Stanley on a strategic review of its chemicals 
operations. The process is in the early stages and Shell has yet to commit to any final decisions.
Among the assets included in the review is Shell's Deer Park -facility in Texas. The site produces a range of 
chemicals such as light and heavy olefins, which can be used to make pharmaceuticals, detergents, adhesives and 
wire coating. The operation is -located adjacent to a refinery, which Shell previously sold its stake in. Shell also has 
chemical facilities in Pennsylvania and Louisiana in the US, and in -Europe it has plants in the UK, Germany and 
The Netherlands.
Potential bidders for the assets could range from private-equity firms to Middle Eastern buyers wanting to expand 
into the West.
Since chief executive Wael Sawan took the helm of Shell at the start of 2023, the company has worked to focus 
more on its most profitable operations. To that end, the company has rolled back some of its green-energy targets 
and pledged to pump more oil and gas. Shell's chemicals business has been seen as lagging behind for years. It is 
capital-heavy and subject to cyclical ups and downs, resulting in losses in recent years that have weighed on the 
company's overall performance. Anaemic gas prices and rising capacity in chemical manufacturing have caused 
the petrochemical market to languish recently. The company has already signalled its willingness to shed lower-
margin chemicals operations. Last year, it struck a deal to sell its chemicals park in Singapore to a joint venture that 
includes Glencore, the mining company, and Chandra Asri, an Indonesia-based chemicals producer.
