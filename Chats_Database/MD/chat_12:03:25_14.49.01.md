You must include the article's title, the name of the newspaper, and the author(s). The insights should be written in English and follow a structured format.

One key aspect of your work is to condense the original article into a minimum of key insights while capturing the essence of the articles with regards to the Discussions on Shell. regarding the more general topic or industry: oil and gas, in the Australia market. We specifically look for insights that relate to Shell in that context..
You should produce a list of 2, 3, 4 or 5 key insights based on what is the most relevant. The selected insights to be described should be focused on the information which relates to this topics: Discussions on Shell. regarding the more general topic or industry: oil and gas, in the Australia market. We specifically look for insights that relate to Shell in that context..

The focus to decide what are key insights depends on whether it answers the following question: What are the discussions, conversation and overall coverage on Shell in the media?

Shell, one of the world's largest energy companies, has quietly shelved plans to develop an offshore wind project in 
Victoria, as it implements its strategy to invest in less capital-intensive, -mature forms of electricity generation.
The decision is the first known example of a developer walking away from Victoria's offshore wind plans, and it will 
do little to quell concern about the prospect of an industry that Victoria has earmarked as playing a critical role in its 
transition away from fossil fuels.
Victoria in 2022 set a target of generating about 20 per cent of its energy needs from offshore wind within a decade. 
The target then doubles to 4GW by 2035 and 9GW by 2040. In all, Victoria sees potential for 13GW of offshore 
wind capacity by 2050, five times the current renewable generation in Victoria.
The target drew a plethora of some of the world's largest global energy companies to submit an application for a so-
called feasibility licence, and Shell was understood to have been told late last year that it was in line to -secure a 
permit if it could overcome a boundary dispute.
Untangling the dispute was seen as inevitable, but Shell determined it would not proceed with its initial application 
as it delivers on chief executive Wael Sawan's commitment to be "ruthless" in focusing on financial performance. A 
Shell spokeswoman -confirmed the decision, but said the company remained confident in the viability of offshore 
wind in Australia.
"After careful consideration, including more than two years of pre-feasibility work, Shell Australia withdrew from the 
feasibility licence application process for offshore wind development in Gippsland, Victoria earlier this year," a 
spokeswoman said.
"In Australia, Shell is focusing on growing our low-carbon -energy portfolio including via -onshore wind and battery 
energy storage projects. Australia's abundant offshore wind resources have strong -potential to help Australia 
achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and Shell continues to have confidence in the establishment of a sustainable 
Australian offshore wind industry." Despite Shell's public commitment to the industry, Australia's offshore wind 
industry was expected to be extremely expensive, industry sources said. While the industry expected costs to come

down, industry sources said current projections had new projects costing about $300 per megawatt, well in excess 
of the current wholesale price of about $120.
Offshore wind is substantially more expensive than onshore wind and solar, and Shell is understood to have 
developed plans to focus instead on onshore alternatives.
There are also substantial costs associated with moving towards a final investment decision associated with 
offshore wind.
The 12 projects granted a feasibility licence by the federal Labor government will now begin seabed and 
environmental studies to confirm the suitability for an offshore wind project.
Should all projects proceed to construction, the industry is also concerned about winners being picked.
The 12 projects that have -secured a feasibility licence have a combined capacity of 25GW, nearly double the target 
Victoria has offered to underwrite.
Sources familiar with the thinking of the Victorian government acknowledge that not all the 12 projects are likely to -
materialise and those that do will be ready at different times.
Victoria plans to incrementally stimulate developments. It has scheduled staggered so-called contract for different 
auditions that will determine how much fin-ancial support is offered to developers.
There are concerns about Victoria's capacity to pay as the state budget deficit increases. However, the industry 
acknowledges that offshore wind is vital for the country's transition.
Victoria has Australia's most aggressive climate goals. Victoria plans to have zero emission sources account for 95 
per cent of its energy needs by 2035 and to be net zero by 2045.
The target is likely to end the use of coal in the state, with EnergyAustralia's Yallourn set to close in 2028, while the 
state's largest, AGL Energy's Loy Yang A, is expected to shutter in 2035.
A Victorian government spokesman said: "We're building Australia's first offshore wind energy industry and learning 
from global leaders in the sector to ensure our auction process is competitive and results in the timely delivery of 
projects.
"It is normal for developers to explore projects and then stop work on them, for a variety of reasons internal to their 
business." He said the 12 approved offshore wind projects could "generate 25GW of electricity - more than enough 
to meet Victoria's energy needs".

1. Shell has withdrawn from its offshore wind project in Victoria, marking the first instance of a developer abandoning plans in the state's offshore wind sector, which is crucial for its transition away from fossil fuels.

2. The decision aligns with Shell's strategy under CEO Wael Sawan to prioritize financial performance and invest in less capital-intensive energy projects, shifting focus towards onshore wind and battery energy storage instead of offshore wind.

3. Despite Shell's public commitment to the offshore wind industry, the high costs associated with offshore projects—estimated at $300 per megawatt—pose significant challenges, especially compared to the current wholesale price of $120 per megawatt.

4. The Victorian government acknowledges the need for a competitive auction process for the 12 offshore wind projects that have received feasibility licenses, but there are concerns about the state's budget deficit and its ability to support these developments financially.
