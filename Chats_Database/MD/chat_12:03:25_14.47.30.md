Highlight: Fossil fuel producers are buying large stakes in carbon companies and land to run their own carbon 
offset projects. Experts and insiders want that banned.
Body
Large fossil fuel companies are making multimillion-dollar investments in carbon companies and offset projects, 
raising concerns among industry insiders and experts that the sector is funding lowest-cost and lower-quality 
emission offsets, rather than tackling climate change as was intended.
An investigation by this masthead has found fossil fuel companies, including Shell and Woodside, are increasingly 
entering the supply chain of the Australian carbon offsets market, buying stakes in carbon companies, registering 
projects, trading credits or purchasing swathes of land to run their own carbon abatement projects.

Under the federal government's flagship policy for reducing industrial emissions, the country's top polluters can 
achieve all required emissions reductions through buying Australian carbon credits. Experts question allowing those 
polluters to have a role in the creation and sale of those credits.
"The guys who are doing the emitting, are now getting profits from the solution? It couldn't be more perverse. 
They're profiting from the problem they created," said Daryl Killin, who previously held senior roles at major carbon 
companies Select Carbon and Natural Carbon.
The criticisms came as an investigation by this masthead revealed allegations of carbon companies using long-term 
contracts to sign traditional owners into unfair deals, and of the industry watchdog, the Clean Energy Regulator 
(CER), having chronic problems managing conflicts of interest.
Global petroleum giant Shell's subsidiary, Shell Energy Environmental Products Australia, lists its primary activity 
as to "carry out trading" of Australian credits. Its profit in 2021 was $3.4 million, followed by losses of $2.8 million 
and $2.2 million in 2022 and 2023.
The Shell subsidiary also became a 25.1 per cent shareholder of Corporate Carbon last year in a $14 million deal 
that included a $7.25 million funding injection from its parent company, Shell Energy Holdings Australia. Its latest 
annual report said the acquisition would give Shell "significant influence over its business decisions".

Corporate Carbon managing director Gary Wyatt said Shell converted an investment in its Queensland offset 
projects into the shareholding which allowed Shell to nominate one board director.
Wyatt, who previously ran ANZ Bank's energy trading desk, said carbon credits "fill a small bridging role" in climate 
policy and called for greater government regulation to reduce emissions across the broader economy. He said the 
fossil fuel industry should not be blamed for emissions.
"It's not a problem they [the fossil fuel industry] created," he said. "It's a problem that's been created by us choosing 
to live the lifestyle that we do, which has resulted in the consumption of a large amount of fossil fuels. We've all 
benefited from that lifestyle, but it's created a problem. But to point to the energy producers and say, you've created 
this problem, is a very narrow framing."
Wyatt was "not comfortable" answering questions about what benefits Shell's shareholding delivered for the petrol 
giant, but conceded the company may achieve "cheaper outcomes" and "secure volumes" of carbon credits.
A Shell spokesperson said "offsets are used only where emissions cannot be avoided" and that part-owning 
Corporate Carbon allowed it to "maximise quality and integrity" of projects that "deliver wider benefits to the 
environment and local communities".
Shell fully acquired another carbon company, Select Carbon, in 2020.
Land titles obtained by this masthead show ASX-listed oil and gas giant Woodside's subsidiary, Woodside Energy 
Carbon Services, owns 72 property titles in NSW and 41 titles in Western Australia to run offset projects.
It has nine carbon projects registered with the CER, using the reforestation method which involves planting native 
trees. These projects have been issued more than 840,000 carbon credits since 2013. Dozens of other polluters 
have registered carbon projects, including Santos, Inpex and Tokyo Gas Australia.
A spokesperson for Woodside said its carbon business was established in 2018 to "better manage the cost and 
integrity of our carbon credits" and it was "open to considering an investment in a carbon developer but is pleased 
with our carbon business's capability today".
"Woodside's priority is avoiding and reducing emissions," the spokesperson said.
However, Woodside's decarbonisation strategy has been routinely rejected by investors as undermining 
international climate agreements. A historic 58 per cent of shareholders voted against the plan in April over 
concerns the company was expanding gas projects, relying too heavily on offsets and failing to cut key emissions.
International conglomerates are also players in the local carbon market. Mitsubishi bought a 40 per cent stake in 
Australian Integrated Carbon in 2021, and Mitsui invested in Climate Friendly in 2022.
A former staff member at Climate Friendly, who declined to be named because they feared retribution, quit last year 
after becoming uncomfortable with the influence of Mitsui and private equity firm Adamantem.
"The shift went from mum and dad farmers, helping those people into the scheme, to maximising profits for 
shareholders ... How do we grow the business to make sure Adamantem are happy?"
The staff member questioned the company's leadership about the new investors and was told Mitsui helped Climate 
Friendly by establishing connections with fossil fuel industry customers, both in Australia and abroad.
"What does Climate Friendly get out of it? It's the relationships," they said. "Within the industry, you need to know 
who is buying and selling. To sell that volume of ACCUs you need the relationship. It was millions of dollars of 
trades."
The employee said these relationships paid off and there was an unprecedented rise in Climate Friendly's trading 
volumes after the Mitsui investment.Page 3 of 4

"The trades were massive, like nothing we had seen before ... That's fine for a one-off, then it started happening 
more frequently. And I was like: 'Is this going be the trajectory of the business?'"
Climate Friendly co-executive officers Skye Glenday and Josh Harris released a joint statement saying the 
company's purpose had not changed from "profit-for-purpose" and "tackling climate change" through supporting 
carbon farming.
They said Adamantem's investment had allowed staff to increase from 30 to 100 people and "scale up our positive 
climate change impacts" and said Mitsui had a "strong decarbonisation plan" that had no influence on the company 
strategy.
"Our driving purpose is to decarbonise Australia's land sector, which is responsible for about 20 per cent of the 
nation's greenhouse gas emissions," they said in a joint statement.
 "Our staff are clear on Climate Friendly's purpose and mission, and are united by the urgent need to scale up 
carbon farming in line with the International Panel on Climate Change's call for the world to rapidly expand carbon 
sequestration." 
This masthead can also reveal the Australian Academy of Sciences (AAS) raised concerns with the CER in 2022 
that the $4.5 billion taxpayer-backed Emissions Reduction Fund had become too focused on supporting the 
growing carbon industry rather than abating emissions.
"Over the decade of the [Emissions Reduction Fund] operation, the scheme has become less of a climate policy 
instrument and more of an industry policy mechanism," according to an internal CER email obtained by this 
masthead under freedom of information summarising "key take-outs" from the Academy's review.
"There is a need to reinforce that the ACCU [Australian Carbon Credit Unit] scheme is fundamentally for the 
removal, and avoidance, of greenhouse gas emissions."
The scientists identified "several concerns or limitations" with two of the most common methods, avoided 
deforestation and human-induced regeneration (HIR), which rely on "counterfactuals" and unreliable data that 
makes the scheme "vulnerable to integrity accusations" and "accusations of doing little to prevent carbon leakage".
Killin said these projects dominate the market because they were cheap to run, reducing costs for polluters while 
boosting profits for the carbon "gatekeepers" that own most projects and make money from trading credits.
"We've got a cartel running the industry in Australia," said Killin. "We've had fossil fuel companies running climate 
policy in this country for decades. Carbon is no different."
In an unpublished submission to the Chubb review, Killin said barriers to entry and poor policy had made it 
"excruciatingly painful" to run small-scale projects that use robust methods, such as tree planting and savannah 
burning. He called for carbon companies to split up and for fossil fuel investment in supply to be banned.
"I am a well-informed industry insider who knows how the market really runs, rather than the 'sweetness and light' 
that are regularly portrayed to the public," the submission states.
"We need real carbon abatement policy and actual carbon market development that encourages direct participation 
and minimises intermediary benefits."
Killin called for a "complete overhaul" to address the "market failure" where vested interests had suppressed the 
price of carbon and resulted in low transparency for participants and poor quality projects.
"All of this has conspired to create a cosy 'Carbon Club' in Australia. Voices of dissent and other internal criticism 
that do not fit the industry's vacuous view of itself are ignored repeatedly," he said.Page 4 of 4

Killin was critical of government interventions to reduce the cost of carbon credits, pointing to the government's 
"cost containment" policy that caps credits at $70 for companies captured by the safeguard mechanism, when 
robust tree planting projects can cost up to $100 per credit.
"It's not a real market. If there is high demand, the price should go up. But every time the price goes up, the 
government intervenes to bring the price down," he said. "The polluters should be made to pay."
University of Sydney chair of political economy Dr Gareth Bryant said governments globally had intervened in 
carbon offset markets because high prices were "political poison".
Bryant said the "elegant economic reasoning" of market-based emissions reduction always came second to 
industry interests, and politicians were quick to "carve out special consideration policies" to avoid hurting fossil fuel 
profits.
"That's the contradiction of carbon offsetting. Attempts to create a profitable industry around carbon offsetting are 
always coming up against interests which see carbon offsets as a get out of jail free card for the fossil fuel industry. 
In that battle, usually it's the fossil fuel industry that has won, globally."
Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen declined an interview request and did not answer detailed 
questions on record, but a spokesperson highlighted the government's increased and legislated emissions 
reduction target, and said the safeguard mechanism and renewable energy plan meant Australia was "now on track 
for at least 42 per cent emissions reduction by 2030".

Embraer has performed the first flight of its passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversion, with the modified E190 taking 
to the skies over Sao Jose dos Campos on 5 April.
The E190F – a 2010-built example first operated by Avianca El Salvador – flew for about 2h, allowing the Embraer 
team to complete an ­initial evaluation of the aircraft. A second sortie followed five days later.
The jet will undergo further flight testing ­before being delivered to US lessor Regional One, ­Embraer says.
Previously, the company had stated its intention to deliver the E190F in the second quarter of 2024.
“We are very pleased with E190F’s and E195F’s fast progress during the testing period,” says Embraer chief 
­executive Francisco Gomes Neto.....

Vervolg van pagina 1
Philips maakte de schikking gisterochtend bekend, gelijktijdig met de presentatie van zijn cijfers over het eerste 
kwartaal. In het akkoord erkent Philips geen schuld voor mogelijke schade bij patiënten, die vreesden dat ze 
kanker, astma en andere aandoeningen hadden opgelopen door het gebruik van de Philips-apparaten. Het 
concern kondigde gisteren ook aan dat zijn verzekeraars ruim €0,5 mrd van de kosten zullen vergoeden.
De schikking betreft zowel de claims voor medische schade als voor medische controle voor patiënten. 
Claimadvocaten hadden meer dan 760 zaken aangebracht. Nog eens 60.000 patiënten hadden zich laten 
registreren om in een later stadium aanspraak te kunnen maken op een vergoeding. Hoeveel geld afzonderlijke 
patiënten ontvangen, is nog niet duidelijk. Het is aan de advocaten om het totaalbedrag onder hun cliënten te 
verdelen. Philips heeft zich stevig verweerd tegen de schadeclaims. Volgens het bedrijf is uit onderzoek gebleken 
dat de uitstoot van schadelijke stoffen te gering was om ernstige gezondheidsschade te kunnen veroorzaken. 
Philips stemde toch in met een schikking omdat de uitkomst van rechtszaken moeilijk te voorspellen is. In het 
Amerikaanse rechtssysteem kunnen jury's soms onverwacht grote schadevergoedingen toekennen. Eerder 
bereikte Philips al een akkoord over economische schade voor patiënten, evenals een schikkingsakkoord met de 
Amerikaanse medische toezichthouder, de FDA. Met de nieuwe, tweeledige schikking zijn de totale kosten voor het 
afhandelen van de apneuaffaire opgelopen tot €5,2 mrd, zo blijkt uit berekeningen van het FD.....
