Christopher Doleman expresses a negative sentiment towards Shell by highlighting the financial challenges of LNG competing with coal, suggesting skepticism about the profitability of LNG facilities, and while his views appear consistent with a critical stance on LNG economics, his analysis could contribute to reputational and operational concerns for Shell by reinforcing doubts about the viability of its LNG investments.
