Highlight: Cisco will reportedly eliminate 4000 jobs in a second round of layoffs this year, as it moves its focus to 
areas such as cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.
Body
Cisco Systems plans to eliminate thousands more jobs in a second round of layoffs this year, Reuters reported, as 
the networking equipment maker shifts its focus to faster-growing businesses such as cybersecurity and artificial 
intelligence.
The news follows Cisco's move to cut about 4000 jobs in February after a slowdown in corporate tech spending 
wiped out its sales growth. The company had almost 85,000 workers at the end of fiscal 2023, which ran to July of 
that year.
Cisco joins other tech companies in paring jobs as they cope with uneven demand. Though AI spending has 
helped fuel growth in some areas, traditional information technology giants have not benefited as much.
Intel announced plans this month to slash 15,000 jobs as it contends with sluggish sales. Dell Technologies is also 
cutting positions as part of a reorganisation of its sales teams.
Cisco shares fell as much as 1.3 per cent to $US45.24 in New York. They were down 9.3 per cent this year 
heading into Friday's session.
The latest job cuts could be announced as early as Wednesday when the company reports fourth-quarter results, 
according to Reuters.
Three months ago, an upbeat Cisco forecast sparked hope that IT customers had picked up spending again. But 
the broader tech industry has been dogged by more recent concerns about the economy - and the idea that AI 
spending might not have a near-term payoff.
A representative for Cisco declined to comment on layoff plans.
Over the longer term, chief executive Chuck Robbins has been trying to transform Cisco into a provider of 
networking services and software, rather than a company focused on one-time sales of hardware.
It also looks to capitalise more on the AI boom that has fuelled sales for companies such as Nvidia. Last year, the 
company made a big move into the cybersecurity market with the $US28 billion acquisition of software firm Splunk.
