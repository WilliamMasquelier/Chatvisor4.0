Given the following issue categories and their descriptions:

Financial Instability and Market Capitalization Decline: Ørsted has suffered severe financial losses, including multi-billion-euro impairments, project cancellations, and cost overruns. The company’s market capitalization has plummeted by approximately 80% since its peak in 2021, reflecting a significant loss of investor confidence. Rising interest rates, inflation, and supply chain disruptions have further exacerbated its financial struggles, forcing Ørsted to suspend dividend payments, sell assets, and implement drastic cost-cutting measures. These financial difficulties raise concerns about the company’s long-term viability and ability to maintain its leadership in the renewable energy sector.
Project Cancellations and Delays: Ørsted has been forced to cancel or delay multiple offshore wind projects, particularly in the U.S., due to financial infeasibility, regulatory uncertainty, and rising costs. The cancellation of major projects such as Ocean Wind I & II and the FlagshipONE green fuel project has resulted in billions in impairments. Additionally, construction delays at projects like Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind have led to further financial setbacks. These repeated project failures highlight Ørsted’s challenges in managing large-scale renewable energy developments efficiently and profitably.
Strategic Retrenchment and Market Exits: In response to financial pressures, Ørsted has scaled back its renewable energy ambitions, reducing its planned offshore wind capacity from 50 GW to 35-38 GW by 2030. The company has also exited key offshore wind markets, including Spain, Portugal, Norway, and France, limiting its future growth opportunities. This strategic retreat signals a shift from aggressive expansion to a more cautious investment approach, potentially weakening Ørsted’s competitive position in the global renewable energy sector.
Leadership Instability and Governance Issues: Ørsted has experienced significant leadership turmoil, with the resignation of its CEO, Mads Nipper, following an 80% decline in the company’s stock price. Additionally, the company’s chairman and other senior executives have stepped down, raising concerns about instability at the top levels of management. Frequent leadership changes can disrupt strategic planning, further complicating Ørsted’s efforts to recover from its financial difficulties and regain investor confidence.
Regulatory and Political Challenges: Ørsted has faced significant regulatory and political obstacles, particularly in the U.S., where policy changes and legal challenges have hindered its offshore wind expansion. The return of Donald Trump to the presidency has resulted in a freeze on new offshore wind permits, forcing Ørsted to write down billions in assets. Additionally, the company has struggled to secure tax credits and navigate complex permitting processes, further delaying projects and increasing financial risks. These regulatory uncertainties threaten Ørsted’s ability to execute its renewable energy strategy effectively.
Operational and Supply Chain Disruptions: Rising costs, inflation, and supply chain disruptions have significantly impacted Ørsted’s ability to execute its wind farm projects profitably. The company has faced difficulties in securing materials, managing construction timelines, and mitigating cost overruns. These operational challenges have contributed to project delays, financial impairments, and a broader slowdown in offshore wind expansion. The inability to control these factors raises concerns about Ørsted’s capacity to deliver large-scale renewable energy projects efficiently.
Investor Confidence and Stock Performance Decline: Ørsted’s stock price has plummeted due to financial struggles, project cancellations, and rising costs, making it a less attractive option for institutional investors. The company’s decision to suspend dividend payments and sell off key assets has further eroded investor confidence. Additionally, Ørsted has become an acquisition target, with companies like Equinor purchasing stakes in the company, raising concerns about its vulnerability to external takeovers. The sharp decline in stock performance reflects broader concerns about Ørsted’s financial stability and future growth prospects.
Workforce Reductions and Social Impact: Ørsted has implemented significant job cuts, eliminating up to 800 positions globally as part of its cost-cutting measures. These layoffs reflect the financial strain the company is under and have social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities. The workforce reductions highlight the broader instability within Ørsted and raise concerns about its ability to retain talent and maintain operational efficiency amid financial difficulties.
Challenges in Renewable Energy Diversification: Ørsted’s attempt to diversify beyond offshore wind has faced setbacks, as seen in the cancellation of the FlagshipONE green fuel project in Sweden. The company struggled to secure long-term contracts at viable prices, leading to financial impairments. This failure highlights the difficulties in expanding into new renewable energy technologies and raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to successfully diversify its portfolio beyond offshore wind. The broader struggles in the synthetic fuel market further complicate Ørsted’s efforts to establish a foothold in alternative renewable energy sectors.

Issue to classify:
- Ørsted has decided to cut its renewable energy project targets by at least 24%, reducing its planned capacity from 50 GW to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030. This reduction signals a retreat from its previous ambitious expansion plans and could slow the global transition to renewable energy. The company is also exiting several emerging offshore wind markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, limiting its future growth opportunities. [El Economista, Violeta N.
