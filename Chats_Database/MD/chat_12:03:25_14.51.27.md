Here is the document section to analyze:

Shell's international vice president for strategy, insights and scenarios, Laszlo 
Varro, says the transition to net zero will succeed or fail depending on how well two "global cleavage points" are 
managed.
One is the financial gap between the Western world, which is investing heavily in clean energy technologies - about 
90 per cent of the global investment in those technologies is being made by the West and China - and the 
developing world.
The other is what Varro refers to as the "technology interface," or being able to leverage China's "unique 
capabilities" within a "challenging" geopolitical context.
Varro, who's in Australia to speak at an Australian Energy Producers conference in Perth this week, says there has 
been a surge in clean energy investment in China and a remarkable inflow of investment in the sustainable finance 
sector in the Western world. About 85 per cent of that money, however, stays in the Western world.
Canadian pension fund buying a Swedish wind farm, " he said. "Whereas last year, green bonds in Africa were 0.1 
per cent of the total green bond deployment."
The developing world, where populations are growing even as those in developed economies and China are 
flatlining or shrinking, doesn't have the funds to finance a transition to clean energy and, Varro says, there is no 
time and no carbon budget (if net zero is to be achieved as targeted) for it to have a conventional industrialisation 
and then make that transition.
The good news, he said, is that the technology that makes a transition plausible is solar and most developing 
countries are close to the equator. Scale "leapfrogging" - largely bypassing fossil fuel-based energy systems and

The two major threats to a 'net zero' world
jumping straight to solar or hydro while using natural gas as the reserve - is already occurring in Africa and 
elsewhere.
A two-thirds renewables, one-third natural gas combination produces roughly 100 kg of carbon dioxide per 
megawatt of power, or less than half the current European or US average, Varro said.
(Varro and his team at Shell, a major gas producer, see the impact of electric cars resulting in peak oil demand 
somewhere between 2025 and 2035, but see a significant future for natural gas - for use in heavy industry or as 
reserve power for renewable systems that are weather dependent - even in a net-zero environment, with carbon 
capture and storage or removal playing a role).
'A London every quarter'
Unfortunately, while the developing world might be leapfrogging its way towards cleaner energy, it is also rapidly 
urbanising and building the infrastructure to accommodate the large shifts in populations towards urban centres.
"Urbanisation is currently running at the speed of a London every quarter," Varro said.
"This is the people who live in their villages and move to Cairo, or Nairobi or Jakarta or Karachi. That's a London 
every quarter and that is concrete and steel and glass and plastics and aluminium. All these are very energy-
intensive commodities; altogether representing around 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions."
There's also that paucity of investment for clean energy in the developing world. Varro says Shell's best estimate is 
that the developing world needs about seven times the level of clean energy investment that is occurring within the 
developed world.
And that is difficult to imagine, he said, given the segmentation of the global financial system - which makes it a 
factor that could cause the transition to net-zero emissions to fail.
The maths of net zero are quite daunting. In 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that to 
achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by 2050 the carbon budget - the cumulative emissions - 
would be 500 gigatonnes (Gt).
From the starting point of January 1, 2020 to the end of 2022, however, there has already been about 120 Gt of 
emissions. With annual global emissions of more than 40 Gt in 2023, you don't have to be Einstein to see how 
challenging keeping within, or anywhere close to, that emissions budget will be and how significant a role 
developing economies - and China - will have in the success or failure of the transition.
Geopolitics, therefore, represents the other major threat.
China leads the world in the mass production of clean-energy technologies, whether it's EVs, batteries, solar 
panels, wind turbines or the processing of the critical minerals required.
Its economy is also still heavily dependent on coal, despite a massive state-directed and subsidised deployment of 
clean-power technologies. Varro said China's domestic coal-mining output last year increased by more than 
Australia's entire exports of LNG.
China is, however, the largest EV manufacturer in the world and the EV market share in its domestic market is 
approaching 50 per cent. That will affect its own emissions and, to the extent that it is able to export its EVs, those 
of third countries.
This month's announcement of new punitive tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, batteries, solar cells and critical 
miners by the Biden administration - made to protect the massive investments in green technologies sparked by 
America's Inflation Reduction Act and also influenced by the domestic political sensitivity of the US auto industry in 
an election year - is being criticised outside America because of the impact it will have on the takeup of EVs and 
other clean energy technologies, and therefore on the rate at which carbon emissions are reduced.Page 3 of 3
The two major threats to a 'net zero' world
The higher prices for electric cars built in the US or Europe (which is close to imposing its own tariffs on Chinese 
EVs) and the need to develop their own critical minerals and battery supply chains will slow the takeup of EVs in the 
US and Europe.
'Predictable surprise'
The "next predictable surprise" is a flood of cheap Chinese EVs into developing economies, says Varro.
China's clean energy "cluster" has, he said, genuinely unique capabilities and, given the challenging geopolitical 
context, how the tensions are resolved is one of the key uncertainties, with the potential to facilitate or slow down 
the global energy transition.
How the financial gap between the Western world and the developing world, and China's unique capabilities are 
managed can therefore "make a difference between success or failure," says Varro.
While he thinks there are plausible routes to net zero, they will involve massive and disruptive government 
interventions in energy systems, economies and societies and a reduction in geopolitical tensions that have been 
intensifying rather than waning.
Today, those outcomes do seem unlikely.

Shell, one of the world's largest energy companies, has quietly shelved plans to develop an offshore wind project in 
Victoria, as it implements its strategy to invest in less capital-intensive, -mature forms of electricity generation.
The decision is the first known example of a developer walking away from Victoria's offshore wind plans, and it will 
do little to quell concern about the prospect of an industry that Victoria has earmarked as playing a critical role in its 
transition away from fossil fuels.
Victoria in 2022 set a target of generating about 20 per cent of its energy needs from offshore wind within a decade. 
The target then doubles to 4GW by 2035 and 9GW by 2040. In all, Victoria sees potential for 13GW of offshore 
wind capacity by 2050, five times the current renewable generation in Victoria.
The target drew a plethora of some of the world's largest global energy companies to submit an application for a so-
called feasibility licence, and Shell was understood to have been told late last year that it was in line to -secure a 
permit if it could overcome a boundary dispute.
Untangling the dispute was seen as inevitable, but Shell determined it would not proceed with its initial application 
as it delivers on chief executive Wael Sawan's commitment to be "ruthless" in focusing on financial performance. A 
Shell spokeswoman -confirmed the decision, but said the company remained confident in the viability of offshore 
wind in Australia.
"After careful consideration, including more than two years of pre-feasibility work, Shell Australia withdrew from the 
feasibility licence application process for offshore wind development in Gippsland, Victoria earlier this year," a 
spokeswoman said.
"In Australia, Shell is focusing on growing our low-carbon -energy portfolio including via -onshore wind and battery 
energy storage projects. Australia's abundant offshore wind resources have strong -potential to help Australia 
achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and Shell continues to have confidence in the establishment of a sustainable 
Australian offshore wind industry." Despite Shell's public commitment to the industry, Australia's offshore wind 
industry was expected to be extremely expensive, industry sources said. While the industry expected costs to come 
Page 2 of 2

down, industry sources said current projections had new projects costing about $300 per megawatt, well in excess 
of the current wholesale price of about $120.
Offshore wind is substantially more expensive than onshore wind and solar, and Shell is understood to have 
developed plans to focus instead on onshore alternatives.
There are also substantial costs associated with moving towards a final investment decision associated with 
offshore wind.
The 12 projects granted a feasibility licence by the federal Labor government will now begin seabed and 
environmental studies to confirm the suitability for an offshore wind project.
Should all projects proceed to construction, the industry is also concerned about winners being picked.
The 12 projects that have -secured a feasibility licence have a combined capacity of 25GW, nearly double the target 
Victoria has offered to underwrite.
Sources familiar with the thinking of the Victorian government acknowledge that not all the 12 projects are likely to -
materialise and those that do will be ready at different times.
Victoria plans to incrementally stimulate developments. It has scheduled staggered so-called contract for different 
auditions that will determine how much fin-ancial support is offered to developers.
There are concerns about Victoria's capacity to pay as the state budget deficit increases. However, the industry 
acknowledges that offshore wind is vital for the country's transition.
Victoria has Australia's most aggressive climate goals. Victoria plans to have zero emission sources account for 95 
per cent of its energy needs by 2035 and to be net zero by 2045.
The target is likely to end the use of coal in the state, with EnergyAustralia's Yallourn set to close in 2028, while the 
state's largest, AGL Energy's Loy Yang A, is expected to shutter in 2035.
A Victorian government spokesman said: "We're building Australia's first offshore wind energy industry and learning 
from global leaders in the sector to ensure our auction process is competitive and results in the timely delivery of 
projects.
"It is normal for developers to explore projects and then stop work on them, for a variety of reasons internal to their 
business." He said the 12 approved offshore wind projects could "generate 25GW of electricity - more than enough 
to meet Victoria's energy needs".

Shell has dragged resources giants Woodside and Paladin Resources to court after being lumped with an $86.5 
million clean-up bill for the Northern Endeavour oil platform, claiming the bill should never have been its to pay.
According to a writ lodged in the WA Supreme Court, Shell claims it was forced to pay assessment notices issued 
by the Australian Taxation Office in 2023 and 2024 totalling $86.5 million in February 2024.
The payment demand was made under an offshore petroleum levy enacted by the federal government in 2022 in 
direct response to the costs associated with the unmanned vessel.
But Shell claims it should never have been saddled with that clean-up bill, pointing to a clause allegedly buried in 
the share purchase deal it inked with Woodside and Paladin more than a decade ago it argues rendered the two 
companies liable.
Shell claims both Woodside and Paladin were to reimburse Shell for any claims arising from or in connection with 
the venture.
Woodside, Shell and BHP established a joint venture in the late 1990s after being granted exploration and 
petroleum production licenses over the Corallina and Laminaria oil fields in the Timor Sea, about 550 kilometres 
west north-west of Darwin.
Under the joint venture, led by Woodside as majority owner and operator, the trio built the Northern Endeavour 
floating production vessel, which was permanently moored to the seabed.
Woodside and Paladin bought Shell out before handing the floating rig to Perth-based company Northern Oil and 
Gas Australia (NOGA) in 2015.
But within four years that rig was shut down amid saftey warnings from the regulator, National Offshore Petroleum 
Safety and Environmental Management Authority, and NOGA collapsed just months later.
The collapse coupled with environmental concerns prompted the federal government to take the decommissioning 
of the vessel into its own hands - an exercise which has cost hundreds of millions of dollars since 2020.

That eye-watering clean-up bill is now at the centre of a Supreme Court battle between Shell, Woodside and 
Paladin Resources.
In the writ, Shell claims it penned two letters between February 2023 and March 2024 demanding payment from 
Woodside and Paladin Resources, but that the pair both denied liability.
Now Shell wants the Supreme Court to intervene by forcing Woodside and Paladin to reimburse it to the tune of 
$86.5 million.
It also wants a declaration that Woodside and Paladin Resources are to compensate it for all future costs it may 
incur as part of the decommissioning, which is only in the first of three stages.
Woodside has been contacted for comment.

Energy giant Shell is suing Woodside Energy and Paladin Resources for $86.6m for the clean-up bill for the 
Northern Endeavour oil platform, saying it struck agreements almost two decades ago which absolved it of any 
responsibility to pay remediation costs.
The question of who should pay to remediate Northern Endeavour, on Western Australia's North West Shelf, and 
abandoned oil and gas projects more broadly, prompted the previous government to introduce laws to protect 
taxpayers from having to foot the bill, should operators not be able to meet their obligations.
