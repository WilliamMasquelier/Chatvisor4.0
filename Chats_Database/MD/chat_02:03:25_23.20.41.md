You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| Lene Skole | Chairman of Orsted | "The impacts on our business of the increasingly challenging situation in the offshore wind industry, ranging from supply chain bottlenecks, interest rate increases, to a changing regulatory landscape, mean that our focus has shifted." | N.A. |
| Mads Nipper | Former CEO of Orsted | "Leading Orsted through four challenging yet rewarding years has been a great privilege. Despite the obstacles we've faced, we've achieved many significant milestones, and I'm immensely proud of our colleagues' efforts and dedication." | N.A. |
| Rasmus Errboe | CEO of Orsted | "I'm looking forward to taking the lead on the transformation necessary to navigate the headwinds that Orsted and our industry currently face." | N.A. |
| Rasmus Errboe | CEO of Orsted | "Offshore wind remains crucial for the green transition, and we're deeply committed to pursuing our vision of a world that runs entirely on green energy." | N.A. |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Orsted.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Orsted or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
