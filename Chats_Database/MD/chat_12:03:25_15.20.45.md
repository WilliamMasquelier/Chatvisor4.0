Shell, the oil and gas giant with billions of dollars invested in Australia, says a dysfunctional and enormously 
complicated system of regulations is putting the transition to clean energy at risk even as it readies to spend big on 
renewables.
Shell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said obstacles for gas developments and large renewables projects 
threatened to derail progress towards 2030 climate targets.
Labor wants to cut carbon emissions by 43 per cent on 2005 levels by the end of the decade, a goal that appears 
increasingly unreachable.
"Right now, what we have is a dysfunctional, deharmonised patchwork quilt of regulations that really make it difficult 
to have successful investments," Ms Wake said in an interview.
"Many of the headwinds that we're seeing across our gas business, we are seeing replicated in the large-scale 
renewable part of the business."
The transition away from fossil fuels coal, oil and gas is heading towards another political brawl - like the one that 
consumed former Coalition and Labor governments. Delays in approvals and higher costs of construction have 
slowed the rollout of big renewable energy projects despite plenty of interest from global investors.
The Coalition has proposed a network of nuclear power stations as the best way to move away from fossil fuel as 
coal plants shut. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton will use a speech in Sydney today to again pitch nuclear power as 
a long-term renewable energy solution, hitting back at an attack on the plan last week by Energy Minister Chris 
Bowen.
While conceding nuclear power will have a "significant upfront cost", Mr Dutton will claim that the 80-year lifespan of 
each plant means they will outlast renewable electricity sources many times over. He will not, however, release any 
costings.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, however, is banking on mechanisms which incentivise the development of wind 
and solar projects to hit targets. That, the government says, can be supported by gas to ensure supply if demand 
surges.
Shell has long criticised the investment climate for gas. Ms Wake pointed to duplication between state and federal 
environmental approvals and "ambiguous" requirements on Indigenous consultation as some of the reasons for 
delays and higher costs.
But she said similar hurdles were now evident for wind and solar projects, putting at risk private investment needed 
to underpin the move away from fossil fuels.
"If we're going to reach net zero by 2050, for Australia to really thrive through the energy transition, we're going to 
need not one wave of investment, but a second, a third, a fourth, multiple waves of investment and what that 
requires is successful delivery of projects," she said. "We need a really harmonised set of regulatory settings so that 
we can deliver projects - whether they're in the gas or the renewables or firming space - predictably and deliver the 
lowest cost, most reliable, lowest-emissions energy."
London-listed Shell is one of the country's biggest energy players. It owns the Queensland Curtis LNG venture at 
Gladstone, one of the state's three large gas export projects. It owns gas power and solar plants, the ERM Power 
electricity retailer, which sells to business, and household energy retailer Powershop.
In the west, its portfolio includes the Prelude floating LNG plant, a stake in Chevron's Gorgon LNG venture, and a 
small holding in Woodside Energy's North West Shelf.
Ms Wake said the Australian business represented "quite a powerful microcosm" of a "balanced" energy transition, 
but added that funders of these projects had "choices on where to go", signalling Shell could look elsewhere if 
investing became too difficult.
These issues were raised by Clean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton in a speech earlier this month, 
when he described environmental and planning rules for wind farm development as "not fit for purpose" and one 
reason for a difficult year in 2023, when few decisions were made on whether to proceed with big projects.
The Clean Energy Council, which represents major renewable energy developers, has warned that a big increase in 
commitments for generation projects will be needed by the end of December to reach the level of work needed to 
hit government targets.
"We should have big expectations for the second half of this year," said Mr Thornton. "As a nation, we didn't do a 
great job of preparing for this complex transition. So we now need to draw on every ounce of tenacity to confront 
these challenges."
Ms Wake said the transition away from fossil fuel needed plenty of capital, urging governments to "leave the 
populism and the ideology and the party politics to one side and really get behind what is in Australia's best 
interests".
Ms Wake pointed to Shell's Crux LNG project in Western Australia as one that suffered from the fallout from the 
litigation over Indigenous consultation at Santos' Barossa gas project in the Timor Sea and Woodside's 
Scarborough LNG project.
The $3.6 billion Crux project, which was approved in 2022, is intended to supply replacement gas for Prelude LNG 
off the north-west coast. She said Shell had had to significantly broaden and lengthen consultation, taking in talks 
with 18 traditional owner groups even though none of the project infrastructure will come onshore.
"It felt to me like an example of additional complexity that added delay and costs to projects without delivering a 
significantly better outcome for traditional owner groups, and in fact, put a huge burden on them," she said of the 
project.Page 3 of 3

Shell's clean energy portfolio in Australia has almost 1.5 gigawatts of renewable generation and storage, including 
a 49 per cent interest in developer WestWind Energy, the Gangarri solar farm in Queensland, a battery in the NSW 
Riverina, and the Rangebank battery south-east of Melbourne, which is due online later this year.
But it has a bigger pipeline of projects, including a big battery at Wallerawang in NSW and a smaller storage project 
in WA's Wheatbelt region.
"There's another bit over a gigawatt of other battery projects that are there in the pipeline, so if we hit a permitting or 
a contracting roadblock on one of them, we can shuffle the deck in terms of the sequence," Ms Wake said.
In all, Shell aims to have 4GW of renewables and storage operating by 2032.
