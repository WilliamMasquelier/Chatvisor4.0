BILL payers are to spend as much as £150 per household on new wind turbines as Ed Miliband oversees a record 
expansion of green energy.
The money - a total of £3bn, which will ultimately come from consumers - is to fund the construction or expansion of 
nine offshore wind sites between 2027 and 2031, most of them owned by foreign energy companies, plus other 
green technologies such as onshore wind and solar.
Denmark's state-controlled energy company Orsted is among the biggest winners, along with ScottishPower, which 
is owned by Spanish utility Iberdrola. The money for wind turbines has been agreed as part of a government 
auction for renewable energy contracts known as the allocation round 6 (AR6). Under this system, the Government 
encourages companies to build low-carbon energy plants such as solar and wind farms by offering a minimum price 
for the electricity generated. The money for such subsidies is eventually added to bills. The UK's power grid 
operator, National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO), calculates "budget impact" of the subsidies for offshore 
wind and other renewables at £4bn from 2026 to 2031, in today's money.
The costs given exclude the additional expense of transmission lines and the expansion of the national grid to 
handle the extra power.
It means more than five gigawatts (GW) of new offshore wind power is now set for construction - a stark contrast to 
last year's botched auction round when there were no bids. The Tories offered subsidies so low - at £40 per 
megawatt hour (MWh) - that no off- shore wind developers came forward.

Subsidies under Mr Miliband will be more than doubled to over £82 per MWh. Solar farms will get £70/MWh, with 
newer technologies such as floating wind handed £195/MWh and tidal stream projects given £239/MWh.
A total of 131 clean energy projects have won state subsidies in this year's auction, including 115 solar projects 
across England and onshore wind projects mainly in Scotland and Wales.
Many of the onshore projects are likely to prove highly controversial, with homeowners and environmentalists 
objecting to the industrialisation of landscapes with panels and turbines.
However, Mr Miliband hailed the auction results as a triumph. He said: "We inherited a broken energy policy. Today 
we have a record-setting round for enough renewable power for 11m homes, essential to give energy security to 
families across the country. It is another significant step forward in our mission for clean power by 2030."
Orsted is one of the biggest winners.
It has been allowed to shunt much of its Hornsea 3 project out of contracts signed under previous allocation rounds, 
where lower subsidies were offered, into this year's auction. A spokesman for Mr Miliband said the move had been 
permitted because otherwise Hornsea 3 - potentially the world's largest wind farm at 3GW - might never have been 
built.
Critics will argue that such contracts become meaningless if companies can simply move them from one auction 
round if a subsequent one offers better terms. Orsted was also awarded a 2.4GW CfD for Hornsea 4. Rasmus 
Errboe, of Orsted, said: "We look forward to delivering these landmark projects, which will supply renewable power 
at a large scale to UK consumers and businesses and help the UK Government achieve its target of quadrupling 
offshore wind capacity to 60GW by 2030."
ScottishPower has been offered contracts for another two large wind farms, East Anglia Two and East Anglia 
Three. As with Orsted, it was allowed to move its East Anglia Three project out of the contracts signed under a 
previous and less lucrative auction.
A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesman said it did not recognise the costs per household, but 
renewable energy remained essential to boost UK energy security.

1. Orsted is positioned as a major beneficiary of the UK government's recent auction for renewable energy contracts, securing significant funding for its Hornsea 3 and Hornsea 4 offshore wind projects, which are crucial for expanding the UK's renewable energy capacity.

2. The company has been allowed to transfer its Hornsea 3 project from previous contracts with lower subsidies to the current auction, raising concerns among critics about the integrity of the auction process and the implications for future contract negotiations.

3. Orsted's projects are part of a broader government initiative to increase offshore wind capacity to 60GW by 2030, highlighting the company's pivotal role in achieving the UK's renewable energy goals and enhancing energy security for consumers.

4. The auction results, which include substantial subsidies for offshore wind, reflect a shift in government policy under Ed Miliband, aiming to rectify previous failures in energy policy and stimulate investment in renewable technologies, with Orsted at the forefront of this transition.
