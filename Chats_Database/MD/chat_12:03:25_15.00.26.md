Shell wins appeal against court order to reduce the oil company's carbon emissions
"Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of Shell's strategy and is 
transforming our business."
Climate mitigation debate
The ruling coincides with the COP29 UN climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, where building on a decision at last 
year's talks to transition away from fossil fuels is set to be debated.
Climate activist group Friends of the Earth Netherlands, which brought the case forward in 2019, said it would 
continue its fight against large polluters.
"This hurts," the group's director Donald Pols said. 
"At the same time, we see that this case has ensured that major polluters are not immune and has further 
stimulated the debate about their responsibility in combating dangerous climate change.
"That is why we continue to tackle major polluters, such as Shell."
Friends of the Earth did not say whether it would launch a further appeal at the Netherlands' Supreme Court.
The case in the Hague, where Shell was headquartered until it completed its move to London in 2022, was viewed 
as pivotal for both sides of the emissions divide and helped to inspire other lawsuits.
In appeal hearings earlier this year, Shell said demands for companies to reduce emissions could not be made by 
courts, but only by states.
The court agreed with Shell that an absolute order to reduce emissions from its products could have an adverse 
effect worldwide, as it could lead customers to switch from using Shell's gas to more polluting coal.
"In general, any reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is positive to mitigate climate change," Judge Joustra said.
"But that does not mean that a reduction order for Shell has that same effect."
Shell shares traded down 0.2 per cent in Amsterdam early on Tuesday, broadly in line with the wider index.

Shell has won its appeal against a 2021 landmark decision that said it was partially responsible for climate change 
and must sharply cut its carbon emissions, delivering a major court victory to the oil giant in a closely watched 
case.
The ruling in a Dutch court is a setback for efforts by non-profits and other groups to hold energy companies and 
other multinationals responsible for the effects of climate change.
But experts warned the issues raised in the case remain far from settled. They said the judgment signalled a 
willingness by the court to mandate emissions curbs, while leaving wide latitude for the mechanisms to be worked 
out in future litigation.
The 2021 decision by The Hague district court ordered Shell - at the time based in the Netherlands - to reduce its 
carbon emissions by 45 per cent by the end of 2030 from 2019 levels.
The Hague Court of Appeal on Tuesday ruled that while Shell is obliged to reduce its emissions, the court was 
unable to determine which percentage should apply.
"There is insufficient consensus in climate science on a specific reduction percentage to which an individual 
company like Shell should adhere," it said.
It said it therefore rejected the claims of Milieudefensie, the Dutch arm of environmental group Friends of the Earth.
The court added that Shell was already working to reduce its emissions and that an obligation for the company to 
reduce emissions caused by buyers of its products would be ineffective.
Milieudefensie called the appeals court decision a shocking setback, but said that it showed companies were under 
pressure to reduce carbon emissions, even if targets aren't legally binding. "Large polluters are powerful. But 
united, we as people have the power to change them," said Donald Pols, its director.

Shell wins carbon appeal
The group didn't say whether it planned an appeal to the Dutch supreme court, a process that could extend the 
legal fight for years. Lawyers expect the group to appeal.
Its statement included a plea for financial support, adding, "This judgment will change nothing about our eagerness 
to keep fighting." The decision comes as world leaders meet in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku to discuss global 
warming at the United Nations COP29 summit. The mood in many circles has been gloomy in part due to 
expectations that Donald Trump's victory will pull the US further back from a leading role in global climate efforts.
In a response to the Dutch court's ruling, Shell reiterated that it believed a court ruling would do little to reduce 
emissions as it wouldn't dent demand for petrol, diesel and gas. The clear view in Tuesday's judgment is that the 
court felt empowered to order a company to abide by absolute carbon emissions targets, a novel development that 
could have wide ripple effects even while specifics are debated in different countries and courtrooms.

Highlight: BP and Shell led Big Oil's push into renewable energy. Now they are leading the retreat.
Body
BP and Shell led Big Oil's push into renewable energy. Now they are leading the retreat.
Last week BP announced that it had sold its offshore wind assets into a joint venture with Japan's JERA, itself a 
joint venture between Tokyo Electric Power and Chubu Electric Power, to create one of the world's largest offshore 
wind businesses.
That followed an earlier BP announcement, in September, that it planned to sell its US onshore wind farms.
Under former chief executive, Bernard Looney, BP had been building its wind farm portfolio as part of an ambitious 
strategy to cut its hydrocarbon production by 40 per cent by 2030, reduce its emissions and those of its customers 
by 35 to 40 per cent by the end of this decade and become a "net zero"-emissions company by 2050.
Last year it started backing away from those commitments, saying it would cut production by only 25 per cent by 
2030 and its emissions by 20 to 30 per cent.
This year, under a new chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, it now appears even those reduced targets are being 
wound back.
It's not just BP.
Shell has scaled back its investment in renewables, including offshore wind and hydrogen; it has reduced its 
emissions' intensity targets and it has abandoned its objective of becoming the world's largest electricity company. 
Norway's energy giant, Equinor, has also announced plans to shrink its renewable energy division.
As they retreat from their push into renewable energy and downgrade their ambitions to build major exposures to 
electricity generation, the UK and European oil companies are refocusing on their traditional oil and gas 
businesses.
Where previously they planned to cap or reduce their production, now they are planning and investing to increase it.
Page 2 of 3
Big Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare
Last year BP raised its forecast of oil equivalent production from 1.5 billion barrels a day by 2030 to 2 million 
barrels a day, planning to invest $US8 billion ($12.6 billion) more than previously budgeted on new oil and gas 
investments. Since Auchincloss became CEO, that focus on lifting hydrocarbon production has intensified.
The commercial logic in what they are doing is clear. BP generates returns of 15 to 20 per cent on its fossil fuel 
investments but only 6 to 8 per cent from its renewable assets, with wind's returns inferior to solar's.
Ploughing billions each year into wind, solar and hydrogen dilutes the overall returns on capital and reduces the 
returns to shareholders, making them most unhappy. Having invested about $US18 billion over the past five years 
in lower-returning renewables between them, BP and Shell investors have become increasingly unhappy.
Moreover, the UK and European energy majors are always compared with their US counterparts.
Exxon and Chevron haven't been anywhere near as committed to lowering the carbon intensity of their portfolios as 
their transatlantic rivals. The US majors were committed to the "drill, baby, drill" mantra before Donald Trump and 
saw that reflected in their share price relativities with their UK and European counterparts.
Where, over the past five years, Exxon's share price has risen 54 per cent and Chevron's 23 per cent, BP's has 
fallen 22 per cent and Shell's more than 6 per cent. That kind of disparity in performance tends to galvanise 
shareholders, along with executives motivated by their remuneration.
By moving its offshore wind assets into a joint venture vehicle and off its own balance sheet BP will keep an 
exposure to wind but significantly reduce the amounts of capital devoted to it and the levels of debt supporting it.
Between them, BP and JERA plan to spend up to $US5.8 billion on their combined portfolios (which includes the 
proposed Blue Mackerel offshore wind farm in Bass Strait) by the end of 2030. With shared investment and non-
recourse funding, BP's capital commitment will be modest relative to what it would otherwise have been.
Both BP and Shell still seem committed to solar, which is less capital intensive than wind, but that won't help them 
escape the criticism from climate activist groups and ESG (environmental, social and governance) investors, who 
are particularly vocal and litigious in Europe and the UK.
The problem, of course, is that the companies can't satisfy both constituencies and in a contest between emissions 
and returns is one that ultimately shareholders will always win.
With Trump about to return to the White House and open up US federal lands to more drilling for oil and gas, and 
the incoming Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, having a "3-3-3" plan that includes lifting US energy production by 
three million barrels of oil equivalent a day, the contrast between the environment for the US producers and their 
competitors elsewhere will only become starker and the pressure from shareholders on companies like BP and 
Shell will only intensify.
Trump also plans to remove the generous 10-year tax credits for renewables within Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction 
Act, which, if he is successful, would make the returns from investment in US renewables even less competitive 
with those from fossil fuels.
Any increase in US oil production would add to the existing glut in the oil market and depress prices that are 
already under pressure, despite the withdrawal of about six million barrels a day of supply by the OPEC+ cartel.
The lower prices being experienced now and likely to continue into at least the first half of next year, however, 
aren't an argument for the oil majors to invest in renewables.
Returns from oil and gas will still be superior to those from renewables and, if oil and gas prices and profits are 
under pressure, there will be even more of an incentive to invest only in the highest-returning assets.
Those who invest purely in renewables appear unconcerned about the gradual withdrawal of the oil majors who 
gatecrashed their sector and, seeking to gain scale rapidly, drove up the costs of developing greenfields projects.Page 3 of 3
Big Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare
Ploughing billions each year into wind, solar and hydrogen dilutes the overall returns on capital and reduces the 
returns to shareholders, making them most unhappy.
There are a lot of environmentally-sensitive and patient investment funds available from sources other than the oil 
majors that are willing to trade off returns for their convictions and/or consistent long-term returns, so losing some 
investment from the oil companies shouldn't retard renewables developments.
It was always going to be difficult for BP and Shell to try to produce a balance of their traditional oil and gas 
businesses and renewable energy portfolios while satisfying both financially-motivated and ESG-driven investors.
It has been particularly difficult for the UK and Europeans, with their lower returns but better environmental 
credentials, to attract investors in the US. There's been a backlash against ESG investing in the US where, 
because there is no significant stigma associated with the oil and gas industry, valuation metrics tend to be higher.
If BP and Shell want better access to those more attractive metrics, improved share price performances and 
access to cheaper capital, they have no realistic option but to shed, and invest less in, low-returning assets. That's 
what they are now doing.

British energy giant Shell on Thursday announced a 17-percent drop in annual net profit owing to weaker oil and 
gas prices as well as asset write-offs.
Profit after tax fell to $16.1 billion in 2024, the company said in an earnings statement.
Revenue dropped nearly 11 percent to $289 billion in a year that saw Shell backtrack on some key climate targets.
Oil prices came under pressure from weakness in the Chinese economy while the cost of gas has fallen heavily 
since soaring after the invasion of Ukraine by energy producer Russia.
In late 2024, Shell announced it was cutting hundreds of jobs from its oil and gas exploration division to reduce 
costs.
Chief executive Wael Sawan described last year's financial performance as "strong" despite "a lower price 
environment", causing Shell to increase its dividend by four percent and repurchase $3.5 billion of company 
shares.
Shell, whose share price rose slightly in reaction, "remains at a crossroads torn between the seemingly inevitable 
pull of the energy transition and the demands of shareholders", noted Derren Nathan, head of equity research at 
Hargreaves Lansdown.
"Its financial strength gives it the firepower to invest for the future as well as make generous distributions, but there 
are still some major doubts as to how the company plans to adapt to changing shifts in the energy mix."
Sawan said Shell will in March update its "strategy to deliver more value with less emissions".
The company last year booked a significant write-down owing to a shelved biofuels project in the Netherlands.

Shell Annual Profit Drops To $16 Bn As Oil Prices Fall
Along with rival BP, Shell has scaled back various climate objectives to focus more on oil and gas in order to raise 
profits, drawing criticism from environmental activists.
"Shell and its shareholders again raked in tens of billions from fuelling the climate crisis last year," Elena Polisano, 
head of Greenpeace UK's Stop Drilling campaign, said in reaction to the latest results.
Shell has watered down key targets on cutting carbon emissions but has kept its pledge for net zero by 2050.
The group had said net carbon intensity would be cut 15-20 percent by 2030 compared to 2016 levels. That marked 
a dilution from its previous 20-percent target.
In a more recent announcement, the company in December said it would no longer lead development of new 
offshore wind projects.
Offshore wind is one of the major sources of renewable energy that Europe is counting on to decarbonise electricity 
production, but in recent years projects have been mired by soaring costs and supply chain issues.
Gas is being touted by energy companies as cleaner than other fossil fuels as countries around the world strive to 
reduce their emissions and slow global warming.
