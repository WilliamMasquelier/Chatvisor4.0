Nvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang said artificial intelligence had hit a "tipping point," sending the stock to 
new dizzying heights.
The renewed rally has Huang, known for his love of wearing leather jackets, on the verge of his own breakthrough: 
becoming one of the 20 richest people in the world.
Huang's wealth jumped $US9.6 billion ($14.7 billion) to $US69.2 billion, a gain that leapfrogged him ahead of 
Charles Koch and Chinese bottled-water tycoon Zhong Shanshan to 21st place on the Bloomberg Billionaires 
Index. It's a remarkable rise for the co-founder of the semiconductor company, who was ranked 128th with a net 
worth of $US13.5 billion as recently as early last year.
Nvidia surged 16 per cent to a record high on Thursday in New York, adding about $US277 billion in market value. 
That was the biggest single-session increase in market history, beating Meta's $US197 billion gain earlier this 
month. The company was able to exceed sky-high investor expectations with a revenue forecast that was more 
than $US2 billion ahead of analyst expectations.
Nvidia's rally boosted the fortunes of the 30 billionaires on Bloomberg's wealth list who attribute at least some of 
their wealth to AI by a combined $US42.8 billion. Charles Liang, CEO of Super Micro Computer, was the biggest 
winner on a percentage basis with a 33 per cent jump.
Nvidia's outlook extends a streak of the company shattering expectations, thanks to insatiable demand for its 
artificial intelligence accelerators - highly prized chips that crunch data for AI models. The technology has helped 
power a proliferation of chatbots and other generative AI services, which can create text and graphics based on 
simple prompts.
"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point," Huang said. "Demand is surging worldwide 
across companies, industries and nations."

Nvidia's market capitalisation has now increased by more than $US650 billion this year - bringing its valuation to 
$US1.89 trillion - as investors bet that the company will remain the prime beneficiary of an AI computing boom.
That turned Wednesday's report into a highly anticipated event for both Wall Street and the tech world. And the 
numbers - along with the upbeat tone from Huang - renewed confidence that spending will stay strong.
"The entire market is watching this report and expectations have been elevated," Wolfe Research analyst Chris 
Caso said.
Guidance was strong enough to "demonstrate continued momentum, while also leaving room for continued upside 
through the second half."
Nvidia, co-founded by Huang in 1993, got its start as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. Its profile 
blew up in the last two years, when its technology proved adept at handling heavy AI workloads. The company's 
H100 accelerators have become legendary in the tech world, with customers scrambling to get their hands on as 
many as possible.
Companies such as Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet's Google are Nvidia's largest customers, 
accounting for nearly 40 per cent of its revenue, as they rush to invest in hardware for AI computing.
In the US fiscal fourth quarter, which ended January 28, Nvidia's revenue more than tripled to $US22.1 billion. Profit 
excluding certain items was $US5.16 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $US20.4 billion and earnings 
of $US4.60 a share. Underscoring the magnitude of its recent growth streak: As recently as 2021, Nvidia didn't 
generate that much revenue in an entire year.
Nvidia's data centre division, now by far its largest source of sales, generated $US18.4 billion of revenue, up 409 
per cent from the same period a year earlier. Gaming chips provided $US2.87 billion of sales.
Nvidia is now working to spread its AI technology beyond the big data-centre companies. Huang, 61, has travelled 
the globe arguing that governments and corporations need their own AI systems - both to protect their data and 
gain a competitive advantage.
Nvidia announced a deal with Cisco Systems earlier this month that gives it a new distribution channel. As part of 
that deal, Cisco, the world's biggest provider of networking gear, will help sell complete AI systems to companies.
But Nvidia faces risks, including mounting competition and a push by some customers to develop their own AI 
chips.
"We're going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in the marketplace," Huang said.
