Professor David Paterson's stance towards Ørsted appears neutral, as he emphasizes the importance of applying environmental learnings from the oil and gas sector to offshore wind without explicitly criticizing or endorsing Ørsted. His perspective suggests a consistent focus on responsible environmental management in offshore industries, which could influence Ørsted's reputation by reinforcing the need for sustainable decommissioning practices, though it does not directly challenge or support the company's current approach.
