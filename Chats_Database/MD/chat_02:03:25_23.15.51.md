You are tasked with adding English translations to a set of stakeholder quotes. For each quote:
- If the quote is in English, add "N.A." as the translation
- If the quote is in any other language, provide an accurate English translation

Input format is a markdown table with stakeholder names and quotes.
Output should be a markdown table with three columns: name, original quote, and translation.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Never translate English quotes to English - use "N.A." instead.
- Only and always translate non-English quotes.
- If the original quote, in the third column of the md table is not in english, translate it and add the tranlsation in the 4th column, as described below, but that is only when the quote is not in English.
- Keep original quotes exactly as they are.
- Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Example input:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision est importante." |
| John Smith | Orsted's corporate lawyer | "We need to review this carefully." |

Example output:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision est importante." | "This decision is important." |
| John Smith | Orsted's corporate lawyer | "We need to review this carefully." | N.A. |

If the input is "None", return "None".

Input quotes:
| Mads Nipper | Group president and chief executive of Ørsted | "The liquid e-fuel market in Europe is developing slower than expected, and we have taken the strategic decision to deprioritise our efforts within the market and cease the development of FlagshipONE." |
