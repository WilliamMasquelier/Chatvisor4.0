Anita Vlaar's decision to test and highlight Kure Bazaar Paris, a "12-free clean" nail polish, suggests a preference for non-toxic and eco-friendly alternatives, which may indicate a critical stance towards traditional acrylic nail products. While her views on Acrylnagelproducten are not explicitly stated, her focus on cleaner formulations could influence consumer perception by promoting a shift towards more sustainable and health-conscious nail care options, potentially impacting the reputation and demand for conventional acrylic nail products.
