Cisco Systems has completed its $US28bn ($42.8bn) all-cash acquisition of cyber security and analytics company 
Splunk.
The deal, the largest in Cisco's history, was closed months earlier than projected, reflecting the extraordinary effort 
many companies are undertaking as they remake their businesses around data and artificial intelligence.
Cisco chief executive Chuck Robbins and former Splunk CEO Gary Steele - now an executive vice-president at 
Cisco - said in an interview that AI would be deeply woven into the combined companies, and that they saw no hint 
that the current wave of business AI adoption was going to slow down or reverse course.
The combined company will use AI to help customers draw correlations in intelligence coming from different vendor 
platforms, so that they can take a more predictive approach to cyber security. While that predictive capability has 
been developing for some time, the company also plans to launch more capabilities that make use of generative AI 
to simplify their software and make it easier for people without technical training to operate the tools.
Splunk, launched in 2003, developed a dashboard that allows users to search, monitor and analyse machine-
generated data. It takes training to use it and generative AI helps reduce the learning curve, according to Mr Steele. 
"Splunk has its own proprietary language, the way in which you issue commands, and you have to be reasonably 
technical to do that," he said.
"With the AI assistance that we've launched, you can use English language to automatically generate that 
proprietary language. You can get outcomes without having all the advanced knowledge." Splunk's AI would benefit 
from Cisco's massive amounts of data, not to mention its global presence and sales and marketing channels, Mr 
Steele said.
Generative AI will have other applications across Cisco's business, such as simplifying the complex task of setting 
a configuration screen for a company's security policy, according to Mr Robbins. "It's very technical. We're going to 
enable our customers to just use English language to describe what security capabilities they would like â€¦ and 
then we will translate that into a policy that they would review," he said.

The software will function as an assistant, simplifying and speeding up the deployment of security policy and other 
resources without replacing human operators, according to Mr Robbins.
When the deal was announced in September 2023, the companies said it expected it to be completed by the end of 
September 2024. The process was completed in roughly half a year. Last week, the European Union gave the deal 
unconditional antitrust approval, after regulators found it wouldn't pose barriers to competition. Networking 
equipment pioneer Cisco, founded in 1984, rode the telecommunications boom of the 1990s. It was for a time the 
most valuable company in the world.
