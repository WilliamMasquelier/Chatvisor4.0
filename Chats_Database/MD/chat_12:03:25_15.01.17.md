#### Introduction  

Shell has faced increasing scrutiny for weakening its climate commitments, particularly regarding its 2030 and 2035 emission reduction targets. The company has scaled back its decarbonization goals and slowed the decline of fossil fuel production, drawing criticism from environmental advocates and investors. These actions have raised concerns that Shell is prioritizing short-term financial gains over long-term sustainability, undermining global efforts to combat climate change. The company’s retreat from previous commitments has also sparked backlash from stakeholders who expect stronger environmental responsibility from major energy corporations.  

#### Chronological Developments  

Shell’s shift away from its earlier climate commitments became evident in early 2024 when CEO Wael Sawan stated that setting a 2035 emission reduction target was "perilous" due to uncertainties in the energy transition. This marked a significant departure from Shell’s previous stance on long-term decarbonization, signaling a retreat from its earlier commitments to reducing carbon emissions [WA Today, April 02, 2024]. Around the same time, Shell also reduced its 2030 climate targets, shifting its focus away from long-term sustainability efforts. Critics argued that this move prioritized short-term profits over meaningful action to combat climate change, further undermining global efforts to transition away from fossil fuels [WA Today, April 02, 2024].  

In May 2024, Shell faced additional backlash for slowing the rate at which its fossil fuel production was scheduled to decline. This decision was met with strong criticism from European and UK investors who are more committed to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies. Many stakeholders viewed this as a clear indication that Shell was prioritizing financial gains over long-term sustainability [WA Today, May 09, 2024]. Around the same time, Greenpeace UK accused Shell of "banking billions from flogging the fuels that are driving the crisis," reinforcing concerns that the company was profiting from fossil fuels while global leaders were discussing ways to help vulnerable nations cope with climate change [International Business Times Australia, May 02, 2024].  

By early 2025, Shell had further weakened its climate commitments by reducing its net carbon intensity goal for 2030 from a 20% reduction to a range of 15-20%. This move drew criticism from environmental activists, who argued that the company was backtracking on its climate commitments and undermining global efforts to combat climate change [International Business Times Australia, Ben Perry, January 30, 2025].  

#### Impact Analysis and Business Model Implications  

Shell’s decision to weaken its climate commitments has significant implications for its reputation, operations, and long-term business strategy. The company’s retreat from its previous decarbonization goals has damaged its credibility among environmental advocates and investors who prioritize sustainability. This reputational risk could lead to increased scrutiny from regulators and policymakers, potentially resulting in stricter regulations or legal challenges.  

Operationally, Shell’s decision to slow the decline of fossil fuel production may provide short-term financial benefits, but it also exposes the company to long-term risks. As global energy markets shift towards renewables, Shell’s reliance on fossil fuels could make it less competitive in the future. Additionally, the company’s weakened climate commitments may deter potential partners and investors who prioritize ESG considerations.  

Financially, Shell’s decision to scale back its climate targets could lead to increased investor skepticism, particularly from European and UK stakeholders who are more committed to ESG policies. This could result in divestments or reduced access to sustainable financing options. Furthermore, as governments worldwide implement stricter climate policies, Shell may face higher compliance costs and potential legal challenges related to its environmental impact.  

From a business model perspective, Shell’s weakening climate commitments could hinder its ability to adapt to the energy transition. While the company has invested in renewable energy projects, its continued reliance on fossil fuels may limit its ability to compete with companies that are more aggressively pursuing decarbonization strategies. Additionally, consumer preferences are shifting towards cleaner energy solutions, and Shell’s perceived reluctance to fully commit to sustainability could impact its brand loyalty and market positioning.  

#### Stakeholder Interests  

Shell’s decision to weaken its climate commitments has elicited strong reactions from various stakeholders, each with distinct concerns and expectations.  

Environmental advocates and climate activists have been among the most vocal critics, arguing that Shell’s actions undermine global efforts to combat climate change. Greenpeace UK, for example, accused the company of profiting from fossil fuels while vulnerable nations struggle with climate-related challenges [International Business Times Australia, May 02, 2024]. These groups expect Shell to take more ambitious steps towards decarbonization and align its business strategy with global climate goals.  

Investors, particularly those in Europe and the UK, have also expressed concerns about Shell’s retreat from its climate commitments. Many of these investors prioritize ESG considerations and view Shell’s actions as a step backward. The backlash from this group could lead to divestments or increased pressure on Shell’s leadership to adopt more sustainable policies [WA Today, May 09, 2024].  

Regulators and policymakers may also take a more critical stance on Shell’s environmental policies. As governments worldwide implement stricter climate regulations, Shell’s weakened commitments could attract regulatory scrutiny and potential legal challenges. This could result in increased compliance costs and restrictions on the company’s operations.  

Consumers and corporate clients are another key stakeholder group affected by Shell’s climate policies. As demand for cleaner energy solutions grows, Shell’s perceived reluctance to fully commit to sustainability could impact its brand reputation and customer loyalty. Businesses that prioritize sustainability in their supply chains may also reconsider their partnerships with Shell if the company is seen as failing to meet environmental expectations.  

Overall, Shell’s decision to weaken its climate commitments has created significant reputational, financial, and operational risks. The company’s ability to navigate these challenges will depend on how it responds to stakeholder concerns and whether it takes meaningful steps to align its business strategy with global climate goals.
