Shell, one of Australia's largest foreign investors, has urged the federal government to remove duplication and 
inconsistency across state and national energy regimes to create a "single front door" across all energy projects in 
Australia.
Shell's country chair Cecile Wake told The Australian's Energy Nation Forum a more streamlined process should 
apply beyond renewable energy projects.
Her comments come amid growing concerns around regulatory bottlenecks and environment planning delays that 
can stymie and delay energy project timelines.
"The renewable energy agreements that minister (Chris) Bowen was speaking about between himself and the state 
energy ministers, let's broaden them so that we deliver successful projects across the length and breadth of our 
economy," Ms Wake said.
"Energy is the economy. Energy is the future. And we've got a great opportunity, but we mustn't â€¦ squander our 
traditional strengths." She said an agreement covering business, government and consumers was required to 
traverse the complex energy transition, which wouldn't happen without trade-offs, costs and difficult choices.
"We just need to have that clear-eyed, transparent dialogue." Ms Wake also noted the energy policy debate would 
need to broach subjects including incentives, subsidies and production credits.
Shell is one of the dominant players in Australia's -energy sector, operating the QCLNG export plant in 
Queensland, the Prelude floating LNG project off northern Australia and also has stakes in WA's North West Shelf 
and Gorgon LNG ventures and gas business Arrow.
Ms Wake called for a pragmatic approach and a "shared vision" among stakeholders for the nation to best navigate 
and capitalise on the energy transition happening across markets globally.

"We need to stop demonising gas, we need to look more broadly than simply the â€¦ renewable penetration in the 
electricity mix, we need to look to biofuels. We need to at least have a conversation around nuclear," she said, 
noting Shell did not operate in the nuclear space as it wasn't a competitive strength.
Wednesday's forum was held amid rising speculation of an early election and a flare-up in the energy and climate 
wars.
Large Australian and offshore-based companies are also positioning to benefit from burgeoning industries and 
policies that emerge as a result of the changes. GrainCorp chief executive Robert Spurway told the forum it was up 
to government to get policy settings right, for industries such as biofuels, that would allow Australia to leverage its 
"natural advantage".
