If the given company is not a specific entity but a topic or industry, make sure that the article's content is directly and closely related to that topic or industry. The company or topic to be considered is the following: Shell.

## User


You will be provided with a news media article and a company, topic or industry name. Here is the company or industry of interest: Shell. It operates in the oil and gas, with a prefered focus on the Australia market. You should only respond to the following question: Is the article relevant? Your output should only be: "Yes" or "No". Nothing else. Your task is to determine if the article is sufficiently relevant to Shell based on the following criterion:

Centrality: The article is considered relevant if Shell is central to the article's content, meaning the focus of the conversation revolves around Shell.

If Shell is only mentioned a few times without being a primary focus, the article should be considered not relevant.

The two major threats to a 'net zero' world

Highlight: Shell's head of strategy says the chances of meeting the global carbon emissions targets depend on 
two crucial factors.
Body
To meet global carbon emissions goals, domestic and geopolitical policies have to align to create a pathway to net-
zero emissions by 2050. In the world in which we currently live, that looks unlikely.
Global emissions targets are already being missed, the mix of geopolitical tensions and domestic policies is muffling 
the impact that China's dominant clean energy technologies could have, and in the wake of the pandemic and 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, energy security has been prioritised over emissions, particularly in Europe.
It's not all doom and gloom though. Shell's international vice president for strategy, insights and scenarios, Laszlo 
Varro, says the transition to net zero will succeed or fail depending on how well two "global cleavage points" are 
managed.
One is the financial gap between the Western world, which is investing heavily in clean energy technologies - about 
90 per cent of the global investment in those technologies is being made by the West and China - and the 
developing world.
The other is what Varro refers to as the "technology interface," or being able to leverage China's "unique 
capabilities" within a "challenging" geopolitical context.
Varro, who's in Australia to speak at an Australian Energy Producers conference in Perth this week, says there has 
been a surge in clean energy investment in China and a remarkable inflow of investment in the sustainable finance 
sector in the Western world. About 85 per cent of that money, however, stays in the Western world.
Canadian pension fund buying a Swedish wind farm, " he said. "Whereas last year, green bonds in Africa were 0.1 
per cent of the total green bond deployment."
The developing world, where populations are growing even as those in developed economies and China are 
flatlining or shrinking, doesn't have the funds to finance a transition to clean energy and, Varro says, there is no 
time and no carbon budget (if net zero is to be achieved as targeted) for it to have a conventional industrialisation 
and then make that transition.
The good news, he said, is that the technology that makes a transition plausible is solar and most developing 
countries are close to the equator. Scale "leapfrogging" - largely bypassing fossil fuel-based energy systems and

jumping straight to solar or hydro while using natural gas as the reserve - is already occurring in Africa and 
elsewhere.
A two-thirds renewables, one-third natural gas combination produces roughly 100 kg of carbon dioxide per 
megawatt of power, or less than half the current European or US average, Varro said.
(Varro and his team at Shell, a major gas producer, see the impact of electric cars resulting in peak oil demand 
somewhere between 2025 and 2035, but see a significant future for natural gas - for use in heavy industry or as 
reserve power for renewable systems that are weather dependent - even in a net-zero environment, with carbon 
capture and storage or removal playing a role).
'A London every quarter'
Unfortunately, while the developing world might be leapfrogging its way towards cleaner energy, it is also rapidly 
urbanising and building the infrastructure to accommodate the large shifts in populations towards urban centres.
"Urbanisation is currently running at the speed of a London every quarter," Varro said.
"This is the people who live in their villages and move to Cairo, or Nairobi or Jakarta or Karachi. That's a London 
every quarter and that is concrete and steel and glass and plastics and aluminium. All these are very energy-
intensive commodities; altogether representing around 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions."
There's also that paucity of investment for clean energy in the developing world. Varro says Shell's best estimate is 
that the developing world needs about seven times the level of clean energy investment that is occurring within the 
developed world.
And that is difficult to imagine, he said, given the segmentation of the global financial system - which makes it a 
factor that could cause the transition to net-zero emissions to fail.
The maths of net zero are quite daunting. In 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that to 
achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by 2050 the carbon budget - the cumulative emissions - 
would be 500 gigatonnes (Gt).
From the starting point of January 1, 2020 to the end of 2022, however, there has already been about 120 Gt of 
emissions. With annual global emissions of more than 40 Gt in 2023, you don't have to be Einstein to see how 
challenging keeping within, or anywhere close to, that emissions budget will be and how significant a role 
developing economies - and China - will have in the success or failure of the transition.
Geopolitics, therefore, represents the other major threat.
China leads the world in the mass production of clean-energy technologies, whether it's EVs, batteries, solar 
panels, wind turbines or the processing of the critical minerals required.
Its economy is also still heavily dependent on coal, despite a massive state-directed and subsidised deployment of 
clean-power technologies. Varro said China's domestic coal-mining output last year increased by more than 
Australia's entire exports of LNG.
China is, however, the largest EV manufacturer in the world and the EV market share in its domestic market is 
approaching 50 per cent. That will affect its own emissions and, to the extent that it is able to export its EVs, those 
of third countries.
This month's announcement of new punitive tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, batteries, solar cells and critical 
miners by the Biden administration - made to protect the massive investments in green technologies sparked by 
America's Inflation Reduction Act and also influenced by the domestic political sensitivity of the US auto industry in 
an election year - is being criticised outside America because of the impact it will have on the takeup of EVs and 
other clean energy technologies, and therefore on the rate at which carbon emissions are reduced.Page 3 of 3
The two major threats to a 'net zero' world
The higher prices for electric cars built in the US or Europe (which is close to imposing its own tariffs on Chinese 
EVs) and the need to develop their own critical minerals and battery supply chains will slow the takeup of EVs in the 
US and Europe.
'Predictable surprise'
The "next predictable surprise" is a flood of cheap Chinese EVs into developing economies, says Varro.
China's clean energy "cluster" has, he said, genuinely unique capabilities and, given the challenging geopolitical 
context, how the tensions are resolved is one of the key uncertainties, with the potential to facilitate or slow down 
the global energy transition.
How the financial gap between the Western world and the developing world, and China's unique capabilities are 
managed can therefore "make a difference between success or failure," says Varro.
While he thinks there are plausible routes to net zero, they will involve massive and disruptive government 
interventions in energy systems, economies and societies and a reduction in geopolitical tensions that have been 
intensifying rather than waning.
Today, those outcomes do seem unlikely.
