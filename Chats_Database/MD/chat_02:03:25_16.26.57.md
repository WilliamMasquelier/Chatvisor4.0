## Assistant

Lisanne van Spronsen maintains a neutral stance towards Acrylnagelproducten, as her statement objectively describes the chemical composition and function of acrylates in gel nail products without expressing a positive or negative opinion. Given her role as a journalist, her factual reporting is unlikely to directly impact Acrylnagelproducten’s reputation or operations, but continued coverage on the topic could shape public awareness and discussions around the safety and use of such products.
