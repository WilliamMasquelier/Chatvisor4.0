Keith Anderson's statement suggests a cautiously optimistic stance towards Ørsted, acknowledging past challenges but indicating a recovery in the offshore wind sector. His reference to a "misstep" implies prior criticism or concerns, but his recognition that the industry is "back on track" may help restore confidence in Ørsted’s operations, signaling a shift from past negativity to a more neutral or slightly positive outlook.
