Highlight: State-owned Norwegian energy giant Ørsted says there is a lack of demand for e-fuel
Body
A flagship green fuel factory has been scrapped by the renewable energy giant Ørsted  amid a lack of demand 
from customers.
Work has halted on the FlagshipONE project, a proposed e-methanol plant in the Swedish town of Örnsköldsvik, 
meant to supply container ships as part of the battle to reach net zero.
The announcement is the latest sign that energy majors are retreating from the mega-projects needed to accelerate 
the global shift from fossil fuels to cleaner substitutes. 
Ørsted took a 1.5bn Danish kroner (£172m) hit from the decision to axe the facility, according to its latest financial 
results.
The business, which is controlled by the Danish government, has become one of the UK’s leading developers of 
offshore wind, with 12 operational wind farms in UK waters.
They include Hornsea 1 and 2 off the east coast – together comprising one of the world’s largest wind farms.
The company produces 7pc of the UK’s power and is planning further expansion including two more wind farms 
near Hornsea  and a massive floating one off Scotland.
However, its ventures into new technologies and regions have hit the company hard this year, with Mads Nipper, 
group president and chief executive of Ørsted announcing a total of 3.9bn DKK of impairments.
The FlagshipONE project would have used renewable electricity to produce hydrogen that could then be combined 
with CO2 to produce methanol.

The aim was to produce 55,000 tonnes of methanol a year, enough for one large container vessel, making it a 
large-scale pilot project.
Mr Nipper said the company had been unable to secure long-term contracts to buy its e-methanol at a viable price.
He said: “The liquid e-fuel market in Europe is developing slower than expected, and we have taken the strategic 
decision to deprioritise our efforts within the market and cease the development of FlagshipONE.
“We will continue our focus and development efforts within renewable hydrogen, which is essential for 
decarbonising key industries in Europe and closer to our core business.”
Ørsted suffered a second impairment totalling 2.1bn kroner at its Revolution wind farm project near Martha’s 
Vineyard, off the US east coast. Construction delays at its onshore substation are the key cause.
Mr Nipper said: “Despite encouraging progress on our US offshore wind project, Revolution Wind, the construction 
of the onshore substation for the project has been delayed. This means that we have pushed the commercial 
operation date from 2025 into 2026, which led to an impairment.
“This is, of course, unsatisfactory.”
The company reported a pre-tax profit of 3.9bn kroner, up from 2.4bn kroner in the same period last year, and net 
profits of 931m kroner.
Tancrede Fulop, senior equity analyst at Morningstar said Ørsted had outperformed expectations especially in 
offshore wind, but the impairments “underscore the impact of project delays”.
Ørsted’s cuts follow similar moves by other energy majors in scaling back renewable energy projects.
Last month, Shell halted construction of a new plant in Rotterdam meant to convert waste into jet fuel and biodiesel, 
warning that market conditions were not right.
