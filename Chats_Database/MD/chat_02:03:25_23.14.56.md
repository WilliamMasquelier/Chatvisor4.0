You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| Joël Meggelaars | Ørsted representative | "We zijn de testfase dus voorbij." | "We are past the testing phase." |
| Joël Meggelaars | Ørsted representative | "We hebben onze veiligheidsvoorwaarden aangescherpt." | "We have tightened our safety conditions." |
| Joël Meggelaars | Ørsted representative | "Omdat dit de eerste keer is dat we het echt op operationele schaal doen, houden we daar rekening mee in de planning." | "Because this is the first time we are really doing it on an operational scale, we are taking that into account in the planning." |
| Joël Meggelaars | Ørsted representative | "Dus ik denk dat we het nu al een succes kunnen noemen." | "So I think we can already call it a success." |
| Joël Meggelaars | Ørsted representative | "Het is in elk geval een veelbelovende ontwikkeling." | "It is certainly a promising development." |
| Joël Meggelaars | Ørsted representative | "Het onderhoud van windturbines is en blijft mensenwerk." | "The maintenance of wind turbines is and remains a human job." |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Orsted.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Orsted or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
