## Assistant

The media portrayal of Annika Lee Louise Peterson, Edmund L. Wong, and Hamzah Kardame is entirely neutral, as they are only mentioned in the context of patent filings for Cisco Technology. Each individual is listed as an inventor in brief, factual reports without any evaluative language or sentiment, resulting in an average sentiment score of 0.0. There is no evidence of negative portrayal, controversy, or criticism in the coverage, suggesting that their inclusion in a list of individuals with the "most negative sentiment" is misleading or based on a misinterpretation of sentiment analysis.
