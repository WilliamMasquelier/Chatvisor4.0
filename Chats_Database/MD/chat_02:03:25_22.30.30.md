Body
Danish energy company and the world's largest offshore wind farm developer Orsted is cutting investments by 
25%.
Orsted recently changed management and announced that it would cut planned investments by 25% by 2030, the 
Financial Times reports.
Orsted is still trying to recover from the effects of its expansion in the US, where it ran into major problems in 2023.
Orsted's new management now wants to raise the company's shares again and is trying to adapt to the changed 
business climate.
Under Orsted's previous CEO, Mads Nipper, the company's shares fell by almost 80% due to rising interest rates 
and the end of the green stock boom. The company's business was further disrupted by global supply disruptions, 
and Orsted has abandoned several projects in recent years.
Over the past decade, Orsted has transformed itself into a renewable energy company, having previously operated 
primarily in the fossil fuel market.
Some other renewable energy developers are also setting less ambitious targets. For example, Orsted shareholder 
and Norwegian state energy company Equinor announced that it would lower its renewable energy targets and 
increase oil and gas production by 10%. (Afn.by)
