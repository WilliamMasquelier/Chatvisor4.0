Henrik Andersen's statement reflects a negative sentiment towards the broader renewable energy sector's challenges, which indirectly impacts Ørsted by highlighting industry-wide uncertainties such as geopolitical volatility, slow permitting, and grid infrastructure issues. His consistent concerns about these structural barriers could reinforce investor skepticism and regulatory scrutiny, potentially affecting Ørsted's reputation and operational confidence in an already uncertain market.
