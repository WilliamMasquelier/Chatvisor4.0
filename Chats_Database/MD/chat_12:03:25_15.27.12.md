You are tasked with adding English translations to a set of stakeholder quotes. For each quote:
- If the quote is in English, add "N.A." as the translation
- If the quote is in any other language, provide an accurate English translation

Input format is a markdown table with stakeholder names and quotes.
Output should be a markdown table with three columns: name, original quote, and translation.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Never translate English quotes to English - use "N.A." instead.
- Only and always translate non-English quotes.
- If the original quote, in the third column of the md table is not in english, translate it and add the translation in the 4th column, as described below, but that is only when the quote is not in English.
- Keep original quotes exactly as they are.
- Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Example input:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision est importante." |
| John Smith | Shell's corporate lawyer | "We need to review this carefully." |

Example output:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision est importante." | "This decision is important." |
| John Smith | Shell's corporate lawyer | "We need to review this carefully." | N.A. |

Example input:
| [Person Name 1] | Person Role 1 | [Original Quote in another language (e.g. Dutch, French, German, Spanish,eyc..)] |
| [person Name 2] | Person Role 2 | [Original Quote in English] |

Example output:
| [person Name 1] | Person Role 1 | [Original Quote in another language (e.g. Dutch, French, German, Spanish,etc..)] | [Translated Quote] |
| [person Name 2] | Person Role 2 | [Original Quote in English] | N.A. |

If the input is "None", return "None". if the original quote is not in English, make sure it is translated. Add "N.A" if the quote is already in English.

Input quotes:
| Saul Kavonic | Energy analyst | "If they can prove horizontal wells work in this tight coal seam gas play, it could open up several more tcf [trillion cubic feet] of gas for the east coast." |
| Rick Wilkinson | CEO of EnergyQuest | "The flare reported at the Shell site seems to indicate more gas is flowing than the vertical well tested recently by Elixir." |
| Trevor Brown | CEO of Omega | "If we're successful here this could be the next big wave of development post the coal seam gas wave." |
