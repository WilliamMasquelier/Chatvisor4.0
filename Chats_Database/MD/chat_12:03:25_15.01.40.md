SpaceX on the move Elon Musk's SpaceX is seeking to convert its business incorporation to Texas from Delaware. 
The Secretary of State of Texas on Wednesday issued a certificate evidencing the acceptance and filing of the 
conversion. The rocket company's move comes two weeks after a Delaware court ordered Musk to give up a Tesla 
compensation package valued at $US55.8bn. "Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware," Musk 
wrote on X following the court's decision, noting that shareholders would be able to vote on whether to move 
Tesla's incorporation to Texas.
Publishing spat Arena Group Holdings said it would continue publishing the print and digital editions of Sports 
Illustrated as it continued negotiating with the publication's owner, Authentic Brands Group. Arena, which also 
publishes TheStreet and Men's Journal, said there was an unresolved claim of $US45m against the company by 
Authentic, and it would continue to publish Sports Illustrated until the issue was resolved. The publisher previously 
missed a payment to Authentic, which licenses the Sports Illustrated brand to Arena. Under the publishing deal 
between the two, Authentic has the right to terminate its licensing agreement, which Authentic did. Arena on 
Wednesday also named Cavitt Randall as the company's next chief executive. Arena said in a regulatory filing that 
Randall was appointed chairman of the board January 23 and had previously served as CEO of investment firm 
MBX Clearing and operating chief of SI Capital. Randall, 46, has agreed to an annual salary of $US1, according to 
the filing.

of these actions in the third quarter and recognise about $US500m of these charges. Cisco expects about 
$US150m of the charges to be recognised in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and the remaining amount primarily 
through the first half of fiscal 2025. Cisco had about 84,900 employees as of July 29.
Morgan Stanley cuts Morgan Stanley plans to cut several hundred jobs in its wealth management division as new
