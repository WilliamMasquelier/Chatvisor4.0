#### Introduction  

Ørsted, once a dominant force in the renewable energy sector, has faced severe financial instability in recent years, leading to a dramatic decline in its market capitalization. The company has suffered multi-billion-euro impairments, project cancellations, and cost overruns, significantly eroding investor confidence. Rising interest rates, inflation, and supply chain disruptions have further exacerbated its financial struggles, forcing Ørsted to implement drastic cost-cutting measures, suspend dividend payments, and sell assets. These financial difficulties raise concerns about the company’s long-term viability and its ability to maintain leadership in the offshore wind sector.  

#### Chronological Developments  

Ørsted’s financial troubles became increasingly apparent in 2023 when the company reported a net loss of €2.7 billion, a stark contrast to its €2 billion profit the previous year. This downturn was largely attributed to the cancellation of major offshore wind projects in the U.S., including Ocean Wind 1 and 2, which resulted in impairments of €3.8 billion. Additionally, the company set aside €1.5 billion in provisions for potential compensation payments related to these canceled projects, further straining its financial position [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024].  

The company’s market capitalization, which peaked at €76.5 billion in early 2021, had plummeted to just €16 billion by early 2024, marking a decline of approximately 80% [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]. This sharp drop reflected growing investor concerns about Ørsted’s financial health and its ability to execute large-scale offshore wind projects profitably.  

In response to these financial difficulties, Ørsted announced a series of drastic measures, including asset sales worth €15 billion to stabilize its balance sheet. However, this strategy raised concerns about the company’s long-term growth potential, as selling key assets could weaken its influence in the offshore wind sector [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024].  

By mid-2024, Ørsted continued to struggle, reporting a loss of 1.7 billion Danish kroner (€225 million) in the second quarter due to delays and the abandonment of key offshore wind projects. These financial setbacks forced the company to scale back its ambitious goal of expanding its renewable energy capacity to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030 [Energie & Management, Georg Eble, October 07, 2024].  

The financial strain intensified in late 2024, prompting Ørsted to suspend dividend payments, cut investments, and lay off hundreds of employees as part of a major restructuring effort. These measures were necessary to address rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and higher interest rates, but they also raised concerns about the company’s ability to maintain its leadership in the offshore wind sector [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, October 30, 2024].  

Entering 2025, Ørsted faced further financial setbacks, announcing new asset impairments amounting to approximately 9% of its market capitalization. This unexpected write-down led to an 11% drop in its stock price, following an initial plunge of 18%. Investors had hoped that the worst was over after the company’s 2023 financial struggles, but these new impairments further eroded confidence in Ørsted’s financial stability [Les Echos, Sylvie Ramadier, January 21, 2025].  

The company’s financial woes continued with a €1.62 billion impairment due to cost overruns and delays in its Sunrise Wind project, the largest offshore wind farm in the U.S. Analysts warned that Ørsted now held American assets that "no longer have any value," raising serious concerns about its financial health and ability to execute large-scale projects [Les Echos, Nicolas Rauline, January 22, 2025].  

By early February 2025, Ørsted announced fresh writedowns of 12.1 billion Danish kroner (£1.4 billion) on its U.S. business, citing rising interest rates and market uncertainties. This latest financial blow followed a series of impairments and project cancellations, further eroding investor confidence [The Telegraph, James Warrington, January 31, 2025].  

#### Severity and Impact Analysis  

Ørsted’s financial instability has had profound implications for its operations, reputation, and stakeholder trust. The company’s repeated impairments and project cancellations have significantly weakened investor confidence, as evidenced by the 80% decline in its market capitalization since 2021 [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]. This loss of value has made it more difficult for Ørsted to secure financing for future projects, potentially limiting its ability to expand its renewable energy portfolio.  

Operationally, the company’s financial struggles have forced it to scale back investments, suspend dividend payments, and lay off employees, all of which could hinder its ability to maintain leadership in the offshore wind sector [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, October 30, 2024]. The sale of €15 billion in assets, while necessary to stabilize its balance sheet, could weaken Ørsted’s long-term growth potential and reduce its influence in the industry [Le Monde, Jean-Michel Bezat, February 09, 2024].  

From a regulatory perspective, Ørsted’s financial difficulties may impact its ability to participate in future offshore wind auctions and secure government contracts. The company’s impairments and project cancellations in the U.S. have already raised concerns about its ability to execute large-scale projects efficiently, which could affect its standing with policymakers and regulators [Les Echos, Nicolas Rauline, January 22, 2025].  

#### Stakeholder Interests  

Ørsted’s financial instability has affected multiple stakeholders, each with distinct concerns and expectations.  

- **Investors**: Shareholders have suffered significant losses due to the company’s declining stock price, with Ørsted’s market capitalization dropping by approximately €65 billion since its peak in 2021 [Les Echos, Sylvie Ramadier, January 21, 2025]. Investors are increasingly wary of the company’s ability to recover, particularly given the repeated impairments and project cancellations.  

- **Government and Regulators**: The Danish government, which holds a significant stake in Ørsted, has borne half of the company’s market capitalization loss, raising concerns about the financial stability of a key national asset [Les Echos, Sylvie Ramadier, January 21, 2025]. Regulators in the Netherlands and other markets may also scrutinize Ørsted’s financial health when awarding future offshore wind contracts.  

- **Employees**: The company’s financial struggles have led to layoffs and restructuring efforts, creating uncertainty for its workforce [De Telegraaf, August 15, 2024]. Employees may be concerned about job security and the company’s long-term stability.  

- **Customers and Partners**: Utility companies, corporate buyers, and technology partners rely on Ørsted for stable renewable energy supply. The company’s financial instability and project cancellations could undermine trust and lead customers to seek alternative suppliers [Energie & Management, Georg Eble, October 07, 2024].  

#### Business Model Implications  

Ørsted’s financial instability poses significant challenges to its business model, particularly in the Netherlands’ renewable energy market. The company’s ability to develop and operate offshore wind farms depends on securing financing and maintaining investor confidence. However, the sharp decline in its market capitalization and repeated impairments have made it more difficult to attract capital for new projects [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024].  

The company’s cost-cutting measures, including asset sales and reduced investments, could weaken its competitive position in the offshore wind sector. Ørsted’s ability to innovate and expand its renewable energy capacity is now under pressure, potentially affecting its long-term growth strategy [Energie & Management, Georg Eble, October 07, 2024].  

Additionally, Ørsted’s financial struggles may impact its ability to form strategic partnerships and secure government contracts. Policymakers and regulators may be hesitant to award new projects to a company facing significant financial uncertainty [Les Echos, Nicolas Rauline, January 22, 2025].  

Overall, Ørsted’s financial instability threatens its leadership in the renewable energy sector, raising concerns about its long-term viability and ability to support the Netherlands’ energy transition goals.
