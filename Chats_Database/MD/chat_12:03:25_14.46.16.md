Compassion in World Farming (CIWF), Media Release, 24 February 2025
Compassion in World Farming (CIWF), a leading animal welfare organisation, has released its APAC EggTrack 
2024 Spotlight. As the 2025 deadline for numerous global, regional, and local commitments approaches, the 
Spotlight highlights Australia’s standout leadership in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region for advancing cage-free egg 
commitments.

This year’s ‘online spotlight’ underscores both achievements and ongoing challenges in the region’s shift to cage-
free egg production, with several Australian companies demonstrating leadership in setting benchmarks for 
transparency and cage-free implementation.
The APAC EggTrack 2024 spotlight showcases how companies in the region are progressing toward their cage-
free commitments. It identifies which companies are ‘Leaders’ (companies achieving significant progress or 100 per 
cent cage-free status), ‘In Progress’ (companies demonstrating transparency despite low implementation), ‘At Risk’ 
(companies failing to disclose progress and commitments), and ‘Laggards’ (companies retreating from prior 
commitments). The reporting is based on publicly available information, including company websites, ESG reports, 
and press releases.
Australian companies leading the way
Among the 23 companies analysed across APAC, five companies in Australia are recognised as ‘leaders’.

EggTrack 2024: Australia leads cage-free egg transition in APAC
McDonald’s has achieved 100 per cent cage-free for shell eggs and egg products across Australia and New 
Zealand. Coles Group reports 94 per cent cage-free for branded and own-brand shell eggs in Australia, achieving 
100 per cent for its own-brand shell eggs. Woolworths Group maintains 100 per cent cage-free for own-brand and 
77 per cent for branded shell eggs, in Australia and New Zealand, and has increased cage-free ingredient use from 
21 per cent to 34 per cent.
Hungry Jack’s (regionally, Burger King) has achieved 100 per cent cage-free shell eggs in Australia and New 
Zealand and is reporting 22 per cent cage-free for whole eggs, egg products, and egg ingredients across the APAC 
region. Sodexo Australia continues to maintain 100 per cent cage-free shell eggs, but is not reporting progress on 
cage-free egg products.

While Australia's leaders set a high standard, other companies are making good progress such as Domino’s Pizza 
Enterprises (Australia) reporting an increase in cage-free implementation from 11.7 per cent to 27 per cent.
However, some companies remain silent on their Australian commitment progress, with George Weston Foods, 
Mars Global and Aldi Süd, yet to provide public reports.
Disappointingly, Bid Corporation’s Australian subsidiary no longer references its cage-free commitment, raising 
concerns about its continued dedication to its previous goals.
Call for transparency and action
The APAC EggTrack Spotlight 2024 highlights both achievements and ongoing challenges in the region. For 
example, in 2024 Australia experienced purchase limits on the number of egg cartons and an 11.2 per cent price 
increase as a result of Avian Influenza and the cull of more than 1.8 million birds.
On average, cage-free implementation in the region has grown by 9.9 percentage points since 2023. The spotlight 
shows that the overall pace of transition remains inconsistent across the region. While some companies have 
demonstrated strong progress, others have experienced a slower transition, with many businesses still needing to 
scale up implementation.
"We understand transition can be challenging; however, we remain optimistic for a cage-free future. Australia's 
leadership in the APAC region demonstrates what can be achieved and we encourage all companies to actively 
progress and report on their journey to cage-free for all hens in their supply.” Dr Tracey Jones, Global Director of 
Food Business.
