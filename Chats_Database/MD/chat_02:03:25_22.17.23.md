Previous summaries: - Ørsted has announced the suspension of its dividend payments until at least 2025, marking a significant shift in its financial strategy. The company had been consistently increasing shareholder payouts since 2016, but due to financial struggles, it has decided to halt these payments to focus on investments without raising additional capital. This move could negatively impact investor confidence and stock performance, as dividends are a key attraction for shareholders. [El Economista, Violeta N. Quiñonero, February 07, 2024]

- The company has suffered a major financial setback, reporting an EBITDA of 18.7 billion Danish kroner (€2.5 billion) for 2023, which is below its projected range of 20-23 billion kroner. A significant portion of this shortfall is attributed to a 9.6 billion kroner provision for cancellation costs related to the termination of the Ocean Wind 1 project in the U.S. This financial underperformance highlights the challenges Ørsted faces in managing its offshore wind projects profitably.

The job cuts will have significant social and economic consequences for affected employees and their communities, further highlighting the financial strain the company is under. [Energie & Management, Stefan Sagmeister, February 08, 2024]

- The company has announced a suspension of dividend payments until at least 2025, a move that could negatively impact investor confidence. Ørsted had previously been a reliable dividend payer, making this decision a major shift in its financial strategy. The suspension reflects the company’s urgent need to preserve capital amid mounting financial losses, but it may also deter investors who rely on dividends for returns. [Het Financieele Dagblad, Bartjens, February 09, 2024]

- Ørsted’s market value has plummeted by 70% over the past three years, reflecting a severe loss of investor confidence.

SSE PLC (LSE:SSE), Orsted and ScottishPower are among firms to have secured contracts under the UK's latest 
green energy allocation round.
After no bids were submitted in last year's auction, nine offshore wind contracts were awarded in the UK's sixth 
allocation round, the government announced on Tuesday.
These come alongside a wider string of green energy projects which combined will provide enough power for some 
11 million homes.
SSE saw its 130.5 megawatt Cloiche Wind Farm awarded a contract for difference under the round, guaranteeing a 
price for the power it produces.
Other wind farm developers ScottishPower and Denmark's Orsted also won contracts, for their Hornsea 4 and East 
Anglia 2 sites respectively.
ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson noted offshore wind was "back on track"  following last year's 
"misstep," which saw lower offered prices fail to attract any developers.
Stephen Wheeler, managing director at SSE Renewables, added guaranteed prices under the contracts for 
difference secured a "route to market" for projects and was "critical to delivering new homegrown green energy".
SIMEC's MeyGen 2 tidal stream project was among other green energy projects to secure a new contract, which 
will see the site expanded and guaranteed £172 per megawatt hour.

Britain's government hiked the maximum strike prices, which guarantee income for developers, offered in the latest 
auction.
This meant developers could be offered up to £73 per megawatt hour, against £44 previously, with both Orsted and 
SSE reporting theirs were lower but based on 2012 prices, meaning inflation since would have taken the contract 
values higher.

BILL payers are to spend as much as £150 per household on new wind turbines as Ed Miliband oversees a record 
expansion of green energy.
The money - a total of £3bn, which will ultimately come from consumers - is to fund the construction or expansion of 
nine offshore wind sites between 2027 and 2031, most of them owned by foreign energy companies, plus other 
green technologies such as onshore wind and solar.
Denmark's state-controlled energy company Orsted is among the biggest winners, along with ScottishPower, which 
is owned by Spanish utility Iberdrola. The money for wind turbines has been agreed as part of a government 
auction for renewable energy contracts known as the allocation round 6 (AR6). Under this system, the Government 
encourages companies to build low-carbon energy plants such as solar and wind farms by offering a minimum price 
for the electricity generated. The money for such subsidies is eventually added to bills. The UK's power grid 
operator, National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO), calculates "budget impact" of the subsidies for offshore 
wind and other renewables at £4bn from 2026 to 2031, in today's money.
The costs given exclude the additional expense of transmission lines and the expansion of the national grid to 
handle the extra power.
It means more than five gigawatts (GW) of new offshore wind power is now set for construction - a stark contrast to 
last year's botched auction round when there were no bids. The Tories offered subsidies so low - at £40 per 
megawatt hour (MWh) - that no off- shore wind developers came forward.

record expansion of renewables
Subsidies under Mr Miliband will be more than doubled to over £82 per MWh. Solar farms will get £70/MWh, with 
newer technologies such as floating wind handed £195/MWh and tidal stream projects given £239/MWh.
A total of 131 clean energy projects have won state subsidies in this year's auction, including 115 solar projects 
across England and onshore wind projects mainly in Scotland and Wales.
Many of the onshore projects are likely to prove highly controversial, with homeowners and environmentalists 
objecting to the industrialisation of landscapes with panels and turbines.
However, Mr Miliband hailed the auction results as a triumph. He said: "We inherited a broken energy policy. Today 
we have a record-setting round for enough renewable power for 11m homes, essential to give energy security to 
families across the country. It is another significant step forward in our mission for clean power by 2030."
Orsted is one of the biggest winners.
It has been allowed to shunt much of its Hornsea 3 project out of contracts signed under previous allocation rounds, 
where lower subsidies were offered, into this year's auction. A spokesman for Mr Miliband said the move had been 
permitted because otherwise Hornsea 3 - potentially the world's largest wind farm at 3GW - might never have been 
built.
Critics will argue that such contracts become meaningless if companies can simply move them from one auction 
round if a subsequent one offers better terms. Orsted was also awarded a 2.4GW CfD for Hornsea 4. Rasmus 
Errboe, of Orsted, said: "We look forward to delivering these landmark projects, which will supply renewable power 
at a large scale to UK consumers and businesses and help the UK Government achieve its target of quadrupling 
offshore wind capacity to 60GW by 2030."
ScottishPower has been offered contracts for another two large wind farms, East Anglia Two and East Anglia 
Three. As with Orsted, it was allowed to move its East Anglia Three project out of the contracts signed under a 
previous and less lucrative auction.
A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesman said it did not recognise the costs per household, but 
renewable energy remained essential to boost UK energy security.

 Opponents of offshore wind around the U.S. are pelting projects with lawsuits seeking to cancel them or tie them 
up for years in costly litigation.
The court cases represent another hurdle the nascent industry must overcome, particularly along the East Coast 
where opposition to offshore wind farms is vocal and well-organized. 
They add another pressure point for an industry already struggling with escalating prices, shaky supply chains, and 
a handful of highly publicized turbine failures that opponents are seizing on as proof that the structures are 
unreliable and unsafe, something the industry denies.
There are 13 cases pending in federal courts targeting offshore wind projects, according to the American Clean 
Power Association, an offshore wind trade group. An undetermined number of additional lawsuits are active in state 
courts, they said.
Robin Shaffer is president of Protect Our Coast NJ, a citizens group that has filed numerous lawsuits in New Jersey 
against two offshore projects currently or previously proposed. 
Shaffer said his group was at least partly responsible for scuttling two New Jersey wind farms proposed by Orsted 
that the Danish wind giant scrapped last October, saying they were no longer financially workable.
"An ancillary benefit of our legal strategy is to give pause or doubt in the minds of investors in the big corporations 
that are undertaking these projects," he said. "Last year, we saw Orsted leave its commitment to build Ocean Wind 
off the southern New Jersey coast amidst the uncertainty of two lawsuits we filed, as well as another filed by Cape 
May County."

Opponents cite altered views of the horizon from wind turbines and concerns about what the structures might do to 
marine life. They also cite rising projected prices for electricity generated from the wind farms, and point to recent 
turbine collapses off Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts and at Doggers Bank off the English coast as proof the 
technology is risky.
Supporters say offshore wind is necessary to combat climate change, which they call the principal threat to the 
ocean and its inhabitants.
"Offshore wind projects undergo rigorous environmental reviews and permitting processes, in addition to a lengthy 
public comment period," said Jason Ryan, a spokesman for the Clean Power Association. "The current slate of U.S. 
offshore wind projects under construction and development are among the most carefully planned and analyzed 
infrastructure projects in U.S. history; we are confident their permits will withstand legal scrutiny."
Paulina O'Connor, executive director of the New Jersey Offshore Wind Alliance, said offshore wind is needed to 
combat climate change.
"On the heels of one of the hottest summers on record, it is disappointing to see another frivolous lawsuit filed by 
those with opposing views," she said of the most recent lawsuit.
That action was filed Friday by Save LBI, another New Jersey citizen group. It claims that Atlantic Shores, the New 
Jersey project furthest along its state's approval path, would violate noise ordinances during pile driving and 
operation of hundreds of wind turbines. The group says it has several other lawsuits on the way. Atlantic Shores 
declined to comment.
Other litigation in New Jersey challenged Orsted's now-scrapped wind farm plan, a state tax break the company 
would have received, and even the placement of a power cable that would bring electricity from the project onshore. 
A group of Jersey Shore towns sued Atlantic Shores, and fishing and environmental groups sued two federal 
agencies overseeing offshore wind projects. They are appealing the dismissal of their suit after a judge ruled they 
had no legal standing to sue.
Offshore wind foes in other states are also turning to the courts.
In March, The National Legal and Policy Center, a conservative watchdog group in Virginia, sued Dominion Energy 
and the federal government hoping to block a wind farm off the coast of Virginia Beach. Dominion called the suit 
meritless and said it employs multiple layers of protection for the marine environment.
Last year, a Rhode Island nonprofit known for its seaside mansions sued the federal government challenging the 
permitting process for offshore wind energy projects off Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. The Preservation 
Society of Newport County said the presence of hundreds of wind turbines off the New England coast would ruin 
ocean views from several of its historic properties.
Also in Rhode Island, the anti-wind group Green Oceans sued the federal government in April, saying it illegally 
gave Orsted permits for its South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind projects. Orsted declined comment on the 
lawsuit but noted that South Fork is fully operational and Revolution recently installed its first turbine.
On the West Coast, the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians in Oregon, whose 
culture reveres the ocean, sued the federal government Tuesday over plans to hold an offshore wind energy 
auction next month.
And in March, fishermen sued California over plans for three floating wind farms.

Le géant pétrolier norvégien&#160; Equinor&#160;a annoncé lundi qu'il avait acheté une part de 9,8% dans le 
spécialiste danois des énergies renouvelables Orsted, devenant ainsi son deuxième plus gros actionnaire derrière 
l'État danois. Equinor n'a pas précisé le montant déboursé mais a indiqué que cette participation, acquise à la fois 
progressivement et par l'achat d'un bloc d'actions, représentait une valeur d'environ 2,5 milliards de dollars au 
cours de clôture de l'action Orsted vendredi.
«L'industrie de l'éolien en mer est actuellement confrontée à une série de défis, mais nous restons confiants quant 
aux perspectives à long terme du secteur et au rôle crucial que l'éolien en mer jouera dans la transition 
énergétique», a dit son directeur général, Anders Opedal. «Il s'agit d'un investissement contre-cyclique dans un 
développeur de premier plan et un portefeuille d'actifs éoliens offshore en exploitation de premier ordre», a-t-il 
ajouté, cité dans un communiqué.
Le secteur de l'éolien peine à être rentable à cause de coûts et de taux d'intérêt élevés, combinés à une baisse du 
prix de l'électricité. Au deuxième trimestre, Orsted a essuyé une perte de 1,7 milliard de couronnes (225 millions 
d'euros) à cause de retards et de l'abandon d'un projet. Le groupe qui dispose aujourd'hui d'une capacité de 10,4 
GW d'énergies renouvelables vise à porter sa capacité à entre 35 et 38 GW d'ici à 2030, rappelle Equinor.
Le norvégien compte de son côté maintenir sa production d'hydrocarbures en Norvège inchangée jusqu'en 2035 - 
environ 1,2 million de barils équivalent-pétrole par jour, soit plus de la moitié de sa production mondiale - tout en 
accroissant ses investissements dans le renouvelable. Des analystes ont dans le passé évoqué la possibilité d'un 
rapprochement entre Equinor et Orsted, détenus à respectivement 67 et 50,1% par les États norvégien et danois.

Die norwegische Equinor wird zweitgrößter Aktionär der dänischen Orsted. Der Zeitpunkt des Aktienkaufs ist gut 
gewählt. Ändern soll sich sonst nichts, versichert die ehemalige Statoil.
Der weitgehend staatliche norwegische Öl- und Gaskonzern Equinor ist mit 9,8 Prozent der stimmberechtigten 
Aktien beim dänischen Erneuerbaren-Konzern Orsted eingestiegen und rückt damit zum zweitgrößten Aktionär 
nach dem dänischen Staat auf, der die Mehrheit behält. Equinor, vormals Statoil, teilte die angeblich freundliche 
und langfristig angelegte Übernahme des Aktienpakets am 7. Oktober der Presse mit, Orsted bestätigte sie in einer 
dürren Pflichtmitteilung für die Börse. Der Kaufpreis der Aktien wurde mit etwa 2,5 Milliarden Dollar (2,3 Milliarden 
Euro) angegeben.
Ziel ist laut Equinor, auf die eigene Dekarbonisierungsstrategie einzuzahlen, indem das weltgrößte Portfolio 
produzierender Offshore-Windparks von Orsted auf die ehrgeizige Entwicklungspipeline von Equinor trifft. Die auch 
in Deutschland prominent vertretene Orsted will ihr Erneuerbaren-Erzeugungsportfolio bis 2030 von 10.400 MW 
auf 35.000 MW bis 38.000 MW mehr als verdreifachen. Beide Staatskonzerne haben Dekarbonisierungspfade, bei 
Orsted gibt es sogar ein Ziel, das die Zulieferer einbezieht.
Anders Opedal, Chef der Equinor, bezeichnete den Erwerb auch als „antizyklisch“ und spielte damit darauf an, dass 
die Offshore-Windbranche „derzeit Herausforderungen gegenübersteht“. Der Kaufzeitpunkt scheint gut gewählt zu 
sein, hat der Orsted-Aktienkurs doch seit Mitte 2023 den Bereich 80 bis 120 Euro weit nach unten verlassen und 
tastet sich gerade erst wieder an die 60 Euro heran, auch getrieben durch die Nachricht von der Transaktion.
Orsted war 2023 durch Abschreibungen auf abgesagte Gigawatt-Windparkprojekte in den USA in Milliardenhöhe in 
die roten Zahlen geraten. Das hatte die damaligen Chefs ihre Positionen gekostet, hunderte Stellen werden 
gestrichen, und der dänische Konzern dimmte auch seine Erneuerbarenziele von ursprünglich 50.000 MW herunter 
(wir berichteten mehrfach).

- Ørsted has been allowed to shift parts of its Hornsea 3 offshore wind project into a more recent and more lucrative government auction round, raising concerns about the fairness of the UK’s renewable energy subsidy system. Critics argue that such contract adjustments undermine the credibility of the auction process, as companies can move projects to rounds with higher subsidies, potentially inflating costs for consumers. This move has sparked debate over whether the government’s renewable energy policies are being manipulated to benefit large energy firms at the expense of billpayers. [The Telegraph, Jonathan Leake, September 03, 2024]

- Ørsted is facing multiple lawsuits in the U.S. that seek to delay or cancel offshore wind projects, adding to the company’s financial and operational challenges. Opponents, including citizen groups and environmental organizations, argue that the projects could harm marine life, disrupt coastal views, and lead to higher electricity prices. Legal battles have already contributed to the cancellation of Ørsted’s Ocean Wind projects in New Jersey, with opponents claiming their lawsuits created uncertainty that deterred investors. These legal challenges add another layer of risk to Ørsted’s U.S. expansion strategy and could further delay the development of offshore wind infrastructure. [The Independent, Wayne Parry, September 18, 2024]

- Ørsted’s financial struggles have made it an acquisition target, with Norwegian oil and gas giant Equinor purchasing a 9.8% stake in the company for approximately $2.5 billion. This investment comes at a time when Ørsted’s stock price has significantly declined due to project cancellations, rising costs, and financial impairments. While Equinor frames the acquisition as a strategic move to expand its renewable energy portfolio, the purchase highlights Ørsted’s weakened financial position and vulnerability to external takeovers. The deal also raises concerns about the increasing influence of fossil fuel companies in the renewable energy sector. [Lefigaro, Anonymous, October 07, 2024]

- Ørsted has suffered significant financial losses due to project cancellations and impairments, with the company reporting a loss of 1.7 billion Danish kroner (€225 million) in the second quarter of 2024. These losses stem from delays and the abandonment of key offshore wind projects, further exacerbating the company’s financial instability. The company’s ambitious goal of expanding its renewable energy capacity to between 35 and 38 GW by 2030 is now under pressure, as financial constraints force it to scale back investments. This financial downturn raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to maintain its leadership in the offshore wind sector. [Energie & Management, Georg Eble, October 07, 2024]
