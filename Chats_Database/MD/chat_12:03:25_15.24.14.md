You are tasked with extracting stakeholder information and direct quotes from a given news article related to Cisco. Your output should be in the form of a markdown table without column titles or any additional information. Each table row should contain:
1. The name of a real person who has expressed a quote in the provided article
2. His role or relation with regards to Cisco.
3. Their original quote about Cisco exactly as it appears in the article, without any modifications or translations

Guidelines:
- Include only real people: Exclude organizations, companies, or any other non-person entities
- Direct connection: Ensure that each selected individual is explicitly connected to Cisco or explicitly express his opinion on Cisco.
- Only include those whose statements are directly about Cisco
- Exclude individuals whose comments are not directly relevant to Cisco or are too general
- Pertinent stakeholders only: Only include the most relevant individuals
- Do not include stakeholders who are not directly associated with Cisco

Output Format Requirements:
- Each line must contain exactly two columns separated by "|" symbols
- Column 1: Stakeholder's name
- Column 2: Stakeholder's role or link to Cisco. If not described in the article, try to interpret its role. If it is not straightforward to interpret, mention "Not mentioned".
- Column 3: Original quote in its original language

Example of correct formatting:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision de Cisco est très importante." |
| John Smith | Cisco's CEO |"We need to review Cisco's proposal carefully." |
| Hans Weber | Financial analyst | "Die Strategie von Cisco ist überzeugend." |

If no relevant individuals with quotes are found, return "None."
