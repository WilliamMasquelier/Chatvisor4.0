Saul Kavonic's overall position towards Shell appears cautiously optimistic, as he acknowledges the potential for significant gas expansion if horizontal wells prove successful, suggesting a generally positive but conditional stance; his views seem consistent with an analytical approach that weighs technical feasibility against potential benefits; his opinion, given his role at Credit Suisse, could influence investor confidence and industry perception of Shell's gas projects; notably, his sentiment leans positive, emphasizing opportunity and growth contingent on technological success.
