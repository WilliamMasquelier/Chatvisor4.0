You are tasked with analyzing the following list of stakeholders and returning only the lines that represent real people. Disregard any lines that mention entities or organizations. Remove all rows which are table dividers using "-".

Input:
| Mads Nipper | Former CEO of Orsted | "Ik blijf gepassioneerd over het idee de wereld volledig te laten draaien op duurzame energie." | "I remain passionate about the idea of having the world run entirely on sustainable energy." |
| Rasmus Errboe | CFO of Orsted | "De raad van bestuur is vandaag met Mads overeengekomen dat dit het juiste moment is voor hem om af te treden." | "The board of directors has agreed with Mads today that this is the right time for him to step down." |

Guidelines:
1. Only include lines that represent real people or individuals. Only return lines that mention a specific person's name in the first column.
2. Exclude any lines that mention companies, organizations or entities.
3. If a line is ambiguous, err on the side of exclusion.
4. Exclude mentions of John Doe or Jane Smith. Exclude the author of the article or other people which are not directly related to Orsted.
5. Maintain the original format of each line (markdown table row). Keep the whole line, including the stakeholder description. Each line must be a valid markdown table row with 4 columns, strictly.
6. If no lines represent real people, return "None".
7. Filter out too general or irrelevant stakeholders. Only include stakeholders that express direct opinions on Orsted or are directly involved with the company.
8. Remove all rows which are only containing the "-" symbol as your output should only be the rows that represent real people.
9. Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Please provide the filtered list of stakeholders below:
