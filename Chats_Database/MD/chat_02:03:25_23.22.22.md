Charlotte de Lorgeril's statement emphasizes the importance of securing long-term, low-carbon electricity contracts at competitive prices, which suggests a neutral to slightly critical stance towards companies like Ørsted if they cannot meet these criteria. Her perspective highlights a consistent focus on cost competitiveness in the French e-fuels sector, and if Ørsted is perceived as unable to provide affordable renewable energy, this could negatively impact its reputation and attractiveness in the French market.
