Joël Meggelaars, as Head of Public Affairs for Ørsted Benelux, appears to have a pragmatic and somewhat critical stance towards the company's current market conditions, emphasizing challenges in securing acceptable off-take agreements. His statements suggest a shift from an experimental phase to a more mature stage, yet frustration with market unwillingness to meet Ørsted’s pricing expectations indicates a growing concern. This sentiment, which leans negative, could impact Ørsted’s reputation by highlighting difficulties in commercial viability, potentially influencing investor confidence and stakeholder negotiations.
