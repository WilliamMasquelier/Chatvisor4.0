Shell said its fourth-quarter earnings took a hit of between $US2.5bn and $US4.5bn ($7.7bn) in impairments, offset 
by significantly higher gas trading, while its overall production volumes are on track to meet targets.
The London-based energy giant said the impairments were primarily driven by macro developments as well as 
portfolio choices, including its Singapore chemicals and products assets, which it has been trying to sell.
The FTSE 100 leader by market capitalisation also said it expected cash flow from operations to take a hit from a 
$US900m charge related to timing of payments of emissions.
Shell expects to report integrated gas production between 880,000 and 920,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day for the 
fourth quarter, which would be in line with its guided range of 870,000-930,000 BOE a day, and compares with 
third-quarter production of 900,000 BOE a day.
Fourth-quarter volumes of liquefied natural gas are expected to be between 6.9 million and 7.3 million tonnes 
compared with 6.9 million tonnes in the preceding quarter. Shell previously expected LNG volumes of 6.7 million-
7.3 million tonnes.
Gains from integrated gas trading are expected to be significantly higher quarter-on-quarter, while the trading result 
from chemicals and crude oil refineries is seen to be significantly lower. The former segment was expected to make 
an adjusted earnings loss, the company said.
However, the expected uptick in fourth-quarter gas trading comes despite declining oil and gas prices throughout 
the period, with oil hitting a five-month low in early December, reflecting supply and demand concerns despite 
support from geopolitical uncertainty.
Upstream production - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - is expected to meet the guided range of 1.75 
million to 1.95 million BOE a day at 1.83 million to 1.93 million a day. It reported 1.75 million BOE a day in the third 
quarter.

Elsewhere, Saudi Aramco said it would cut crude prices to all regions, including its largest market in Asia - a move 
that comes amid weaker global oil prices and increased production by producers outside the Organisation of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
After a summer rally attributed in large part to Saudi Arabia's decision to implement a production cut of one million 
barrels a day on top of existing cuts by other members of OPEC and its allies, including Russia, crude fell sharply in 
the fourth quarter. Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ have extended cuts into 2023.
West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, fell more than 21 per cent in the fourth quarter of the calendar 
year to post a 2023 decline of 10.7 per cent. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell around 19 per cent in the fourth 
quarter to lose 10.3 per cent in 2023. Dow Jones newswires

British oil major Shell has suspended all shipments through the Red Sea indefinitely after US and UK strikes on 
Yemen's Houthi rebels triggered fears of further escalation, according to sources.
The West's targeting of the Iranian-ally militia came after the Houthis launched dozens of missiles and drones at 
commercial vessels around the Red Sea and the nearby Bab el-Mandeb. The militia has said the attacks are in 
response to the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip.
About 12 per cent of total global seaborne oil trade goes through the Red Sea. Last month, a tanker chartered by 
Shell to move Indian jet fuel was targeted by a drone in the Red Sea and harassed by Houthi boats, according to 
shipping officials.
Shell declined to comment on the suspension of transit and the attack. But the company last week halted all 
crossings over concerns that a successful -attack could trigger a massive spill in the region, as well as present risks 
to the safety of crews on the ships, sources said.
Shell joins other global shippers in deciding to avoid the Red Sea, including other energy companies.
BP last month said it would pause all shipments through the key shipping lane, and Qatar Energy did the same this 
week.
Qatar, which has acted as a mediator for the Houthis in the past, halted the use of the Red Sea route for its 
liquefied natural gas exports for fear of being caught in the conflict, according to a Qatari energy official and 
shipping trackers.
Recent Houthi attacks, initially directed against Israeli-linked vessels, have rattled global markets, upended 
international shipping routes and become more indiscriminate. The rebels have attacked vessels from 
containerships to tankers moving sanctioned Russian oil, as the global shipping nexus complicates their ability to 
identify specific targets.

They have vowed to continue their campaign against US and international targets in the region in response to 
Israel's actions in Gaza. "Anyone attempting to hinder us from doing so will fail," a Houthi official said on Monday. 
After the US-led strike, several captains of chartered vessels heading for Europe via the Suez Canal have refused 
to enter the Red Sea, forcing them to sail through a lengthy route around southern Africa. The Singapore ship 
registry and Intertanko, an industry lobby group, said the waterway should be avoided.

Highlight: The oil super majors are eyeing shifting their primary stock exchange listings to New York as a stronger 
push to reduce fossil fuels in their home markets weighs on their share prices.
Body
There's a yawning gap between the valuations of US oil and gas majors and their UK and European counterparts. 
That's prompted a debate over whether the more lowly rated energy giants should switch their primary stock 
exchange listing to New York.
The discussion was given a sharper edge late last month when the chief executive of France's Total Energies, 
Patrick Pouyann√©, said the century-old super major, founded by the French government, was seriously considering 
a shift of its listing, albeit not its headquarters.
Shell, which shifted its headquarters from The Hague and unwound its dual listing to base itself and its shares in 
London in 2022, is known to have also seriously pondered a shift in its primary listing three years ago.
BP has said a move is not on its agenda but would inevitably have done some analysis on it. There's also been 
speculation that its relatively low sharemarket valuation could make it a target for one of the more highly rated oil 
giants, which could effectively produce a transfer of its listing.
The driver of the discussion is a significant disparity in the sharemarket valuations of European and UK energy 
companies relative to their US counterparts like Exxon and Chevron, which trade on cashflow multiples up to 50 per 
cent higher than their transatlantic rivals.
Not only does that make their shareholders happier, but it lowers the US majors' cost of equity, enables them to 
invest more productively and makes acquisitions more attractive. Exxon bought Pioneer Natural Resources for 
$US60 billion ($91 billion) last year, while Chevron announced an agreed all-share $US53 billion for Hess Corp.
The smaller strand in the explanation for the varying valuations relates to the markets themselves.
The New York stock market is much bigger and deeper than London and the fragmented European exchanges and 
is supported by a far larger pool of institutional and retail investors. Historically, that has produced higher valuations 
relative to European peer companies.
With the US being the world's largest producer and exporter of oil and gas, there is also stronger interest in the 
sector there and better support from US and international investors.

It's not easy being green for UK and European oil giants
While the market dynamics have seen some UK and European companies, particularly (but not exclusively) tech 
and biotech companies, shift their listings to the US, they are not the primary reason energy companies have 
considered the move.
Nor is the post-Brexit decline in the status of London's market a major factor, although what was once the global 
hub for resources investment has been fading as some of its larger listings, like BHP's UK listing, have disappeared 
or - as will happen if BHP succeeds with its Anglo-American bid -- London-listed miners have been acquired.
The US companies are pursuing growth strategies. Their trans-Atlantic competitors aren't.
The more material influence on the oil majors' valuations than the nature of their domestic markets is the extent to 
which policymakers and investors in the UK and Europe have responded to climate change and the way that has, 
and is, shaping the growth strategies of companies like TotalEnergies, Shell and BP.
Exxon and Chevron are aggressively growing their oil and gas production volumes and investing in increasing their 
output even as, across the Atlantic, TotalEnergies, Shell and BP are pursuing carbon emissions reduction-related 
strategies that will eventually see their volumes decline.
The US companies are pursuing growth strategies. Their transatlantic competitors aren't.
Shell and BP have received significant criticism recently for slowing the rate at which their fossil fuel volumes are 
scheduled to fall.
BP, for instance, had a 2020 plan to cut its oil and gas production by 40 per cent by 2030 from 2019. Last year, the 
target was shifted to 25 per cent by 2030, with the 35 to 40 per cent target for its own carbon emissions revised to 
between 20 and 30 per cent.
Shell, which had said it would reduce its output by 1 or 2 per cent a year through to the end of the decade, last year 
restated its plan.
It now expects flat volumes through to 2030 and, where it had planned to reduce investment in oil and gas and 
increase its spending on low-carbon products, it will now invest $US40 billion in oil and gas by 2035, against the 
$US10 to $US15 billion it will spend in those low-carbon products.
The backlash against BP and Shell was strong because European and UK fund managers, retail investors and their 
governments are far more committed to environmental, social and governance policies than most US fund 
managers and other investors.
In the US, where President Joe Biden has presided over a massive increase in US oil and gas production and 
Donald Trump is promising to "drill, baby, drill" if he regains the presidency, there has recently been something of a 
backlash against ESG investment policies.
The stronger emissions reduction frameworks in Europe and the UK (and successful legal actions by environmental 
activists) have forced their oil and gas companies to pursue strategies that have resulted in them constraining their 
oil and gas investment and production while building a presence in greener technologies and fuels.
From the companies' perspective - and that of prospective investors less concerned about fossil fuels - the pressure 
to reduce their oil and gas production and invest in renewables and hydrogen will deliver lower returns than the 
more aggressively pro-fossil fuel strategies pursued by Exxon and Chevron.
When BP unveiled its new timetable for responding to climate change, it said that it generated returns on 
investment of 15 to 20 per cent from its fossil fuel projects. The returns from bioenergy were about 15 per cent, but 
they were only 6 to 8 per cent from renewables like solar and wind. It's not surprising that it decided to invest more 
in oil and gas and biofuels than in renewables.Page 3 of 3
It's not easy being green for UK and European oil giants
There's a relatively recent view among the majors, one that arguably was held earlier and more strongly by the US 
companies, that the transition to cleaner energy is going to take longer and, if it is to be relatively smooth, will 
require more investment in fossil fuels to maintain energy supply than was once projected.
That view doesn't sit well with ESG-sensitive European or British investors. At the same time, the significant and 
still-growing presence of lower-returning assets in their portfolios and the absence of the production growth 
strategies of Exxon and Chevron deter those investors less fussed about investing in fossil fuels.
TotalEnergies, which has far more US investors than Europeans and whose biggest exposure to oil and gas is in 
the US, has less of a discount relative to Exxon and Chevron than the UK companies. But it believes that, if it were 
valued in line with them, there would be a very substantial uplift.
But as a French national champion, TotalEnergies would face significant obstacles to moving its listing - as might 
Shell and BP - from governments determined to retain their flagship companies, retain their corporate offices and 
maintain the size and relevance of their equity markets.

# Title: Shell sues ATO over disputed $99m tax bill

Body
The biggest company traded on the London Stock Exchange, Shell, is pushing an Australian court to clear it of $99 
million in allegedly unpaid taxes that stem from its $3.5 billion exit from the former Woodside Petroleum.
The 2017 share sale ended Shell's more than 30-year investment in Woodside, completing a near decade-long 
effort to reduce its 35 per cent shareholding to nil. The sale of its final 13.3 per cent stake netted Shell about $3.5 
billion, but the commissioner of taxation ruled in February it had understated its profits from the sell-down.
Federal Court filings obtained by The Australian Financial Review show the Tax Office believes the company 
should have declared a capital gain $193.9 million higher than first flagged in the 2017 sale. It also took aim at a 
2014 share sale where it found the gain was $135.7 million higher than declared.
Shell has appealed the ruling, with a spokeswoman saying Shell "complies with all its legal and taxation obligations 
and is committed to paying the right amount of tax in all countries in which we operate".
"Shell has a co-operative relationship with the ATO, where we discuss business activity and taxation matters on a 
proactive, transparent basis," she said. "It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time."
The nearly $330 million in additional capital gains would, at the company tax rate of 30 per cent, mean Shell owes 
at face value $99 million to the Tax Office for the disputed years.
The major oil and gas producers are "now among the largest taxpayers in Australia", the ATO said last November.
"Payments from this sector have grown markedly in the 2022-23 income tax year to in excess of $11 billion," the 
ATO said at the time. Receipts from the energy sector made up more than two-thirds of the $6.4 billion paid by 
multinational companies in the period.
An ATO spokeswoman said: "The ATO cannot comment on any current matter before the Federal Court," in 
response to Shell's appeal.

The Financial Review understands that Shell thinks its shares in Woodside should be treated at the lower amount 
due to transitional changes to the capital gains regime that were introduced in 1997 following the acquisition of its 
stake in 1985. The matter is set for a case management hearing on July 29.
Shell is one of the world's largest oil and gas producers, and is involved in seven major domestic projects, including 
the Gorgon natural gas project off the coast of Western Australia.
The Australian outpost posted a profit of $US632.7 million ($947 million) in the 2023 calendar year, filings to the 
corporate regulator show, less than a third of the $US2.7 billion reported only a year prior.
The accounts also show Shell Australia paid $US37 million in tax last year.

Highlight: Shell's head of strategy says the chances of meeting the global carbon emissions targets depend on 
two crucial factors.
Body
To meet global carbon emissions goals, domestic and geopolitical policies have to align to create a pathway to net-
zero emissions by 2050. In the world in which we currently live, that looks unlikely.
Global emissions targets are already being missed, the mix of geopolitical tensions and domestic policies is muffling 
the impact that China's dominant clean energy technologies could have, and in the wake of the pandemic and 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, energy security has been prioritised over emissions, particularly in Europe.
It's not all doom and gloom though.
