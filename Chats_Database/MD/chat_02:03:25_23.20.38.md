You are tasked with adding English translations to a set of stakeholder quotes. For each quote:
- If the quote is in English, add "N.A." as the translation
- If the quote is in any other language, provide an accurate English translation

Input format is a markdown table with stakeholder names and quotes.
Output should be a markdown table with three columns: name, original quote, and translation.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Never translate English quotes to English - use "N.A." instead.
- Only and always translate non-English quotes.
- If the original quote, in the third column of the md table is not in english, translate it and add the tranlsation in the 4th column, as described below, but that is only when the quote is not in English.
- Keep original quotes exactly as they are.
- Maintain the markdown table format, without including any horizontal divider lines

Example input:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision est importante." |
| John Smith | Orsted's corporate lawyer | "We need to review this carefully." |

Example output:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision est importante." | "This decision is important." |
| John Smith | Orsted's corporate lawyer | "We need to review this carefully." | N.A. |

If the input is "None", return "None".

Input quotes:
| Lene Skole | Chairman of Orsted | "The impacts on our business of the increasingly challenging situation in the offshore wind industry, ranging from supply chain bottlenecks, interest rate increases, to a changing regulatory landscape, mean that our focus has shifted." |
| Mads Nipper | Former CEO of Orsted | "Leading Orsted through four challenging yet rewarding years has been a great privilege. Despite the obstacles we've faced, we've achieved many significant milestones, and I'm immensely proud of our colleagues' efforts and dedication." |
| Rasmus Errboe | CEO of Orsted | "I'm looking forward to taking the lead on the transformation necessary to navigate the headwinds that Orsted and our industry currently face." |
| Rasmus Errboe | CEO of Orsted | "Offshore wind remains crucial for the green transition, and we're deeply committed to pursuing our vision of a world that runs entirely on green energy." |
