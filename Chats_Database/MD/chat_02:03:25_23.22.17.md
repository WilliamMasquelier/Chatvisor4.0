Benoit Decourt's statement suggests a neutral to slightly positive stance towards Ørsted, as he frames the company's announcement as a natural development within the market rather than an alarming or unexpected event. His perspective, which appears consistent with a pragmatic industry outlook, may help mitigate negative perceptions by reinforcing the idea that such strategic shifts are a normal part of market dynamics, potentially stabilizing Ørsted's reputation among industry stakeholders.
