Beiling's buy-local policy has hit US tech giants hard For American tech companies in China, the writing is on the 
wall. It's also on paper, in Document 79.
The 2022 Chinese government directive expands a drive that is muscling US technology out of the country - an 
effort some refer to as "Delete A", for Delete America.
Document 79 was so sensitive that high-ranking officials and executives were only shown the order and weren't 
allowed to make copies, sources say. It requires state-owned companies in finance, energy and other sectors to 
replace foreign software in their IT systems by 2027.
American tech giants had long thrived in China as they hot-wired the country's meteoric industrial rise with 
computers, operating systems and software. Chinese leaders want to sever that relationship, driven by a push for 
self-sufficiency and concerns over the country's long-term security.
The first targets were hardware makers. Dell, IBM and Cisco Systems have gradually seen much of their 
equipment replaced by products from Chinese competitors.
Document 79, named for the numbering on the paper, targets companies that provide the software enabling daily 
business operations from basic office tools to supply chain management. The likes of Microsoft and Oracle are 
losing ground in the field, one of the last bastions of foreign tech profitability in the country.
The effort is just one salvo in a year-long push by Chinese leader Xi Jinping for self-sufficiency in everything from 
critical technology such as semiconductors and fighter jets to the production of grain and oilseeds. The broader 
strategy is to make China less dependent on the West for food, raw materials and energy, and instead focus on 
domestic supply chains.
Officials in Beijing issued Document 79 in September 2022, as the US was ratcheting up chip export restrictions 
and sanctions on Chinese tech companies. It requires state-owned firms to provide quarterly updates on their 
Page 2 of 4

progress in replacing foreign software used for email, human resources and business manage-ment with Chinese 
alternatives.
The directive came down from the agency overseeing the country's massive state-owned enterprise sector - a 
group that includes more than 60 of China's 100 largest listed companies.
That agency, the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, and the country's national 
cabinet, the State Council, didn't respond to requests for comment.
Spending by China's state sector topped 48 trillion yuan ($10 trillion) in 2022. The directive leverages that 
purchasing power to support Chinese tech companies, which in turn can improve their products and narrow the 
technology gap with US rivals.
State firms have ramped up their buying of domestic brands, even if the Chinese substitutes sometimes aren't as 
good. The buyers include banks, financial brokerages and public services such as the postal system.
Back in 2006, "China was the land of milk and honey, and intellectual property was the main challenge", says a 
former US Trade Representative official involved in previous technology discussions with the Chinese. "Now, there 
is a feeling that the sense of opportunity is off. Companies are merely hanging on." The push to localise tech is 
known as Xinchuang, loosely translated as "IT innovation" with a reference to technology that is secure and 
trustworthy. The policy has gained urgency amid an escalating tech and trade war with Washington, which has cut 
many Chinese entities off from American technologies.
Premier Li Qiang reiterated the push during China's annual legislative sessions this week. China's central 
government plans to increase its spending on science and technology by 10 per cent to about $US51bn ($77bn) 
this year, according to a budget report released on Tuesday - up from a 2 per cent increase last year.
At some trade fairs across the country, vendors tout homegrown tech as an alternative to foreign brands. One 
semiconductor equipment maker stall in Nanjing put it bluntly, offering to help buyers "Delete A" from their supply 
chain.
Domestic alternatives are growing more user-friendly. A local official recalled how in 2016, it took a whole day to 
open and close a spreadsheet on a computer with an operating system known as KylinOS, developed by a Chinese 
military-linked company. He compares the usability of the latest KylinOS version to Microsoft's Windows 7, 
introduced in 2009 - workable if not great.
As recently as six years ago, most government tenders sought hardware, chips and software from Western brands. 
By 2023, many were seeking Chinese tech products instead. When the customs department in the eastern Chinese 
city of Ningbo sought to purchase rack servers in 2018, it stated a preference for brands such as Dell and Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise, and for hardware powered by Intel's Xeon central processing units. Five years later, the same 
agency asked for rack servers made by Chinese companies and equipped with Huawei chips.
These servers are typically assembled by state-owned tech manufacturers that barely sell equipment overseas, 
such as Beijing-based Tsinghua Tongfang. Tongfang's controlling shareholder is a state-owned company in charge 
of China's civilian and military nuclear programs.
Some government officials in China's capital had their foreign-branded PCs replaced with those made by Tongfang 
and officials last year were told to use Chinese phones instead of Apple's iPhones for work.
Over the past decade, Xi has repeatedly emphasised technological innovation and the use of trusted homegrown 
technology in government departments and industry. Revelations by former National Security Agency contractor 
Edward Snowden in 2013 that US authorities had hacked into Chinese mobile phone communications, universities 
and private companies strengthened Xi's resolve. More recently, he has told senior officials that China should 
leverage its strengths and market to break bottlenecks in the development of essential software such as operating 
systems.Page 3 of 4
Chinese push to delete US technology
As China focused on replacing hardware, IBM's China revenues have steadily declined. It downsized its China 
research operations in Beijing in 2021, more than two decades after it opened.
Cisco, once a technology powerhouse in China, said in 2019 that it was losing orders in the country to local 
vendors. PC maker Dell's market share in China has almost halved in the past five years, to 8 per cent. Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise, which makes servers, storage and networks, got 14.1 per cent of its revenue from China in 
2018, according to estimates from FactSet. By 2023, that had fallen to 4 per cent.
In May, HPE said it would sell its 49 per cent stake in its Chinese joint venture. The company continues to sell direct 
to multinational customers in China and sells selected products to the broader mainland market through its Chinese 
partner.
In software, Adobe, Citrix parent Cloud Software Group and Salesforce have pulled out or downsized direct 
operations in the country over the past two years.
Microsoft, the world's biggest software provider, historically dominated computer operating systems in China. A 
Morgan Stanley poll of 135 chief information officers in China found that many expected the share of computers 
powered by Microsoft's Windows operating system installed in their companies to fall over the next three years. 
They expected Linux-based UOS, or Unity Operating System, an effort co-led by a state-owned company, to gain in 
the shift. Even as Microsoft's top executives and co-founder Bill Gates have frequently travelled to Beijing for high-
profile meetings with Chinese leaders on subjects like co-operation on AI and US-China trade relations in recent 
years, the company has decreased its offerings in China. Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a subcommittee 
hearing last September that China made up just 1.5 per cent of its overall sales. The company posted sales of 
$US212bn in the last fiscal year.
Some state-owned companies are dragging their feet on orders to replace foreign IT products that are essential to 
their core businesses over concerns about the stability and performance of domestic alternatives.
But in addition to becoming more advanced, China's own technology is also plugged into the local ecosystem. 
Providers of domestic business software allow interoperability with WeChat, a ubiquitous chat messaging app 
widely used in place of email among Chinese businesses.
The buy-local policy is trickling down to privately run companies, which are showing greater inclination to buy 
domestic software, according to Morgan Stanley's CIO survey.
A shift towards hosting and managing data on cloud servers instead of servers on the premises has also allowed 
Chinese companies to narrow the gap. Oracle, IBM and Microsoft dominated the database software market in 
China in 2010. Since then, Chinese companies including Alibaba and Huawei have come up with their own 
database management products to replace American technology.
China-based vendors took more than half of that market in China - worth $US6.3bn overall - for the first time in 
2022, and continue to grow, according to researcher Gartner. Tenders examined by the Journal show more state-
linked entities and companies have opted for Huawei's databases in recent years.
China's banks, brokerage firms and insurers had sped up procurement of homegrown databases, Yang Bing, chief 
executive of Chinese database company OceanBase, said at a Beijing conference in November. OceanBase, 
developed by Alibaba and its fintech affiliate Ant Group, replaced Oracle databases at Alibaba and Ant in 2016.
Western companies are being replaced not just by Chinese national champions such as Huawei but also more 
specialised companies. Yonyou Network Technology, a Shanghai-listed firm with a market value of $US6bn, 
provides systems to manage human resources, inventory and finances. Yonyou has been gaining users at the 
expense of Oracle and SAP, which together used to dominate more than half the market.

Highlight: Set-and-forget investing can get good results over long periods, but you'll need to overcome the 
temptation to trade.
Body
Shani Jayamanne is a self-confessed "lazy investor". It's an unusual admission for someone whose day job is 
director and investment specialist at financial services firm Morningstar, but Jayamanne says she "doesn't 
particularly enjoy the art of investing".
"I don't enjoy poring through company reports on a Friday night," she says.
Jayamanne learnt early in her investing journey that stock picking wasn't for her - owning shares directly in 
individual companies made her "incredibly nervous".
"I tend to try to seek out as much information as I can, confirming that I've made the right decision all the time, and 
that's quite exhausting," she says.
Instead, she has adopted a no-hassles, "lazy" approach to her portfolio, investing in managed equity funds and 
exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Lazy investors lean into diversification, low-cost products and a long investment horizon.
Ashley Owen, who runs a consulting business called Owen Analytics and writes a weekly newsletter about 
investing, says the biggest barriers to lazy investing are an inability to tune out noise and ignore emotions, and 
avoiding the temptation to chase returns, all of which can be costly.
"Human nature is the killer of buy and hold," he says. "You literally have to learn to control yourself to ignore 
frenzied booms and the frenzied busts, and that's very hard to do. Controlling your emotions is the hardest part of 
investing."
Vanguard founder John Bogle and legendary investor Warren Buffett both advise that individual investors can get 
by with a simple portfolio consisting of just two index funds - one covering US shares and one covering US bonds.
But a lazy Australian investor might have 70 per cent invested in growth assets like Australian and global shares, 
with the global shares usually 50 per cent hedged, Owen says.
Page 2 of 4
How to become a lazy investor (and yes, it's a good thing)
The remaining 30 per cent could be in defensive assets such as Australian and global fixed rate investment grade 
government or corporate bonds, with the global component fully hedged.
Owen's own long-term investment portfolio features 10 ETFs, none of which are invested in long-duration bonds, 
which Owen believes won't deliver the same returns over the next 20 years as they have over the past 30 years.
He adds that if someone is establishing a set-and-forget portfolio today, they should also be aware that they're 
"going to be buying shares at a very expensive point in the cycle", with future returns to be lower than average.
ETFs and managed funds
Jayamanne isn't invested in bonds, either. Her portfolio consists of four managed funds and three ETFs tracking 
broad market indexes across Australian and international equities.
Owen says someone with a standard growth portfolio mix - 70 per cent invested in Australian and global shares and 
30 per cent in bonds - achieved a return of about 11 per cent after fees in the 2023-24 financial year. This is the 
asset mix most large superannuation funds use as their "default" option.
"Even after inflation of 4 per cent, a lazy return of 11 per cent is still a very healthy 7 per cent real return for the 
year," he says. "I say 'lazy' because any passive investor would have achieved these returns without trying to chase 
hot stocks or funds or themes or fads, or fiddle with opaque alternatives, or whacky 'new' asset classes, or listened 
to perennial doomsayers prattling on about recessions or political crises or world wars."
Investors using a buy-and-hold strategy need to accept that there will inevitably be periods of outperformance and 
underperformance, Jayamanne says.
But on average, you will perform better compared to someone who tries to time the market by switching in and out 
of investments, she says.
Besides incurring the transaction costs associated with buying and selling, market data for the past 30 years shows 
that if you missed the S&P 500's 10 best days, your returns will be cut in half, Jayamanne says.
"And if you missed the best 30 days ... your return would be 83 per cent lower," she says.
Jayamanne takes the emotion out of her investment decisions by adhering to an investment policy statement, a 
document that outlines exactly what she's investing for and how her investments connect to her financial goals.
"Those sorts of guidelines allow you to sit back and think about why you're making a decision, whether it's 
emotionally driven, whether you're feeling like you're missing out on something, or you're doing it in line with your 
portfolio, your financial goals, and what will benefit you over the long term."
Jayamanne's investment policy statement also includes parameters for when she will buy and sell investments.
Buying at the right price
These are the two most critical time points for lazy investors, Owen says. In particular, buying investments at the 
right price is key, as buying when investments are overvalued can destroy returns from a set and forget portfolio for 
decades, he says.

"You make your money when you buy. You've got to be aware of when things are expensive and you've got to be 
aware of when things are cheap."
Eric Marais, an investment specialist at Orbis Investment Management, agrees that little matters more than the buy-
in price.Page 3 of 4
How to become a lazy investor (and yes, it's a good thing)
Orbis invests based on an active management philosophy of seeking out undervalued companies, and Marais 
points to investors who bought into successful tech companies like Cisco Systems and Microsoft before the dotcom 
crash of the early 2000s, as an example of those who got the buy-in price wrong.
"Cisco is a business that has actually been extremely successful. It's continued to grow its revenue and its profits, 
but it has yet to recoup its peak price 25 years later." In the case of Microsoft, Marais says recovering to its pre-
dotcom share price took 16 years.
For lazy investors who don't want to follow the markets closely enough to time their entry, the solution is dollar cost 
averaging, which is the approach Jayamanne uses. Dollar cost averaging is the process of investing the same sum 
at regular intervals, regardless of market movements.
"You're just putting $100 in every week, and you buy all the way through the booms and busts and that works quite 
well," Owen says.
When to review
Despite her hands-off approach, Jayamanne does monitor her portfolio.
"You always have to monitor and maintain your portfolio because markets will always change, economic conditions 
will change," she says. "There's no set-and-forget portfolio that you can just leave and let it run and be confident 
that it's still aligned with your goals over the long term."
Jayamanne reviews her portfolio every six months. "I think that's a pretty good cadence for lazy investors," she 
says.
Owen agrees that some tweaking does make sense from time to time as conditions change, adding that "about 
once or twice per decade there is a major market rupture that requires some serious thinking and major changes".
Yield Financial Planning managing director James McFall agrees staying invested when markets fall suddenly and 
waiting for the recovery is part of a successful investor's mindset.
He advocates a more active approach, suggesting investors should "actively switch among asset classes where the 
greater risk or opportunity is at different points in the market cycle".
While the thesis that there are some companies that you can buy and hold forever might be considered central to 
lazy investing, Marais calls this idea "dangerous".
"Over time, it has tended to be the case that most businesses get disrupted, so the idea that there is a good-
enough company that you can buy and hold forever is sort of redundant."
He says rather than an annual or biannual review, the right time to review your investments "should be based on 
what's changing in the market".

Cisco Systems has completed its $US28bn ($42.8bn) all-cash acquisition of cyber security and analytics company 
Splunk.
The deal, the largest in Cisco's history, was closed months earlier than projected, reflecting the extraordinary effort 
many companies are undertaking as they remake their businesses around data and artificial intelligence.
Cisco chief executive Chuck Robbins and former Splunk CEO Gary Steele - now an executive vice-president at 
Cisco - said in an interview that AI would be deeply woven into the combined companies, and that they saw no hint 
that the current wave of business AI adoption was going to slow down or reverse course.
The combined company will use AI to help customers draw correlations in intelligence coming from different vendor 
platforms, so that they can take a more predictive approach to cyber security. While that predictive capability has 
been developing for some time, the company also plans to launch more capabilities that make use of generative AI 
to simplify their software and make it easier for people without technical training to operate the tools.
Splunk, launched in 2003, developed a dashboard that allows users to search, monitor and analyse machine-
generated data. It takes training to use it and generative AI helps reduce the learning curve, according to Mr Steele. 
"Splunk has its own proprietary language, the way in which you issue commands, and you have to be reasonably 
technical to do that," he said.
"With the AI assistance that we've launched, you can use English language to automatically generate that 
proprietary language. You can get outcomes without having all the advanced knowledge." Splunk's AI would benefit 
from Cisco's massive amounts of data, not to mention its global presence and sales and marketing channels, Mr 
Steele said.
Generative AI will have other applications across Cisco's business, such as simplifying the complex task of setting 
a configuration screen for a company's security policy, according to Mr Robbins. "It's very technical. We're going to 
enable our customers to just use English language to describe what security capabilities they would like â€¦ and 
then we will translate that into a policy that they would review," he said.

The software will function as an assistant, simplifying and speeding up the deployment of security policy and other 
resources without replacing human operators, according to Mr Robbins.
When the deal was announced in September 2023, the companies said it expected it to be completed by the end of 
September 2024. The process was completed in roughly half a year. Last week, the European Union gave the deal 
unconditional antitrust approval, after regulators found it wouldn't pose barriers to competition. Networking 
equipment pioneer Cisco, founded in 1984, rode the telecommunications boom of the 1990s. It was for a time the 
most valuable company in the world.

Nvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang said artificial intelligence had hit a "tipping point," sending the stock to 
new dizzying heights.
The renewed rally has Huang, known for his love of wearing leather jackets, on the verge of his own breakthrough: 
becoming one of the 20 richest people in the world.
Huang's wealth jumped $US9.6 billion ($14.7 billion) to $US69.2 billion, a gain that leapfrogged him ahead of 
Charles Koch and Chinese bottled-water tycoon Zhong Shanshan to 21st place on the Bloomberg Billionaires 
Index. It's a remarkable rise for the co-founder of the semiconductor company, who was ranked 128th with a net 
worth of $US13.5 billion as recently as early last year.
Nvidia surged 16 per cent to a record high on Thursday in New York, adding about $US277 billion in market value. 
That was the biggest single-session increase in market history, beating Meta's $US197 billion gain earlier this 
month. The company was able to exceed sky-high investor expectations with a revenue forecast that was more 
than $US2 billion ahead of analyst expectations.
Nvidia's rally boosted the fortunes of the 30 billionaires on Bloomberg's wealth list who attribute at least some of 
their wealth to AI by a combined $US42.8 billion. Charles Liang, CEO of Super Micro Computer, was the biggest 
winner on a percentage basis with a 33 per cent jump.
Nvidia's outlook extends a streak of the company shattering expectations, thanks to insatiable demand for its 
artificial intelligence accelerators - highly prized chips that crunch data for AI models. The technology has helped 
power a proliferation of chatbots and other generative AI services, which can create text and graphics based on 
simple prompts.
"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point," Huang said. "Demand is surging worldwide 
across companies, industries and nations."

Nvidia's market capitalisation has now increased by more than $US650 billion this year - bringing its valuation to 
$US1.89 trillion - as investors bet that the company will remain the prime beneficiary of an AI computing boom.
That turned Wednesday's report into a highly anticipated event for both Wall Street and the tech world. And the 
numbers - along with the upbeat tone from Huang - renewed confidence that spending will stay strong.
"The entire market is watching this report and expectations have been elevated," Wolfe Research analyst Chris 
Caso said.
Guidance was strong enough to "demonstrate continued momentum, while also leaving room for continued upside 
through the second half."
Nvidia, co-founded by Huang in 1993, got its start as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. Its profile 
blew up in the last two years, when its technology proved adept at handling heavy AI workloads. The company's 
H100 accelerators have become legendary in the tech world, with customers scrambling to get their hands on as 
many as possible.
Companies such as Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet's Google are Nvidia's largest customers, 
accounting for nearly 40 per cent of its revenue, as they rush to invest in hardware for AI computing.
In the US fiscal fourth quarter, which ended January 28, Nvidia's revenue more than tripled to $US22.1 billion. Profit 
excluding certain items was $US5.16 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $US20.4 billion and earnings 
of $US4.60 a share. Underscoring the magnitude of its recent growth streak: As recently as 2021, Nvidia didn't 
generate that much revenue in an entire year.
Nvidia's data centre division, now by far its largest source of sales, generated $US18.4 billion of revenue, up 409 
per cent from the same period a year earlier. Gaming chips provided $US2.87 billion of sales.
Nvidia is now working to spread its AI technology beyond the big data-centre companies. Huang, 61, has travelled 
the globe arguing that governments and corporations need their own AI systems - both to protect their data and 
gain a competitive advantage.
Nvidia announced a deal with Cisco Systems earlier this month that gives it a new distribution channel. As part of 
that deal, Cisco, the world's biggest provider of networking gear, will help sell complete AI systems to companies.
But Nvidia faces risks, including mounting competition and a push by some customers to develop their own AI 
chips.
"We're going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in the marketplace," Huang said.

## Assistant

Among the most negative journalists, Liza Lin's reporting on Cisco is particularly negative due to her focus on the company's declining presence in China. Her article details how Cisco, along with other American tech firms, has been systematically replaced by Chinese alternatives as part of China's push for technological self-sufficiency. The narrative emphasizes Cisco's diminishing market share, lost orders, and the broader geopolitical forces working against the company. The tone is consistently bleak, portraying Cisco as a victim of an irreversible trend, which contributes to her extreme negative sentiment score. In contrast, Michelle Bowes' article only briefly mentions Cisco in a negative light, referencing its historical stock price struggles post-dotcom crash. While this is a negative remark, it is not the central theme of the article, which is primarily about investment strategies. This explains why Bowes' sentiment score is less negative than Lin's, as her coverage of Cisco is incidental rather than a focal point of criticism.

Among the most positive journalists, Stephen Rosenbush's reporting on Cisco is highly favorable, focusing on the company's successful $42 billion acquisition of Splunk. His article highlights the strategic benefits of the deal, emphasizing Cisco's integration of AI and cybersecurity capabilities, its accelerated timeline for completion, and the positive outlook from company executives. The narrative presents Cisco as a forward-thinking leader in AI-driven security, reinforcing a strong and optimistic image. This overwhelmingly positive framing results in his high sentiment score. In contrast, the article by Vernal Galpotthawela, Jack Witzig, and Ian King is neutral, as it primarily discusses Nvidia's success and only briefly mentions Cisco in the context of a partnership. The lack of a strong positive or negative stance on Cisco results in a neutral sentiment score, making Rosenbush's coverage significantly more positive in comparison.
