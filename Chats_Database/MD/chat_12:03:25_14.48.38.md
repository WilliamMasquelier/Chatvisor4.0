Shell said its fourth-quarter earnings took a hit of between $US2.5bn and $US4.5bn ($7.7bn) in impairments, offset 
by significantly higher gas trading, while its overall production volumes are on track to meet targets.
The London-based energy giant said the impairments were primarily driven by macro developments as well as 
portfolio choices, including its Singapore chemicals and products assets, which it has been trying to sell.
The FTSE 100 leader by market capitalisation also said it expected cash flow from operations to take a hit from a 
$US900m charge related to timing of payments of emissions.
Shell expects to report integrated gas production between 880,000 and 920,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day for the 
fourth quarter, which would be in line with its guided range of 870,000-930,000 BOE a day, and compares with 
third-quarter production of 900,000 BOE a day.
Fourth-quarter volumes of liquefied natural gas are expected to be between 6.9 million and 7.3 million tonnes 
compared with 6.9 million tonnes in the preceding quarter. Shell previously expected LNG volumes of 6.7 million-
7.3 million tonnes.
Gains from integrated gas trading are expected to be significantly higher quarter-on-quarter, while the trading result 
from chemicals and crude oil refineries is seen to be significantly lower. The former segment was expected to make 
an adjusted earnings loss, the company said.
However, the expected uptick in fourth-quarter gas trading comes despite declining oil and gas prices throughout 
the period, with oil hitting a five-month low in early December, reflecting supply and demand concerns despite 
support from geopolitical uncertainty.
Upstream production - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - is expected to meet the guided range of 1.75 
million to 1.95 million BOE a day at 1.83 million to 1.93 million a day. It reported 1.75 million BOE a day in the third 
quarter.

Elsewhere, Saudi Aramco said it would cut crude prices to all regions, including its largest market in Asia - a move 
that comes amid weaker global oil prices and increased production by producers outside the Organisation of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
After a summer rally attributed in large part to Saudi Arabia's decision to implement a production cut of one million 
barrels a day on top of existing cuts by other members of OPEC and its allies, including Russia, crude fell sharply in 
the fourth quarter. Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ have extended cuts into 2023.
West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, fell more than 21 per cent in the fourth quarter of the calendar 
year to post a 2023 decline of 10.7 per cent. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell around 19 per cent in the fourth 
quarter to lose 10.3 per cent in 2023. Dow Jones newswires

1. Shell reported fourth-quarter earnings impairments between $US2.5bn and $US4.5bn, primarily due to macroeconomic factors and strategic portfolio decisions, particularly concerning its Singapore chemicals and products assets.

2. Despite the earnings hit, Shell's integrated gas production is expected to meet its targets, with projected production volumes between 880,000 and 920,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day, consistent with previous guidance.

3. The company anticipates a significant increase in gas trading profits, countering the overall decline in oil and gas prices during the quarter, which saw oil prices drop to a five-month low amid supply and demand concerns.

4. Shell's cash flow from operations is expected to be negatively impacted by a $US900m charge related to the timing of emissions payments, highlighting ongoing financial pressures linked to environmental compliance.

5. The broader market context includes Saudi Aramco's decision to cut crude prices, reflecting a trend of declining global oil prices and increased production from non-OPEC countries, which may further affect Shell's market positioning.
