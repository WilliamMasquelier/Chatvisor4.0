You are tasked with extracting stakeholder information and direct quotes from a given news article related to Shell. Your output should be in the form of a markdown table without column titles or any additional information. Each table row should contain:
1. The name of a real person who has expressed a quote in the provided article
2. His role or relation with regards to Shell.
3. Their original quote about Shell exactly as it appears in the article, without any modifications or translations

Guidelines:
- Include only real people: Exclude organizations, companies, or any other non-person entities
- Direct connection: Ensure that each selected individual is explicitly connected to Shell or explicitly express his opinion on Shell.
- Only include those whose statements are directly about Shell
- Exclude individuals whose comments are not directly relevant to Shell or are too general
- Pertinent stakeholders only: Only include the most relevant individuals
- Do not include stakeholders who are not directly associated with Shell

Output Format Requirements:
- Each line must contain exactly two columns separated by "|" symbols
- Column 1: Stakeholder's name
- Column 2: Stakeholder's role or link to Shell. If not described in the article, try to interpret its role. If it is not straightforward to interpret, mention "Not mentioned".
- Column 3: Original quote in its original language

Example of correct formatting:
| Pierre Dupont | Consumer | "Cette décision de Shell est très importante." |
| John Smith | Shell's CEO |"We need to review Shell's proposal carefully." |
| Hans Weber | Financial analyst | "Die Strategie von Shell ist überzeugend." |

If no relevant individuals with quotes are found, return "None."

Highlight: Oil giant Shell wins a landmark case at The Hague, overturning an earlier court ruling ordering it to cut 
its carbon emissions by 45 per cent. 
Body
A Dutch court has accepted Shell's appeal against a landmark climate ruling, dismissing the order for the oil and 
gas company to sharply reduce emissions.
The appeals court in The Hague said on Tuesday that Shell had a responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions to protect people from global warming.
But it dismissed the 2021 ruling that ordered Shell to cut its absolute carbon emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 
compared to 2019 levels, including those caused by the use of its products.
The Dutch court said Shell was already on its way to meet required targets for its own emissions, and it was 
unclear if demands to also reduce emissions caused by the use of its products would help the fight against climate 
change.
"Even though Shell bears a special responsibility as a large oil and gas company, that does not mean we can 
apply a general reduction goal of 45 per cent," presiding judge Carla Joustra said.
In a written summary of the ruling, the court said: "There is currently insufficient consensus in climate science on a 
specific reduction percentage to which an individual company like Shell should adhere."
Shell's chief executive officer, Wael Sawan, welcomed the ruling.
“We are pleased with the court’s decision, which we believe is the right one for the global energy transition, the 
Netherlands and our company,” he said.

"Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of Shell's strategy and is 
transforming our business."
Climate mitigation debate
The ruling coincides with the COP29 UN climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, where building on a decision at last 
year's talks to transition away from fossil fuels is set to be debated.
Climate activist group Friends of the Earth Netherlands, which brought the case forward in 2019, said it would 
continue its fight against large polluters.
"This hurts," the group's director Donald Pols said. 
"At the same time, we see that this case has ensured that major polluters are not immune and has further 
stimulated the debate about their responsibility in combating dangerous climate change.
"That is why we continue to tackle major polluters, such as Shell."
Friends of the Earth did not say whether it would launch a further appeal at the Netherlands' Supreme Court.
The case in the Hague, where Shell was headquartered until it completed its move to London in 2022, was viewed 
as pivotal for both sides of the emissions divide and helped to inspire other lawsuits.
In appeal hearings earlier this year, Shell said demands for companies to reduce emissions could not be made by 
courts, but only by states.
The court agreed with Shell that an absolute order to reduce emissions from its products could have an adverse 
effect worldwide, as it could lead customers to switch from using Shell's gas to more polluting coal.
"In general, any reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is positive to mitigate climate change," Judge Joustra said.
"But that does not mean that a reduction order for Shell has that same effect."
Shell shares traded down 0.2 per cent in Amsterdam early on Tuesday, broadly in line with the wider index.
