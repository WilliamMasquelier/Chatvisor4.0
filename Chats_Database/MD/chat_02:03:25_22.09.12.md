Body
America's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm is officially open, a long-awaited moment that helps pave the 
way for a succession of large wind farms.
Danish wind energy developer Ørsted and the utility Eversource built a 12-turbine wind farm called South Fork 
Wind 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Montauk Point, New York.  New York Gov. Kathy Hochul  will be on Long 
Island Thursday to announce that the turbines are delivering clean power to the local electric grid. Interior Secretary 
Deb Haaland  is expected to attend. 
Achieving commercial scale is a turning point for the industry, but what's next? Experts say the nation needs a 
major buildout of this type of clean electricity to address climate change. 
Offshore wind is central to both national and state plans to transition to a carbon-free electricity system. The Biden 
administration has approved six commercial-scale offshore wind energy projects, and auctioned lease areas for 
offshore wind for the first time off the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico coasts. New York picked two more projects last 
month to power more than 1 million homes. 
This is just the beginning, Hochul said. She said the completion of South Fork shows that New York will 
aggressively pursue climate change solutions to save future generations from a world that otherwise could be 
dangerous. South Fork can generate 132 megawatts of offshore wind energy to power more than 70,000 homes. 
“It’s great to be first, we want to make sure we’re not the last. That’s why we’re showing other states how it can be 
done, why we're moving forward, on to other projects,” Hochul told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview 
before the announcement. 
“This is the date and the time that people will look back in the history of our nation and say, ‘This is when it 
changed,’” Hochul added.

Ørsted CEO Mads Nipper called the opening a major milestone that proves large offshore wind farms can be built, 
both in the United States  and in other countries with little or no offshore wind energy currently. 
With South Fork finished, Ørsted and Eversource are turning their attention to the work they will do offshore 
beginning this spring for a wind farm more than five times its size. Revolution Wind will be Rhode Island and 
Connecticut’s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes next year. 
The site where the cable will connect in Rhode Island is already under construction.
In New York, the state said last month it would negotiate a contract with Ørsted and Eversource for an even larger 
wind farm, Sunrise Wind, to power 600,000 homes. The Norwegian company Equinor was picked for its Empire 
Wind 1 project to power more than 500,000 New York homes. Both aim to start providing power in 2026. 
After years of planning and development, 2024 is a year of action— building projects that will deliver sizeable 
amounts of clean power to the grid, said David Hardy, group executive vice president and CEO Americas at 
Ørsted.
Ørsted, formerly DONG Energy, for Danish Oil and Natural Gas, started aggressively building wind farms off the 
coast of Denmark, the U.K. and Germany in 2008. The company sold off the North Sea oil and gas assets on which 
it had built its identity to focus on clean energy, becoming Ørsted. It’s now one of the biggest wind power 
developers.
The first U.S. offshore wind farm was supposed to be a project off the coast of Massachusetts known as Cape 
Wind. A Massachusetts developer proposed the project in 2001. It failed after years of local opposition and 
litigation. 
Turbines began spinning off Rhode Island’s Block Island as a pilot project in 2016. But with just five of them, it’s not 
a commercial-scale wind farm.
Last year brought challenges for the nascent U.S. offshore wind industry, as Ørsted and other developers canceled 
projects in the Northeast that they said were no longer financially feasible. High inflation, supply chain disruptions 
and the rising cost of capital and building materials were making projects more expensive as developers were trying 
to get the first large U.S. offshore wind farms opened. 
Industry leaders expect 2024 to be a better year, as interest rates come down and states ask for more offshore 
wind to meet their climate goals. 
The nation's second large offshore wind farm, Vineyard Wind, is expected to open later this year off the coast of 
Massachusetts, too. The first five turbines are providing power for about 30,000 homes and businesses in 
Massachusetts. When all 62 turbines are spinning, they'll generate enough electricity for 400,000 homes and 
businesses. Avangrid and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners are the joint owners of that project.
The Biden administration wants enough offshore wind energy to power 10 million homes by 2030. Interior Secretary 
Haaland said in a statement that "America’s clean energy transition is not a dream for a distant future— it's 
happening right here and now.”

1. Ørsted, in partnership with Eversource, has successfully launched the South Fork Wind farm, marking a significant milestone as America's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, which is expected to influence future projects across the country.

2. Following the completion of South Fork, Ørsted is set to begin work on the Revolution Wind project, which will be over five times larger and aims to power more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut by next year.

3. Ørsted is negotiating a contract for the Sunrise Wind project, which will be even larger than South Fork, with the capacity to power 600,000 homes in New York, indicating the company's aggressive expansion strategy in the U.S. offshore wind market.

4. Despite facing challenges in the previous year, including project cancellations due to financial feasibility issues, Ørsted and industry leaders are optimistic about 2024, anticipating a more favorable environment for offshore wind development as interest rates decline and demand for clean energy increases.
