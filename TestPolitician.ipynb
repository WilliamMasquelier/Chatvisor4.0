The new offence covers the publication of details such as names, addresses, and phone numbers with the intent to cause harm, with penalties of up to seven years in jail. The legislation follows a high-profile case involving the publication of information from a WhatsApp group of Jewish Australians.  \n",

Limited All Rights Reserved\\nLength: 1579 words\\nHighlight: Parents face a \\'triple whammy\\' with a sick child in daycare, missing work, paying fees, and then facing \\nthe risk of getting sick themselves.\\nBody\\nWhen Fiona Maine drops one-year-old Freddy at his daycare centre, it annoys her if she notices another child \\nlooking sickly.\\n\"I have heard of many parents, if their kids are sick, they\\'ll give them Panadol or Nurofen and send them off, \\nknowing they\\'ll have to go pick them up once it wears off. Just so they can have half a day of daycare, they can \\nwork and get paid for it,\" she says.\\nFreddy has been attending daycare in Sydney five days a week since he was four months old. The 31-year-old \\npregnant mother of four cannot work in her tech support role while he is home.\\n\"I can\\'t take phone calls while looking after a baby. Honestly, he gets sick once every couple of weeks. [I feel] a bit \\nrotted because we still have to pay for it.\"\\nIt\\'s a common complaint heard around the nation from parents with children in daycare who get sent home sick. Jay \\nWeatherill, the former premier of South Australia, now leads early education campaign Thrive by Five and says \\nparents with young children are stuck in an impossible position.\\n\"Parents are doing it really tough right now through the spiralling cost-of-living, but it\\'s a triple whammy for parents \\nwhen their children are sick,\" he says.\\n\"Not only are they caring for a sick child, which is stressful enough on its own, they are also grappling with the out-\\nof-pocket costs for a day of childcare and the lost earnings or leave due to being unable to attend work.\"\\nMelanie Allen is a Pilates instructor and works for herself while her children Henry, 3, and Edie, 10 months, attend \\ndaycare in Adelaide.\\n\"Money-wise, it\\'s hard. And the daycare fee being so high makes it harder,\" Allen says.\\n\"I never factored in how much it would cost in daycare to have them both in. And then I was like, why? Why, when \\nschool is free? Why isn\\'t daycare subsidised to the point that it\\'s free as well?\\nPage 2 of 4\\n\\'Gastro seven times\\': How childcare hits parents with a triple whammy\\n\"What burns is paying for them not to be there, staying home, and not getting paid. So, say I make $250 in a day; I \\ndon\\'t make that money, and then I also have to pay another $170.\\n\"And then, knowing that might go through my second kid, and then also through me and then to my husband, \\nbecause if one of us is sick, the other one\\'s going to have to take off work so they can look after the kids. So it\\'s just \\na cycle, a vicious cycle.\"\\nWeatherill says the early childhood education and care workforce is in crisis because of low pay, poor conditions \\nand staff shortages as well as providers with ongoing overheads that they can\\'t turn off when a child enrolled at \\ntheir service is ill.\\n\"What all this adds up to is a system in need of complete reform. Providers need certainty, early childhood \\neducators need proper pay and conditions, parents need financial support and children need access to the \\nenormous benefits that arise from participation in high quality early learning.\"\\nGeorgie Dent, chief executive of The Parenthood, a campaign partner of Thrive by Five, says Australia needs to \\nmove to a system that is more affordable for families and closer to the school experience.\\n\"This would mean it\\'s not a system where families are spending hundreds of dollars out of pocket on a day. And so \\nit then would become less of an issue if your child was sick or not sick,\" she says.\\nShayne Kuyper and his partner enrolled their two-year-old daughter, Poppy, in daycare when she was 13 months \\nold. She had never been sick before daycare.\\n\"She hasn\\'t had a single week without coming home with something since,\" Kuyper says. \"She\\'s had gastro seven \\ntimes this year.\"\\nThey navigate Poppy\\'s sick days at their home in Melbourne by splitting the day in half.\\n\"[My partner] will take her for the morning, and I\\'ll take her for the afternoon. Which means that we\\'ve each missed \\nhalf a day of work.\\n\"It\\'s painful that you still have to pay for these sick days. And you\\'re allocated [52] days a year - beyond that, you \\nlose your government subsidy. So, if we have more absent days, we pay the full rate. It\\'s unavoidable; they\\'ll get \\nsick at daycare, but we\\'re punished for it.\"\\nNesha Hutchinson, vice-president of the Australian Childcare Alliance, says rostering staff for a position in a \\nchildcare centre means it\\'s impossible to avoid charging fees if a child is away sick.\\n\"If there are 10 children in the preschool room, or five in the toddler\\'s room, we have to pay for that staff member \\nwhether or not the child turns up,\" Hutchinson says.\\n\"If two children are sick on a day, does the staff member get paid 80 per cent of their wages because the children \\nare off? That\\'s important to consider, given that wages are the highest cost for a childcare centre. And we can\\'t \\noverbook like they do on planes, hotels or restaurants as it\\'s illegal.\"\\nHutchinson says \"educators get very sick, particularly in their first year in early education\", contributing to a high \\nstaff turnover within the first year of employment.\\nEmily Holmes, 25, is a childcare educator working in South East Melbourne. She says most of her fellow educators \\nhave used their sick leave entitlements.\\n\"We get sick quite a lot in general, but it is the same in every centre I\\'ve ever worked at,\" she says.\\nFederal Early Childhood Education Minister Anne Aly said the childcare subsidy will continue to be paid for 52 \\nabsences a year, after it was increased from 42 a year due to the pandemic.Page 3 of 4\\n\\'Gastro seven times\\': How childcare hits parents with a triple whammy\\n\"Supporting and growing the early childhood education and care workforce is critical to delivering our landmark \\ncheaper childcare reforms - which is why we have a plan to deliver a stronger and sustainable early childhood \\neducation workforce,\" she said in a statement.\\nLink to Image\\nJames Brickwood\\n\"We\\'re increasing the number of university spots, bringing forward fee-free TAFE places, changing the Fair Work \\nAct to allow multi-employer bargaining and taking action to close the gender pay gap - all of which will benefit the \\nearly childhood education sector.\"\\nThe government has committed to a Productivity Commission review into the early childhood education and care \\nsector, looking into how to improve affordability and access for families, including considering a universal 90 per \\ncent Child Care Subsidy rate.\\nElke Bremner has two sons in daycare in Sydney\\'s West Killara. Her husband, Seth, is often overseas for work, \\nleaving her in a tough spot when they\\'re ill and he\\'s away.\\n\"Your work doesn\\'t stop just because your kids are sick,\" she says. \"So, I was having to still make up the time. \\nWhen my child was sleeping; or at night, I was working after the kids were in bed each night just trying to catch up \\non everything.\\n\"I don\\'t know of many families that can afford to be living in Sydney at the moment and not have both parents \\nworking.\"\\nTo fill the daycare gap, Sharon Mitchell wakes up at 3am, goes for a run on the treadmill and gets ready to answer \\nher phone at 4am. Mitchell runs Mayday Mummy, an emergency nanny service on the north shore of Sydney.\\n\"The phone absolutely does ring and early in the morning. It\\'s ad-hoc, emergency, last minute. We\\'re not a \\npermanent nanny solution. I would only have anyone on the Mayday Mummy team that I would feel comfortable in \\nmy own home, looking after my own family,\" she says.\\nThe rate is $65 an hour. Mitchell acknowledges most parents may not earn enough to cover the minimum three-\\nhour callout fee, but they are available if something goes pear-shaped and parents need somebody to step in. She \\nadds that there is more than enough work for her company and welcomes competition.\\n\"If there are other people out there that can support families in these difficult situations, I say: Absolutely, you know. \\nPlease help, because there\\'s so much need out there.\" \\nMitchell backs up Fiona Maine\\'s revelation about parents doing the \"Panadol drop and run\".\\n\"They know that when a phone call comes in, at midday, the Panadol is worn off,\" she said.\\n\"I was speaking to a daycare centre, it was a while ago, and they actually stopped parents providing the babies\\' \\nbottles made up because they found that some parents were actually putting Panadol and Nurofen into the baby\\'s \\nbottle, knowing that they would then have an extra dose of Panadol and Nurofen at lunchtime in their bottle.\"\\nDr Lachlan Macarthur, a GP at Mona Vale Medical Centre, says one of the benefits of having children spend time \\naround lots of different children is that they become exposed to a wide variety of common viruses. The immune \\nsystem is then able to create a response, allowing immunity to increase for a period of time.\\n\"Like a great many other families with whom I have worked, my daughter had a number of illnesses this year, \\nincluding COVID-19 in February and Influenza A in June,\" he says.\\nMacarthur says the frustration or concern with shifting around work roles pales in the face of a seriously unwell \\nchild.Page 4 of 4\\n\\'Gastro seven times\\': How childcare hits parents with a triple whammy\\n\"I understand that it can be difficult to adapt pre-planned schedules and work commitments when one\\'s child is \\nunwell. I am lucky to work in a profession that allows, perhaps, a greater level of flexibility when it comes to taking \\ncarer\\'s leave.\"\\nBut for Maine, who has been taking her children to daycare for the past five years, the battle will continue.\\n\"So I just kind of put up with it and pay the fee instead of fighting it,\" she says.\\n\"Even a discount would be appreciated.\"\\nMake the most of your health, relationships, fitness and nutrition with our Live Well newsletter.

I\\'m so proud that our government is a \\ngovernment that values early childhood education and care. And from 1 July this year, over one million families will \\nbenefit from our Cheaper Child Care policy. This is good for families, and you\\'ll have more young children gain \\naccess to the great benefits of early childhood education and care. And that more parents can better balance work \\nand parenting - particularly women. Because for too long the high costs of child care have put a brake on their \\neconomic participation. I know this is a huge issue for families in Canberra where we have some of the highest child \\ncare costs in the country. So I\\'m really pleased to hand over to the Prime Minister now to talk further.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Alicia. And it\\'s great to be back here at one of the \\ncentres where we came in opposition, to talk about what a difference a change of government would make in taking \\nchild care seriously and in promoting early learning. Early learning is good for young ones, it\\'s also good for \\nfamilies, it\\'s also good for our economy. Because if we support women to be able to participate fully in the \\nworkforce there will be productivity benefits. It benefits them and their family budgets, but it also benefits \\nbusinesses who employ women, because they\\'re able to have greater continuity in their career. They retire with \\nhigher savings than they would otherwise, and it changes the dynamic in our workplaces. This was the first major \\nPage 2 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\ncommitment that I gave in my first budget reply, in the days when opposition leaders had policies and that made \\nannouncements in budget replies. We campaigned for three years with this as the largest on-budget investment \\nthat we are making during this term, and it\\'s the largest on-budget investment because there is nothing that is more \\nimportant than giving the best chance in life for our youngest Australians, some of whom we\\'ve met here today. \\nLearning that social interaction that\\'s so important, as well as learning skills that will give them a good run up to \\nwhen they start school. But also it\\'s so important for our national economy. It\\'s one of the themes as well of the \\nJobs and Skills Summit, and I\\'m very pleased that we put in place the mechanisms last year, in our first term we \\ncarried the legislation for cheaper child care that will benefit 1.2 million Australian families from July 1, but we\\'re not \\nresting there. We also committed to do a Productivity Commission Inquiry into the universal provision of early \\nlearning. Just as Labor is the party of universal Medicare, of universal superannuation, we also want to be the party \\nthat delivers universal, affordable child care - very important going forward. And that\\'s why today we\\'re announcing \\nthe Productivity Commission Inquiry with Professor Deborah Brennan as the person to undertake that enquiry. \\nThere\\'s no one more qualified than Professor Brennan to undertake this work. It will be a comprehensive inquiry \\nthat will report back to the government on the next steps that we will make. I lead an orderly government. A \\ngovernment that indicates what we are going to do and then gets on and does it. Making a difference as we have in \\nour first eight months, this will make a difference and it\\'s my great pleasure to ask the Professor to make some \\ncomments.\\nPROFESSOR DEBORAH BRENNAN: Thanks, Prime Minister. I\\'m Deb Brennan, I\\'m from the University of New \\nSouth Wales and I\\'ve been around the early childhood education and care policy world for a very long time. So I\\'m \\nabsolutely thrilled to have this opportunity to participate in a co-leadership role in the Productivity Commission \\nInquiry. We\\'ve got the foundations of a fantastic early childhood learning and care system in Australia. But \\neverybody knows there\\'s work to do. We\\'ve got challenges around affordability, access, workforce, many areas, so \\nwe\\'re going to have a really good look at the sector and come up with some suggestions for advancing the system \\nso that every child in Australia gets access to high quality learning and care.\\nJASON CLARE, MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: This is really important. The first five years of your life are \\neverything. Everything you see, everything you hear, every book you read, and every person you meet shapes the \\nperson that you become. What happens in places like this shape the person you become. Early education is good \\nfor kids, it\\'s good for parents, and it\\'s good for the economy. We promised to do three things in the election; first, to \\ncut the cost of child care, and that starts on the first of July. The legislation we passed last year will cut the cost of \\nchild care for more than a million Australian families. We also promised an ACCC inquiry into the driving costs \\nbehind child care. That work is now underway and they will provide their interim report in June and their final report \\nin December. And thirdly, we promised a big and broad, far-reaching inquiry into our early education system to set \\nus up for the next decade and beyond done by the Productivity Commission. And I\\'ve got to say, I am so glad that \\nDeborah, you have agreed to do this work for us. Last night I picked up the phone and spoke to leaders in the \\nsector to tell them that Professor Deborah Brennan would be doing this work. And I\\'ve got to tell you, the response \\nwas overwhelming. If you talk to the same people I spoke to last night, you will hear the same thing. Because \\nhonestly, there is no one more experienced and no one more respected by the early education sector to do this \\nwork. Deborah, I know this has been your life\\'s work and I thank you so much for helping us to write the next \\nchapter.\\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: This Productivity Commission Review that\\'s \\ngoing to be led by Professor Brennan, who brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to this review is just one \\npart of the Albanese Government\\'s reforms in early childhood education and care. We\\'ve started that with making \\nearly childhood education and care more affordable for 1.2 million families right across Australia. As Jason \\nmentioned, and as the Prime Minister mentioned, those first five years are critical, and we have the capacity \\nthrough early childhood education and care to change the trajectory of a child\\'s life. No child born into any form of \\ndisadvantage, no matter who they are, no matter where they live, no matter what background they come from. \\nEvery single child has the capacity to grow and develop if we focus, if we get it right in those first five years. And \\nthis Productivity Commission Review led by Professor Brennan is going to be a huge part of our reforms in early \\nchildhood education and care, carrying on the Labor government\\'s legacy in this area. It was a Labor government \\nthat first introduced the National Quality Framework when we were last in government, and we will continue that Page 3 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nlegacy because we know just how important those first five years are in a child\\'s life. But also how important good \\nquality, affordable early childhood education and care are for the economy, for parents, for allowing women who are \\npredominantly primary caregivers to get out there, to work, to choose to continue their education and develop \\nthemselves if they so wish. So like Jason, and like the Prime Minister, and Alicia Payne, I\\'m really, really excited to \\nwelcome Professor Brennan to the Productivity Commission Review. Thank you.\\nPRIME MINISTER: As you can see, we\\'re very excited about Professor Brennan\\'s appointment here this morning. \\nHappy to take questions.\\nJOURNALIST: On housing affordability, there\\'s new legislation being introduced today. Obviously, that\\'s a long term \\nplan, but will there be any relief for renters in the May Budget?\\nPRIME MINISTER: We\\'ll have the May Budget in May, but we\\'re already taking significant action when it comes to \\nhousing, including the introduction of the legislation that we\\'ll have today for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \\nThat\\'s important legislation, to boost the supply of housing but particularly social and community housing. In \\naddition to that, we\\'ve said that of those 30,000 additional social housing units that will be created, 4,000 of them \\nwill be set aside for women and children escaping domestic violence. In addition to that, we have our Emergency \\nHousing Fund, a $100 million increase. In addition to that, we have our National Housing Accord with the Master \\nBuilders Association, with state and territory governments, with the private sector, working together with the private \\nsector to boost housing supply. In addition to that, we\\'re creating our Housing Supply and Affordability Council \\nagain. Working with state and territory governments, as well as local government about freeing up land, about \\ncreating more support there in the housing sector. In addition to that, there was over half a billion dollars just sitting \\nthere not being used for housing that we have tapped into to provide that support. So we have a comprehensive \\nplan when it comes to housing, you\\'ll see more roll out, in an orderly way, just like we\\'re rolling out today\\'s \\nannouncement in an orderly way.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the first Australian shipment of coal has arrived in China, do you know how many \\nmore are expected to arrive in the near future, and are you confident that the shipments can increase with Don \\nFarrell visiting in the near future as well?\\nPRIME MINISTER: What I\\'m confident of is that the dynamic between Australia and China has changed, from one \\nwhere there wasn\\'t dialogue between ministers, to one where there is. And that dialogue is always a good idea. I\\'ve \\nsaid with regards to the relationship with China, that we will cooperate where we can, we will disagree where we \\nmust, and we\\'ll engage in our national interest. And when I met with President Xi, I indicated to him publicly, but \\nalso of course, privately, that it quite clearly was in Australia\\'s interests to export more to China. China currently \\nreceives more exports by value than the next three major trading partners combined. So that relationship is \\nimportant for Australian jobs, for our national economy, but there\\'s another thing it\\'s good for too. It\\'s good for China \\nto receive those goods, because we have not just resources, but we have wine, meat, barley, seafood - the best in \\nthe world. And it is in China\\'s interest for any impediments to be removed. I\\'m very pleased that Don Farrell had a \\nconstructive meeting this week with his counterpart in China. I\\'m pleased that Penny Wong visited Beijing on \\nDecember 21st to mark the 50th anniversary of relations between Australia and the People\\'s Republic of China. \\nAnd I look forward to both of our countries going forward in a constructive, cooperative way. These reports haven\\'t \\nbeen confirmed yet. We are cautious about making announcements before they\\'re confirmed. But quite clearly, I \\nthink if Australian business and Australian industry, what they tell me, including last night with business people I\\'ve \\nmet with, is that they are very pleased with the constructive direction of the relationship.\\nJOURNALIST: Further on China, US officials say that Chinese spy balloons are part of an effort to assess the \\nmilitary capabilities around the world. Does that concern you and does this incident in the US, do you see that as a \\nsetback in the engagement that was seen between Washington and Beijing and Canada?\\nPRIME MINISTER: We support the sovereignty of nations, including the United States, our great friends in the \\nUnited States. We consider all of the matters relating to national security and respond in an appropriate way and \\nwill continue to do so.Page 4 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nJOURNALIST: Disability workers and age care workers got big pay rises recently. The Childcare Workers Union \\nhas called for a 25% pay rise. We know pay is a huge factor in this industry. Would you back a pay rise like that for \\nchild care workers?\\nPRIME MINISTER: The government doesn\\'t determine the level of wages for everybody in the sector.\\nJOURNALIST: But do you support their push?\\nPRIME MINISTER: What I support is people being paid fairly, and I won\\'t comment on specifics because that\\'s the \\njob of the Fair Work Commission to consider these matters independently of government and come to decisions. \\nWhat I would say though, and what I\\'ve said publicly a number of times, including yesterday at the UN International \\nWomen\\'s Day event that was held yesterday morning, is that if you look at the sectors where people are underpaid, \\nthey have something in common, two things: One, they are the very sectors that got us through the pandemic. Our \\ncleaners, our aged care workers, our childcare workers. There\\'s something else they\\'ve got in common as well. \\nThey are largely feminised industries, and that\\'s why, when we made changes to industrial regulations, I announced \\nat our campaign launch in Perth last year that we would very specially have measures that allowed the gender pay \\ngap to be considered. We had legislation yesterday as well about transparency, so that the gender pay gap can be \\nidentified for larger companies as well. So I will conclude with this by saying, early learning educators do a fantastic \\njob. They\\'re valued by parents, they\\'re valued by children who grow to love them and have a relationship with them. \\nThis isn\\'t just a normal job, as much as I love all the journalists here, our relationship is different. Between the \\neducators and the children who they look after. And I have every respect for the educators and the work that they \\ndo.\\nJOURNALIST: One on the Referendum Machinery Act please if I could. Yesterday, Katy Gallagher said that you \\nwould go ahead with the information pamphlet. In December, Don Farrell and Mark Dreyfus said \"there\\'s no longer \\nany need for taxpayers to pay for a pamphlet to be sent to every household. The Referendum Act does not reflect \\nmodern delivery and communications methods.\" Do you still agree with that? Has your view changed or is this \\nbringing back the pamphlet a concession to just get it through the Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Both things are right. The truth is, I don\\'t know about you Josh, when was the last letter you \\nsent?\\nJOURNALIST: I think it was around Christmas.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Apart from Christmas Cards, when was the last letter you sent?\\nJOURNALIST: You\\'re testing my memory, it\\'s not my press conference.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Has anyone here sent a letter this year?\\nJOURNALIST: Last week, to the US Consulate.\\nPRIME MINISTER: That\\'s not a letter, that\\'s an application. The world has changed how we communicate. But I \\ncould have said, we will engage constructively. One of the Senators approached, we made this decision a week \\nago, one of the Senators approached and said, this will make a big difference for our approach. I don\\'t know how \\nmany times I can say this at press conferences, we will do what we need to do to broaden support for this. The \\nreferendum that will be held later this year is about two things, recognition and consultation. Recognising Aboriginal \\nand Torres Strait Islander People in our Constitution and consulting them on matters that affect them, that\\'s what it\\'s \\nabout. Now we want to maximise support for that. So if anyone has, as I said, I await any member of the House of \\nRepresentatives or the Senate to examine the question and the draft changes that I put forward at Garma last year. \\nNow, I\\'ll give you the exclusive, just for you, so if everyone else can not listen, if there\\'s a constructive suggestion, \\nthat\\'s backed in by lawyers, we\\'ll change that. If there\\'s a suggestion, there hasn\\'t been one, there hasn\\'t been one. \\nI want this to succeed. I\\'m not being dogmatic about this. This is not our proposal, this is a proposal that came from \\nthe bottom up. And you need to think of the counterfactual of what happens if this referendum succeeds. If this \\nreferendum succeeds, Indigenous Australians will be shown the respect that they deserve. Australians will all know Page 5 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nthat we\\'ve acknowledged the great privilege that we have of sharing this continent with the oldest continuous \\nculture on earth. And the world will see that Australia\\'s a mature country, a mature country that can be honest \\nabout our history and can celebrate that history. That\\'s what this is about. It\\'s not about party politics. And that\\'s \\nwhat every state Premier and Chief Minister understands. And I just say to my colleagues on the Hill, this isn\\'t the \\nopportunity to look for division. This is the opportunity to look for national unity, to embrace the opportunity which is \\nthere. So, if someone has a suggestion, by all means put it forward. I\\'m up for it, in terms of, whether a pamphlet \\ngoes out, it doesn\\'t hurt, a pamphlet going out. People are going to put things in letterboxes anyway during the \\nreferendum. If people want taxpayers to pay for it, there\\'s a judgement call there, fine. Taxpayers shouldn\\'t be \\nfunding the campaigns of Yes and No. That should be up to people to fund. There should be equal funding and \\nthere will be under the under the proposal that we have. I also welcome Simon Birmingham\\'s comments this \\nmorning. Simon Birmingham has said very clearly that there shouldn\\'t be funding of the Yes and No case. I \\nwelcome the comments of Simon Birmingham. I welcome anyone who wants to join this journey on the path to \\nreconciliation.\\nJOURNALIST: There are strong indications that Vladimir Putin signed off on the supply of weapons used to shoot \\ndown MH17. If you could look at him in the eye today, what would you say to Vladimir Putin?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I\\'d say that you are reprehensible. That Vladimir Putin, clearly, the shooting down of MH17 was \\nan act of terrorism that had an impact here in Australia, but on many countries as well. And we will continue to \\npursue these issues with every avenue at our disposal.\\nJOURNALIST: So how do you feel about the suspension of the criminal investigation into the downing of MH17?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I think I just answered how I feel about it. The issue, of course, of the Russian invasion of \\nUkraine, this is a guy who runs an authoritarian regime that doesn\\'t care about human rights, that doesn\\'t care \\nabout devastation of communities, whether it be in Ukraine, whether it be the oppression of its own citizens, or \\nwhether the acts outside of Russia of which we\\'ve seen a number. The travesty of MH17 is an issue in which he \\nshould be held to account and Australia will continue to pursue all of these issues with every avenue at our \\ndisposal.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, this morning the Deputy PM has indicated he wants to get rid of Chinese linked \\nsurveillance cameras from government buildings. We spoke about the relationship with China earlier, the last time \\nthe Australian government tried to ban or exclude a Chinese company from communications in any form in \\nAustralia, it was detrimental to our relationship with China. Are you concerned about how Beijing will react to the \\nremoval of those devices?\\nPRIME MINISTER: No, we act in accordance with Australia\\'s national interest. We do so transparently and that\\'s \\nwhat we\\'ll continue to do.

She has never held an Egyptian passport but might be \\ncaught by the strict interpretation of foreign citizenship - and its renunciation - applied by the High Court.\\nIn May 2018, the High Court disqualified ACT Labor senator Katy Gallagher because she was a \"citizen of a foreign \\npower at the time of her nomination for election to the Senate on May 31, 2016, and was for that reason incapable \\nof being chosen as a senator at the double-dissolution election\". The court applied a rigid test, holding that it is not \\nsufficient for a candidate to take \"all reasonable steps\" if the foreign state itself has not legally adopted the \\nrenunciation.\\nFollowing that court decision Dr Aly produced a document from the Egyptian embassy stating   she relinquished her \\ncitizenship on May 6, 2016. \\nThe statement said: \"Dr Anne Aly renounced Egyptian citizenship on May 6, 2016, having completed all the steps \\nrequired and, as of that date, had completely renounced her Egyptian citizenship.\"\\nHowever, Professor Gans, a criminal law specialist, said   while the document \"looks good on its face\", Egypt\\'s \\nNationality Law did not provide for voluntary renunciation of citizenship.

That would require a decree by the \\nEgyptian   Minister of Interior, he said.\\nDr Aly had not provided a copy of any decree, and the letter she cited from the embassy made no mention of one.

service \\nout the back — obviously that\\'s not viable for the long term.\"\\nThe centre is in talks with the Federal Minister for Early Childhood Education Anne Aly to become a pilot facility for \\na new childcare subsidy model.\\n\"We\\'re not sure what it will look like because we\\'re waiting to hear back but we\\'re pretty excited about it,\" Ms Jones \\nsaid.\\nBarriers under

For the first time \\nin our political history, there will be a record number of Carla Zampatti dresses, as opposed to the once prevalent \\nMJ Bale suits, in both houses of parliament. The federal election was a win, not just for the Greens and the teal \\nwave, but also for a new world order of sorts.\\nThere is a new guard looming. One that is all about difference, diversity and diverging from a place of \"that\\'s just the \\nway it is\" to a new chapter in Canberra that champions equality. Climate change was front of mind for many voters, \\nwho backed independents including Allegra Spender - daughter of the late Zampatti - in the seat of Wentworth and \\nKate Chaney in Curtin, to speak up for the environment. \\nThis is in keeping with what ANU climate scientist Joëlle Gergis so aptly sums up in her new book, Humanity\\'s \\nMoment: A Climate Scientist\\'s Case for Hope, on sale this month: \"What an extraordinary time to be alive; we are \\npart of the generation that will help heal the world.\" The age of societal sustainability is upon us.\\nThe 47th parliament will be one of the most representative we\\'ve had, thanks to a new government and a collection \\nof MPs who accurately represent modern Australia.

Women \\ncount for 51 per cent of the Australian population and now comprise 38 per cent of the chamber in the new \\nparliament - the highest ever proportion on record - after 58 women were elected to the lower house, including 19 \\ndebutante MPs.

Her colleagues were so opposed to her being there, she had to make several attempts at \\npresenting her first speech, because the men kept interjecting as she spoke of wanting equal access to education \\nfor young Australian women.\\nStill, in 2003, the then newly minted cabinet minister Julie Bishop was infamously told how to dress by her male \\npeers. \"When I was first appointed to the ministry, I was asked to be the Minister for Ageing. And one of the prime \\nminister\\'s senior advisors rang me and said \\'Julie, take this the right way, but forget the Armani suits and forget the \\ncorporate look. You\\'re the minister for the ageing, you\\'re going into aged- care homes, you\\'ve got to dress \\nappropriately,\" Bishop has shared. \"I said \\'What? You mean like cardigans?\\' And he said, \\'Yeah more prints, more \\ncolour. Just not corporate.\\'\"\\nNot too long after this sermon from a \"faceless man\", Bishop went on to become Minister for Foreign Affairs and a \\nthree-time deputy leader of the Liberal party. And she did it all in good shoes and some of the best of Australian \\nfashion, including Rachel Gilbert, Rebecca Vallance and Dion Lee, and coined the phrase \"fashion diplomacy\" by \\nexclusively wearing homegrown Australian labels when on official visits.\\nHer work, putting fashion on the agenda, also helped put the wheels in motion for the Australian Fashion Council to \\nsecure a federal grant to establish an Australian Fashion trademark in 2021. The world-first campaign hopes to \\npromote the industry and create more local jobs. \"The Australian Fashion trademark will be a driving force in \\nbuilding the industry\\'s growth trajectory to deliver substantial economic, social and environmental gains over the \\nnext 10 years,\" CEO of Australian Fashion Council Leila Naja Hibri said in a statement. \\n\"We can show the world how prioritising people and the planet together with profit can lead to a legacy of thriving \\nprosperity.\"\\nWe\\'ve also come a long way since the ministerial wing was trodden, pretty much exclusively, by men in R.M. \\nWilliams boots in the first part of this century.

There is a lot more to it,\" Aly said.\\n\"Obviously, any opportunity to deliver our commitments earlier than expected will be good.\\n\"So we\\'re just playing it by ear at the moment, working towards that and I don\\'t want to pre-empt any kind of \\nchanges to that.\"\\nPrevious overhauls of the subsidy system have required months of implementation time so the government and \\nchildcare centres and providers can upgrade their IT systems.\\nThe Parenthood executive director Georgie Dent said early learning was a huge cost pressure on families, \\nespecially when combined with high inflation and interest rate rises.\\n\"If it is feasible to bring it forwards, potentially to January, then that would absolutely be worthwhile,\" she said.\\nThe existing system subsidises between 85 per cent and 20 per cent of fees, depending on a family\\'s income.\\nThe highest subsidies go to families earning below about $70,000 a year. The rate steps down so families earning \\nbetween $175,000 and $254,300 receive a 50 per cent subsidy and then steps further so those earning between \\n$344,300 and $354,300 get a 20 per cent subsidy. Above this income threshold, there is no subsidy.\\nChanges that started in March increased the subsidy rate for second and subsequent children where families have \\nmore than one child under the age of 5 in care, by 30 percentage points, up to a maximum of 95 per cent.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nParents set to save hundreds on childcare fees - but not until next year\\nLabor\\'s proposal will lift the subsidy rate for all families, smooth out the taper rate so it doesn\\'t abruptly step down, \\nand gives subsidies to families earning up to $530,000. It will also keep the higher subsidies for younger siblings.\\nAly will task the Productivity Commission before year\\'s end with examining the entire sector, with an aim of a \\nuniversal subsidy of 90 per cent. She\\'ll also ask the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to design a \\nprice regulation mechanism to make sure higher subsidies don\\'t translate into higher fees.\\nWhile the Coalition attacked Labor\\'s plan for paying the fees of wealthy families, those at the top end of the income \\nscale get the lowest subsidies - about 7 per cent for a household income of $500,000.\\nAn analysis of the proposal by ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods associate professor Ben Phillips finds \\nthat while the largest benefits in dollar terms would go to parents in the top 20 per cent of incomes, that is because \\nthey get either no subsidy or a lower level under the existing scheme.\\nThose earning up to $86,000 will be an average $358 better off a year.\\nOut of the almost 1.2 million families using childcare each year, all but about 14,300 would be better off than they \\nare now.\\nDent said it was also important the government dealt with existing workforce shortages before adding extra demand \\nfor childcare.\\nShe\\'s been hearing from parents whose childcare centres are having to restrict the number of places on offer or \\neven close rooms because they can\\'t get enough staff.\\n\"The situation with the workforce is a crisis and it\\'s only increasing,\" she said.\\nAly says addressing the workforce shortage has to be a cross-portfolio effort.

I'm Tania Lawrence, the Member for Hasluck. And it gives me great pleasure to be \\ntoday joined with the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Premier Roger Cook, my state parliamentary colleagues, \\nthe teachers, the trainers and students of North Metro TAFE. When we, even before the election in 2022, we knew \\nwe had a skills and labour shortage. So, one of the very first actions that the Albanese Labor Government took, was \\nto host a summit of unions, businesses, experts, economists, trainers from around the country to identify and \\narticulate the problem and work a pathway to solving it. I also hosted a roundtable here in Perth, with industry \\nleaders, TAFE institutions and with unions. And together, culminating now in this landmark agreement to really fund \\nthe institutions and vocational education training, with TAFE. And we all know, many of us here know, just how \\ncentral it is to having TAFE as the base for education. I myself, as a graduate of TAFE, my staff have done \\napprenticeships as well, and it really does create the careers and pathway opportunities, that have benefited the \\nnation. So with this, I'd love to hand over now to the Prime Minister.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA: Well, thanks very much, Tania, and it's great to be \\nback in the electorate of Hasluck. And it's terrific also to be here with our state parliamentary colleagues, led by \\nPremier Roger Cook, and the Training Minister Simone McGurk, but also Michelle Roberts, the local member here. \\nI am so excited to be in WA this weekend, because of course, it's Telethon Weekend. And you can feel a real uplift \\nhere, as WA does something that other states used to do, but don't do any more, unite in a common interest to \\nraise money to assist sick kids and their family. So, a big shout out at the beginning of this weekend, to all of those \\ninvolved in Telethon and an encouragement to dig deep over this weekend, to make sure that those young \\nAustralians who are so inspirational, who I look forward to meeting their ambassadors later today, and again to talk \\nto people tomorrow about the remarkable example that they show in their resilience, in their positivity, under \\ncircumstances which can be very difficult. But today, we are here at this wonderful TAFE institution to celebrate and \\nto mark the first National Skills Agreement since 2012. Throughout the entire period of my predecessors, there was \\nnot only no National Skills Agreement, there weren't skills agreements between indeed any individual jurisdiction \\nand the Commonwealth. Well, my Government is different. I went to an election saying that we would prioritise \\nTAFE at the center of the vocational education and training system and that we would value skills. The first \\nannouncement that I made as Labor Leader, was back here in Perth in 2019, where I announced the creation of \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nJobs and Skills Australia, a body to identify what the labour market needs were for Australian business going \\nforward, not just over a one year period, but five years, 10 years time. To make sure that our education and training \\nsystem was fit for purpose. To make sure, as well, that we didn't just rely upon temporary labour, bringing people in \\nand then sending them out, and bringing in other people to do the same job. That when we identify an area of skill \\nshortage, we actually have a strategy to tackle it. And that means firstly, training Australians for those jobs. We \\nneed also, of course, to have, migration will continue to play a role. But training Australians up, whether it be for \\ntheir first job or retraining. And it was fantastic to meet some of the students who are here, some of them new in \\ntheir first task that they're looking at doing but others looking at retraining, as well, for the jobs of the future, with the \\nconcentration that this TAFE will have on the renewable sector, which will require different skills. And that's why this \\n$12 billion program that we have put in place over a five year period, with $1.2 billion directly for Western Australia, \\nwill make an enormous difference going forward, over the next five years. And I pay tribute to all of the State and \\nTerritory Governments. A lot of work has gone into this, in the lead up to the National Cabinet meeting that we held \\non Monday, but all of the Premiers and Chief Ministers are very excited about the prospects of going forward. And \\nan example of the way that my Government is working cooperatively with State Governments. Not picking fights \\nwith them, not choosing to back Clive Palmer rather than the local State Government, but choosing instead to back \\nWestern Australians to deliver. Back in this most magnificent of economies, that has been so central to Australia's \\nemployment growth, to continue to be a powerhouse of the national economy. This week we had the labour market \\nfigures, showed an unemployment rate of 3.6 per cent. There have been 19 occasions since records began, where \\nunemployment has had a three in front of it and 16 of the of them have been under my Labor Government, since \\nwere elected last May. Now, we will continue to prioritise the creation of jobs, we will continue to prioritise lifting \\nwages and we will continue to prioritise giving people the skills, so they can fill those good, secure jobs. Now, the \\nFee-Free TAFE is already making an enormous difference. We committed to 180,000 Fee-Free TAFE places this \\nyear. We've delivered at least but still growing, 215,000. Here in WA, there were going to be 18,000 places, we've \\nalmost doubled that figure. WA was very quick off the mark in making a difference. And here at this TAFE, just one \\nexample of the difference that it has made, before Fee-Free TAFE this course in electronics used to cost $3,700. It \\nattracted about seven students each term. Fee-Free TAFE means that now the course has 85 students enrolled, \\nseven to 85. A practical example of how our commitment to Fee-Free TAFE, making a difference, working with \\nState Governments is making a difference to the economy. But importantly as well, making a difference to people's \\nlives by training them up and giving them the skills that they need for secure work into the future. So, I want to also \\nconclude by just giving a shout out to those people who are doing the training. A lot of people, when I've been to \\nTAFEs over the years, people who've already made a massive contribution through the skills and work that they've \\ndone, towards the end of their careers or sometimes after they're formally retired, go and impart those skills to the \\nnext generation coming through. And that's a really important thing about TAFE that we see and I thank those who \\nare doing that. And this course at this wonderful TAFE, I just think this is a really practical announcement and a \\npractical example of how my Government is getting on with dealing with cost of living pressures, dealing with the \\nchallenges which are in the economy and setting us up for a prosperous future. We're going to hear from the \\nPremier and then the WA Training Minister, Simone. And then we'll take questions.\\nROGER COOK, PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA: Thanks very much, Anthony. It's great to have the Prime \\nMinister back here in Western Australia and here in Midland at North Metropolitan TAFE, one of the centres that \\nwill be designed to train all the people we need for our renewable energy transition. So, it's terrific to be here to \\ncelebrate Fee-Free TAFE courses. I'm joined by Minister McGurk, I want to thank her for her leadership in the \\ntraining field, but also acknowledge Tania Lawrence the Member for Hasluck. And of course, the great local \\nMember for Midland, Michelle Roberts. This is an outstanding outcome for Western Australia. In 2023, 36,000 \\nWestern Australians took advantage of our Fee-Free courses, over and above the anticipated 180,000. And so \\nnow, we've got more in 24. And we're really looking forward to extending the Fee-Free TAFE courses under the \\nNational Skills Agreement. Now, my Government always fights for the best deal for Western Australians and the \\nNational Skills Agreement is an outstanding outcome for training Western Australians, not only for the jobs of today, \\nbut for the jobs of the future. It enables us to properly target our resources to those qualifications that we know are \\ngoing to be so vital for the ongoing prosperity of our economy. And it also provides us with an opportunity to target \\ncohorts that we want to see get into the courses, that are so valuable. People from disadvantaged backgrounds, \\ngender diversity in these courses. And so, this is an outstanding outcome. I was very proud to be at the National \\nCabinet meeting earlier in the week, where all the Premiers and Chief Ministers were able to sign off on the Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nNational Skills Agreement. It's a great sign of a Commonwealth Government, which is taking the lead to make sure \\nour economy has the workforce that we need to continue to prosper. This is also in addition to my Government's \\n$246 million redevelopment of our TAFE campuses, almost a quarter of a billion dollars around designing and \\nmaking sure that our TAFE campuses are fit for purpose, to continue to provide great job opportunities for those \\nskills that we'll need today, but to continue to make sure that we have the job opportunities for skills into the future. \\nSo, for instance, here at North Metropolitan TAFE, we'll be providing skills opportunities for those people looking to \\ntransition into the renewable energies future. We'll have a wind turbine here in the very near future, to provide skills \\nfor those people to be able to practice, not only working on wind turbines, but also working at height. So, you can \\nsee how these strategic investments are so important to providing people with jobs. And that's what my \\nGovernment's priority is, is to make sure that Western Australians get the jobs that they deserve. And our \\nunemployment rate figures, which were released yesterday, 3.3 per cent is an outstanding outcome for the Western \\nAustralian economy, and we want to do more. We want to continue to make sure that we provide opportunities for \\nWestern Australians to get rewarding jobs, in great industries, that are forward looking into the future. So, thank you \\nvery much to the Commonwealth Government. Congratulations to Minister McGurk for the National Skills \\nAgreement. This is a great day for Western Australian jobs and training, and very much looking forward to seeing \\nmore success in the Fee-Free TAFE courses into the future.\\nSIMONE MCGURK, WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR TRAINING: Thank you Premier and thank you \\nPrime Minister for being here, as well as Tania Lawrence and Michelle Roberts. I just wanted to acknowledge what \\nwe're able to achieve when we work in cooperation with the Federal Government and the State Government, both \\nbeing so committed in Western Australia to making sure that Western Australians are skilled to do the jobs that we \\nknow are out there and we know are coming. And this five year Skills Agreement, which will deliver $1.3 billion to \\nWestern Australia, $1.3 billion, and that would be $380 million more than we've had in previous, than previous \\nfunding arrangements with the Federal Government. But importantly, we have some certainty of funding for five \\nyears. And working together with a Commonwealth Government to understand what our priority areas are, for the \\njobs that we know are here now and the jobs that we know are coming at us. And to be here at North Metropolitan \\nTAFE here in Midland, where we're able to meet students who are taking advantage of significant Fee-Free \\ncourses, making significant savings. And as the Prime Minister said, we've met a couple of students who are \\nmature age and are coming back and taking the opportunity to upskill, but also young students who can see the \\nopportunities that are here. These are electronic students and you can tell, there's real buzz in the room. They've \\nreally taken advantage of what we're able to deliver with Fee-Free and I would just like to repeat my \\nacknowledgement of the cooperation that we're able to achieve with the Federal Government, when we work \\ntogether. And for the Federal Government, under Prime Minister Albanese and the Skills Minister Brendan \\nO'Connor, understanding that Western Australia has some real pressures and that we need to all work together to \\nput our shoulder to the wheel, to meet the skills demands that are with us today.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Simone. Happy to have questions, on this firstly. This is a really important \\nannouncement and I'm sure you have some other things you want to talk about.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Ed Husic and Anne Aly, who've accused Israel of collectively punishing \\nPalestinians? And if it's not collective punishment, what is it?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Ed Husic, Anne Aly and my entire team voted for a resolution in the Parliament and indeed Ed \\nand Anne spoke about it. That resolution was really important, it unequivocally condemned Hamas for the atrocities \\nthat it committed as a terrorist organisation, with its invasion of Israel. And with the atrocities that were committed, \\nincluding to young people who were attending a music festival, we had people kidnapped and taken from their \\nfamilies. Israel has a right to defend itself. We also acknowledged in that resolution, importantly, that the lives of \\ninnocent civilians needed to be protected. Every loss of an innocent life matters, whether they are Israeli or \\nPalestinian. And I do note the comments of President Biden today. This is what President Biden has had to say, \\n'The US remains committed to the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self determination. We mourn every \\ninnocent life lost. We can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians, who only want to live in peace.' And I \\napplaud the efforts of President Biden, to work with nations in the region to make sure that Gaza will be able to \\nhave access to food, water and medicine. President Biden went on to say, 'We cannot give up on peace and we \\ncannot give up on a two state solution.' And his comments are appropriate, I completely agree with them, and I Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nstand by, as does every Member of the Labor Party, the resolution that was adopted overwhelmingly in the \\nParliament, in the House of Representatives and the same resolution in the Senate just this week.\\nJOURNALIST: We learned just this morning that a 16 year old Aboriginal boy has become first death in custody in \\nWA in the last 50 years. The Voice was your key measure to avoid these sorts of outcomes. With that having failed, \\nwhat's next?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, firstly, can I say that this news is a terrible tragedy and I give my condolences to the family \\nand friends of this young person who has died. And there will now be, of course, a coronial inquiry and so on those \\nspecifics, it is not appropriate, therefore, to comment further. My Government is determined to Close the Gap with \\nIndigenous Australians. We answered the invitation of indigenous Australians to give constitutional recognition in \\nthe form which was requested, which was through a constitutionally enshrined Voice to Parliament. Australians did \\nnot vote for that. Our constitution is difficult to change. We're now on eight out of 45, and it is though the case that \\nIndigenous communities in remote Northern Territory, in places in the Kimberley, in Lockhart River and Palm Island \\nand the Tiwis and other communities, overwhelmingly did vote Yes in this referendum. And that will be a difficult \\ntime, it is a difficult time for Indigenous Australians. But we respect the outcome in our democracy and I have done \\nthat. What we will continue to do, we'll continue to work on Closing the Gap though. The National Skills Agreement \\nis an example, we have over $200 million of that agreement, is set aside for First Nation skills uplift. We want to \\nmake sure that there are more Indigenous apprentices, that there are more Indigenous trainees, that workforces are \\nable to benefit from skilling up Indigenous Australians. I know that many of the companies that were out there \\nsupporting the Voice, are those that have done a lot in terms of reconciliation action plans, in Indigenous \\napprenticeships, and here in Western Australia, of course, has led that quite often, and that's a good thing. But the \\nfact that we have this specific program is an indication that I believe whilst Australians did not vote in favour of the \\nreferendum, Australians do want to see the gap closed. They do want to see disadvantage dealt with, that is, in \\nIndigenous communities. And we'll continue to work in this area, but in health, in life expectancy, in community \\nservices, in all of these areas, with the programs that we have. But also consult with Indigenous communities, \\nbecause one of the things that I do know, and here in Western Australia of all places, is the case. I've been coming \\nhere for a long period of time. I've been here, I think, now 17 times as Prime Minister, that's more than one a month, \\nand it's certainly more than what I committed to, of ten visits a year. Because if you want to find out what's \\nhappening on the ground, here in Western Australia, I think West Australians understand this. They don't want \\ndecisions to just be made in Canberra. They want people to come, to talk to people on the ground, to get those \\nresults. Now, that's a principle that doesn't just apply in Indigenous affairs, it's one that applies across the board. It's \\none that my Government will continue to do, which is why I've engaged so strongly with the Premier, Roger Cook, \\nand why I engaged so strongly as well with his predecessor, Mark McGowan.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you have been coming here for a long time before you were Prime Minister and as \\nPrime Minister, as well. Did you expect such a strong No vote in this state?\\nPRIME MINISTER: People saw what polling was saying, we were determined, though. You had a call in 2017. \\nYou'll note that I was coming here in 2017, but I wasn't the Prime Minister. Nor was I the Prime Minister who \\nestablished a process, which asked Indigenous Australians to deliberate on what form constitutional recognition \\nshould take. That process, we had John Howard way back in, we had a vote on the Preamble, which had a similar \\noutcome, last century. We then had John Howard go to an election in 2007, we then had Tony Abbott and then \\nMalcolm Turnbull establish a process. That process came up with the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017. You \\nhad Ken Wyatt appointed as the Minister for Indigenous Australians and go to Garma in 2019. I was there when he \\nput forward the idea that there would be a referendum. That was the policy that Scott Morrison was elected on in \\n2019. It never happened. It never happened. I'm a Prime Minister who will promise to do things and then go and do \\nthem. I think that's how you restore faith in politics. That is something that we need to do. I launched my campaign \\nhere at the stadium and I promised on multiple occasions, that we would do this. And we gave Australians their say, \\nbut we respect the outcome that was given.\\nJOURNALIST: How concerned are you about the unlawful use of solitary confinement in our detention centre, that \\ncan see Indigenous kids held in their cell for 23 hours? Including the one -Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: I have no intention of commenting on, from Canberra, about the specifics of what occurs in \\nevery centre in Australia\\nJOURNALIST: But, if we're trying to Close the Gap\\nPRIME MINISTER: It's a question of the State. I'm not going to pretend, on a serious issue when it comes to \\nIndigenous Australians, that I am somehow an expert on every issue. That's the whole point that I'm making here, is \\nthat you need to get local engagement and local input on matters.\\nJOURNALIST: What do you make of the Opposition Leader's claims yesterday, urging you to fly to Washington via \\nTel Aviv, in the final moments of Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think that quite clearly, the conflict in the Middle East is a complex one. It's one that has \\ngone on for a considerable period of time. The responsibility for what is happening now rests firmly with Hamas and \\nthe actions that they have taken. But there are, of course, longer term issues which President Biden has indicated \\nthis morning again, has given people a reminder, that they are issues that need to be addressed. And I \\nacknowledge the suffering of Israeli, as well as Palestinian citizens, who are innocent, who just want to live a life in \\nsecurity and with justice, as the resolution carried by the Parliament said, going forward. I also acknowledge that \\nleaders have a responsibility at this time to make sure that there is, whilst there is some concern in the community \\nand hurt being felt for people who have relatives and friends in the Middle East, whether they be Israeli or \\nPalestinian, this is a very difficult time for the community. So, individuals and particularly people, I draw your \\nattention to the comments of the Director General of ASIO, Mike Burgess, who's spoken about the need to be \\nresponsible in comments and to be careful about language which is used at this time. We have a harmonious \\ncommunity here in Australia, I want to see that continue. There's no place here in Australia for anti-Semitism. \\nThere is also no place here in Australia for Islamophobia. The Leader of the Opposition chose to do that, that's a \\nmatter for him. I have scheduled a visit, that has been longstanding with President Biden, where the logistics of \\norganising that for Sunday, is when we will depart from Canberra. The leaders who have visited, and I note this, the \\nleaders who have visited are members of the P5, the Permanent Members of the Security Council. The United \\nStates has a particular role in that, as does the United Kingdom, as does the other people who have visited there. \\nAnd President Biden's visit produced outcomes of negotiating through with different states, but also was \\naccompanied by a considerable security effort for President Biden. This is not a secure area. Our priority has been \\nto engage and I've engaged, I've met personally with the Israeli Ambassador. I had him to my residence and had a \\ndiscussion. I've had discussions with leaders of the Palestinian community, leaders of the Jewish community here \\nin Australia, as well. The decision of the Leader of the Opposition to raise such an issue publicly, that's a matter for \\nhim. But at this point in time, I have no plans to visit the Middle East, and in terms of the security agencies as well, \\nthere's no disagreement from the position that I've taken.\\nJOURNALIST: From Joe Biden's speech, what are your thoughts, more specifically on these comments, that if we \\nwalk away and let Putin erase Ukraine's independence, would be aggressors, would be emboldened to try and do \\nthe same possibly in the Pacific and the Middle East more broadly?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, we're there with the people of Ukraine because the actions of Vladimir Putin, of invading, \\nillegally the sovereign state of Ukraine, is an attack on the international rule of law and on respect for national \\nboundaries and national sovereignty. That's why Australia has been a significant contributor to the struggle in \\nUkraine. And that's why we've provided support, including providing comfort and refuge for people fleeing Ukraine. \\nSimilarly, our priority hasn't been to get people into the Middle East, it's been to get people out of the Middle East. \\nAustralian citizens, is what we've been concentrating on, rather than having a whole contingent go into an area \\nwhich is clearly very volatile, to say the least. It's a state of war, is going on. The people of Ukraine are showing \\nextraordinary courage, extraordinary courage, and I support President Biden's call to continue to engage, to show \\nresolve. Australia will continue to be a part of the support for the people of Ukraine, for as long as it is required, \\nbecause this isn't just a struggle about what occurs in Ukraine.

Just so they can have half a day of daycare, they can \\nwork and get paid for it,\" she says.\\nFreddy has been attending daycare in Sydney five days a week since he was four months old. The 31-year-old \\npregnant mother of four cannot work in her tech support role while he is home.\\n\"I can\\'t take phone calls while looking after a baby. Honestly, he gets sick once every couple of weeks. [I feel] a bit \\nrotted because we still have to pay for it.\"\\nIt\\'s a common complaint heard around the nation from parents with children in daycare who get sent home sick. Jay \\nWeatherill, the former premier of South Australia, now leads early education campaign Thrive by Five and says \\nparents with young children are stuck in an impossible position.\\n\"Parents are doing it really tough right now through the spiralling cost-of-living, but it\\'s a triple whammy for parents \\nwhen their children are sick,\" he says.\\n\"Not only are they caring for a sick child, which is stressful enough on its own, they are also grappling with the out-\\nof-pocket costs for a day of childcare and the lost earnings or leave due to being unable to attend work.\"\\nMelanie Allen is a Pilates instructor and works for herself while her children Henry, 3, and Edie, 10 months, attend \\ndaycare in Adelaide.\\n\"Money-wise, it\\'s hard. And the daycare fee being so high makes it harder,\" Allen says.\\n\"I never factored in how much it would cost in daycare to have them both in. And then I was like, why? Why, when \\nschool is free? Why isn\\'t daycare subsidised to the point that it\\'s free as well?\\nPage 2 of 4\\n\\'Gastro seven times\\': How childcare hits parents with a triple whammy\\n\"What burns is paying for them not to be there, staying home, and not getting paid. So, say I make $250 in a day; I \\ndon\\'t make that money, and then I also have to pay another $170.\\n\"And then, knowing that might go through my second kid, and then also through me and then to my husband, \\nbecause if one of us is sick, the other one\\'s going to have to take off work so they can look after the kids. So it\\'s just \\na cycle, a vicious cycle.\"\\nWeatherill says the early childhood education and care workforce is in crisis because of low pay, poor conditions \\nand staff shortages as well as providers with ongoing overheads that they can\\'t turn off when a child enrolled at \\ntheir service is ill.\\n\"What all this adds up to is a system in need of complete reform. Providers need certainty, early childhood \\neducators need proper pay and conditions, parents need financial support and children need access to the \\nenormous benefits that arise from participation in high quality early learning.\"\\nGeorgie Dent, chief executive of The Parenthood, a campaign partner of Thrive by Five, says Australia needs to \\nmove to a system that is more affordable for families and closer to the school experience.\\n\"This would mean it\\'s not a system where families are spending hundreds of dollars out of pocket on a day. And so \\nit then would become less of an issue if your child was sick or not sick,\" she says.\\nShayne Kuyper and his partner enrolled their two-year-old daughter, Poppy, in daycare when she was 13 months \\nold. She had never been sick before daycare.\\n\"She hasn\\'t had a single week without coming home with something since,\" Kuyper says. \"She\\'s had gastro seven \\ntimes this year.\"\\nThey navigate Poppy\\'s sick days at their home in Melbourne by splitting the day in half.\\n\"[My partner] will take her for the morning, and I\\'ll take her for the afternoon. Which means that we\\'ve each missed \\nhalf a day of work.\\n\"It\\'s painful that you still have to pay for these sick days. And you\\'re allocated [52] days a year - beyond that, you \\nlose your government subsidy. So, if we have more absent days, we pay the full rate. It\\'s unavoidable; they\\'ll get \\nsick at daycare, but we\\'re punished for it.\"\\nNesha Hutchinson, vice-president of the Australian Childcare Alliance, says rostering staff for a position in a \\nchildcare centre means it\\'s impossible to avoid charging fees if a child is away sick.\\n\"If there are 10 children in the preschool room, or five in the toddler\\'s room, we have to pay for that staff member \\nwhether or not the child turns up,\" Hutchinson says.\\n\"If two children are sick on a day, does the staff member get paid 80 per cent of their wages because the children \\nare off?

There is a lot more to it,\" Aly said.\\n\"Obviously, any opportunity to deliver our commitments earlier than expected will be good.\\n\"So we\\'re just playing it by ear at the moment, working towards that and I don\\'t want to pre-empt any kind of \\nchanges to that.\"\\nPrevious overhauls of the subsidy system have required months of implementation time so the government and \\nchildcare centres and providers can upgrade their IT systems.\\nThe Parenthood executive director Georgie Dent said early learning was a huge cost pressure on families, \\nespecially when combined with high inflation and interest rate rises.\\n\"If it is feasible to bring it forwards, potentially to January, then that would absolutely be worthwhile,\" she said.\\nThe existing system subsidises between 85 per cent and 20 per cent of fees, depending on a family\\'s income.\\nThe highest subsidies go to families earning below about $70,000 a year. The rate steps down so families earning \\nbetween $175,000 and $254,300 receive a 50 per cent subsidy and then steps further so those earning between \\n$344,300 and $354,300 get a 20 per cent subsidy. Above this income threshold, there is no subsidy.\\nChanges that started in March increased the subsidy rate for second and subsequent children where families have \\nmore than one child under the age of 5 in care, by 30 percentage points, up to a maximum of 95 per cent.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nParents set to save hundreds on childcare fees - but not until next year\\nLabor\\'s proposal will lift the subsidy rate for all families, smooth out the taper rate so it doesn\\'t abruptly step down, \\nand gives subsidies to families earning up to $530,000. It will also keep the higher subsidies for younger siblings.\\nAly will task the Productivity Commission before year\\'s end with examining the entire sector, with an aim of a \\nuniversal subsidy of 90 per cent. She\\'ll also ask the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to design a \\nprice regulation mechanism to make sure higher subsidies don\\'t translate into higher fees.\\nWhile the Coalition attacked Labor\\'s plan for paying the fees of wealthy families, those at the top end of the income \\nscale get the lowest subsidies - about 7 per cent for a household income of $500,000.\\nAn analysis of the proposal by ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods associate professor Ben Phillips finds \\nthat while the largest benefits in dollar terms would go to parents in the top 20 per cent of incomes, that is because \\nthey get either no subsidy or a lower level under the existing scheme.\\nThose earning up to $86,000 will be an average $358 better off a year.\\nOut of the almost 1.2 million families using childcare each year, all but about 14,300 would be better off than they \\nare now.\\nDent said it was also important the government dealt with existing workforce shortages before adding extra demand \\nfor childcare.\\nShe\\'s been hearing from parents whose childcare centres are having to restrict the number of places on offer or \\neven close rooms because they can\\'t get enough staff.\\n\"The situation with the workforce is a crisis and it\\'s only increasing,\" she said.\\nAly says addressing the workforce shortage has to be a cross-portfolio effort. She doesn\\'t want to take anything off \\nthe table, including migration and improving pay and conditions.\\nBut she\\'s confident the transitional approach - with the sliding scale of subsidies first - will allow the sector to meet \\nthe increased demand.\\nCut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis from Jacqueline Maley. \\nSubscribers can sign up to our weekly Inside Politics newsletter here.\\nLoad-Date: June 12, 2022\\nEnd of Document', \"Page 1 of 2\\nBig pay increase for early childcare workers\\nBig pay increase for early childcare workers\\nThe World Today (ABC transcript)\\nAugust 8, 2024 Thursday\\nCopyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved\\nLength: 721 words\\nHighlight: Childcare workers will get a huge bump to their pay packets by Christmas, with the federal government \\nagreeing to fund a 15 per cent pay increase for workers, but it's conditional.\\nBody\\nStephanie Smail: Childcare workers have welcomed a significant pay increase, saying it will help address the staff \\nshortages that have been plaguing the sector.

Advocates say the bump in pay is also a major step forward for \\ngender equity, as Kathleen Ferguson reports.\\nAnthony Albanese: What do you think about my drawing, Ned? Do you think it's good?\\nKathleen Ferguson: The Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, has a crack at some of the crafts which help nurture \\nthe country's young.\\nAnthony Albanese: Hey, what do you reckon?\\nOpinion: That looks weird.

Can I have a look, Tom?\\nKathleen Ferguson: He visited the Sydney Early Childcare Centre after announcing a 15% pay increase for the \\nsector's workers.\\nAnthony Albanese: They deserve more than our thanks. They deserve decent wages and conditions.\\nKathleen Ferguson: Under the deal, workers will get 10% by this Christmas and a further 5% by December next \\nyear. It equates to around an extra $100 a week and will cost $3.6 billion. Karen Moran is a long-time educator.\\nKaren Moran: This decision today will change people's lives. It means that early childhood educators who've been \\nrelying on Food Bank to feed their own families won't have to do that anymore. And those that work two and three \\njobs just to make ends meet will be able to spend more time with their families.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nBig pay increase for early childcare workers\\nKathleen Ferguson: But the deal is conditional. In order to receive the pay bump, childcare centres will have to \\nlimit their fee increases to 4.4% during the next 12 months.

Georgie Dent is the \\nCEO of advocacy group The Parenthood.\\nGeorgie Dent: This is a long overdue recognition of the incredible contribution that early childhood educators make \\nto our children, to our communities, to families. It is such a fantastic achievement.\\nKathleen Ferguson: Georgie Dent says this pay increase is desperately needed to combat a worker shortage in \\nthe sector, which is mostly made up of women.\\nGeorgie Dent: The sector is overjoyed. This has been a long-realised dream. We have known that early childhood \\neducators have been chronically underpaid and undervalued. We have seen in recent years the accelerating exit of \\nearly educators from the sector, which has put incredible pressure on services.\\nKathleen Ferguson: This is an interim measure which will be in place for two years while the federal government \\nreviews the sector. The federal education minister, Jason Clare, says it will be up to childcare centres and providers \\nto sign on to the scheme. And he says if centres don't sign up, they should be prepared to lose staff to competitors.\\nJason Clare: This is a cost-of-living win-win. It's good for workers and it's good for parents.

And we'll look at the detail of this proposal that Labor's putting forward. If it can raise real wages for Australians, \\nof course we're going to support it. That's our position.\\nKathleen Ferguson: The United Workers Union says the increase sends a strong message to women. Jo \\nSchofield is the union's national president.\\nJo Schofield: Just this week, we did a survey that showed 60% of educators wanted to leave within three years. \\n97% of centres have seen educators walk out in the last year, and the single factor in that is the low pay.\\nKathleen Ferguson: She says while the union will continue advocating for better pay and conditions, this is a good \\nstart.\\nStephanie Smail: Kathleen Ferguson reporting.\\nLoad-Date: August 8, 2024\\nEnd of Document\"]}, {'name': 'Nesha Hutchinson', 'type': 'person', 'description': 'Vice-President of the Australian Childcare Alliance, representing childcare providers and advocating for their interests.', 'article_refs': [{'title': 'Unknown', 'date': 'Unknown', 'media_outlet': 'Unknown'}], 'contents': ['Page 1 of 4\\n\\'Gastro seven times\\': How childcare hits parents with a triple whammy\\n\\'Gastro seven times\\': How childcare hits parents with a triple whammy\\nThe Age (Melbourne, Australia) - Online\\nOctober 24, 2022 Monday 4:27 AM UTC\\nCopyright 2022 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

That\\'s important to consider, given that wages are the highest cost for a childcare centre. And we can\\'t \\noverbook like they do on planes, hotels or restaurants as it\\'s illegal.\"\\nHutchinson says \"educators get very sick, particularly in their first year in early education\", contributing to a high \\nstaff turnover within the first year of employment.\\nEmily Holmes, 25, is a childcare educator working in South East Melbourne. She says most of her fellow educators \\nhave used their sick leave entitlements.\\n\"We get sick quite a lot in general, but it is the same in every centre I\\'ve ever worked at,\" she says.\\nFederal Early Childhood Education Minister Anne Aly said the childcare subsidy will continue to be paid for 52 \\nabsences a year, after it was increased from 42 a year due to the pandemic.Page 3 of 4\\n\\'Gastro seven times\\': How childcare hits parents with a triple whammy\\n\"Supporting and growing the early childhood education and care workforce is critical to delivering our landmark \\ncheaper childcare reforms - which is why we have a plan to deliver a stronger and sustainable early childhood \\neducation workforce,\" she said in a statement.\\nLink to Image\\nJames Brickwood\\n\"We\\'re increasing the number of university spots, bringing forward fee-free TAFE places, changing the Fair Work \\nAct to allow multi-employer bargaining and taking action to close the gender pay gap - all of which will benefit the \\nearly childhood education sector.\"\\nThe government has committed to a Productivity Commission review into the early childhood education and care \\nsector, looking into how to improve affordability and access for families, including considering a universal 90 per \\ncent Child Care Subsidy rate.\\nElke Bremner has two sons in daycare in Sydney\\'s West Killara.

I\\'m Alicia Payne, the Federal Member for Canberra \\nand it\\'s my great pleasure this morning to be here at MOCCA in Manuka with the Prime Minister, Anthony \\nAlbanese, the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, and the Minister for Early Childhood, Anne Aly. And I want to \\nsay a huge thank you to Kara and the team here at MOCCA for welcoming us again to their beautiful centre, and to \\nthe children who we had such a lovely play with Lego this morning. I\\'m so proud that our government is a \\ngovernment that values early childhood education and care. And from 1 July this year, over one million families will \\nbenefit from our Cheaper Child Care policy. This is good for families, and you\\'ll have more young children gain \\naccess to the great benefits of early childhood education and care. And that more parents can better balance work \\nand parenting - particularly women. Because for too long the high costs of child care have put a brake on their \\neconomic participation. I know this is a huge issue for families in Canberra where we have some of the highest child \\ncare costs in the country. So I\\'m really pleased to hand over to the Prime Minister now to talk further.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Alicia. And it\\'s great to be back here at one of the \\ncentres where we came in opposition, to talk about what a difference a change of government would make in taking \\nchild care seriously and in promoting early learning. Early learning is good for young ones, it\\'s also good for \\nfamilies, it\\'s also good for our economy. Because if we support women to be able to participate fully in the \\nworkforce there will be productivity benefits. It benefits them and their family budgets, but it also benefits \\nbusinesses who employ women, because they\\'re able to have greater continuity in their career. They retire with \\nhigher savings than they would otherwise, and it changes the dynamic in our workplaces. This was the first major \\nPage 2 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\ncommitment that I gave in my first budget reply, in the days when opposition leaders had policies and that made \\nannouncements in budget replies. We campaigned for three years with this as the largest on-budget investment \\nthat we are making during this term, and it\\'s the largest on-budget investment because there is nothing that is more \\nimportant than giving the best chance in life for our youngest Australians, some of whom we\\'ve met here today. \\nLearning that social interaction that\\'s so important, as well as learning skills that will give them a good run up to \\nwhen they start school. But also it\\'s so important for our national economy. It\\'s one of the themes as well of the \\nJobs and Skills Summit, and I\\'m very pleased that we put in place the mechanisms last year, in our first term we \\ncarried the legislation for cheaper child care that will benefit 1.2 million Australian families from July 1, but we\\'re not \\nresting there. We also committed to do a Productivity Commission Inquiry into the universal provision of early \\nlearning. Just as Labor is the party of universal Medicare, of universal superannuation, we also want to be the party \\nthat delivers universal, affordable child care - very important going forward. And that\\'s why today we\\'re announcing \\nthe Productivity Commission Inquiry with Professor Deborah Brennan as the person to undertake that enquiry. \\nThere\\'s no one more qualified than Professor Brennan to undertake this work. It will be a comprehensive inquiry \\nthat will report back to the government on the next steps that we will make. I lead an orderly government. A \\ngovernment that indicates what we are going to do and then gets on and does it. Making a difference as we have in \\nour first eight months, this will make a difference and it\\'s my great pleasure to ask the Professor to make some \\ncomments.\\nPROFESSOR DEBORAH BRENNAN: Thanks, Prime Minister. I\\'m Deb Brennan, I\\'m from the University of New \\nSouth Wales and I\\'ve been around the early childhood education and care policy world for a very long time. So I\\'m \\nabsolutely thrilled to have this opportunity to participate in a co-leadership role in the Productivity Commission \\nInquiry. We\\'ve got the foundations of a fantastic early childhood learning and care system in Australia. But \\neverybody knows there\\'s work to do. We\\'ve got challenges around affordability, access, workforce, many areas, so \\nwe\\'re going to have a really good look at the sector and come up with some suggestions for advancing the system \\nso that every child in Australia gets access to high quality learning and care.\\nJASON CLARE, MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: This is really important. The first five years of your life are \\neverything. Everything you see, everything you hear, every book you read, and every person you meet shapes the \\nperson that you become. What happens in places like this shape the person you become. Early education is good \\nfor kids, it\\'s good for parents, and it\\'s good for the economy. We promised to do three things in the election; first, to \\ncut the cost of child care, and that starts on the first of July. The legislation we passed last year will cut the cost of \\nchild care for more than a million Australian families. We also promised an ACCC inquiry into the driving costs \\nbehind child care. That work is now underway and they will provide their interim report in June and their final report \\nin December. And thirdly, we promised a big and broad, far-reaching inquiry into our early education system to set \\nus up for the next decade and beyond done by the Productivity Commission. And I\\'ve got to say, I am so glad that \\nDeborah, you have agreed to do this work for us. Last night I picked up the phone and spoke to leaders in the \\nsector to tell them that Professor Deborah Brennan would be doing this work. And I\\'ve got to tell you, the response \\nwas overwhelming. If you talk to the same people I spoke to last night, you will hear the same thing. Because \\nhonestly, there is no one more experienced and no one more respected by the early education sector to do this \\nwork. Deborah, I know this has been your life\\'s work and I thank you so much for helping us to write the next \\nchapter.\\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: This Productivity Commission Review that\\'s \\ngoing to be led by Professor Brennan, who brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to this review is just one \\npart of the Albanese Government\\'s reforms in early childhood education and care. We\\'ve started that with making \\nearly childhood education and care more affordable for 1.2 million families right across Australia. As Jason \\nmentioned, and as the Prime Minister mentioned, those first five years are critical, and we have the capacity \\nthrough early childhood education and care to change the trajectory of a child\\'s life. No child born into any form of \\ndisadvantage, no matter who they are, no matter where they live, no matter what background they come from. \\nEvery single child has the capacity to grow and develop if we focus, if we get it right in those first five years. And \\nthis Productivity Commission Review led by Professor Brennan is going to be a huge part of our reforms in early \\nchildhood education and care, carrying on the Labor government\\'s legacy in this area. It was a Labor government \\nthat first introduced the National Quality Framework when we were last in government, and we will continue that Page 3 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nlegacy because we know just how important those first five years are in a child\\'s life. But also how important good \\nquality, affordable early childhood education and care are for the economy, for parents, for allowing women who are \\npredominantly primary caregivers to get out there, to work, to choose to continue their education and develop \\nthemselves if they so wish. So like Jason, and like the Prime Minister, and Alicia Payne, I\\'m really, really excited to \\nwelcome Professor Brennan to the Productivity Commission Review. Thank you.\\nPRIME MINISTER: As you can see, we\\'re very excited about Professor Brennan\\'s appointment here this morning. \\nHappy to take questions.\\nJOURNALIST: On housing affordability, there\\'s new legislation being introduced today. Obviously, that\\'s a long term \\nplan, but will there be any relief for renters in the May Budget?\\nPRIME MINISTER: We\\'ll have the May Budget in May, but we\\'re already taking significant action when it comes to \\nhousing, including the introduction of the legislation that we\\'ll have today for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \\nThat\\'s important legislation, to boost the supply of housing but particularly social and community housing. In \\naddition to that, we\\'ve said that of those 30,000 additional social housing units that will be created, 4,000 of them \\nwill be set aside for women and children escaping domestic violence. In addition to that, we have our Emergency \\nHousing Fund, a $100 million increase. In addition to that, we have our National Housing Accord with the Master \\nBuilders Association, with state and territory governments, with the private sector, working together with the private \\nsector to boost housing supply. In addition to that, we\\'re creating our Housing Supply and Affordability Council \\nagain. Working with state and territory governments, as well as local government about freeing up land, about \\ncreating more support there in the housing sector. In addition to that, there was over half a billion dollars just sitting \\nthere not being used for housing that we have tapped into to provide that support. So we have a comprehensive \\nplan when it comes to housing, you\\'ll see more roll out, in an orderly way, just like we\\'re rolling out today\\'s \\nannouncement in an orderly way.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the first Australian shipment of coal has arrived in China, do you know how many \\nmore are expected to arrive in the near future, and are you confident that the shipments can increase with Don \\nFarrell visiting in the near future as well?\\nPRIME MINISTER: What I\\'m confident of is that the dynamic between Australia and China has changed, from one \\nwhere there wasn\\'t dialogue between ministers, to one where there is. And that dialogue is always a good idea. I\\'ve \\nsaid with regards to the relationship with China, that we will cooperate where we can, we will disagree where we \\nmust, and we\\'ll engage in our national interest. And when I met with President Xi, I indicated to him publicly, but \\nalso of course, privately, that it quite clearly was in Australia\\'s interests to export more to China. China currently \\nreceives more exports by value than the next three major trading partners combined. So that relationship is \\nimportant for Australian jobs, for our national economy, but there\\'s another thing it\\'s good for too. It\\'s good for China \\nto receive those goods, because we have not just resources, but we have wine, meat, barley, seafood - the best in \\nthe world. And it is in China\\'s interest for any impediments to be removed. I\\'m very pleased that Don Farrell had a \\nconstructive meeting this week with his counterpart in China. I\\'m pleased that Penny Wong visited Beijing on \\nDecember 21st to mark the 50th anniversary of relations between Australia and the People\\'s Republic of China. \\nAnd I look forward to both of our countries going forward in a constructive, cooperative way. These reports haven\\'t \\nbeen confirmed yet. We are cautious about making announcements before they\\'re confirmed. But quite clearly, I \\nthink if Australian business and Australian industry, what they tell me, including last night with business people I\\'ve \\nmet with, is that they are very pleased with the constructive direction of the relationship.\\nJOURNALIST: Further on China, US officials say that Chinese spy balloons are part of an effort to assess the \\nmilitary capabilities around the world. Does that concern you and does this incident in the US, do you see that as a \\nsetback in the engagement that was seen between Washington and Beijing and Canada?\\nPRIME MINISTER: We support the sovereignty of nations, including the United States, our great friends in the \\nUnited States. We consider all of the matters relating to national security and respond in an appropriate way and \\nwill continue to do so.Page 4 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nJOURNALIST: Disability workers and age care workers got big pay rises recently. The Childcare Workers Union \\nhas called for a 25% pay rise. We know pay is a huge factor in this industry. Would you back a pay rise like that for \\nchild care workers?\\nPRIME MINISTER: The government doesn\\'t determine the level of wages for everybody in the sector.\\nJOURNALIST: But do you support their push?\\nPRIME MINISTER: What I support is people being paid fairly, and I won\\'t comment on specifics because that\\'s the \\njob of the Fair Work Commission to consider these matters independently of government and come to decisions. \\nWhat I would say though, and what I\\'ve said publicly a number of times, including yesterday at the UN International \\nWomen\\'s Day event that was held yesterday morning, is that if you look at the sectors where people are underpaid, \\nthey have something in common, two things: One, they are the very sectors that got us through the pandemic. Our \\ncleaners, our aged care workers, our childcare workers. There\\'s something else they\\'ve got in common as well. \\nThey are largely feminised industries, and that\\'s why, when we made changes to industrial regulations, I announced \\nat our campaign launch in Perth last year that we would very specially have measures that allowed the gender pay \\ngap to be considered. We had legislation yesterday as well about transparency, so that the gender pay gap can be \\nidentified for larger companies as well. So I will conclude with this by saying, early learning educators do a fantastic \\njob. They\\'re valued by parents, they\\'re valued by children who grow to love them and have a relationship with them. \\nThis isn\\'t just a normal job, as much as I love all the journalists here, our relationship is different. Between the \\neducators and the children who they look after. And I have every respect for the educators and the work that they \\ndo.\\nJOURNALIST: One on the Referendum Machinery Act please if I could. Yesterday, Katy Gallagher said that you \\nwould go ahead with the information pamphlet. In December, Don Farrell and Mark Dreyfus said \"there\\'s no longer \\nany need for taxpayers to pay for a pamphlet to be sent to every household. The Referendum Act does not reflect \\nmodern delivery and communications methods.\" Do you still agree with that? Has your view changed or is this \\nbringing back the pamphlet a concession to just get it through the Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Both things are right. The truth is, I don\\'t know about you Josh, when was the last letter you \\nsent?\\nJOURNALIST: I think it was around Christmas.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Apart from Christmas Cards, when was the last letter you sent?\\nJOURNALIST: You\\'re testing my memory, it\\'s not my press conference.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Has anyone here sent a letter this year?\\nJOURNALIST: Last week, to the US Consulate.\\nPRIME MINISTER: That\\'s not a letter, that\\'s an application. The world has changed how we communicate. But I \\ncould have said, we will engage constructively. One of the Senators approached, we made this decision a week \\nago, one of the Senators approached and said, this will make a big difference for our approach. I don\\'t know how \\nmany times I can say this at press conferences, we will do what we need to do to broaden support for this. The \\nreferendum that will be held later this year is about two things, recognition and consultation. Recognising Aboriginal \\nand Torres Strait Islander People in our Constitution and consulting them on matters that affect them, that\\'s what it\\'s \\nabout. Now we want to maximise support for that. So if anyone has, as I said, I await any member of the House of \\nRepresentatives or the Senate to examine the question and the draft changes that I put forward at Garma last year. \\nNow, I\\'ll give you the exclusive, just for you, so if everyone else can not listen, if there\\'s a constructive suggestion, \\nthat\\'s backed in by lawyers, we\\'ll change that. If there\\'s a suggestion, there hasn\\'t been one, there hasn\\'t been one. \\nI want this to succeed. I\\'m not being dogmatic about this. This is not our proposal, this is a proposal that came from \\nthe bottom up. And you need to think of the counterfactual of what happens if this referendum succeeds. If this \\nreferendum succeeds, Indigenous Australians will be shown the respect that they deserve. Australians will all know Page 5 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nthat we\\'ve acknowledged the great privilege that we have of sharing this continent with the oldest continuous \\nculture on earth. And the world will see that Australia\\'s a mature country, a mature country that can be honest \\nabout our history and can celebrate that history. That\\'s what this is about. It\\'s not about party politics. And that\\'s \\nwhat every state Premier and Chief Minister understands. And I just say to my colleagues on the Hill, this isn\\'t the \\nopportunity to look for division. This is the opportunity to look for national unity, to embrace the opportunity which is \\nthere. So, if someone has a suggestion, by all means put it forward. I\\'m up for it, in terms of, whether a pamphlet \\ngoes out, it doesn\\'t hurt, a pamphlet going out. People are going to put things in letterboxes anyway during the \\nreferendum. If people want taxpayers to pay for it, there\\'s a judgement call there, fine. Taxpayers shouldn\\'t be \\nfunding the campaigns of Yes and No. That should be up to people to fund. There should be equal funding and \\nthere will be under the under the proposal that we have. I also welcome Simon Birmingham\\'s comments this \\nmorning. Simon Birmingham has said very clearly that there shouldn\\'t be funding of the Yes and No case. I \\nwelcome the comments of Simon Birmingham. I welcome anyone who wants to join this journey on the path to \\nreconciliation.\\nJOURNALIST: There are strong indications that Vladimir Putin signed off on the supply of weapons used to shoot \\ndown MH17. If you could look at him in the eye today, what would you say to Vladimir Putin?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I\\'d say that you are reprehensible. That Vladimir Putin, clearly, the shooting down of MH17 was \\nan act of terrorism that had an impact here in Australia, but on many countries as well. And we will continue to \\npursue these issues with every avenue at our disposal.\\nJOURNALIST: So how do you feel about the suspension of the criminal investigation into the downing of MH17?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I think I just answered how I feel about it. The issue, of course, of the Russian invasion of \\nUkraine, this is a guy who runs an authoritarian regime that doesn\\'t care about human rights, that doesn\\'t care \\nabout devastation of communities, whether it be in Ukraine, whether it be the oppression of its own citizens, or \\nwhether the acts outside of Russia of which we\\'ve seen a number. The travesty of MH17 is an issue in which he \\nshould be held to account and Australia will continue to pursue all of these issues with every avenue at our \\ndisposal.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, this morning the Deputy PM has indicated he wants to get rid of Chinese linked \\nsurveillance cameras from government buildings. We spoke about the relationship with China earlier, the last time \\nthe Australian government tried to ban or exclude a Chinese company from communications in any form in \\nAustralia, it was detrimental to our relationship with China. Are you concerned about how Beijing will react to the \\nremoval of those devices?\\nPRIME MINISTER: No, we act in accordance with Australia\\'s national interest. We do so transparently and that\\'s \\nwhat we\\'ll continue to do. Thanks very much.\\nLoad-Date: February 9, 2023\\nEnd of Document', 'Page 1 of 2\\n\\'This is not a secure area\\': Prime Minister has no plans to visit Israel despite unrest\\n\\'This is not a secure area\\': Prime Minister has no plans to visit Israel despite \\nunrest\\nCanberra Times (Australia)\\nOctober 21, 2023 Saturday\\nPrint & Internet Editions\\nCopyright 2023 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

I \\nthink that anyone, any state or any group that commits war crimes, should be investigated and should be held \\naccountable.”\\nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has recognised Israel’s right to defend itself but also urged the Netanyahu \\ngovernment to “ operate by the rules of war  ” amid increasing expectations of an imminent ground operation in \\nGaza.\\nOn Monday, Hill told parliament that Israel’s right to defend itself did not extend to the “indiscriminate mass killing of \\ninnocent Palestinians”.\\nHill said he had heard an “overwhelming message” from his community “that the mass punishment of 2 million \\npeople in Gaza is not a proportionate response and this is a trap that Israel must not fall into – it is what Hamas is \\ntrying to provoke”.\\nPayman told the Senate that Australia “must condemn” civilian deaths as “Israeli missiles strike residential \\ndwellings, civilians, multi-story apartments, health facilities as well as places of worship, indiscriminately killing men, \\nwomen and children”.\\n“The price tag of Israel’s right to defend itself cannot be the destruction of Palestine. Israel’s right to defend its \\ncivilians cannot equate to the annihilation of Palestinian civilians.”\\nOn Thursday, the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, said she was “not going to get into” who was responsible  for \\nthe Al-Ahli Arab hospital strike because it was an “unfolding” situation.\\n“What we do know about this is that hundreds of innocent people, who were at a hospital evidently already \\nincredibly unwell and vulnerable, have lost their lives,” she said.\\n“his was set off by these violent and inhumane, barbaric attacks by Hamas.”\\n“What we now see is loss of innocent lives, of men, women and children in Gaza, and I want Australians to know \\nthat, for any innocent loss of life, we stand with Australian communities who experience this pain very deeply, \\nwhether they are Jewish Australians who are mourning the loss of life in the Middle East, or whether they are \\nPalestinian or Muslim Australians who are mourning the loss there.”Page 3 of 3\\nAustralian ministers say Palestinians are being ‘collectively punished’ for Hamas barbarism\\nLoad-Date: October 19, 2023\\nEnd of Document', 'Page 1 of 3\\nOur new government\\'s force for change\\nOur new government\\'s force for change\\nThe Australian Online\\nAugust 21, 2022 Sunday 9:00 PM AEDT\\nCopyright 2022 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\\nLength: 1374 words\\nByline: Jenna Clarke\\nBody\\nIn fashion history, a red and purple outfit has only been pulled out to send some poignant, albeit pointed, \\nmessages. Princess Diana donned a red blazer and purple skirt when she sat alone outside the Taj Mahal in 1992 \\nas her marriage crumbled. Her daughter-in-law, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, recreated the look for one of her final \\nofficial duties as a working royal in 2019. And in 2022, clutching a pink Qur\\'an, Anne Aly wore a red Acler skirt and \\npurple blouse to Government House where she was sworn in as Australia\\'s first Muslim female minister.\\nAly\\'s appointment comes on the heels of a significant changing of the guard in Australian politics. For the first time \\nin our political history, there will be a record number of Carla Zampatti dresses, as opposed to the once prevalent \\nMJ Bale suits, in both houses of parliament. The federal election was a win, not just for the Greens and the teal \\nwave, but also for a new world order of sorts.\\nThere is a new guard looming. One that is all about difference, diversity and diverging from a place of \"that\\'s just the \\nway it is\" to a new chapter in Canberra that champions equality. Climate change was front of mind for many voters, \\nwho backed independents including Allegra Spender - daughter of the late Zampatti - in the seat of Wentworth and \\nKate Chaney in Curtin, to speak up for the environment. \\nThis is in keeping with what ANU climate scientist Joëlle Gergis so aptly sums up in her new book, Humanity\\'s \\nMoment: A Climate Scientist\\'s Case for Hope, on sale this month: \"What an extraordinary time to be alive; we are \\npart of the generation that will help heal the world.\" The age of societal sustainability is upon us.\\nThe 47th parliament will be one of the most representative we\\'ve had, thanks to a new government and a collection \\nof MPs who accurately represent modern Australia. A record number of women will take their seats in the House of \\nRepresentatives. Many are not aligned to the traditional parties and make up the super-sized crossbench. Women \\ncount for 51 per cent of the Australian population and now comprise 38 per cent of the chamber in the new \\nparliament - the highest ever proportion on record - after 58 women were elected to the lower house, including 19 \\ndebutante MPs. The Senate reached and exceeded 50 per cent gender parity in the last parliament, and maintains \\nthis in the new parliament.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nOur new government\\'s force for change\\nWe\\'ve come a long way since Edith Cowan, our first female politician, was elected to the Western Australian \\nparliament in 1921. Her colleagues were so opposed to her being there, she had to make several attempts at \\npresenting her first speech, because the men kept interjecting as she spoke of wanting equal access to education \\nfor young Australian women.\\nStill, in 2003, the then newly minted cabinet minister Julie Bishop was infamously told how to dress by her male \\npeers. \"When I was first appointed to the ministry, I was asked to be the Minister for Ageing. And one of the prime \\nminister\\'s senior advisors rang me and said \\'Julie, take this the right way, but forget the Armani suits and forget the \\ncorporate look. You\\'re the minister for the ageing, you\\'re going into aged- care homes, you\\'ve got to dress \\nappropriately,\" Bishop has shared. \"I said \\'What? You mean like cardigans?\\' And he said, \\'Yeah more prints, more \\ncolour. Just not corporate.\\'\"\\nNot too long after this sermon from a \"faceless man\", Bishop went on to become Minister for Foreign Affairs and a \\nthree-time deputy leader of the Liberal party. And she did it all in good shoes and some of the best of Australian \\nfashion, including Rachel Gilbert, Rebecca Vallance and Dion Lee, and coined the phrase \"fashion diplomacy\" by \\nexclusively wearing homegrown Australian labels when on official visits.\\nHer work, putting fashion on the agenda, also helped put the wheels in motion for the Australian Fashion Council to \\nsecure a federal grant to establish an Australian Fashion trademark in 2021. The world-first campaign hopes to \\npromote the industry and create more local jobs. \"The Australian Fashion trademark will be a driving force in \\nbuilding the industry\\'s growth trajectory to deliver substantial economic, social and environmental gains over the \\nnext 10 years,\" CEO of Australian Fashion Council Leila Naja Hibri said in a statement. \\n\"We can show the world how prioritising people and the planet together with profit can lead to a legacy of thriving \\nprosperity.\"\\nWe\\'ve also come a long way since the ministerial wing was trodden, pretty much exclusively, by men in R.M. \\nWilliams boots in the first part of this century. R.M. Williams was, during those days, owned by luxury conglomerate \\nLVMH. But in 2020 the brand was brought home when it was acquired by Perth billionaire Andrew \\'Twiggy\\' Forrest \\nand his wife Nicola. \\nSince Australia\\'s richest man has taken over the bootmaker, vegan materials have been introduced and demand is \\nskyrocketing. And Prime Minister Anthony Albanese seems keen to tread new paths. One that is more female-\\nfocused, family-friendly and awake to the Australia we want to become.\\nNow, almost 10 per cent of the Senate identifies as Indigenous after the record number of Aboriginal and Torres \\nStrait Islander representatives elected, including four new Indigenous MPs, three of whom are women. Indigenous \\nAffairs Minister Linda Burney was bestowed her new job on election night. Burney, a proud Wiradjuri woman, knows \\nthe power that culture, and more specifically fashion, can have in politics. Since serving in federal politics from \\n2016, she has regularly been spotted on the shadow front bench in the odd Albus Lumen piece and Anna Quan \\nskirt.\\nAnother fashion force has also joined the Albanese government\\'s inner sanctum. The aforementioned Anne Aly, \\nMinister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth is as passionate about her portfolio as she is about \\nfashion, the statements style can make and where that style is made.\\nDr Aly is Australia\\'s first Muslim woman elected to parliament and is also the first Muslim woman MP who will sit in \\nthe outer ministry. Serendipitously, she represents the seat of Cowan - named after Edith Cowan - in Perth\\'s outer \\nsuburbs. Born in Egypt, Aly\\'s family moved to Sydney\\'s southwest when she was two. She is a survivor of domestic \\nviolence and an academic specialising in counter terrorism. She\\'s still considered a global authority into why \\nchildren are lured into extremism. She also achieved all this after spending her 20s working for the minimum wage \\nas a single mother of two boys.\\nAly has a deep love and appreciation of fashion and since being elected in 2016 has regularly worn local labels that \\nhave a strong sustainable ethos including KitX and Flannel to parliament and official functions. In 2017 she made Page 3 of 3\\nOur new government\\'s force for change\\nher catwalk debut for then 23-year-old designer Thomas Puttick, a designer who was showing sustainable clothes \\nbefore it went mainstream and cast \\'muses\\' such as Aly instead of models for his runway show.\\n\"It\\'s in my nature to disrupt because it is more often the case that I just end up being somewhere where I am not \\nexpected to be - like parliament or the catwalk of Australian Fashion Week,\" Dr Aly tells Vogue. Fashion is in her \\nblood. \"My dad studied textiles engineering. But when my family migrated to Australia, he couldn\\'t find work in his \\nfield so he drove buses,\" Aly shares. \"A story typical of so many who choose to make Australia home. Dad would \\nspend hours at the sewing machine making our school uniforms. He never lost his passion for design. My mum tells \\nme I\\'ve inherited his passion.\"\\nShe says that it was only after she was first elected that she realised what her career and success represented \\nwhen a constituent in Perth said she had told her young daughter that Dr Aly\\'s victory was proof girls, Muslim girls \\nespecially, in Australia could achieve anything. \\n\"The significance of it to other people, to the people watching really struck me at that point,\" she continues. \"I made \\na very conscious decision that, coming in here, I would do everything I could to not just open the door but break \\ndown the wall.

She managed to turf out \\nthe Liberal incumbent Luke Simpkins by the finest of margins. \"It took 10 days to count the vote,\" she says.\\nIn 2019, she increased her margin and by 2022 she harnessed 46.9 per cent of the vote, adding more than 9 per \\ncent to her 2019 numbers.\\nOf that first campaign, she remembers standing at a train station with a picture of herself while waving at cars. A \\nyear ago to the day, she had been invited to speak at the White House at a counterterrorism conference. \"All I could \\nthink was from the White House to Greenwood station.

Aly joined Ed Husic last month to warn Gaza\\'s 2.3 million \\nresidents were being \"collectively punished\" for the crimes of terrorists.\\nAs the Israel-Hamas war becomes more divisive, Aly says she is trying to demonstrate how \"important it is that we \\nrecognise each other\\'s humanity and show compassion to each other, even when we are hurting the most\".\\nAs the minister for early childhood education, and also the minister for youth, Aly has a lot on her plate as she \\nmarshals through two reviews of the childcare and early learning sectors.\\nThe government is moving, slowly, towards adopting a model of universal access. In July, it increased the \\nmaximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning up to $80,000, and a sliding scale in subsidies for families \\nearning less than $530,000.\\n\"The fact is Australia is one of the most expensive places for early childhood education and care,\" says Aly.\\n\"We have a quality system that is world-class, and a quality framework that has been in place for 10 years. The \\nissue is the cost and the fact that the market isn\\'t behaving the way you would expect. It doesn\\'t go to where the \\ndemand is, it goes to where the money is.\"\\nThe delivery of the Productivity Commission report this week and the Australian Competition and Consumer \\nCommission\\'s investigation will ensure childcare remains one of the hot button issues for the Albanese government \\nin coming months.Page 3 of 4\\n\\'I\\'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS\\' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN\\nAly will be familiar to most people, even if they haven\\'t connected the name to the face. She is the petite dark-\\nhaired, dark-eyed woman in colourful clothing who sits behind Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during question \\ntime. Aly is an active listener. She nods. She laughs. She scowls and boos. She never drifts off or checks her \\nphone.\\nAlways impeccably well-dressed, Aly\\'s choice of clothing has taken a twist in the past couple of years as she took \\nup crochet and knitting as a form of meditation and mindfulness as she takes endless flights between Canberra and \\nPerth.\\nThe white jumper she wears to lunch is handcrafted (and has a matching skirt), as was the crochet long dress she \\nwore to this year\\'s Mid-Winter Ball.

The marriage wasn\\'t arranged, as was common for girls like her. Rather, it was a way of escaping \\nthe strictures of being a single woman in a Muslim country.\\n\"The marriage gave me a freedom that I didn\\'t have living under my parents\\' roof. It gave me the freedom to be a \\nrespectable married woman in Egypt. It meant I could go camping with friends, I could go to parties, I could come \\nhome when I wanted to.\"\\nThere were red flags which she ignored - or didn\\'t know any better.\\nBut after moving to Perth, the violence and contemptuous behaviour escalated.\\n\"There was a bit of martyrdom on my behalf. But there are a lot of stereotypes around women who are survivors, a \\nlot of us are high achievers. The feelings of responsibility and humiliation; we expect more of ourselves,\" she says.\\n\"I remember driving away once and saying out loud to myself: \\'You must be just the kind of woman that men hit.\\' I\\'d \\nresigned myself to it.\\n\"I describe domestic violence as this crack in a bone somewhere in your body that you carry with you through your \\nlife.\\n\"It\\'s hard to imagine myself as the person I was.

It also got her invited to Oxford University and the White House to speak.\\nHer political spark was ignited after the rise of anti-Muslim sentiment across the world, witnessing one-too-many \\ninstances of casual racism in suburban Perth, and becoming a target of death threats because of her profile as a \\nresearcher in anti-terrorism.Page 4 of 4\\n\\'I\\'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS\\' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN\\nThe university moved her team to unidentified offices twice during the course of a year with strict instruction not to \\nreveal the location.\\nI have set aside 90 minutes for lunch, but after an hour a staffer taps Aly on the shoulder and says we have five \\nminutes to wrap it up.\\nHeavens, we haven\\'t even got on to husband number two, or heaven forbid Dave Allen, who is husband number \\nthree.

I'm Mary Doyle, I'm the Labor Candidate for \\nthe Aston by-election. It's really exciting to be here at Swinburne TAFE with the Prime Minister and Ministers \\nO'Connor and Aly. And thanks to everyone including the wonderful students for showing us around this morning. \\nTAFE is something I'm hugely passionate about, having been a TAFE student myself many years ago. And I can \\ntell you, when I talk to people about the Albanese Government's plans for fee-free TAFE in critical sectors, they \\noverwhelmingly tell me it's a great idea. This is a Government that I want to be a part of. One that looks at the \\npressures facing families in the outer-eastern suburbs and then goes about making a practical difference to address \\nthose challenges. Whether it's cheaper child care, which will benefit 5,700 families here in Aston. Whether it's \\ncheaper medicines, already saving Aston locals more than $250,000 since that came in. Whether it's fee-free TAFE \\nfor 55,000 Victorians. I want to be a part of the team that delivers for the outer-east. If I'm elected to be part of the \\nAlbanese Government as the next Member for Aston, I promise you this I will always fight for TAFE, I will always \\nfight for cheaper child care, and I will always fight for locals. And I'm thrilled to welcome the PM back to Wantirna.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Well, thanks very much, Mary. And I do want to thank the staff and the \\nstudents at Swinburne TAFE here for the very warm welcome that I've received here this morning, along with my \\nMinister for Skills and Training, Brendan O'Connor, and my Minister who looks after Early Childhood Learning, \\nAnne Aly. We're here to talk to students. We're here also to hear firsthand from them the difference that fee-free \\nTAFE is making to their lives. We, arising out of the Jobs and Skills Summit last year, and a commitment we made \\nat the election to 180,000 fee-free TAFE places are happening right now. And what we heard from this morning is \\nstudents who not only are benefiting from that fee-free TAFE, but they're also working and earning an income while \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nthat is happening. We've learned from them firsthand that this was part of the incentive for them to enter an area \\nwhich has skill shortages. So, it's good for students, but it's good for the economy as well. And it's good for this \\nregion, because we also heard that the early learning centres which they are partaking in now, in terms of their work \\nexperience, are all local. And Mary Doyle understands that. That's why I want Mary Doyle, next Saturday, to \\nbecome the Member for Aston. Because this community needs a voice in government. A Labor Government. A \\nLabor Government that cares about people in the outer suburbs. A Labor Government that's committed to making a \\ndifference with fee-free TAFE, to making a difference with the cheaper pharmaceuticals, but making a difference as \\nwell in child care costs for families. One of the things that is happening here from the students we spoke to, not only \\nare they benefiting from free-free TAFE, they're benefiting from working, because there are skills shortages, but \\nthey're also having the bonus of our cheaper child care plan, that comes in on July 1, will mean that more women in \\nparticular can join the workforce. This isn't a welfare policy. This is a productivity enhancing economic policy. This is \\nabout improving women's workforce participation, it's about boosting productivity and also about boosting the \\npopulation. The three Ps of economic growth are all ticked by this policy. Mary Doyle understands this. She hasn't \\nshopped around for a seat. Mary Doyle ran for this seat last year, and she's been committed to her community, \\nwhere she has lived for a long period of time, here in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. And that's why I want \\nsomeone who actually understands this community, who's committed to this community, and who will represent this \\ncommunity in the by-election on April 1. People do have an opportunity to send a message to the Opposition that \\nthey need to do better than have Peter Dutton as their Leader. Peter Dutton, who has spent year after year in \\ngovernment deriding Victorians, condemning the sacrifices that they were making during the pandemic, and \\nsomeone who said that people weren't safe to go out in Melbourne. Like, he just doesn't get this city and he doesn't \\nget this state of Victoria. Mary Doyle does. She'll be a fantastic representative, and I look forward to her joining our \\nteam after April 1 and having input into the Budget that we'll be putting together in May, which will take further \\npressure off working families in communities like this. I'll get Brendan to say something, Anne, and then we're \\nhappy to take questions.\\nBRENDAN O'CONNOR, MINISTER FOR SKILLS AND TRAINING: Thanks, Prime Minister. It's great to be with the \\nPrime Minister and, of course, with Mary and Anne, here today at this fantastic dual sector provider at Swinburne. \\nIt's fair to say that when we were elected, we comprehended the challenge we had in supplying the skills to the \\nlabour market. There were skill shortages across the economy. Wherever you looked, whatever professional trade, \\nthere were shortages. It was for that reason the Prime Minister convened the Jobs and Skills Summit, bringing \\ntogether industry, bringing together state and territory governments, and finding solutions to the problems that we \\ninherited. And I'm happy to say that the 180,000 fee-free TAFE places decision that was made at that summit was \\nan absolutely critical part of the response by the Albanese Government to the skill shortages. And we're seeing it \\nhere today, as a result of that decision and as a result of decisions by the Albanese Government with eight separate \\ngovernments, eight state and territory governments, to have agreements in each jurisdiction, we can focus on the \\neconomies of each state and territory. And that's what we've done. 55,000 fee-free places in Victoria, and then a \\nlarge proportion of those, for example, in early childhood education, where there's a massive demand. 40 per cent \\nof the advertisements for those jobs are in Victoria. That's why we've dedicated 3,800 places to this state, and that's \\nwhy the students we've met today are able to enrol in those courses, knowing that they can afford it, knowing that \\nthey can cope with the cost of living pressures because the courses are fee-free, which also means, because \\nenrolments are going up, the supply of skilled workers to this really critical sector of our economy, looking after and \\nteaching our children, preschool children is absolutely vital, we'll be able to provide that pipeline. So, as a result of \\nthose agreements with state and territory governments, the fee-free component, which is ensuring that enrolments \\nare increasing, we are responding to the skill shortages across the economy, not just in that area, but today we are \\nfocussing on that area. And I believe that, certainly in talking with Mary, she fully understands the pressure that \\nparents are under in terms of costs, the pressure that students are under, and that's why we're providing fee-free \\nplaces and understands, too, that we need to be ensuring that we can supply the skilled workforce to an economy \\nthat is certainly in need of such a supply. It's because of these decisions we are seeing the benefits that are \\nhappening. And that's why in talking to the students today, it was quite obvious that it was a lot easier for them to \\nenter into these courses, acquire these much needed skills, because of the announcement and the decision of the \\nAlbanese Government, working with state and territory governments, providing fee-free options for them.Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: Thanks, Brendan. It's great to be here this \\nmorning, of course, with the Prime Minister, with Brendan O'Connor, and our wonderful candidate for Aston, Mary \\nDoyle. Mary is a local and she gets it. She gets what families here are going through and she understands the \\nimportance of early childhood education and care. And, in fact, Mary was saying that her own daughter went locally \\nhere, accessed early childhood education and care locally here, and still recognises her early childhood education \\nteacher at the shopping centre. That's because she's a local. She knows this area, and she understands and values \\nearly childhood education and care. Now, in just under 100 days, families right across Australia are going to reap \\nthe benefits of our reforms that are making early childhood education and care more affordable. And we know that \\nin order for that to be successful, we need a sustainable workforce. That is why the fee-free TAFE that the \\nAlbanese Labor Government has introduced is so important. And today, we had the pleasure of meeting students \\nlike Tiana and Connor who are using that fee-free TAFE. They are saving thousands of dollars and they are the \\nfuture workforce of early childhood education and care, but they're also the current workforce of early childhood \\neducation and care. Because, as the Prime Minister said, they are working as they are getting their degree in areas \\nof skill shortages. We know that our early childhood education and care reforms that make it much more affordable \\nfor families right across Australia are important, but we're also getting on with the job of ensuring that we have that \\nsustainable workforce. And I'm proud to be a part of a Labor Government, I look forward to welcoming Mary Doyle \\nas a Member for Aston after the election next week. I know she will make an extremely valuable contribution to the \\nLabor Caucus. And I look forward to seeing more students like Tiana and Connor taking advantage of that fee-free \\nTAFE, graduating with an Early Childhood Education and Care Certificate, and becoming part of our valuable \\nworkforce in early childhood education and care.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there's a lot of mortgage stress in the Aston area, what can your Government do to \\nalleviate some of that?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, what we're doing is having a comprehensive housing policy. There is legislation before the \\nParliament, before the Senate next week, the Housing Australia Future Fund. That has a number of components to \\nit. One is an increased investment in social and community housing, which will create 30,000 additional units over \\nthe next five years. But it also has within it as well, additional funding for emergency housing, some $100 million, \\nand it has, as part of that as well, funding specifically for veterans housing, as well as for women and children \\nescaping family and domestic violence. That's one element. The other thing we're doing is a housing accord, \\nworking with the private sector, with organisations like the Master Builders and the Housing Industry Association \\nand others, having an accord with state and territory governments to increase the supply of housing. Prices, of \\ncourse, are a product of demand and supply. So, what we want to do is to increase the supply of housing. We also \\nhave our Housing Supply and Affordability Council is part of the legislation for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \\nWhat that's aimed at doing is working with each level of government to make sure that approvals and land release \\nand those issues are dealt with in our outer suburbs in a way that assists people. We recognise that people are \\ndoing it tough. We are taking action on that. That's the other reason why we're making sure that we put downward \\npressure on inflation. The Reserve Bank Governor, in the statement that he made at the beginning of this month, \\nhas said that he hoped that inflation had peaked in the December quarter. Of course, the highest inflation rate \\ngrowth of any quarter this century was the March 2022 quarter last year. So, the last full quarter in which the \\nCoalition were in office was the highest inflation of any quarter in Australia this century. And that's why, as well, we \\nwill produce a responsible Budget. That's why we returned 99 per cent of the revenue gains to the Budget in \\nOctober last year. So there's no easy fix here. But we want to work with the Andrews Government to make sure that \\nwe deal with the housing stress, which is a national phenomenon. That's why we're working with all state and \\nterritory governments and the private sector. And that's why I'd urge the Senate next week to pass this legislation \\nthat will make a difference.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you expect the Premier to join you on the campaign trail in the last week here in Aston?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I'll be in Parliament next week.\\nJOURNALIST: Over the weekend maybe?Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well I won't be here over the weekend. There's a couple of elections on, this by-election. This \\nafternoon I'll be in Penrith, so a bit of notice for the media, I'll be in Penrith and I'll be in Riverstone this afternoon \\nand I'll be in a range of seats tomorrow in my home state of New South Wales, as you would expect.\\nJOURNALIST: Are you confident Chris Minns will get the job done?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Chris Minns, I think, will make an outstanding Premier of New South Wales. That's a decision \\nfor the people of New South Wales. I think, can I say this? I think that Dominic Perrottet and Chris Minns are both \\nvery good people. They're good human beings. I have a good relationship with both of them and I like both of them. \\nThe problem is that Dominic Perrottet's Government is a shambles. The Liberals are too busy fighting each other \\nand fighting the Nationals, and the Nationals fighting each other, to fight for the people of New South Wales. And \\nthat's why Chris Minns deserves and his team deserves to be elected to government tomorrow. I'll work with \\nwhoever is elected it, as I do constructively. I've had liaison with Premier Rockliff this morning. My Government \\nactually works for solutions. We look for unity. We don't look for division. The problem with the modern Liberal Party \\nis that it is so divided on itself. On itself. I mean, they can't make a decision on constitutional recognition for \\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in 2023. If they oppose it, they've got to say. When will that occur? How \\nlong? Is 122 years not long enough to wait to recognise that our history didn't begin in 1788? The Victorian Liberal \\nParty here are a shambles. We've seen them fighting each other. And the Caucus can't make a decision in \\nCanberra, in Peter Dutton. That's why we need to send a message to them that they need to do better. They need \\nto get their act together. That's why Mary Doyle deserves to be elected as the Member for Aston. If she joins our \\nCaucus, she'll join a united, coherent team. A united, coherent team that has plans for our economic growth, that \\nhas plans for social equity, that has plans for gender equality, that has plans for dealing with the challenge of \\nclimate change, that supports multiculturalism, that doesn't have to think about these things because it's in our core. \\nIt's our instinct. And that is what Mary Doyle, that's the team that she will join if she's elected.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Linda Burney that Peter Dutton is just looking for excuses to reject the Voice? \\nAnd secondly, will you release the Solicitor-General's advice on the wording?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well the two things are connected, because Peter Dutton knows that he sat in a Cabinet for \\nnine years and didn't release any advice to the Cabinet. It's not the way it works. And he knows that. He knows that. \\nSo what we saw from Peter Dutton, over a long period of time, was first in the lead-up to my speech at Garma, he \\nsaid, 'We don't know what the question is.' So, I released draft words. We received not a suggestion in between \\nJuly last year and yesterday when I released what will be in the legislation to go to Parliament next week. Not one \\nsuggestion from him or Julian Leeser, the Shadow Attorney-General, of any change. Not a word. And Julian Leeser, \\nwe know, has been involved with the wording since a decade ago. A decade ago. He was one of the people who \\nwere involved in that process, as Noel Pearson outlined in The Australian some weeks ago. So, Peter Dutton needs \\nto get real about this. This isn't about him, and it's not about me. This is about whether we are a better country \\ngoing forward. It's whether we can recognise Indigenous Australians in our nation's birth certificate. And then it's \\nonly about one other thing, which is will we get better outcomes if we consult the people who are impacted by those \\ndecisions? That's what this is about. It's a simple proposition before the Australian people, and I'm confident that \\nthe Australian people will vote yes. And the idea whenever any detail is given, and yesterday we released eight of \\nthe principles that will go towards the legislation in shaping the Voice. And the Voice can't be clearer, the words that \\nwill go forward include, the third point, 'The Parliament shall, subject to this constitution, have power to make laws \\nwith respect to matters relating to', which is a legal term, 'Relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, \\nincluding its composition, functions, powers and procedures'. Peter Dutton will be a part of the Parliament and \\nfuture members will be a part of future Parliaments, that will determine the function of the Voice. And he knows that \\nthat's the case. And we know from the Republic playbook that occurred last century, that it is nothing more than a \\ntactic, and it lacks genuineness to just continue to say 'We don't have the detail'. No matter how much detail is put \\nout, Peter Dutton will say, 'What about more detail?' That's the game that's being played here. And he should make \\na decision of where he stands on this issue, because this is an issue that isn't the creation of a Labor Government. \\nThis has arisen from the bottom up. And yesterday I had Ken Wyatt, who flew overnight to Canberra, the \\nIndigenous Affairs Minister in the Morrison Government, to stand next to me and with his fellow Aboriginal and \\nTorres Strait Islander people who've been a part of the Referendum Working Group, who've come to a unanimous \\nposition. And I'd say that this should be above politics as the 1967 referendum was.Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what economic benefits do you see from the Voice, and do you intend to sit down \\nwith Mr Dutton before next Thursday to discuss his concerns?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I sat down with him yesterday. I sat down with him before we did the press conference. Let's be \\nvery clear, that's the seventh time I have sat down with Peter Dutton. Peter Dutton has met with the Referendum \\nWorking Group twice. You know what? At those meetings we haven't had questions raised. He's had every \\nopportunity. There have been, I think it was Thomas Mayor yesterday, outlined the number of inquiries, details, \\ncommittees that have looked into this over more than a decade. The Uluru Statement from the Heart was in 2017. It \\ngrew out of a First Nations Constitutional Convention. It grew out of a five-year process from 2012 that began back \\nat the end of the last century. John Howard was Prime Minister when he said there needed to be constitutional \\nrecognition. Scott Morrison went to the election in 2019 and said there should be constitutional recognition. It was \\nthe Morrison Government that established the committee that Tom Calma and Marcia Langton presided over, with \\npeople like Chris Kenny and Frank Brennan and a range of people who participated and produced a report that is \\nhundreds of pages long. It went to the Cabinet of the Morrison Government, not my Government, not once, but \\ntwice. The detail is out there. The detail is out there. We need to know, as well, know this, that the programs that \\nhave been successful, that make a difference for Indigenous people, are ones in which they have been involved. \\nJustice reinvestment by the Coalition Government in New South Wales in places like Moree and Bourke, the \\nIndigenous Rangers Program, community health programs. Where people are involved, you get better outcomes. \\nAnd that is something that is just a fact, and that is why we had this coming together. Aboriginal and Torres Strait \\nIslander people are no less homogeneous than any other group that you want to pick. But what you had yesterday \\nwas people from different parts of Australia, from different parts of the country, coming together. And, you know, \\nthe great Galarrwuy Yunupingu, watching it there on Yolngu country in Arnhem Land, watching it, a product of his \\nlife's work. These people, their patience, their modesty, their humbleness, is inspirational. And they deserve, they \\ndeserve nothing less than for people to put politics aside and to get this done. And we will give the Australian \\npeople the opportunity to enlarge our country later this year. And we can be enlarged, or we can shrink. Shrink into \\nplaying old politics. And that's what people need to consider who are in positions of political leadership on this \\nissue.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you worried the wording leaves the door open for High Court challenges? Or are \\nyou confident that it's as watertight as you say it is?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I'm absolutely confident. But I'm confident on the basis of people like the former head of the \\nHigh Court, Justice French. He might know something about the Constitution. The leading academic in Australia \\non constitutional law, Professor Anne Twomey, might know something about the Constitution. This hasn't arisen in \\na vacuum. There's been all of this work done by the advisory group to the Referendum Working Group. It's very \\nclear that this is a straightforward proposition. People can read it themselves. I just read out the third clause that \\nmakes it clear that the Parliament is primary. The primacy of the Parliament is there, including its composition, \\nfunctions, powers and procedures. A key word, including. So, all matters, and it says, to matters relating to, matters \\nis often used as a legal term as well. And we took proper advice, and I'm very confident you will have an \\nopportunity. If you get ten lawyers in a room, you'll often get someone who gets a run in. That's what they're paid to \\ndo. That's why on different sides, to put this in perspective, that's why on different sides in courts, you have lawyers \\non one side and lawyers on the other side. They're paid to advocate. That's an honourable profession to do. But \\nyou shouldn't use that fact to say that there's someone out there who disagrees. Someone, I'm sure I can find you a \\nlawyer who can tell you that that jacket you're wearing is orange or pink. I can find that for you. Pay them enough, \\nthat'll happen.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just back to Aston. Do you think what's happening internally in the Liberal Party in \\nVictoria could actually work in Mary Doyle's favour in regards to Moira Deeming?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think the Liberal Party is dysfunctional here. We saw that in the lead-up to the state \\nelection. We saw that in the way that the Federal Liberal Party people here operate as well. Michael Sukkar was \\npretty desperate to stop the candidate being preselected here for Aston. He didn't have confidence that someone \\nfrom outside the area would be appropriate. I mean, we're a long way from the Melbourne City Council. And I think \\nthat that's just a fact, that it's a dysfunctional branch. They need to be given time to get their act together. In the Page 6 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nmeantime, we've got a fantastic candidate who secured the unanimous support of everyone, who ran last time, who \\nhasn't shopped around for a seat.

She opts for the grilled fennel chicken (no butter please) and a \\nvery hot almond milk cappuccino. I choose the zucchini fritters and a bean-a-colada, which, disappointingly has \\nneither booze nor beans.\\nAly, let it be said, is prone to the odd swear word, as am I, and over the next 60 minutes our conversation is \\npeppered with F-bombs.\\nPage 2 of 5\\nAnne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics\\nThe thrice-married Aly had already lived a complex and somewhat haphazard life before she decided rather \\nspontaneously to run as the Labor candidate for the West Australian seat Cowan in 2016. She managed to turf out \\nthe Liberal incumbent Luke Simpkins by the finest of margins.\\n\"It took 10 days to count the vote,\" she says.\\nIn 2019, she increased her margin and by 2022 she harnessed 46.9 per cent of the vote adding more than 9 per \\ncent to her 2019 numbers.\\nOf that first campaign, she remembers standing at a train station with a picture of herself while waving at cars. A \\nyear ago to the day, she had been invited to speak at the White House at a countering terrorism conference.\\n\"All I could think was from the White House to Greenwood station. What have I done?\"\\nThe migrant experience\\nAly was born Azza Mahmoud Fawzi Hosseini Ali el Serougi in Alexandria, Egypt in 1967. The daughter of a nurse \\nand a textiles engineer who immigrated to Australia in 1969. They were among the last migrants to be received at \\nthe Bonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre in Albury Wodonga - which, having made the world\\'s \\nheadlines two decades earlier over the death from malnutrition of 13 children, had improved conditions \\nconsiderably.\\nThe family moved first to Marrickville in Sydney\\'s inner west and then, just on the cusp of shifting to Texas, they \\nrelocated to Brisbane where Aly\\'s dad got a job with the Jennings factory, which produced corsets and women\\'s \\nunderwear.\\nThey bought their first house in the very un-chi chi West End.\\n\"And then in 1974 came the flood. My parents came from a desert country, they had never seen anything like this,\" \\nAly says.\\n\"But it was a defining feature of our Australian story because what we found was a community. It was almost like \\nthey became Australian through the tragedy.\"\\nThe \\'rational, calming voice\\'\\nMoments like that, she says, stand in stark contrast to other moments of division and rancour that have \\ncharacterised the same-sex marriage plebiscite, the Voice referendum and uncontained racism following the 9/11 \\nattacks in New York.\\nThe current situation in Gaza is confronting, she says. Aly joined Ed Husic last month to warn Gaza\\'s 2.3 million \\nresidents were being \"collectively punished\" for the crimes of terrorists.\\nAs the Israel-Gaza war becomes more divisive, Aly says she is trying to demonstrate how \"important it is that we \\nrecognise each other\\'s humanity and show compassion to each other even when we are hurting the most\".\\n\" I\\'ve spoken and met with the Muslim community and members of the Jewish community. And what I say is to \\ncommunities here, who have intergenerational trauma, and accumulative trauma and who are hurting, is that \\nsometimes the hardest thing to do is to be the rational, calming voice in a room of people who are hurting so much \\nthat the only thing that they can do is shout,\" she says.\\nThe problem with early childhood\\nAs the minister for early childhood education, and also the minister for youth, Aly has a lot on her plate as she \\nmarshalls through two reviews of the childcare and early learning sectors.Page 3 of 5\\nAnne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics\\nThe government is moving, slowly, towards adopting a model of universal access. In July, it increased the \\nmaximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning up to $80,000 and a sliding scale in subsidies for every \\nfamily earning less than $530,000.\\n\"The fact is Australia is one of the most expensive places for early childhood education and care,\" says Aly.\\n\"We have a quality system that is world-class, and a quality framework that has been in place for 10 years. The \\nissue is the cost and the fact that the market isn\\'t behaving the way you would expect. It doesn\\'t go to where the \\ndemand is, it goes to where the money is.\"\\nThe delivery of the Productivity Commission report this week and the Australian Competition and Consumer \\nCommission\\'s investigation will ensure childcare remains one of the hot button issues for the Albanese government \\nin coming months.\\nOne of the problems the government has commissioned the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to \\naddress is price gouging, which could see the benefits of more generous subsidies to parents whittled away to zero \\nby higher fees.\\n\"We\\'re going to be watching. People who are making a lot of money out of early childhood education and care at \\nthe expense of it being affordable and accessible for parents need to know we are watching,\" Aly says.\\nShe says the complexity of the system ranging from ASX-listed corporations to mum-and-dad small businesses, \\nmake it difficult to navigate but that her goal is to find a system \"that works for everyone\".\\n\"That could mean different kinds of service delivery in different areas and even different kinds of services. But it\\'s \\nwhere parents are confident of the quality and safety for their children.\"\\nA face you\\'ll know\\nAly will be familiar to most people, even if they haven\\'t connected the name to the face. She is the petite dark-\\nhaired, dark-eyed woman in colourful clothing who sits behind Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during question \\ntime. Aly is an active listener. She nods. She laughs. She scowls and boos. She never drifts off or checks her \\nphone.\\nAlways impeccably well-dressed, Aly\\'s choice of clothing has taken a twist in the past couple of years as she took \\nup crochet and knitting as a form of meditation and mindfulness as she takes endless flights between Canberra and \\nPerth.\\nThe white jumper she wears to lunch is handcrafted (and has a matching skirt) as was the crochet long dress to this \\nyear\\'s Mid-Winter Ball. She is already working on next year\\'s which will feature a crocheted flower, each unique, \\nrepresenting every woman who died from domestic violence during the year.\\nInstagram link\\n\"Then I will auction it off for a domestic violence charity,\" she says.\\nAly has her own story of domestic violence, one that is told in her 2018 autobiography Finding My Place: From \\nCairo to Canberra - the irresistible story of an irrepressible woman.\\nShe had married young, at the age of 20, while living back in Egypt where she was studying English literature, with \\na minor in acting. The marriage wasn\\'t arranged, as was common for girls like her. Rather, it was a way of escaping \\nthe strictures of being a single woman in a Muslim country.\\n\"The marriage gave me a freedom that I didn\\'t have living under my parents\\' roof. It gave me the freedom to be a \\nrespectable married woman in Egypt. It meant I could go camping with friends, I could go to parties, I could come \\nhome when I wanted to.\"Page 4 of 5\\nAnne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics\\nThere were red flags which she ignored - or didn\\'t know any better.\\nBut after moving to Perth, the violence and contemptuous behaviour escalated.\\n\"There was a bit of martyrdom on my behalf. But there are a lot of stereotypes around women who are survivors, a \\nlot of us are high achievers. The feelings of responsibility and humiliation; we expect more of ourselves,\" she says.\\n\"I remember driving away once and saying out loud to myself: \\'you must be just the kind of woman that men hit\\'. I\\'d \\nresigned myself to it.\\n\"I describe domestic violence as this crack in a bone somewhere in your body that you carry with you through your \\nlife.\\n\"It\\'s hard to imagine myself as the person I was. I\\'m much more like me now than I was back then.\"\\nShe finally kicked him out of the family home after six long years and began the next chapter as a broke single mum \\nof two young sons, Karim and Adam.

It also got her invited to Oxford University and the White House to speak.\\nHer political spark was ignited after the rise of anti-Muslim sentiment across the world, witnessing one-too-many \\ninstances of casual racism in suburban Perth, and becoming a target of death threats because of her profile as a \\nresearcher in anti-terrorism.\\n\"Some days I felt broken and beaten by it all - by the death threats and the calls to \\'hang [her] from a tree\\', \\'drown \\nher in pig\\'s blood\\' and \\'put a bullet in the bag\\',\" she writes in her autobiography.\\nThe university moved her team to unidentified offices twice during the course of a year with strict instruction not to \\nreveal the location.\\nA lot left unsaid\\nI have set aside 90 minutes for lunch, but after an hour a staffer taps Aly on the shoulder and says we have five \\nminutes to wrap it up.\\nHeavens, we haven\\'t even got on to husband number two, or heaven forbid Dave Allen, who is husband number \\nthree.

Are they representative of the \\nbroader population? This is what we found.\\nHow many of our politicians attended university?\\nOur politicians are overall a highly educated cohort - 77 per cent have a bachelor\\'s degree or higher.\\nThis figure is significantly greater than the national average, with Australian Bureau of Statistics data showing just \\n32 per cent of all Australians have graduated from university.\\nSo why is there a remarkably high percentage of university graduates in parliament?\\nIs it because people with an interest in politics or policy are more likely to go to university or is it that they get \\npoliticised while there? John Howard, when prime minister, certainly thought it was the latter, when in 2005 he \\nbanned students from automatically becoming members of the student unions because he saw it as a breeding \\nground for hot-headed lefties and socialists.\\nJohn Hawkins, a political historian from the University of Canberra, says the opposite is most likely the case.\\n\"I suspect it\\'s the other way around; that people who are interested in political ideas and policy are more likely to \\nwant to go to university,\" Hawkins says.\\nPage 2 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians, in six charts\\nOur analysis reveals that 83.5 per cent of Labor politicians have at least one degree compared to 68.6 per cent of \\nCoalition members.\\nPaul Strangio, emeritus professor of politics at Monash University, said the prevalence of politicians with degrees in \\nhistory, politics, sociology and law makes sense.\\n\"There\\'s a certain synchronicity. These degrees teach people analytical skills, as well as strong written and verbal \\ncommunication skills. Arguably, there\\'s a good match-up with the role of a politician,\" he says.\\nCertainly, universities are where many politicians get their first taste of politics and activism.\\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese is one such example. He was prominent in campus politics during his time at the \\nUniversity of Sydney, which culminated in his presidency of NSW Young Labor and later as a rising political staffer.\\nSimon Birmingham, leader of the opposition in the Senate, was president of the Adelaide University Liberal Club in \\n1993, and was a key member of Young Liberals in South Australia for most of the 1990s. He later became an \\nelectorate officer for Senator Robert Hill.\\nIt goes to show that the path from student politics to staffer to MP is well-trodden.\\nThere are countless politicians who cut their teeth in student politics. Opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was chair of \\nthe Bayside Young Liberals in 1990. As a student, Tony Burke, minister for industrial relations, was the president of \\nAustralian Young Labor. Foreign affairs minister Penny Wong was heavily involved in the Labor Club at Adelaide \\nUniversity and served on the national executive of the National Union of Students.\\nAnd that\\'s just for starters.\\nWhich universities produce the most politicians?\\nThe institution that has produced the most of our federal politicians is the University of Sydney, closely followed by \\nthe universities of Melbourne and Queensland.\\nUniversities in the Group of Eight (Go8) dominate the ranking, taking up eight out of 10 spots on the list.\\nJohn Hawkins makes the simple point: \"These are the main universities in the states with the biggest populations.\"\\nBut he adds they are also the institutions most likely to offer degrees in law, economics, history and philosophy, and \\nalso the most likely to offer double-degrees, which are a popular choice among the political classes.\\nFor some, however, the prevalence of degrees from Group of Eight universities is emblematic of entrenched elitism \\nand social division in the broader population.\\nGlenn Savage, associate professor of education policy at the University of Melbourne, has compared Australia\\'s \\n\"highly inequitable\" education system to an \"ecosystem\" with flow-on effects that influence an individual\\'s tertiary \\nstudy and, ultimately, employment.\\n\"It\\'s natural that young people who have more advantageous circumstances will end up in more advantageous \\npositions,\" he says.\\nWhat are our politicians most likely to study?\\nAlthough parliament largely consists of highly educated politicians, it\\'s a bit more monochrome when it comes to \\nwhat they studied - mostly arts and humanities.\\nAbout 40 per cent of federal politicians studied arts at university, which was by a long shot the most popular degree. \\nA double arts-law degree was also common, with 27 politicians, or 12 per cent, graduating with that particular \\ncombination.Page 3 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians, in six charts\\nClare O\\'Neil, Brendan O\\'Connor. Bill Shorten, Michelle Rowland, Julian Leeser, Anika Wells, Zoe McKenzie, Angus \\nTaylor, Adam Bandt and Andrew Gee are just a few of the current crop of politicians with double degrees.\\nThere is a range of majors under the broader umbrella of arts.\\nSenator Katy Gallagher studied in political science and sociology. Labor frontbencher Anne Aly majored in English \\nliterature, with a minor in acting. Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather and transport minister Catherine King studied \\nhistory and social work respectively.\\nOnly 20 politicians (or 9 per cent of parliament) are qualified in science or engineering. Seven studied medicine, \\nincluding independents Monique Ryan and Sophie Scamps. One - Emma McBride - did pharmacy. Greens MP \\nElizabeth Watson-Brown is an architect.\\nSavage says arts degrees, in particular law, politics, and other humanities, \"lend themselves very well to producing \\nthe kinds of knowledge and skill sets which would prove useful for a politician\".\\n\"These degrees would also expose students to theories into social dynamics that are of direct relevance to the \\npolitical and policy process,\" he says.\\nStrangio says that the lack of politicians with expertise and backgrounds in STEM \"may be a disadvantage for some \\nworkings of parliament in terms of committee work, where politicians really need to get into the nitty-gritty of policy\".\\n\"However, fundamentally, it\\'s a highly educated cohort. They probably have the skill sets in terms of research \\ncapacities and written communication skills,\" he says.\\nGavin Moodie, adjunct professor at the University of Toronto\\'s Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, says public \\npolicy would be better served if it was \"more informed by technology, science and engineering, because our current \\nand future challenges will be scientific and technological: climate change, health, and technological change.\"\\nAnd only five politicians have studied education. This includes Sue Lines, president of the Senate, as well as Labor \\nMP Ged Kearney.\\nWho are our most educated politicians?\\nProportionally, the Greens are the most formally educated party overall, with three out of 15 party members - 20 per \\ncent - holding PhDs.\\nAdam Bandt completed his PhD in political science at Monash while working part-time at law firm Slater & Gordon. \\nHis thesis was \"Work to Rule: Rethinking Pashukanis, Marx and Law.\"\\nThere are seven Labor politicians with PhDs - or 6.8 per cent of the party. Treasurer Jim Chalmers wrote his thesis \\non former prime minister Paul Keating, titled \"Brawler statesman: Paul Keating and prime ministerial leadership in \\nAustralia.\"\\nOthers Labor PhD holders include Anne Aly, Andrew Charlton, Andrew Leigh and Daniel Mulino.\\nIndependent Helen Haines and Nationals MP Anne Webster also hold PhDs.\\nIn total, the percentage of federal politicians with a PhD is 5.4 per cent - much higher than the 0.7 per cent of the \\nAustralian population (185,000 people) with PhDs.\\nStrangio says that having highly educated politicians is a good thing.\\n\"Legislation is complex. The issues they are dealing with are complex, and higher education can be an advantage.\"\\nWho are our least educated politicians?Page 4 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians, in six charts\\nIt turns out that higher education is not the only way to become a politician, with a sizeable chunk of politicians \\nchoosing an alternate pathway to Parliament House.\\nAlmost one in four politicians (23 per cent) did not graduate from university, while 3 per cent never finished high \\nschool.\\nThe least formally educated politicians come from the Coalition, with some entering the workforce as teenagers. \\nThis is despite the majority of them attending private schools.\\nWarren Entsch, left school at age 14, following his father into the Queensland railway department as a junior porter. \\nEntsch was originally tasked with being the chief toilet cleaner of the Mareeba railway station.\\nWest Australian senator Dorinda Cox joined the WA police force as a cadet at age 17.

It\\'s important to have these experiences being represented, as it is more \\nreflective of the Australian population,\" she says.\\nHawkins, however, says it is reassuring to have a political cohort who is more educated than the general \\npopulation. \"You would want them to be smarter than the general public. Ideally, you\\'d want them to be more \\nhonest and trustworthy as well,\" Hawkins says.\\nWhere did our politicians go to school?\\nAlmost three in five politicians (57 per cent) were educated at private schools. In comparison, ABS data shows that \\n36 per cent of all students across Australia are enrolled in independent or private schools.\\nJust one politician - Greens senator Jordon Steele-John - was homeschooled.\\nAre there any conclusions to be drawn from this?

They deserve decent wages and conditions.\\nKathleen Ferguson: Under the deal, workers will get 10% by this Christmas and a further 5% by December next \\nyear. It equates to around an extra $100 a week and will cost $3.6 billion. Karen Moran is a long-time educator.\\nKaren Moran: This decision today will change people's lives. It means that early childhood educators who've been \\nrelying on Food Bank to feed their own families won't have to do that anymore. And those that work two and three \\njobs just to make ends meet will be able to spend more time with their families.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nBig pay increase for early childcare workers\\nKathleen Ferguson: But the deal is conditional. In order to receive the pay bump, childcare centres will have to \\nlimit their fee increases to 4.4% during the next 12 months. The Minister for Early Childcare, Education and Youth, \\nDr Anne Aly, says the sector's role in society is critical.\\nDr Anne Aly: We know that brain development is... 90% of brain development occurs in those first five years. This \\nis not babysitting, this is not wiping bums and noses. This is education. We see you, we hear you, we acknowledge \\nyou. We know the vital and professional work that you do.\\nKathleen Ferguson: The early childcare sector says it's been a long and hard-fought battle. Georgie Dent is the \\nCEO of advocacy group The Parenthood.\\nGeorgie Dent: This is a long overdue recognition of the incredible contribution that early childhood educators make \\nto our children, to our communities, to families. It is such a fantastic achievement.\\nKathleen Ferguson: Georgie Dent says this pay increase is desperately needed to combat a worker shortage in \\nthe sector, which is mostly made up of women.\\nGeorgie Dent: The sector is overjoyed. This has been a long-realised dream. We have known that early childhood \\neducators have been chronically underpaid and undervalued. We have seen in recent years the accelerating exit of \\nearly educators from the sector, which has put incredible pressure on services.\\nKathleen Ferguson: This is an interim measure which will be in place for two years while the federal government \\nreviews the sector. The federal education minister, Jason Clare, says it will be up to childcare centres and providers \\nto sign on to the scheme. And he says if centres don't sign up, they should be prepared to lose staff to competitors.\\nJason Clare: This is a cost-of-living win-win. It's good for workers and it's good for parents. And at its heart, this is \\ngood for education, for the next generation, setting our kids up for success.\\nKathleen Ferguson: Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor supports higher wages but says bringing down inflation is \\nthe best way to increase pay.\\nAngus Taylor: Well, we want to see higher real wages, which means lower prices for everything, for all Australians, \\nPK. And we'll look at the detail of this proposal that Labor's putting forward. If it can raise real wages for Australians, \\nof course we're going to support it. That's our position.\\nKathleen Ferguson: The United Workers Union says the increase sends a strong message to women. Jo \\nSchofield is the union's national president.\\nJo Schofield: Just this week, we did a survey that showed 60% of educators wanted to leave within three years. \\n97% of centres have seen educators walk out in the last year, and the single factor in that is the low pay.\\nKathleen Ferguson: She says while the union will continue advocating for better pay and conditions, this is a good \\nstart.\\nStephanie Smail: Kathleen Ferguson reporting.\\nLoad-Date: August 8, 2024\\nEnd of Document\", 'Page 1 of 2\\nWong on Payman: she should vote with us, like I had to on gay marriage\\nWong on Payman: she should vote with us, like I had to on gay marriage\\nThe Age (Melbourne, Australia) - Online\\nJune 27, 2024 Thursday 7:45 AM UTC\\nCopyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

I'm Tania Lawrence, the Member for Hasluck. And it gives me great pleasure to be \\ntoday joined with the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Premier Roger Cook, my state parliamentary colleagues, \\nthe teachers, the trainers and students of North Metro TAFE. When we, even before the election in 2022, we knew \\nwe had a skills and labour shortage. So, one of the very first actions that the Albanese Labor Government took, was \\nto host a summit of unions, businesses, experts, economists, trainers from around the country to identify and \\narticulate the problem and work a pathway to solving it. I also hosted a roundtable here in Perth, with industry \\nleaders, TAFE institutions and with unions. And together, culminating now in this landmark agreement to really fund \\nthe institutions and vocational education training, with TAFE. And we all know, many of us here know, just how \\ncentral it is to having TAFE as the base for education. I myself, as a graduate of TAFE, my staff have done \\napprenticeships as well, and it really does create the careers and pathway opportunities, that have benefited the \\nnation. So with this, I'd love to hand over now to the Prime Minister.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA: Well, thanks very much, Tania, and it's great to be \\nback in the electorate of Hasluck. And it's terrific also to be here with our state parliamentary colleagues, led by \\nPremier Roger Cook, and the Training Minister Simone McGurk, but also Michelle Roberts, the local member here. \\nI am so excited to be in WA this weekend, because of course, it's Telethon Weekend. And you can feel a real uplift \\nhere, as WA does something that other states used to do, but don't do any more, unite in a common interest to \\nraise money to assist sick kids and their family. So, a big shout out at the beginning of this weekend, to all of those \\ninvolved in Telethon and an encouragement to dig deep over this weekend, to make sure that those young \\nAustralians who are so inspirational, who I look forward to meeting their ambassadors later today, and again to talk \\nto people tomorrow about the remarkable example that they show in their resilience, in their positivity, under \\ncircumstances which can be very difficult. But today, we are here at this wonderful TAFE institution to celebrate and \\nto mark the first National Skills Agreement since 2012. Throughout the entire period of my predecessors, there was \\nnot only no National Skills Agreement, there weren't skills agreements between indeed any individual jurisdiction \\nand the Commonwealth. Well, my Government is different. I went to an election saying that we would prioritise \\nTAFE at the center of the vocational education and training system and that we would value skills. The first \\nannouncement that I made as Labor Leader, was back here in Perth in 2019, where I announced the creation of \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nJobs and Skills Australia, a body to identify what the labour market needs were for Australian business going \\nforward, not just over a one year period, but five years, 10 years time. To make sure that our education and training \\nsystem was fit for purpose. To make sure, as well, that we didn't just rely upon temporary labour, bringing people in \\nand then sending them out, and bringing in other people to do the same job. That when we identify an area of skill \\nshortage, we actually have a strategy to tackle it. And that means firstly, training Australians for those jobs. We \\nneed also, of course, to have, migration will continue to play a role. But training Australians up, whether it be for \\ntheir first job or retraining. And it was fantastic to meet some of the students who are here, some of them new in \\ntheir first task that they're looking at doing but others looking at retraining, as well, for the jobs of the future, with the \\nconcentration that this TAFE will have on the renewable sector, which will require different skills. And that's why this \\n$12 billion program that we have put in place over a five year period, with $1.2 billion directly for Western Australia, \\nwill make an enormous difference going forward, over the next five years. And I pay tribute to all of the State and \\nTerritory Governments. A lot of work has gone into this, in the lead up to the National Cabinet meeting that we held \\non Monday, but all of the Premiers and Chief Ministers are very excited about the prospects of going forward. And \\nan example of the way that my Government is working cooperatively with State Governments. Not picking fights \\nwith them, not choosing to back Clive Palmer rather than the local State Government, but choosing instead to back \\nWestern Australians to deliver. Back in this most magnificent of economies, that has been so central to Australia's \\nemployment growth, to continue to be a powerhouse of the national economy. This week we had the labour market \\nfigures, showed an unemployment rate of 3.6 per cent. There have been 19 occasions since records began, where \\nunemployment has had a three in front of it and 16 of the of them have been under my Labor Government, since \\nwere elected last May. Now, we will continue to prioritise the creation of jobs, we will continue to prioritise lifting \\nwages and we will continue to prioritise giving people the skills, so they can fill those good, secure jobs. Now, the \\nFee-Free TAFE is already making an enormous difference. We committed to 180,000 Fee-Free TAFE places this \\nyear. We've delivered at least but still growing, 215,000. Here in WA, there were going to be 18,000 places, we've \\nalmost doubled that figure. WA was very quick off the mark in making a difference. And here at this TAFE, just one \\nexample of the difference that it has made, before Fee-Free TAFE this course in electronics used to cost $3,700. It \\nattracted about seven students each term. Fee-Free TAFE means that now the course has 85 students enrolled, \\nseven to 85. A practical example of how our commitment to Fee-Free TAFE, making a difference, working with \\nState Governments is making a difference to the economy. But importantly as well, making a difference to people's \\nlives by training them up and giving them the skills that they need for secure work into the future. So, I want to also \\nconclude by just giving a shout out to those people who are doing the training. A lot of people, when I've been to \\nTAFEs over the years, people who've already made a massive contribution through the skills and work that they've \\ndone, towards the end of their careers or sometimes after they're formally retired, go and impart those skills to the \\nnext generation coming through. And that's a really important thing about TAFE that we see and I thank those who \\nare doing that. And this course at this wonderful TAFE, I just think this is a really practical announcement and a \\npractical example of how my Government is getting on with dealing with cost of living pressures, dealing with the \\nchallenges which are in the economy and setting us up for a prosperous future. We're going to hear from the \\nPremier and then the WA Training Minister, Simone. And then we'll take questions.\\nROGER COOK, PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA: Thanks very much, Anthony. It's great to have the Prime \\nMinister back here in Western Australia and here in Midland at North Metropolitan TAFE, one of the centres that \\nwill be designed to train all the people we need for our renewable energy transition. So, it's terrific to be here to \\ncelebrate Fee-Free TAFE courses. I'm joined by Minister McGurk, I want to thank her for her leadership in the \\ntraining field, but also acknowledge Tania Lawrence the Member for Hasluck. And of course, the great local \\nMember for Midland, Michelle Roberts. This is an outstanding outcome for Western Australia. In 2023, 36,000 \\nWestern Australians took advantage of our Fee-Free courses, over and above the anticipated 180,000. And so \\nnow, we've got more in 24. And we're really looking forward to extending the Fee-Free TAFE courses under the \\nNational Skills Agreement. Now, my Government always fights for the best deal for Western Australians and the \\nNational Skills Agreement is an outstanding outcome for training Western Australians, not only for the jobs of today, \\nbut for the jobs of the future. It enables us to properly target our resources to those qualifications that we know are \\ngoing to be so vital for the ongoing prosperity of our economy. And it also provides us with an opportunity to target \\ncohorts that we want to see get into the courses, that are so valuable. People from disadvantaged backgrounds, \\ngender diversity in these courses. And so, this is an outstanding outcome. I was very proud to be at the National \\nCabinet meeting earlier in the week, where all the Premiers and Chief Ministers were able to sign off on the Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nNational Skills Agreement. It's a great sign of a Commonwealth Government, which is taking the lead to make sure \\nour economy has the workforce that we need to continue to prosper. This is also in addition to my Government's \\n$246 million redevelopment of our TAFE campuses, almost a quarter of a billion dollars around designing and \\nmaking sure that our TAFE campuses are fit for purpose, to continue to provide great job opportunities for those \\nskills that we'll need today, but to continue to make sure that we have the job opportunities for skills into the future. \\nSo, for instance, here at North Metropolitan TAFE, we'll be providing skills opportunities for those people looking to \\ntransition into the renewable energies future. We'll have a wind turbine here in the very near future, to provide skills \\nfor those people to be able to practice, not only working on wind turbines, but also working at height. So, you can \\nsee how these strategic investments are so important to providing people with jobs. And that's what my \\nGovernment's priority is, is to make sure that Western Australians get the jobs that they deserve. And our \\nunemployment rate figures, which were released yesterday, 3.3 per cent is an outstanding outcome for the Western \\nAustralian economy, and we want to do more. We want to continue to make sure that we provide opportunities for \\nWestern Australians to get rewarding jobs, in great industries, that are forward looking into the future. So, thank you \\nvery much to the Commonwealth Government. Congratulations to Minister McGurk for the National Skills \\nAgreement. This is a great day for Western Australian jobs and training, and very much looking forward to seeing \\nmore success in the Fee-Free TAFE courses into the future.\\nSIMONE MCGURK, WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR TRAINING: Thank you Premier and thank you \\nPrime Minister for being here, as well as Tania Lawrence and Michelle Roberts. I just wanted to acknowledge what \\nwe're able to achieve when we work in cooperation with the Federal Government and the State Government, both \\nbeing so committed in Western Australia to making sure that Western Australians are skilled to do the jobs that we \\nknow are out there and we know are coming. And this five year Skills Agreement, which will deliver $1.3 billion to \\nWestern Australia, $1.3 billion, and that would be $380 million more than we've had in previous, than previous \\nfunding arrangements with the Federal Government. But importantly, we have some certainty of funding for five \\nyears. And working together with a Commonwealth Government to understand what our priority areas are, for the \\njobs that we know are here now and the jobs that we know are coming at us. And to be here at North Metropolitan \\nTAFE here in Midland, where we're able to meet students who are taking advantage of significant Fee-Free \\ncourses, making significant savings. And as the Prime Minister said, we've met a couple of students who are \\nmature age and are coming back and taking the opportunity to upskill, but also young students who can see the \\nopportunities that are here. These are electronic students and you can tell, there's real buzz in the room. They've \\nreally taken advantage of what we're able to deliver with Fee-Free and I would just like to repeat my \\nacknowledgement of the cooperation that we're able to achieve with the Federal Government, when we work \\ntogether. And for the Federal Government, under Prime Minister Albanese and the Skills Minister Brendan \\nO'Connor, understanding that Western Australia has some real pressures and that we need to all work together to \\nput our shoulder to the wheel, to meet the skills demands that are with us today.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Simone. Happy to have questions, on this firstly. This is a really important \\nannouncement and I'm sure you have some other things you want to talk about.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Ed Husic and Anne Aly, who've accused Israel of collectively punishing \\nPalestinians? And if it's not collective punishment, what is it?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Ed Husic, Anne Aly and my entire team voted for a resolution in the Parliament and indeed Ed \\nand Anne spoke about it. That resolution was really important, it unequivocally condemned Hamas for the atrocities \\nthat it committed as a terrorist organisation, with its invasion of Israel. And with the atrocities that were committed, \\nincluding to young people who were attending a music festival, we had people kidnapped and taken from their \\nfamilies. Israel has a right to defend itself. We also acknowledged in that resolution, importantly, that the lives of \\ninnocent civilians needed to be protected. Every loss of an innocent life matters, whether they are Israeli or \\nPalestinian. And I do note the comments of President Biden today. This is what President Biden has had to say, \\n'The US remains committed to the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self determination. We mourn every \\ninnocent life lost. We can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians, who only want to live in peace.' And I \\napplaud the efforts of President Biden, to work with nations in the region to make sure that Gaza will be able to \\nhave access to food, water and medicine. President Biden went on to say, 'We cannot give up on peace and we \\ncannot give up on a two state solution.' And his comments are appropriate, I completely agree with them, and I Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nstand by, as does every Member of the Labor Party, the resolution that was adopted overwhelmingly in the \\nParliament, in the House of Representatives and the same resolution in the Senate just this week.\\nJOURNALIST: We learned just this morning that a 16 year old Aboriginal boy has become first death in custody in \\nWA in the last 50 years. The Voice was your key measure to avoid these sorts of outcomes. With that having failed, \\nwhat's next?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, firstly, can I say that this news is a terrible tragedy and I give my condolences to the family \\nand friends of this young person who has died. And there will now be, of course, a coronial inquiry and so on those \\nspecifics, it is not appropriate, therefore, to comment further. My Government is determined to Close the Gap with \\nIndigenous Australians. We answered the invitation of indigenous Australians to give constitutional recognition in \\nthe form which was requested, which was through a constitutionally enshrined Voice to Parliament. Australians did \\nnot vote for that. Our constitution is difficult to change. We're now on eight out of 45, and it is though the case that \\nIndigenous communities in remote Northern Territory, in places in the Kimberley, in Lockhart River and Palm Island \\nand the Tiwis and other communities, overwhelmingly did vote Yes in this referendum. And that will be a difficult \\ntime, it is a difficult time for Indigenous Australians. But we respect the outcome in our democracy and I have done \\nthat. What we will continue to do, we'll continue to work on Closing the Gap though. The National Skills Agreement \\nis an example, we have over $200 million of that agreement, is set aside for First Nation skills uplift. We want to \\nmake sure that there are more Indigenous apprentices, that there are more Indigenous trainees, that workforces are \\nable to benefit from skilling up Indigenous Australians. I know that many of the companies that were out there \\nsupporting the Voice, are those that have done a lot in terms of reconciliation action plans, in Indigenous \\napprenticeships, and here in Western Australia, of course, has led that quite often, and that's a good thing. But the \\nfact that we have this specific program is an indication that I believe whilst Australians did not vote in favour of the \\nreferendum, Australians do want to see the gap closed. They do want to see disadvantage dealt with, that is, in \\nIndigenous communities. And we'll continue to work in this area, but in health, in life expectancy, in community \\nservices, in all of these areas, with the programs that we have. But also consult with Indigenous communities, \\nbecause one of the things that I do know, and here in Western Australia of all places, is the case. I've been coming \\nhere for a long period of time. I've been here, I think, now 17 times as Prime Minister, that's more than one a month, \\nand it's certainly more than what I committed to, of ten visits a year. Because if you want to find out what's \\nhappening on the ground, here in Western Australia, I think West Australians understand this. They don't want \\ndecisions to just be made in Canberra. They want people to come, to talk to people on the ground, to get those \\nresults. Now, that's a principle that doesn't just apply in Indigenous affairs, it's one that applies across the board. It's \\none that my Government will continue to do, which is why I've engaged so strongly with the Premier, Roger Cook, \\nand why I engaged so strongly as well with his predecessor, Mark McGowan.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you have been coming here for a long time before you were Prime Minister and as \\nPrime Minister, as well. Did you expect such a strong No vote in this state?\\nPRIME MINISTER: People saw what polling was saying, we were determined, though. You had a call in 2017. \\nYou'll note that I was coming here in 2017, but I wasn't the Prime Minister. Nor was I the Prime Minister who \\nestablished a process, which asked Indigenous Australians to deliberate on what form constitutional recognition \\nshould take. That process, we had John Howard way back in, we had a vote on the Preamble, which had a similar \\noutcome, last century. We then had John Howard go to an election in 2007, we then had Tony Abbott and then \\nMalcolm Turnbull establish a process. That process came up with the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017. You \\nhad Ken Wyatt appointed as the Minister for Indigenous Australians and go to Garma in 2019. I was there when he \\nput forward the idea that there would be a referendum. That was the policy that Scott Morrison was elected on in \\n2019. It never happened. It never happened. I'm a Prime Minister who will promise to do things and then go and do \\nthem. I think that's how you restore faith in politics. That is something that we need to do. I launched my campaign \\nhere at the stadium and I promised on multiple occasions, that we would do this. And we gave Australians their say, \\nbut we respect the outcome that was given.\\nJOURNALIST: How concerned are you about the unlawful use of solitary confinement in our detention centre, that \\ncan see Indigenous kids held in their cell for 23 hours? Including the one -Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: I have no intention of commenting on, from Canberra, about the specifics of what occurs in \\nevery centre in Australia\\nJOURNALIST: But, if we're trying to Close the Gap\\nPRIME MINISTER: It's a question of the State. I'm not going to pretend, on a serious issue when it comes to \\nIndigenous Australians, that I am somehow an expert on every issue. That's the whole point that I'm making here, is \\nthat you need to get local engagement and local input on matters.\\nJOURNALIST: What do you make of the Opposition Leader's claims yesterday, urging you to fly to Washington via \\nTel Aviv, in the final moments of Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think that quite clearly, the conflict in the Middle East is a complex one. It's one that has \\ngone on for a considerable period of time. The responsibility for what is happening now rests firmly with Hamas and \\nthe actions that they have taken. But there are, of course, longer term issues which President Biden has indicated \\nthis morning again, has given people a reminder, that they are issues that need to be addressed. And I \\nacknowledge the suffering of Israeli, as well as Palestinian citizens, who are innocent, who just want to live a life in \\nsecurity and with justice, as the resolution carried by the Parliament said, going forward. I also acknowledge that \\nleaders have a responsibility at this time to make sure that there is, whilst there is some concern in the community \\nand hurt being felt for people who have relatives and friends in the Middle East, whether they be Israeli or \\nPalestinian, this is a very difficult time for the community. So, individuals and particularly people, I draw your \\nattention to the comments of the Director General of ASIO, Mike Burgess, who's spoken about the need to be \\nresponsible in comments and to be careful about language which is used at this time. We have a harmonious \\ncommunity here in Australia, I want to see that continue. There's no place here in Australia for anti-Semitism. \\nThere is also no place here in Australia for Islamophobia. The Leader of the Opposition chose to do that, that's a \\nmatter for him. I have scheduled a visit, that has been longstanding with President Biden, where the logistics of \\norganising that for Sunday, is when we will depart from Canberra. The leaders who have visited, and I note this, the \\nleaders who have visited are members of the P5, the Permanent Members of the Security Council. The United \\nStates has a particular role in that, as does the United Kingdom, as does the other people who have visited there. \\nAnd President Biden's visit produced outcomes of negotiating through with different states, but also was \\naccompanied by a considerable security effort for President Biden. This is not a secure area. Our priority has been \\nto engage and I've engaged, I've met personally with the Israeli Ambassador. I had him to my residence and had a \\ndiscussion. I've had discussions with leaders of the Palestinian community, leaders of the Jewish community here \\nin Australia, as well. The decision of the Leader of the Opposition to raise such an issue publicly, that's a matter for \\nhim. But at this point in time, I have no plans to visit the Middle East, and in terms of the security agencies as well, \\nthere's no disagreement from the position that I've taken.\\nJOURNALIST: From Joe Biden's speech, what are your thoughts, more specifically on these comments, that if we \\nwalk away and let Putin erase Ukraine's independence, would be aggressors, would be emboldened to try and do \\nthe same possibly in the Pacific and the Middle East more broadly?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, we're there with the people of Ukraine because the actions of Vladimir Putin, of invading, \\nillegally the sovereign state of Ukraine, is an attack on the international rule of law and on respect for national \\nboundaries and national sovereignty. That's why Australia has been a significant contributor to the struggle in \\nUkraine. And that's why we've provided support, including providing comfort and refuge for people fleeing Ukraine. \\nSimilarly, our priority hasn't been to get people into the Middle East, it's been to get people out of the Middle East. \\nAustralian citizens, is what we've been concentrating on, rather than having a whole contingent go into an area \\nwhich is clearly very volatile, to say the least. It's a state of war, is going on. The people of Ukraine are showing \\nextraordinary courage, extraordinary courage, and I support President Biden's call to continue to engage, to show \\nresolve. Australia will continue to be a part of the support for the people of Ukraine, for as long as it is required, \\nbecause this isn't just a struggle about what occurs in Ukraine.

I\\'m Alicia Payne, the Federal Member for Canberra \\nand it\\'s my great pleasure this morning to be here at MOCCA in Manuka with the Prime Minister, Anthony \\nAlbanese, the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, and the Minister for Early Childhood, Anne Aly. And I want to \\nsay a huge thank you to Kara and the team here at MOCCA for welcoming us again to their beautiful centre, and to \\nthe children who we had such a lovely play with Lego this morning. I\\'m so proud that our government is a \\ngovernment that values early childhood education and care. And from 1 July this year, over one million families will \\nbenefit from our Cheaper Child Care policy. This is good for families, and you\\'ll have more young children gain \\naccess to the great benefits of early childhood education and care. And that more parents can better balance work \\nand parenting - particularly women. Because for too long the high costs of child care have put a brake on their \\neconomic participation. I know this is a huge issue for families in Canberra where we have some of the highest child \\ncare costs in the country. So I\\'m really pleased to hand over to the Prime Minister now to talk further.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Alicia. And it\\'s great to be back here at one of the \\ncentres where we came in opposition, to talk about what a difference a change of government would make in taking \\nchild care seriously and in promoting early learning. Early learning is good for young ones, it\\'s also good for \\nfamilies, it\\'s also good for our economy. Because if we support women to be able to participate fully in the \\nworkforce there will be productivity benefits. It benefits them and their family budgets, but it also benefits \\nbusinesses who employ women, because they\\'re able to have greater continuity in their career. They retire with \\nhigher savings than they would otherwise, and it changes the dynamic in our workplaces. This was the first major \\nPage 2 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\ncommitment that I gave in my first budget reply, in the days when opposition leaders had policies and that made \\nannouncements in budget replies. We campaigned for three years with this as the largest on-budget investment \\nthat we are making during this term, and it\\'s the largest on-budget investment because there is nothing that is more \\nimportant than giving the best chance in life for our youngest Australians, some of whom we\\'ve met here today. \\nLearning that social interaction that\\'s so important, as well as learning skills that will give them a good run up to \\nwhen they start school. But also it\\'s so important for our national economy. It\\'s one of the themes as well of the \\nJobs and Skills Summit, and I\\'m very pleased that we put in place the mechanisms last year, in our first term we \\ncarried the legislation for cheaper child care that will benefit 1.2 million Australian families from July 1, but we\\'re not \\nresting there. We also committed to do a Productivity Commission Inquiry into the universal provision of early \\nlearning. Just as Labor is the party of universal Medicare, of universal superannuation, we also want to be the party \\nthat delivers universal, affordable child care - very important going forward. And that\\'s why today we\\'re announcing \\nthe Productivity Commission Inquiry with Professor Deborah Brennan as the person to undertake that enquiry. \\nThere\\'s no one more qualified than Professor Brennan to undertake this work. It will be a comprehensive inquiry \\nthat will report back to the government on the next steps that we will make. I lead an orderly government. A \\ngovernment that indicates what we are going to do and then gets on and does it. Making a difference as we have in \\nour first eight months, this will make a difference and it\\'s my great pleasure to ask the Professor to make some \\ncomments.\\nPROFESSOR DEBORAH BRENNAN: Thanks, Prime Minister. I\\'m Deb Brennan, I\\'m from the University of New \\nSouth Wales and I\\'ve been around the early childhood education and care policy world for a very long time. So I\\'m \\nabsolutely thrilled to have this opportunity to participate in a co-leadership role in the Productivity Commission \\nInquiry. We\\'ve got the foundations of a fantastic early childhood learning and care system in Australia. But \\neverybody knows there\\'s work to do. We\\'ve got challenges around affordability, access, workforce, many areas, so \\nwe\\'re going to have a really good look at the sector and come up with some suggestions for advancing the system \\nso that every child in Australia gets access to high quality learning and care.\\nJASON CLARE, MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: This is really important. The first five years of your life are \\neverything. Everything you see, everything you hear, every book you read, and every person you meet shapes the \\nperson that you become. What happens in places like this shape the person you become. Early education is good \\nfor kids, it\\'s good for parents, and it\\'s good for the economy. We promised to do three things in the election; first, to \\ncut the cost of child care, and that starts on the first of July. The legislation we passed last year will cut the cost of \\nchild care for more than a million Australian families. We also promised an ACCC inquiry into the driving costs \\nbehind child care. That work is now underway and they will provide their interim report in June and their final report \\nin December. And thirdly, we promised a big and broad, far-reaching inquiry into our early education system to set \\nus up for the next decade and beyond done by the Productivity Commission. And I\\'ve got to say, I am so glad that \\nDeborah, you have agreed to do this work for us. Last night I picked up the phone and spoke to leaders in the \\nsector to tell them that Professor Deborah Brennan would be doing this work. And I\\'ve got to tell you, the response \\nwas overwhelming. If you talk to the same people I spoke to last night, you will hear the same thing. Because \\nhonestly, there is no one more experienced and no one more respected by the early education sector to do this \\nwork. Deborah, I know this has been your life\\'s work and I thank you so much for helping us to write the next \\nchapter.\\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: This Productivity Commission Review that\\'s \\ngoing to be led by Professor Brennan, who brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to this review is just one \\npart of the Albanese Government\\'s reforms in early childhood education and care. We\\'ve started that with making \\nearly childhood education and care more affordable for 1.2 million families right across Australia. As Jason \\nmentioned, and as the Prime Minister mentioned, those first five years are critical, and we have the capacity \\nthrough early childhood education and care to change the trajectory of a child\\'s life. No child born into any form of \\ndisadvantage, no matter who they are, no matter where they live, no matter what background they come from. \\nEvery single child has the capacity to grow and develop if we focus, if we get it right in those first five years. And \\nthis Productivity Commission Review led by Professor Brennan is going to be a huge part of our reforms in early \\nchildhood education and care, carrying on the Labor government\\'s legacy in this area. It was a Labor government \\nthat first introduced the National Quality Framework when we were last in government, and we will continue that Page 3 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nlegacy because we know just how important those first five years are in a child\\'s life. But also how important good \\nquality, affordable early childhood education and care are for the economy, for parents, for allowing women who are \\npredominantly primary caregivers to get out there, to work, to choose to continue their education and develop \\nthemselves if they so wish. So like Jason, and like the Prime Minister, and Alicia Payne, I\\'m really, really excited to \\nwelcome Professor Brennan to the Productivity Commission Review. Thank you.\\nPRIME MINISTER: As you can see, we\\'re very excited about Professor Brennan\\'s appointment here this morning. \\nHappy to take questions.\\nJOURNALIST: On housing affordability, there\\'s new legislation being introduced today. Obviously, that\\'s a long term \\nplan, but will there be any relief for renters in the May Budget?\\nPRIME MINISTER: We\\'ll have the May Budget in May, but we\\'re already taking significant action when it comes to \\nhousing, including the introduction of the legislation that we\\'ll have today for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \\nThat\\'s important legislation, to boost the supply of housing but particularly social and community housing. In \\naddition to that, we\\'ve said that of those 30,000 additional social housing units that will be created, 4,000 of them \\nwill be set aside for women and children escaping domestic violence. In addition to that, we have our Emergency \\nHousing Fund, a $100 million increase. In addition to that, we have our National Housing Accord with the Master \\nBuilders Association, with state and territory governments, with the private sector, working together with the private \\nsector to boost housing supply. In addition to that, we\\'re creating our Housing Supply and Affordability Council \\nagain. Working with state and territory governments, as well as local government about freeing up land, about \\ncreating more support there in the housing sector. In addition to that, there was over half a billion dollars just sitting \\nthere not being used for housing that we have tapped into to provide that support. So we have a comprehensive \\nplan when it comes to housing, you\\'ll see more roll out, in an orderly way, just like we\\'re rolling out today\\'s \\nannouncement in an orderly way.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the first Australian shipment of coal has arrived in China, do you know how many \\nmore are expected to arrive in the near future, and are you confident that the shipments can increase with Don \\nFarrell visiting in the near future as well?\\nPRIME MINISTER: What I\\'m confident of is that the dynamic between Australia and China has changed, from one \\nwhere there wasn\\'t dialogue between ministers, to one where there is. And that dialogue is always a good idea. I\\'ve \\nsaid with regards to the relationship with China, that we will cooperate where we can, we will disagree where we \\nmust, and we\\'ll engage in our national interest. And when I met with President Xi, I indicated to him publicly, but \\nalso of course, privately, that it quite clearly was in Australia\\'s interests to export more to China. China currently \\nreceives more exports by value than the next three major trading partners combined. So that relationship is \\nimportant for Australian jobs, for our national economy, but there\\'s another thing it\\'s good for too. It\\'s good for China \\nto receive those goods, because we have not just resources, but we have wine, meat, barley, seafood - the best in \\nthe world. And it is in China\\'s interest for any impediments to be removed. I\\'m very pleased that Don Farrell had a \\nconstructive meeting this week with his counterpart in China. I\\'m pleased that Penny Wong visited Beijing on \\nDecember 21st to mark the 50th anniversary of relations between Australia and the People\\'s Republic of China. \\nAnd I look forward to both of our countries going forward in a constructive, cooperative way. These reports haven\\'t \\nbeen confirmed yet. We are cautious about making announcements before they\\'re confirmed. But quite clearly, I \\nthink if Australian business and Australian industry, what they tell me, including last night with business people I\\'ve \\nmet with, is that they are very pleased with the constructive direction of the relationship.\\nJOURNALIST: Further on China, US officials say that Chinese spy balloons are part of an effort to assess the \\nmilitary capabilities around the world. Does that concern you and does this incident in the US, do you see that as a \\nsetback in the engagement that was seen between Washington and Beijing and Canada?\\nPRIME MINISTER: We support the sovereignty of nations, including the United States, our great friends in the \\nUnited States. We consider all of the matters relating to national security and respond in an appropriate way and \\nwill continue to do so.Page 4 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nJOURNALIST: Disability workers and age care workers got big pay rises recently. The Childcare Workers Union \\nhas called for a 25% pay rise. We know pay is a huge factor in this industry. Would you back a pay rise like that for \\nchild care workers?\\nPRIME MINISTER: The government doesn\\'t determine the level of wages for everybody in the sector.\\nJOURNALIST: But do you support their push?\\nPRIME MINISTER: What I support is people being paid fairly, and I won\\'t comment on specifics because that\\'s the \\njob of the Fair Work Commission to consider these matters independently of government and come to decisions. \\nWhat I would say though, and what I\\'ve said publicly a number of times, including yesterday at the UN International \\nWomen\\'s Day event that was held yesterday morning, is that if you look at the sectors where people are underpaid, \\nthey have something in common, two things: One, they are the very sectors that got us through the pandemic. Our \\ncleaners, our aged care workers, our childcare workers. There\\'s something else they\\'ve got in common as well. \\nThey are largely feminised industries, and that\\'s why, when we made changes to industrial regulations, I announced \\nat our campaign launch in Perth last year that we would very specially have measures that allowed the gender pay \\ngap to be considered. We had legislation yesterday as well about transparency, so that the gender pay gap can be \\nidentified for larger companies as well. So I will conclude with this by saying, early learning educators do a fantastic \\njob. They\\'re valued by parents, they\\'re valued by children who grow to love them and have a relationship with them. \\nThis isn\\'t just a normal job, as much as I love all the journalists here, our relationship is different. Between the \\neducators and the children who they look after. And I have every respect for the educators and the work that they \\ndo.\\nJOURNALIST: One on the Referendum Machinery Act please if I could. Yesterday, Katy Gallagher said that you \\nwould go ahead with the information pamphlet. In December, Don Farrell and Mark Dreyfus said \"there\\'s no longer \\nany need for taxpayers to pay for a pamphlet to be sent to every household. The Referendum Act does not reflect \\nmodern delivery and communications methods.\" Do you still agree with that? Has your view changed or is this \\nbringing back the pamphlet a concession to just get it through the Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Both things are right. The truth is, I don\\'t know about you Josh, when was the last letter you \\nsent?\\nJOURNALIST: I think it was around Christmas.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Apart from Christmas Cards, when was the last letter you sent?\\nJOURNALIST: You\\'re testing my memory, it\\'s not my press conference.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Has anyone here sent a letter this year?\\nJOURNALIST: Last week, to the US Consulate.\\nPRIME MINISTER: That\\'s not a letter, that\\'s an application. The world has changed how we communicate. But I \\ncould have said, we will engage constructively. One of the Senators approached, we made this decision a week \\nago, one of the Senators approached and said, this will make a big difference for our approach. I don\\'t know how \\nmany times I can say this at press conferences, we will do what we need to do to broaden support for this. The \\nreferendum that will be held later this year is about two things, recognition and consultation. Recognising Aboriginal \\nand Torres Strait Islander People in our Constitution and consulting them on matters that affect them, that\\'s what it\\'s \\nabout. Now we want to maximise support for that. So if anyone has, as I said, I await any member of the House of \\nRepresentatives or the Senate to examine the question and the draft changes that I put forward at Garma last year. \\nNow, I\\'ll give you the exclusive, just for you, so if everyone else can not listen, if there\\'s a constructive suggestion, \\nthat\\'s backed in by lawyers, we\\'ll change that. If there\\'s a suggestion, there hasn\\'t been one, there hasn\\'t been one. \\nI want this to succeed. I\\'m not being dogmatic about this. This is not our proposal, this is a proposal that came from \\nthe bottom up. And you need to think of the counterfactual of what happens if this referendum succeeds. If this \\nreferendum succeeds, Indigenous Australians will be shown the respect that they deserve. Australians will all know Page 5 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nthat we\\'ve acknowledged the great privilege that we have of sharing this continent with the oldest continuous \\nculture on earth. And the world will see that Australia\\'s a mature country, a mature country that can be honest \\nabout our history and can celebrate that history. That\\'s what this is about. It\\'s not about party politics. And that\\'s \\nwhat every state Premier and Chief Minister understands. And I just say to my colleagues on the Hill, this isn\\'t the \\nopportunity to look for division. This is the opportunity to look for national unity, to embrace the opportunity which is \\nthere. So, if someone has a suggestion, by all means put it forward. I\\'m up for it, in terms of, whether a pamphlet \\ngoes out, it doesn\\'t hurt, a pamphlet going out. People are going to put things in letterboxes anyway during the \\nreferendum. If people want taxpayers to pay for it, there\\'s a judgement call there, fine. Taxpayers shouldn\\'t be \\nfunding the campaigns of Yes and No. That should be up to people to fund. There should be equal funding and \\nthere will be under the under the proposal that we have. I also welcome Simon Birmingham\\'s comments this \\nmorning. Simon Birmingham has said very clearly that there shouldn\\'t be funding of the Yes and No case. I \\nwelcome the comments of Simon Birmingham. I welcome anyone who wants to join this journey on the path to \\nreconciliation.\\nJOURNALIST: There are strong indications that Vladimir Putin signed off on the supply of weapons used to shoot \\ndown MH17. If you could look at him in the eye today, what would you say to Vladimir Putin?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I\\'d say that you are reprehensible. That Vladimir Putin, clearly, the shooting down of MH17 was \\nan act of terrorism that had an impact here in Australia, but on many countries as well. And we will continue to \\npursue these issues with every avenue at our disposal.\\nJOURNALIST: So how do you feel about the suspension of the criminal investigation into the downing of MH17?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I think I just answered how I feel about it. The issue, of course, of the Russian invasion of \\nUkraine, this is a guy who runs an authoritarian regime that doesn\\'t care about human rights, that doesn\\'t care \\nabout devastation of communities, whether it be in Ukraine, whether it be the oppression of its own citizens, or \\nwhether the acts outside of Russia of which we\\'ve seen a number. The travesty of MH17 is an issue in which he \\nshould be held to account and Australia will continue to pursue all of these issues with every avenue at our \\ndisposal.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, this morning the Deputy PM has indicated he wants to get rid of Chinese linked \\nsurveillance cameras from government buildings. We spoke about the relationship with China earlier, the last time \\nthe Australian government tried to ban or exclude a Chinese company from communications in any form in \\nAustralia, it was detrimental to our relationship with China. Are you concerned about how Beijing will react to the \\nremoval of those devices?\\nPRIME MINISTER: No, we act in accordance with Australia\\'s national interest. We do so transparently and that\\'s \\nwhat we\\'ll continue to do.

recently part of a Senate inquiry into consultancy firms, which examined how \\ngovernment outsourced work to private enterprise.\\nShe said programs like the ISP were an important function of government and that contracting out their \\nadministration was \"not the right thing to do\".\\n\"It is government business to allocate and manage its big programs like this one,\" Senator Pocock said.\\n\"Those services need to be provided, but they need to be provided in ways where taxpayers can be confident that \\nwe\\'re getting value for money.\"\\nIn a statement, KU CEO Chris Legg said

And that more parents can better balance work \\nand parenting - particularly women. Because for too long the high costs of child care have put a brake on their \\neconomic participation. I know this is a huge issue for families in Canberra where we have some of the highest child \\ncare costs in the country. So I\\'m really pleased to hand over to the Prime Minister now to talk further.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Alicia. And it\\'s great to be back here at one of the \\ncentres where we came in opposition, to talk about what a difference a change of government would make in taking \\nchild care seriously and in promoting early learning. Early learning is good for young ones, it\\'s also good for \\nfamilies, it\\'s also good for our economy. Because if we support women to be able to participate fully in the \\nworkforce there will be productivity benefits. It benefits them and their family budgets, but it also benefits \\nbusinesses who employ women, because they\\'re able to have greater continuity in their career. They retire with \\nhigher savings than they would otherwise, and it changes the dynamic in our workplaces. This was the first major \\nPage 2 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\ncommitment that I gave in my first budget reply, in the days when opposition leaders had policies and that made \\nannouncements in budget replies. We campaigned for three years with this as the largest on-budget investment \\nthat we are making during this term, and it\\'s the largest on-budget investment because there is nothing that is more \\nimportant than giving the best chance in life for our youngest Australians, some of whom we\\'ve met here today. \\nLearning that social interaction that\\'s so important, as well as learning skills that will give them a good run up to \\nwhen they start school. But also it\\'s so important for our national economy. It\\'s one of the themes as well of the \\nJobs and Skills Summit, and I\\'m very pleased that we put in place the mechanisms last year, in our first term we \\ncarried the legislation for cheaper child care that will benefit 1.2 million Australian families from July 1, but we\\'re not \\nresting there. We also committed to do a Productivity Commission Inquiry into the universal provision of early \\nlearning. Just as Labor is the party of universal Medicare, of universal superannuation, we also want to be the party \\nthat delivers universal, affordable child care - very important going forward. And that\\'s why today we\\'re announcing \\nthe Productivity Commission Inquiry with Professor Deborah Brennan as the person to undertake that enquiry. \\nThere\\'s no one more qualified than Professor Brennan to undertake this work. It will be a comprehensive inquiry \\nthat will report back to the government on the next steps that we will make. I lead an orderly government. A \\ngovernment that indicates what we are going to do and then gets on and does it. Making a difference as we have in \\nour first eight months, this will make a difference and it\\'s my great pleasure to ask the Professor to make some \\ncomments.\\nPROFESSOR DEBORAH BRENNAN: Thanks, Prime Minister. I\\'m Deb Brennan, I\\'m from the University of New \\nSouth Wales and I\\'ve been around the early childhood education and care policy world for a very long time. So I\\'m \\nabsolutely thrilled to have this opportunity to participate in a co-leadership role in the Productivity Commission \\nInquiry. We\\'ve got the foundations of a fantastic early childhood learning and care system in Australia. But \\neverybody knows there\\'s work to do. We\\'ve got challenges around affordability, access, workforce, many areas, so \\nwe\\'re going to have a really good look at the sector and come up with some suggestions for advancing the system \\nso that every child in Australia gets access to high quality learning and care.\\nJASON CLARE, MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: This is really important. The first five years of your life are \\neverything. Everything you see, everything you hear, every book you read, and every person you meet shapes the \\nperson that you become. What happens in places like this shape the person you become. Early education is good \\nfor kids, it\\'s good for parents, and it\\'s good for the economy. We promised to do three things in the election; first, to \\ncut the cost of child care, and that starts on the first of July. The legislation we passed last year will cut the cost of \\nchild care for more than a million Australian families. We also promised an ACCC inquiry into the driving costs \\nbehind child care. That work is now underway and they will provide their interim report in June and their final report \\nin December. And thirdly, we promised a big and broad, far-reaching inquiry into our early education system to set \\nus up for the next decade and beyond done by the Productivity Commission. And I\\'ve got to say, I am so glad that \\nDeborah, you have agreed to do this work for us. Last night I picked up the phone and spoke to leaders in the \\nsector to tell them that Professor Deborah Brennan would be doing this work. And I\\'ve got to tell you, the response \\nwas overwhelming. If you talk to the same people I spoke to last night, you will hear the same thing. Because \\nhonestly, there is no one more experienced and no one more respected by the early education sector to do this \\nwork. Deborah, I know this has been your life\\'s work and I thank you so much for helping us to write the next \\nchapter.\\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: This Productivity Commission Review that\\'s \\ngoing to be led by Professor Brennan, who brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to this review is just one \\npart of the Albanese Government\\'s reforms in early childhood education and care. We\\'ve started that with making \\nearly childhood education and care more affordable for 1.2 million families right across Australia. As Jason \\nmentioned, and as the Prime Minister mentioned, those first five years are critical, and we have the capacity \\nthrough early childhood education and care to change the trajectory of a child\\'s life. No child born into any form of \\ndisadvantage, no matter who they are, no matter where they live, no matter what background they come from. \\nEvery single child has the capacity to grow and develop if we focus, if we get it right in those first five years. And \\nthis Productivity Commission Review led by Professor Brennan is going to be a huge part of our reforms in early \\nchildhood education and care, carrying on the Labor government\\'s legacy in this area. It was a Labor government \\nthat first introduced the National Quality Framework when we were last in government, and we will continue that Page 3 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nlegacy because we know just how important those first five years are in a child\\'s life. But also how important good \\nquality, affordable early childhood education and care are for the economy, for parents, for allowing women who are \\npredominantly primary caregivers to get out there, to work, to choose to continue their education and develop \\nthemselves if they so wish. So like Jason, and like the Prime Minister, and Alicia Payne, I\\'m really, really excited to \\nwelcome Professor Brennan to the Productivity Commission Review. Thank you.\\nPRIME MINISTER: As you can see, we\\'re very excited about Professor Brennan\\'s appointment here this morning. \\nHappy to take questions.\\nJOURNALIST: On housing affordability, there\\'s new legislation being introduced today. Obviously, that\\'s a long term \\nplan, but will there be any relief for renters in the May Budget?\\nPRIME MINISTER: We\\'ll have the May Budget in May, but we\\'re already taking significant action when it comes to \\nhousing, including the introduction of the legislation that we\\'ll have today for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \\nThat\\'s important legislation, to boost the supply of housing but particularly social and community housing. In \\naddition to that, we\\'ve said that of those 30,000 additional social housing units that will be created, 4,000 of them \\nwill be set aside for women and children escaping domestic violence. In addition to that, we have our Emergency \\nHousing Fund, a $100 million increase. In addition to that, we have our National Housing Accord with the Master \\nBuilders Association, with state and territory governments, with the private sector, working together with the private \\nsector to boost housing supply. In addition to that, we\\'re creating our Housing Supply and Affordability Council \\nagain. Working with state and territory governments, as well as local government about freeing up land, about \\ncreating more support there in the housing sector. In addition to that, there was over half a billion dollars just sitting \\nthere not being used for housing that we have tapped into to provide that support. So we have a comprehensive \\nplan when it comes to housing, you\\'ll see more roll out, in an orderly way, just like we\\'re rolling out today\\'s \\nannouncement in an orderly way.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the first Australian shipment of coal has arrived in China, do you know how many \\nmore are expected to arrive in the near future, and are you confident that the shipments can increase with Don \\nFarrell visiting in the near future as well?\\nPRIME MINISTER: What I\\'m confident of is that the dynamic between Australia and China has changed, from one \\nwhere there wasn\\'t dialogue between ministers, to one where there is. And that dialogue is always a good idea. I\\'ve \\nsaid with regards to the relationship with China, that we will cooperate where we can, we will disagree where we \\nmust, and we\\'ll engage in our national interest. And when I met with President Xi, I indicated to him publicly, but \\nalso of course, privately, that it quite clearly was in Australia\\'s interests to export more to China. China currently \\nreceives more exports by value than the next three major trading partners combined. So that relationship is \\nimportant for Australian jobs, for our national economy, but there\\'s another thing it\\'s good for too. It\\'s good for China \\nto receive those goods, because we have not just resources, but we have wine, meat, barley, seafood - the best in \\nthe world. And it is in China\\'s interest for any impediments to be removed. I\\'m very pleased that Don Farrell had a \\nconstructive meeting this week with his counterpart in China. I\\'m pleased that Penny Wong visited Beijing on \\nDecember 21st to mark the 50th anniversary of relations between Australia and the People\\'s Republic of China. \\nAnd I look forward to both of our countries going forward in a constructive, cooperative way. These reports haven\\'t \\nbeen confirmed yet. We are cautious about making announcements before they\\'re confirmed. But quite clearly, I \\nthink if Australian business and Australian industry, what they tell me, including last night with business people I\\'ve \\nmet with, is that they are very pleased with the constructive direction of the relationship.\\nJOURNALIST: Further on China, US officials say that Chinese spy balloons are part of an effort to assess the \\nmilitary capabilities around the world. Does that concern you and does this incident in the US, do you see that as a \\nsetback in the engagement that was seen between Washington and Beijing and Canada?\\nPRIME MINISTER: We support the sovereignty of nations, including the United States, our great friends in the \\nUnited States. We consider all of the matters relating to national security and respond in an appropriate way and \\nwill continue to do so.Page 4 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nJOURNALIST: Disability workers and age care workers got big pay rises recently. The Childcare Workers Union \\nhas called for a 25% pay rise. We know pay is a huge factor in this industry. Would you back a pay rise like that for \\nchild care workers?\\nPRIME MINISTER: The government doesn\\'t determine the level of wages for everybody in the sector.\\nJOURNALIST: But do you support their push?\\nPRIME MINISTER: What I support is people being paid fairly, and I won\\'t comment on specifics because that\\'s the \\njob of the Fair Work Commission to consider these matters independently of government and come to decisions. \\nWhat I would say though, and what I\\'ve said publicly a number of times, including yesterday at the UN International \\nWomen\\'s Day event that was held yesterday morning, is that if you look at the sectors where people are underpaid, \\nthey have something in common, two things: One, they are the very sectors that got us through the pandemic. Our \\ncleaners, our aged care workers, our childcare workers. There\\'s something else they\\'ve got in common as well. \\nThey are largely feminised industries, and that\\'s why, when we made changes to industrial regulations, I announced \\nat our campaign launch in Perth last year that we would very specially have measures that allowed the gender pay \\ngap to be considered. We had legislation yesterday as well about transparency, so that the gender pay gap can be \\nidentified for larger companies as well. So I will conclude with this by saying, early learning educators do a fantastic \\njob. They\\'re valued by parents, they\\'re valued by children who grow to love them and have a relationship with them. \\nThis isn\\'t just a normal job, as much as I love all the journalists here, our relationship is different. Between the \\neducators and the children who they look after. And I have every respect for the educators and the work that they \\ndo.\\nJOURNALIST: One on the Referendum Machinery Act please if I could. Yesterday, Katy Gallagher said that you \\nwould go ahead with the information pamphlet. In December, Don Farrell and Mark Dreyfus said \"there\\'s no longer \\nany need for taxpayers to pay for a pamphlet to be sent to every household. The Referendum Act does not reflect \\nmodern delivery and communications methods.\" Do you still agree with that? Has your view changed or is this \\nbringing back the pamphlet a concession to just get it through the Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Both things are right. The truth is, I don\\'t know about you Josh, when was the last letter you \\nsent?\\nJOURNALIST: I think it was around Christmas.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Apart from Christmas Cards, when was the last letter you sent?\\nJOURNALIST: You\\'re testing my memory, it\\'s not my press conference.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Has anyone here sent a letter this year?\\nJOURNALIST: Last week, to the US Consulate.\\nPRIME MINISTER: That\\'s not a letter, that\\'s an application. The world has changed how we communicate. But I \\ncould have said, we will engage constructively. One of the Senators approached, we made this decision a week \\nago, one of the Senators approached and said, this will make a big difference for our approach. I don\\'t know how \\nmany times I can say this at press conferences, we will do what we need to do to broaden support for this. The \\nreferendum that will be held later this year is about two things, recognition and consultation. Recognising Aboriginal \\nand Torres Strait Islander People in our Constitution and consulting them on matters that affect them, that\\'s what it\\'s \\nabout. Now we want to maximise support for that. So if anyone has, as I said, I await any member of the House of \\nRepresentatives or the Senate to examine the question and the draft changes that I put forward at Garma last year. \\nNow, I\\'ll give you the exclusive, just for you, so if everyone else can not listen, if there\\'s a constructive suggestion, \\nthat\\'s backed in by lawyers, we\\'ll change that. If there\\'s a suggestion, there hasn\\'t been one, there hasn\\'t been one. \\nI want this to succeed. I\\'m not being dogmatic about this. This is not our proposal, this is a proposal that came from \\nthe bottom up. And you need to think of the counterfactual of what happens if this referendum succeeds. If this \\nreferendum succeeds, Indigenous Australians will be shown the respect that they deserve. Australians will all know Page 5 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nthat we\\'ve acknowledged the great privilege that we have of sharing this continent with the oldest continuous \\nculture on earth. And the world will see that Australia\\'s a mature country, a mature country that can be honest \\nabout our history and can celebrate that history. That\\'s what this is about. It\\'s not about party politics. And that\\'s \\nwhat every state Premier and Chief Minister understands. And I just say to my colleagues on the Hill, this isn\\'t the \\nopportunity to look for division. This is the opportunity to look for national unity, to embrace the opportunity which is \\nthere. So, if someone has a suggestion, by all means put it forward. I\\'m up for it, in terms of, whether a pamphlet \\ngoes out, it doesn\\'t hurt, a pamphlet going out. People are going to put things in letterboxes anyway during the \\nreferendum. If people want taxpayers to pay for it, there\\'s a judgement call there, fine. Taxpayers shouldn\\'t be \\nfunding the campaigns of Yes and No. That should be up to people to fund. There should be equal funding and \\nthere will be under the under the proposal that we have. I also welcome Simon Birmingham\\'s comments this \\nmorning. Simon Birmingham has said very clearly that there shouldn\\'t be funding of the Yes and No case. I \\nwelcome the comments of Simon Birmingham. I welcome anyone who wants to join this journey on the path to \\nreconciliation.\\nJOURNALIST: There are strong indications that Vladimir Putin signed off on the supply of weapons used to shoot \\ndown MH17. If you could look at him in the eye today, what would you say to Vladimir Putin?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I\\'d say that you are reprehensible. That Vladimir Putin, clearly, the shooting down of MH17 was \\nan act of terrorism that had an impact here in Australia, but on many countries as well. And we will continue to \\npursue these issues with every avenue at our disposal.\\nJOURNALIST: So how do you feel about the suspension of the criminal investigation into the downing of MH17?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I think I just answered how I feel about it. The issue, of course, of the Russian invasion of \\nUkraine, this is a guy who runs an authoritarian regime that doesn\\'t care about human rights, that doesn\\'t care \\nabout devastation of communities, whether it be in Ukraine, whether it be the oppression of its own citizens, or \\nwhether the acts outside of Russia of which we\\'ve seen a number. The travesty of MH17 is an issue in which he \\nshould be held to account and Australia will continue to pursue all of these issues with every avenue at our \\ndisposal.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, this morning the Deputy PM has indicated he wants to get rid of Chinese linked \\nsurveillance cameras from government buildings. We spoke about the relationship with China earlier, the last time \\nthe Australian government tried to ban or exclude a Chinese company from communications in any form in \\nAustralia, it was detrimental to our relationship with China. Are you concerned about how Beijing will react to the \\nremoval of those devices?\\nPRIME MINISTER: No, we act in accordance with Australia\\'s national interest. We do so transparently and that\\'s \\nwhat we\\'ll continue to do.

Would you back a pay rise like that for \\nchild care workers?\\nPRIME MINISTER: The government doesn\\'t determine the level of wages for everybody in the sector.\\nJOURNALIST: But do you support their push?\\nPRIME MINISTER: What I support is people being paid fairly, and I won\\'t comment on specifics because that\\'s the \\njob of the Fair Work Commission to consider these matters independently of government and come to decisions. \\nWhat I would say though, and what I\\'ve said publicly a number of times, including yesterday at the UN International \\nWomen\\'s Day event that was held yesterday morning, is that if you look at the sectors where people are underpaid, \\nthey have something in common, two things: One, they are the very sectors that got us through the pandemic. Our \\ncleaners, our aged care workers, our childcare workers. There\\'s something else they\\'ve got in common as well. \\nThey are largely feminised industries, and that\\'s why, when we made changes to industrial regulations, I announced \\nat our campaign launch in Perth last year that we would very specially have measures that allowed the gender pay \\ngap to be considered. We had legislation yesterday as well about transparency, so that the gender pay gap can be \\nidentified for larger companies as well. So I will conclude with this by saying, early learning educators do a fantastic \\njob. They\\'re valued by parents, they\\'re valued by children who grow to love them and have a relationship with them. \\nThis isn\\'t just a normal job, as much as I love all the journalists here, our relationship is different. Between the \\neducators and the children who they look after. And I have every respect for the educators and the work that they \\ndo.\\nJOURNALIST: One on the Referendum Machinery Act please if I could. Yesterday, Katy Gallagher said that you \\nwould go ahead with the information pamphlet. In December, Don Farrell and Mark Dreyfus said \"there\\'s no longer \\nany need for taxpayers to pay for a pamphlet to be sent to every household. The Referendum Act does not reflect \\nmodern delivery and communications methods.\" Do you still agree with that? Has your view changed or is this \\nbringing back the pamphlet a concession to just get it through the Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Both things are right. The truth is, I don\\'t know about you Josh, when was the last letter you \\nsent?\\nJOURNALIST: I think it was around Christmas.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Apart from Christmas Cards, when was the last letter you sent?\\nJOURNALIST: You\\'re testing my memory, it\\'s not my press conference.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Has anyone here sent a letter this year?\\nJOURNALIST: Last week, to the US Consulate.\\nPRIME MINISTER: That\\'s not a letter, that\\'s an application. The world has changed how we communicate. But I \\ncould have said, we will engage constructively. One of the Senators approached, we made this decision a week \\nago, one of the Senators approached and said, this will make a big difference for our approach. I don\\'t know how \\nmany times I can say this at press conferences, we will do what we need to do to broaden support for this. The \\nreferendum that will be held later this year is about two things, recognition and consultation. Recognising Aboriginal \\nand Torres Strait Islander People in our Constitution and consulting them on matters that affect them, that\\'s what it\\'s \\nabout. Now we want to maximise support for that. So if anyone has, as I said, I await any member of the House of \\nRepresentatives or the Senate to examine the question and the draft changes that I put forward at Garma last year. \\nNow, I\\'ll give you the exclusive, just for you, so if everyone else can not listen, if there\\'s a constructive suggestion, \\nthat\\'s backed in by lawyers, we\\'ll change that. If there\\'s a suggestion, there hasn\\'t been one, there hasn\\'t been one. \\nI want this to succeed. I\\'m not being dogmatic about this. This is not our proposal, this is a proposal that came from \\nthe bottom up. And you need to think of the counterfactual of what happens if this referendum succeeds. If this \\nreferendum succeeds, Indigenous Australians will be shown the respect that they deserve. Australians will all know Page 5 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nthat we\\'ve acknowledged the great privilege that we have of sharing this continent with the oldest continuous \\nculture on earth. And the world will see that Australia\\'s a mature country, a mature country that can be honest \\nabout our history and can celebrate that history. That\\'s what this is about. It\\'s not about party politics. And that\\'s \\nwhat every state Premier and Chief Minister understands. And I just say to my colleagues on the Hill, this isn\\'t the \\nopportunity to look for division. This is the opportunity to look for national unity, to embrace the opportunity which is \\nthere. So, if someone has a suggestion, by all means put it forward. I\\'m up for it, in terms of, whether a pamphlet \\ngoes out, it doesn\\'t hurt, a pamphlet going out. People are going to put things in letterboxes anyway during the \\nreferendum. If people want taxpayers to pay for it, there\\'s a judgement call there, fine. Taxpayers shouldn\\'t be \\nfunding the campaigns of Yes and No. That should be up to people to fund. There should be equal funding and \\nthere will be under the under the proposal that we have. I also welcome Simon Birmingham\\'s comments this \\nmorning. Simon Birmingham has said very clearly that there shouldn\\'t be funding of the Yes and No case. I \\nwelcome the comments of Simon Birmingham. I welcome anyone who wants to join this journey on the path to \\nreconciliation.\\nJOURNALIST: There are strong indications that Vladimir Putin signed off on the supply of weapons used to shoot \\ndown MH17. If you could look at him in the eye today, what would you say to Vladimir Putin?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I\\'d say that you are reprehensible. That Vladimir Putin, clearly, the shooting down of MH17 was \\nan act of terrorism that had an impact here in Australia, but on many countries as well. And we will continue to \\npursue these issues with every avenue at our disposal.\\nJOURNALIST: So how do you feel about the suspension of the criminal investigation into the downing of MH17?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I think I just answered how I feel about it. The issue, of course, of the Russian invasion of \\nUkraine, this is a guy who runs an authoritarian regime that doesn\\'t care about human rights, that doesn\\'t care \\nabout devastation of communities, whether it be in Ukraine, whether it be the oppression of its own citizens, or \\nwhether the acts outside of Russia of which we\\'ve seen a number. The travesty of MH17 is an issue in which he \\nshould be held to account and Australia will continue to pursue all of these issues with every avenue at our \\ndisposal.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, this morning the Deputy PM has indicated he wants to get rid of Chinese linked \\nsurveillance cameras from government buildings. We spoke about the relationship with China earlier, the last time \\nthe Australian government tried to ban or exclude a Chinese company from communications in any form in \\nAustralia, it was detrimental to our relationship with China. Are you concerned about how Beijing will react to the \\nremoval of those devices?\\nPRIME MINISTER: No, we act in accordance with Australia\\'s national interest.

I\\'m Alicia Payne, the Federal Member for Canberra \\nand it\\'s my great pleasure this morning to be here at MOCCA in Manuka with the Prime Minister, Anthony \\nAlbanese, the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, and the Minister for Early Childhood, Anne Aly. And I want to \\nsay a huge thank you to Kara and the team here at MOCCA for welcoming us again to their beautiful centre, and to \\nthe children who we had such a lovely play with Lego this morning. I\\'m so proud that our government is a \\ngovernment that values early childhood education and care. And from 1 July this year, over one million families will \\nbenefit from our Cheaper Child Care policy. This is good for families, and you\\'ll have more young children gain \\naccess to the great benefits of early childhood education and care. And that more parents can better balance work \\nand parenting - particularly women. Because for too long the high costs of child care have put a brake on their \\neconomic participation. I know this is a huge issue for families in Canberra where we have some of the highest child \\ncare costs in the country. So I\\'m really pleased to hand over to the Prime Minister now to talk further.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Alicia. And it\\'s great to be back here at one of the \\ncentres where we came in opposition, to talk about what a difference a change of government would make in taking \\nchild care seriously and in promoting early learning. Early learning is good for young ones, it\\'s also good for \\nfamilies, it\\'s also good for our economy. Because if we support women to be able to participate fully in the \\nworkforce there will be productivity benefits. It benefits them and their family budgets, but it also benefits \\nbusinesses who employ women, because they\\'re able to have greater continuity in their career. They retire with \\nhigher savings than they would otherwise, and it changes the dynamic in our workplaces. This was the first major \\nPage 2 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\ncommitment that I gave in my first budget reply, in the days when opposition leaders had policies and that made \\nannouncements in budget replies. We campaigned for three years with this as the largest on-budget investment \\nthat we are making during this term, and it\\'s the largest on-budget investment because there is nothing that is more \\nimportant than giving the best chance in life for our youngest Australians, some of whom we\\'ve met here today. \\nLearning that social interaction that\\'s so important, as well as learning skills that will give them a good run up to \\nwhen they start school. But also it\\'s so important for our national economy. It\\'s one of the themes as well of the \\nJobs and Skills Summit, and I\\'m very pleased that we put in place the mechanisms last year, in our first term we \\ncarried the legislation for cheaper child care that will benefit 1.2 million Australian families from July 1, but we\\'re not \\nresting there. We also committed to do a Productivity Commission Inquiry into the universal provision of early \\nlearning. Just as Labor is the party of universal Medicare, of universal superannuation, we also want to be the party \\nthat delivers universal, affordable child care - very important going forward. And that\\'s why today we\\'re announcing \\nthe Productivity Commission Inquiry with Professor Deborah Brennan as the person to undertake that enquiry. \\nThere\\'s no one more qualified than Professor Brennan to undertake this work. It will be a comprehensive inquiry \\nthat will report back to the government on the next steps that we will make. I lead an orderly government. A \\ngovernment that indicates what we are going to do and then gets on and does it. Making a difference as we have in \\nour first eight months, this will make a difference and it\\'s my great pleasure to ask the Professor to make some \\ncomments.\\nPROFESSOR DEBORAH BRENNAN: Thanks, Prime Minister. I\\'m Deb Brennan, I\\'m from the University of New \\nSouth Wales and I\\'ve been around the early childhood education and care policy world for a very long time. So I\\'m \\nabsolutely thrilled to have this opportunity to participate in a co-leadership role in the Productivity Commission \\nInquiry. We\\'ve got the foundations of a fantastic early childhood learning and care system in Australia. But \\neverybody knows there\\'s work to do. We\\'ve got challenges around affordability, access, workforce, many areas, so \\nwe\\'re going to have a really good look at the sector and come up with some suggestions for advancing the system \\nso that every child in Australia gets access to high quality learning and care.\\nJASON CLARE, MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: This is really important. The first five years of your life are \\neverything. Everything you see, everything you hear, every book you read, and every person you meet shapes the \\nperson that you become. What happens in places like this shape the person you become. Early education is good \\nfor kids, it\\'s good for parents, and it\\'s good for the economy. We promised to do three things in the election; first, to \\ncut the cost of child care, and that starts on the first of July. The legislation we passed last year will cut the cost of \\nchild care for more than a million Australian families. We also promised an ACCC inquiry into the driving costs \\nbehind child care. That work is now underway and they will provide their interim report in June and their final report \\nin December. And thirdly, we promised a big and broad, far-reaching inquiry into our early education system to set \\nus up for the next decade and beyond done by the Productivity Commission. And I\\'ve got to say, I am so glad that \\nDeborah, you have agreed to do this work for us. Last night I picked up the phone and spoke to leaders in the \\nsector to tell them that Professor Deborah Brennan would be doing this work. And I\\'ve got to tell you, the response \\nwas overwhelming. If you talk to the same people I spoke to last night, you will hear the same thing. Because \\nhonestly, there is no one more experienced and no one more respected by the early education sector to do this \\nwork. Deborah, I know this has been your life\\'s work and I thank you so much for helping us to write the next \\nchapter.\\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: This Productivity Commission Review that\\'s \\ngoing to be led by Professor Brennan, who brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to this review is just one \\npart of the Albanese Government\\'s reforms in early childhood education and care. We\\'ve started that with making \\nearly childhood education and care more affordable for 1.2 million families right across Australia. As Jason \\nmentioned, and as the Prime Minister mentioned, those first five years are critical, and we have the capacity \\nthrough early childhood education and care to change the trajectory of a child\\'s life. No child born into any form of \\ndisadvantage, no matter who they are, no matter where they live, no matter what background they come from. \\nEvery single child has the capacity to grow and develop if we focus, if we get it right in those first five years. And \\nthis Productivity Commission Review led by Professor Brennan is going to be a huge part of our reforms in early \\nchildhood education and care, carrying on the Labor government\\'s legacy in this area. It was a Labor government \\nthat first introduced the National Quality Framework when we were last in government, and we will continue that Page 3 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nlegacy because we know just how important those first five years are in a child\\'s life. But also how important good \\nquality, affordable early childhood education and care are for the economy, for parents, for allowing women who are \\npredominantly primary caregivers to get out there, to work, to choose to continue their education and develop \\nthemselves if they so wish. So like Jason, and like the Prime Minister, and Alicia Payne, I\\'m really, really excited to \\nwelcome Professor Brennan to the Productivity Commission Review. Thank you.\\nPRIME MINISTER: As you can see, we\\'re very excited about Professor Brennan\\'s appointment here this morning. \\nHappy to take questions.\\nJOURNALIST: On housing affordability, there\\'s new legislation being introduced today. Obviously, that\\'s a long term \\nplan, but will there be any relief for renters in the May Budget?\\nPRIME MINISTER: We\\'ll have the May Budget in May, but we\\'re already taking significant action when it comes to \\nhousing, including the introduction of the legislation that we\\'ll have today for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \\nThat\\'s important legislation, to boost the supply of housing but particularly social and community housing. In \\naddition to that, we\\'ve said that of those 30,000 additional social housing units that will be created, 4,000 of them \\nwill be set aside for women and children escaping domestic violence. In addition to that, we have our Emergency \\nHousing Fund, a $100 million increase. In addition to that, we have our National Housing Accord with the Master \\nBuilders Association, with state and territory governments, with the private sector, working together with the private \\nsector to boost housing supply. In addition to that, we\\'re creating our Housing Supply and Affordability Council \\nagain. Working with state and territory governments, as well as local government about freeing up land, about \\ncreating more support there in the housing sector. In addition to that, there was over half a billion dollars just sitting \\nthere not being used for housing that we have tapped into to provide that support. So we have a comprehensive \\nplan when it comes to housing, you\\'ll see more roll out, in an orderly way, just like we\\'re rolling out today\\'s \\nannouncement in an orderly way.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the first Australian shipment of coal has arrived in China, do you know how many \\nmore are expected to arrive in the near future, and are you confident that the shipments can increase with Don \\nFarrell visiting in the near future as well?\\nPRIME MINISTER: What I\\'m confident of is that the dynamic between Australia and China has changed, from one \\nwhere there wasn\\'t dialogue between ministers, to one where there is. And that dialogue is always a good idea. I\\'ve \\nsaid with regards to the relationship with China, that we will cooperate where we can, we will disagree where we \\nmust, and we\\'ll engage in our national interest. And when I met with President Xi, I indicated to him publicly, but \\nalso of course, privately, that it quite clearly was in Australia\\'s interests to export more to China. China currently \\nreceives more exports by value than the next three major trading partners combined. So that relationship is \\nimportant for Australian jobs, for our national economy, but there\\'s another thing it\\'s good for too. It\\'s good for China \\nto receive those goods, because we have not just resources, but we have wine, meat, barley, seafood - the best in \\nthe world. And it is in China\\'s interest for any impediments to be removed. I\\'m very pleased that Don Farrell had a \\nconstructive meeting this week with his counterpart in China. I\\'m pleased that Penny Wong visited Beijing on \\nDecember 21st to mark the 50th anniversary of relations between Australia and the People\\'s Republic of China. \\nAnd I look forward to both of our countries going forward in a constructive, cooperative way. These reports haven\\'t \\nbeen confirmed yet. We are cautious about making announcements before they\\'re confirmed. But quite clearly, I \\nthink if Australian business and Australian industry, what they tell me, including last night with business people I\\'ve \\nmet with, is that they are very pleased with the constructive direction of the relationship.\\nJOURNALIST: Further on China, US officials say that Chinese spy balloons are part of an effort to assess the \\nmilitary capabilities around the world. Does that concern you and does this incident in the US, do you see that as a \\nsetback in the engagement that was seen between Washington and Beijing and Canada?\\nPRIME MINISTER: We support the sovereignty of nations, including the United States, our great friends in the \\nUnited States. We consider all of the matters relating to national security and respond in an appropriate way and \\nwill continue to do so.Page 4 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nJOURNALIST: Disability workers and age care workers got big pay rises recently.

And it\\'s also about gender equality.\\n\"I don\\'t want to squander this platform, this opportunity, to make meaningful change.\"\\nStarting from July next year, the government will increase the maximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families \\nearning up to $80,000 and a sliding scale in subsidy rates for every family earning less than $530,000. It also plans \\nto extend the increased subsidy to outside-school-hours care.\\nDr Aly, who has represented the West Australian seat of Cowan since 2016, was the first Muslim woman elected to \\nfederal parliament.\\nShe will bring her complicated, and often traumatic, background to her role, which includes a second portfolio as \\nminister for youth.\\n‘Pathway to a better life\\'\\nHer family migrated from Egypt when she was two, and settled in western Sydney. Her professionally qualified \\nparents worked in factories and as a bus driver while she attended the Anglican girls school Meriden in Strathfield.\\nPage 2 of 2\\n‘Lived experience\\' will direct Aly\\'s policy choices\\nShe took herself back to Egypt for undergraduate studies in English and acting before returning to Australia, where \\nshe and her first husband lived in Perth.\\nThe marriage was violent. She left with her two sons and no money, discovering the brutal reality of a dole queue \\nand little hope. But she managed to scrape enough together to put herself through a master\\'s degree and PhD \\nbefore becoming a lecturer and international expert on counterterrorism.\\n\"For me, access to childcare meant I was able to lift myself out of poverty and chart a pathway to a better life for \\nmyself, and particularly for my children,\" Dr Aly said.\\n\"That meant I was able to secure the financial freedom that enabled me to have choices in life.

Which \\nis just as well because so far, things aren\\'t going according to plan.\\nWe had arranged to meet at Zeytin Turkish Cuisine on the foreshore of Lake Burley Griffin. But when I show up at \\nnoon sharp, not a sign of life.\\nI\\'m busily texting Aly\\'s people when, luckily, we run into each other - Canberra is a small place - so we amble a few \\nmetres along until we come to a cafe on the corner that seems, well, convenient.\\nWe grab a table outside and Aly immediately launches into a monologue about how to make a lemon chicken \\ntagine, which involves soaking the tagine pot in a bath for 24 hours, rubbing it with oil and then cooking the Middle-\\nEastern deliciousness for another 24 hours in a very low oven.\\nWe are scanning the menu and Aly announces she \"doesn\\'t do rice\", which is a staple of Middle Eastern cuisine \\nand which makes her some sort of pariah at family events. She opts for the grilled fennel chicken (no butter please) \\nand a very hot almond milk cappuccino. I choose the zucchini fritters and a bean-a-colada, which disappointingly \\nhas neither beans nor booze.\\nAly, let it be said, is prone to the odd swear word, as am I, and over the next 60 minutes our conversation is \\npeppered with F-bombs.\\nPage 2 of 4\\n\\'I\\'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS\\' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN\\nThe thrice-married Aly had already lived a complex and somewhat haphazard life before she decided rather \\nspontaneously to run as the Labor candidate for the West Australian seat Cowan in 2016. She managed to turf out \\nthe Liberal incumbent Luke Simpkins by the finest of margins. \"It took 10 days to count the vote,\" she says.\\nIn 2019, she increased her margin and by 2022 she harnessed 46.9 per cent of the vote, adding more than 9 per \\ncent to her 2019 numbers.\\nOf that first campaign, she remembers standing at a train station with a picture of herself while waving at cars. A \\nyear ago to the day, she had been invited to speak at the White House at a counterterrorism conference. \"All I could \\nthink was from the White House to Greenwood station. What have I done?\"\\nAly was born Azza Mahmoud Fawzi Hosseini Ali el Serougi in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1967, the daughter of a nurse \\nand a textiles engineer who migrated to Australia in 1969. They were among the last migrants to be received at the \\nBonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre in Albury-Wodonga - which, having made the world\\'s headlines \\ntwo decades earlier over the death from malnutrition of 13 children, had improved conditions considerably.\\nThe family moved first to Marrickville in Sydney\\'s inner west and then, just on the cusp of shifting to Texas, they \\nrelocated to Brisbane, where Aly\\'s dad got a job at the Jennings factory, which made corsets and women\\'s \\nunderwear.\\nThey bought their first house in the very un-chi chi suburb of West End.\\n\"And then in 1974 came the flood. My parents came from a desert country, they had never seen anything like this,\" \\nAly says.\\n\"But it was a defining feature of our Australian story because what we found was a community. It was almost like \\nthey became Australian through the tragedy.\"\\nMoments like that, she says, stand in stark contrast to other moments of division and rancour that have \\ncharacterised the same-sex marriage plebiscite, the Voice referendum and the uncontained racism that followed the \\n9/11 attacks in New York.\\nThe current situation in Gaza is confronting, she says. Aly joined Ed Husic last month to warn Gaza\\'s 2.3 million \\nresidents were being \"collectively punished\" for the crimes of terrorists.\\nAs the Israel-Hamas war becomes more divisive, Aly says she is trying to demonstrate how \"important it is that we \\nrecognise each other\\'s humanity and show compassion to each other, even when we are hurting the most\".\\nAs the minister for early childhood education, and also the minister for youth, Aly has a lot on her plate as she \\nmarshals through two reviews of the childcare and early learning sectors.\\nThe government is moving, slowly, towards adopting a model of universal access. In July, it increased the \\nmaximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning up to $80,000, and a sliding scale in subsidies for families \\nearning less than $530,000.\\n\"The fact is Australia is one of the most expensive places for early childhood education and care,\" says Aly.\\n\"We have a quality system that is world-class, and a quality framework that has been in place for 10 years. The \\nissue is the cost and the fact that the market isn\\'t behaving the way you would expect. It doesn\\'t go to where the \\ndemand is, it goes to where the money is.\"\\nThe delivery of the Productivity Commission report this week and the Australian Competition and Consumer \\nCommission\\'s investigation will ensure childcare remains one of the hot button issues for the Albanese government \\nin coming months.Page 3 of 4\\n\\'I\\'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS\\' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN\\nAly will be familiar to most people, even if they haven\\'t connected the name to the face.

She scowls and boos. She never drifts off or checks her \\nphone.\\nAlways impeccably well-dressed, Aly\\'s choice of clothing has taken a twist in the past couple of years as she took \\nup crochet and knitting as a form of meditation and mindfulness as she takes endless flights between Canberra and \\nPerth.\\nThe white jumper she wears to lunch is handcrafted (and has a matching skirt), as was the crochet long dress she \\nwore to this year\\'s Mid-Winter Ball. She is already working on next year\\'s dress, which will feature crocheted \\nflowers, each unique, representing every woman who died from domestic violence during the year.\\nAly has her own story of domestic violence, one that is told in her 2018 autobiography Finding My Place: From \\nCairo to Canberra - the Irresistible Story of an Irrepressible Woman.\\nShe had married young, at the age of 20, while living back in Egypt, where she was studying English literature, with \\na minor in acting. The marriage wasn\\'t arranged, as was common for girls like her. Rather, it was a way of escaping \\nthe strictures of being a single woman in a Muslim country.\\n\"The marriage gave me a freedom that I didn\\'t have living under my parents\\' roof. It gave me the freedom to be a \\nrespectable married woman in Egypt. It meant I could go camping with friends, I could go to parties, I could come \\nhome when I wanted to.\"\\nThere were red flags which she ignored - or didn\\'t know any better.\\nBut after moving to Perth, the violence and contemptuous behaviour escalated.\\n\"There was a bit of martyrdom on my behalf. But there are a lot of stereotypes around women who are survivors, a \\nlot of us are high achievers. The feelings of responsibility and humiliation; we expect more of ourselves,\" she says.\\n\"I remember driving away once and saying out loud to myself: \\'You must be just the kind of woman that men hit.\\' I\\'d \\nresigned myself to it.\\n\"I describe domestic violence as this crack in a bone somewhere in your body that you carry with you through your \\nlife.\\n\"It\\'s hard to imagine myself as the person I was.

The rate steps down so families earning \\nbetween $175,000 and $254,300 receive a 50 per cent subsidy and then steps further so those earning between \\n$344,300 and $354,300 get a 20 per cent subsidy. Above this income threshold, there is no subsidy.\\nChanges that started in March increased the subsidy rate for second and subsequent children where families have \\nmore than one child under the age of 5 in care, by 30 percentage points, up to a maximum of 95 per cent.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nParents set to save hundreds on childcare fees - but not until next year\\nLabor\\'s proposal will lift the subsidy rate for all families, smooth out the taper rate so it doesn\\'t abruptly step down, \\nand gives subsidies to families earning up to $530,000.

She\\'ll also ask the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to design a \\nprice regulation mechanism to make sure higher subsidies don\\'t translate into higher fees.\\nWhile the Coalition attacked Labor\\'s plan for paying the fees of wealthy families, those at the top end of the income \\nscale get the lowest subsidies - about 7 per cent for a household income of $500,000.\\nAn analysis of the proposal by ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods associate professor Ben Phillips finds \\nthat while the largest benefits in dollar terms would go to parents in the top 20 per cent of incomes, that is because \\nthey get either no subsidy or a lower level under the existing scheme.\\nThose earning up to $86,000 will be an average $358 better off a year.\\nOut of the almost 1.2 million families using childcare each year, all but about 14,300 would be better off than they \\nare now.\\nDent said it was also important the government dealt with existing workforce shortages before adding extra demand \\nfor childcare.\\nShe\\'s been hearing from parents whose childcare centres are having to restrict the number of places on offer or \\neven close rooms because they can\\'t get enough staff.\\n\"The situation with the workforce is a crisis and it\\'s only increasing,\" she said.\\nAly says addressing the workforce shortage has to be a cross-portfolio effort.

I\\'m Alicia Payne, the Federal Member for Canberra \\nand it\\'s my great pleasure this morning to be here at MOCCA in Manuka with the Prime Minister, Anthony \\nAlbanese, the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, and the Minister for Early Childhood, Anne Aly. And I want to \\nsay a huge thank you to Kara and the team here at MOCCA for welcoming us again to their beautiful centre, and to \\nthe children who we had such a lovely play with Lego this morning. I\\'m so proud that our government is a \\ngovernment that values early childhood education and care. And from 1 July this year, over one million families will \\nbenefit from our Cheaper Child Care policy. This is good for families, and you\\'ll have more young children gain \\naccess to the great benefits of early childhood education and care. And that more parents can better balance work \\nand parenting - particularly women. Because for too long the high costs of child care have put a brake on their \\neconomic participation. I know this is a huge issue for families in Canberra where we have some of the highest child \\ncare costs in the country. So I\\'m really pleased to hand over to the Prime Minister now to talk further.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Alicia. And it\\'s great to be back here at one of the \\ncentres where we came in opposition, to talk about what a difference a change of government would make in taking \\nchild care seriously and in promoting early learning. Early learning is good for young ones, it\\'s also good for \\nfamilies, it\\'s also good for our economy. Because if we support women to be able to participate fully in the \\nworkforce there will be productivity benefits. It benefits them and their family budgets, but it also benefits \\nbusinesses who employ women, because they\\'re able to have greater continuity in their career. They retire with \\nhigher savings than they would otherwise, and it changes the dynamic in our workplaces. This was the first major \\nPage 2 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\ncommitment that I gave in my first budget reply, in the days when opposition leaders had policies and that made \\nannouncements in budget replies. We campaigned for three years with this as the largest on-budget investment \\nthat we are making during this term, and it\\'s the largest on-budget investment because there is nothing that is more \\nimportant than giving the best chance in life for our youngest Australians, some of whom we\\'ve met here today. \\nLearning that social interaction that\\'s so important, as well as learning skills that will give them a good run up to \\nwhen they start school. But also it\\'s so important for our national economy. It\\'s one of the themes as well of the \\nJobs and Skills Summit, and I\\'m very pleased that we put in place the mechanisms last year, in our first term we \\ncarried the legislation for cheaper child care that will benefit 1.2 million Australian families from July 1, but we\\'re not \\nresting there. We also committed to do a Productivity Commission Inquiry into the universal provision of early \\nlearning. Just as Labor is the party of universal Medicare, of universal superannuation, we also want to be the party \\nthat delivers universal, affordable child care - very important going forward. And that\\'s why today we\\'re announcing \\nthe Productivity Commission Inquiry with Professor Deborah Brennan as the person to undertake that enquiry. \\nThere\\'s no one more qualified than Professor Brennan to undertake this work. It will be a comprehensive inquiry \\nthat will report back to the government on the next steps that we will make. I lead an orderly government. A \\ngovernment that indicates what we are going to do and then gets on and does it. Making a difference as we have in \\nour first eight months, this will make a difference and it\\'s my great pleasure to ask the Professor to make some \\ncomments.\\nPROFESSOR DEBORAH BRENNAN: Thanks, Prime Minister. I\\'m Deb Brennan, I\\'m from the University of New \\nSouth Wales and I\\'ve been around the early childhood education and care policy world for a very long time. So I\\'m \\nabsolutely thrilled to have this opportunity to participate in a co-leadership role in the Productivity Commission \\nInquiry. We\\'ve got the foundations of a fantastic early childhood learning and care system in Australia. But \\neverybody knows there\\'s work to do. We\\'ve got challenges around affordability, access, workforce, many areas, so \\nwe\\'re going to have a really good look at the sector and come up with some suggestions for advancing the system \\nso that every child in Australia gets access to high quality learning and care.\\nJASON CLARE, MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: This is really important. The first five years of your life are \\neverything. Everything you see, everything you hear, every book you read, and every person you meet shapes the \\nperson that you become. What happens in places like this shape the person you become. Early education is good \\nfor kids, it\\'s good for parents, and it\\'s good for the economy. We promised to do three things in the election; first, to \\ncut the cost of child care, and that starts on the first of July. The legislation we passed last year will cut the cost of \\nchild care for more than a million Australian families. We also promised an ACCC inquiry into the driving costs \\nbehind child care. That work is now underway and they will provide their interim report in June and their final report \\nin December. And thirdly, we promised a big and broad, far-reaching inquiry into our early education system to set \\nus up for the next decade and beyond done by the Productivity Commission. And I\\'ve got to say, I am so glad that \\nDeborah, you have agreed to do this work for us. Last night I picked up the phone and spoke to leaders in the \\nsector to tell them that Professor Deborah Brennan would be doing this work. And I\\'ve got to tell you, the response \\nwas overwhelming. If you talk to the same people I spoke to last night, you will hear the same thing. Because \\nhonestly, there is no one more experienced and no one more respected by the early education sector to do this \\nwork. Deborah, I know this has been your life\\'s work and I thank you so much for helping us to write the next \\nchapter.\\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: This Productivity Commission Review that\\'s \\ngoing to be led by Professor Brennan, who brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to this review is just one \\npart of the Albanese Government\\'s reforms in early childhood education and care. We\\'ve started that with making \\nearly childhood education and care more affordable for 1.2 million families right across Australia. As Jason \\nmentioned, and as the Prime Minister mentioned, those first five years are critical, and we have the capacity \\nthrough early childhood education and care to change the trajectory of a child\\'s life. No child born into any form of \\ndisadvantage, no matter who they are, no matter where they live, no matter what background they come from. \\nEvery single child has the capacity to grow and develop if we focus, if we get it right in those first five years. And \\nthis Productivity Commission Review led by Professor Brennan is going to be a huge part of our reforms in early \\nchildhood education and care, carrying on the Labor government\\'s legacy in this area. It was a Labor government \\nthat first introduced the National Quality Framework when we were last in government, and we will continue that Page 3 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nlegacy because we know just how important those first five years are in a child\\'s life. But also how important good \\nquality, affordable early childhood education and care are for the economy, for parents, for allowing women who are \\npredominantly primary caregivers to get out there, to work, to choose to continue their education and develop \\nthemselves if they so wish. So like Jason, and like the Prime Minister, and Alicia Payne, I\\'m really, really excited to \\nwelcome Professor Brennan to the Productivity Commission Review. Thank you.\\nPRIME MINISTER: As you can see, we\\'re very excited about Professor Brennan\\'s appointment here this morning. \\nHappy to take questions.\\nJOURNALIST: On housing affordability, there\\'s new legislation being introduced today. Obviously, that\\'s a long term \\nplan, but will there be any relief for renters in the May Budget?\\nPRIME MINISTER: We\\'ll have the May Budget in May, but we\\'re already taking significant action when it comes to \\nhousing, including the introduction of the legislation that we\\'ll have today for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \\nThat\\'s important legislation, to boost the supply of housing but particularly social and community housing. In \\naddition to that, we\\'ve said that of those 30,000 additional social housing units that will be created, 4,000 of them \\nwill be set aside for women and children escaping domestic violence. In addition to that, we have our Emergency \\nHousing Fund, a $100 million increase. In addition to that, we have our National Housing Accord with the Master \\nBuilders Association, with state and territory governments, with the private sector, working together with the private \\nsector to boost housing supply. In addition to that, we\\'re creating our Housing Supply and Affordability Council \\nagain. Working with state and territory governments, as well as local government about freeing up land, about \\ncreating more support there in the housing sector. In addition to that, there was over half a billion dollars just sitting \\nthere not being used for housing that we have tapped into to provide that support. So we have a comprehensive \\nplan when it comes to housing, you\\'ll see more roll out, in an orderly way, just like we\\'re rolling out today\\'s \\nannouncement in an orderly way.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the first Australian shipment of coal has arrived in China, do you know how many \\nmore are expected to arrive in the near future, and are you confident that the shipments can increase with Don \\nFarrell visiting in the near future as well?\\nPRIME MINISTER: What I\\'m confident of is that the dynamic between Australia and China has changed, from one \\nwhere there wasn\\'t dialogue between ministers, to one where there is. And that dialogue is always a good idea. I\\'ve \\nsaid with regards to the relationship with China, that we will cooperate where we can, we will disagree where we \\nmust, and we\\'ll engage in our national interest. And when I met with President Xi, I indicated to him publicly, but \\nalso of course, privately, that it quite clearly was in Australia\\'s interests to export more to China. China currently \\nreceives more exports by value than the next three major trading partners combined. So that relationship is \\nimportant for Australian jobs, for our national economy, but there\\'s another thing it\\'s good for too. It\\'s good for China \\nto receive those goods, because we have not just resources, but we have wine, meat, barley, seafood - the best in \\nthe world. And it is in China\\'s interest for any impediments to be removed. I\\'m very pleased that Don Farrell had a \\nconstructive meeting this week with his counterpart in China. I\\'m pleased that Penny Wong visited Beijing on \\nDecember 21st to mark the 50th anniversary of relations between Australia and the People\\'s Republic of China. \\nAnd I look forward to both of our countries going forward in a constructive, cooperative way. These reports haven\\'t \\nbeen confirmed yet. We are cautious about making announcements before they\\'re confirmed. But quite clearly, I \\nthink if Australian business and Australian industry, what they tell me, including last night with business people I\\'ve \\nmet with, is that they are very pleased with the constructive direction of the relationship.\\nJOURNALIST: Further on China, US officials say that Chinese spy balloons are part of an effort to assess the \\nmilitary capabilities around the world. Does that concern you and does this incident in the US, do you see that as a \\nsetback in the engagement that was seen between Washington and Beijing and Canada?\\nPRIME MINISTER: We support the sovereignty of nations, including the United States, our great friends in the \\nUnited States. We consider all of the matters relating to national security and respond in an appropriate way and \\nwill continue to do so.Page 4 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nJOURNALIST: Disability workers and age care workers got big pay rises recently. The Childcare Workers Union \\nhas called for a 25% pay rise. We know pay is a huge factor in this industry. Would you back a pay rise like that for \\nchild care workers?\\nPRIME MINISTER: The government doesn\\'t determine the level of wages for everybody in the sector.\\nJOURNALIST: But do you support their push?\\nPRIME MINISTER: What I support is people being paid fairly, and I won\\'t comment on specifics because that\\'s the \\njob of the Fair Work Commission to consider these matters independently of government and come to decisions. \\nWhat I would say though, and what I\\'ve said publicly a number of times, including yesterday at the UN International \\nWomen\\'s Day event that was held yesterday morning, is that if you look at the sectors where people are underpaid, \\nthey have something in common, two things: One, they are the very sectors that got us through the pandemic. Our \\ncleaners, our aged care workers, our childcare workers. There\\'s something else they\\'ve got in common as well. \\nThey are largely feminised industries, and that\\'s why, when we made changes to industrial regulations, I announced \\nat our campaign launch in Perth last year that we would very specially have measures that allowed the gender pay \\ngap to be considered. We had legislation yesterday as well about transparency, so that the gender pay gap can be \\nidentified for larger companies as well. So I will conclude with this by saying, early learning educators do a fantastic \\njob. They\\'re valued by parents, they\\'re valued by children who grow to love them and have a relationship with them. \\nThis isn\\'t just a normal job, as much as I love all the journalists here, our relationship is different. Between the \\neducators and the children who they look after. And I have every respect for the educators and the work that they \\ndo.\\nJOURNALIST: One on the Referendum Machinery Act please if I could. Yesterday, Katy Gallagher said that you \\nwould go ahead with the information pamphlet. In December, Don Farrell and Mark Dreyfus said \"there\\'s no longer \\nany need for taxpayers to pay for a pamphlet to be sent to every household. The Referendum Act does not reflect \\nmodern delivery and communications methods.\" Do you still agree with that? Has your view changed or is this \\nbringing back the pamphlet a concession to just get it through the Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Both things are right. The truth is, I don\\'t know about you Josh, when was the last letter you \\nsent?\\nJOURNALIST: I think it was around Christmas.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Apart from Christmas Cards, when was the last letter you sent?\\nJOURNALIST: You\\'re testing my memory, it\\'s not my press conference.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Has anyone here sent a letter this year?\\nJOURNALIST: Last week, to the US Consulate.\\nPRIME MINISTER: That\\'s not a letter, that\\'s an application. The world has changed how we communicate. But I \\ncould have said, we will engage constructively. One of the Senators approached, we made this decision a week \\nago, one of the Senators approached and said, this will make a big difference for our approach. I don\\'t know how \\nmany times I can say this at press conferences, we will do what we need to do to broaden support for this. The \\nreferendum that will be held later this year is about two things, recognition and consultation. Recognising Aboriginal \\nand Torres Strait Islander People in our Constitution and consulting them on matters that affect them, that\\'s what it\\'s \\nabout. Now we want to maximise support for that. So if anyone has, as I said, I await any member of the House of \\nRepresentatives or the Senate to examine the question and the draft changes that I put forward at Garma last year. \\nNow, I\\'ll give you the exclusive, just for you, so if everyone else can not listen, if there\\'s a constructive suggestion, \\nthat\\'s backed in by lawyers, we\\'ll change that. If there\\'s a suggestion, there hasn\\'t been one, there hasn\\'t been one. \\nI want this to succeed. I\\'m not being dogmatic about this. This is not our proposal, this is a proposal that came from \\nthe bottom up. And you need to think of the counterfactual of what happens if this referendum succeeds. If this \\nreferendum succeeds, Indigenous Australians will be shown the respect that they deserve. Australians will all know Page 5 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nthat we\\'ve acknowledged the great privilege that we have of sharing this continent with the oldest continuous \\nculture on earth. And the world will see that Australia\\'s a mature country, a mature country that can be honest \\nabout our history and can celebrate that history. That\\'s what this is about. It\\'s not about party politics. And that\\'s \\nwhat every state Premier and Chief Minister understands. And I just say to my colleagues on the Hill, this isn\\'t the \\nopportunity to look for division. This is the opportunity to look for national unity, to embrace the opportunity which is \\nthere. So, if someone has a suggestion, by all means put it forward. I\\'m up for it, in terms of, whether a pamphlet \\ngoes out, it doesn\\'t hurt, a pamphlet going out. People are going to put things in letterboxes anyway during the \\nreferendum. If people want taxpayers to pay for it, there\\'s a judgement call there, fine. Taxpayers shouldn\\'t be \\nfunding the campaigns of Yes and No. That should be up to people to fund. There should be equal funding and \\nthere will be under the under the proposal that we have. I also welcome Simon Birmingham\\'s comments this \\nmorning. Simon Birmingham has said very clearly that there shouldn\\'t be funding of the Yes and No case. I \\nwelcome the comments of Simon Birmingham. I welcome anyone who wants to join this journey on the path to \\nreconciliation.\\nJOURNALIST: There are strong indications that Vladimir Putin signed off on the supply of weapons used to shoot \\ndown MH17. If you could look at him in the eye today, what would you say to Vladimir Putin?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I\\'d say that you are reprehensible. That Vladimir Putin, clearly, the shooting down of MH17 was \\nan act of terrorism that had an impact here in Australia, but on many countries as well. And we will continue to \\npursue these issues with every avenue at our disposal.\\nJOURNALIST: So how do you feel about the suspension of the criminal investigation into the downing of MH17?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I think I just answered how I feel about it. The issue, of course, of the Russian invasion of \\nUkraine, this is a guy who runs an authoritarian regime that doesn\\'t care about human rights, that doesn\\'t care \\nabout devastation of communities, whether it be in Ukraine, whether it be the oppression of its own citizens, or \\nwhether the acts outside of Russia of which we\\'ve seen a number. The travesty of MH17 is an issue in which he \\nshould be held to account and Australia will continue to pursue all of these issues with every avenue at our \\ndisposal.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, this morning the Deputy PM has indicated he wants to get rid of Chinese linked \\nsurveillance cameras from government buildings. We spoke about the relationship with China earlier, the last time \\nthe Australian government tried to ban or exclude a Chinese company from communications in any form in \\nAustralia, it was detrimental to our relationship with China. Are you concerned about how Beijing will react to the \\nremoval of those devices?\\nPRIME MINISTER: No, we act in accordance with Australia\\'s national interest.

I\\'m Alicia Payne, the Federal Member for Canberra \\nand it\\'s my great pleasure this morning to be here at MOCCA in Manuka with the Prime Minister, Anthony \\nAlbanese, the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, and the Minister for Early Childhood, Anne Aly. And I want to \\nsay a huge thank you to Kara and the team here at MOCCA for welcoming us again to their beautiful centre, and to \\nthe children who we had such a lovely play with Lego this morning. I\\'m so proud that our government is a \\ngovernment that values early childhood education and care. And from 1 July this year, over one million families will \\nbenefit from our Cheaper Child Care policy. This is good for families, and you\\'ll have more young children gain \\naccess to the great benefits of early childhood education and care. And that more parents can better balance work \\nand parenting - particularly women. Because for too long the high costs of child care have put a brake on their \\neconomic participation. I know this is a huge issue for families in Canberra where we have some of the highest child \\ncare costs in the country. So I\\'m really pleased to hand over to the Prime Minister now to talk further.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Alicia. And it\\'s great to be back here at one of the \\ncentres where we came in opposition, to talk about what a difference a change of government would make in taking \\nchild care seriously and in promoting early learning. Early learning is good for young ones, it\\'s also good for \\nfamilies, it\\'s also good for our economy. Because if we support women to be able to participate fully in the \\nworkforce there will be productivity benefits. It benefits them and their family budgets, but it also benefits \\nbusinesses who employ women, because they\\'re able to have greater continuity in their career. They retire with \\nhigher savings than they would otherwise, and it changes the dynamic in our workplaces. This was the first major \\nPage 2 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\ncommitment that I gave in my first budget reply, in the days when opposition leaders had policies and that made \\nannouncements in budget replies. We campaigned for three years with this as the largest on-budget investment \\nthat we are making during this term, and it\\'s the largest on-budget investment because there is nothing that is more \\nimportant than giving the best chance in life for our youngest Australians, some of whom we\\'ve met here today. \\nLearning that social interaction that\\'s so important, as well as learning skills that will give them a good run up to \\nwhen they start school. But also it\\'s so important for our national economy. It\\'s one of the themes as well of the \\nJobs and Skills Summit, and I\\'m very pleased that we put in place the mechanisms last year, in our first term we \\ncarried the legislation for cheaper child care that will benefit 1.2 million Australian families from July 1, but we\\'re not \\nresting there. We also committed to do a Productivity Commission Inquiry into the universal provision of early \\nlearning. Just as Labor is the party of universal Medicare, of universal superannuation, we also want to be the party \\nthat delivers universal, affordable child care - very important going forward. And that\\'s why today we\\'re announcing \\nthe Productivity Commission Inquiry with Professor Deborah Brennan as the person to undertake that enquiry. \\nThere\\'s no one more qualified than Professor Brennan to undertake this work. It will be a comprehensive inquiry \\nthat will report back to the government on the next steps that we will make. I lead an orderly government. A \\ngovernment that indicates what we are going to do and then gets on and does it. Making a difference as we have in \\nour first eight months, this will make a difference and it\\'s my great pleasure to ask the Professor to make some \\ncomments.\\nPROFESSOR DEBORAH BRENNAN: Thanks, Prime Minister. I\\'m Deb Brennan, I\\'m from the University of New \\nSouth Wales and I\\'ve been around the early childhood education and care policy world for a very long time. So I\\'m \\nabsolutely thrilled to have this opportunity to participate in a co-leadership role in the Productivity Commission \\nInquiry. We\\'ve got the foundations of a fantastic early childhood learning and care system in Australia. But \\neverybody knows there\\'s work to do. We\\'ve got challenges around affordability, access, workforce, many areas, so \\nwe\\'re going to have a really good look at the sector and come up with some suggestions for advancing the system \\nso that every child in Australia gets access to high quality learning and care.\\nJASON CLARE, MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: This is really important. The first five years of your life are \\neverything. Everything you see, everything you hear, every book you read, and every person you meet shapes the \\nperson that you become. What happens in places like this shape the person you become. Early education is good \\nfor kids, it\\'s good for parents, and it\\'s good for the economy. We promised to do three things in the election; first, to \\ncut the cost of child care, and that starts on the first of July. The legislation we passed last year will cut the cost of \\nchild care for more than a million Australian families. We also promised an ACCC inquiry into the driving costs \\nbehind child care. That work is now underway and they will provide their interim report in June and their final report \\nin December. And thirdly, we promised a big and broad, far-reaching inquiry into our early education system to set \\nus up for the next decade and beyond done by the Productivity Commission. And I\\'ve got to say, I am so glad that \\nDeborah, you have agreed to do this work for us. Last night I picked up the phone and spoke to leaders in the \\nsector to tell them that Professor Deborah Brennan would be doing this work. And I\\'ve got to tell you, the response \\nwas overwhelming. If you talk to the same people I spoke to last night, you will hear the same thing. Because \\nhonestly, there is no one more experienced and no one more respected by the early education sector to do this \\nwork. Deborah, I know this has been your life\\'s work and I thank you so much for helping us to write the next \\nchapter.\\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: This Productivity Commission Review that\\'s \\ngoing to be led by Professor Brennan, who brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to this review is just one \\npart of the Albanese Government\\'s reforms in early childhood education and care. We\\'ve started that with making \\nearly childhood education and care more affordable for 1.2 million families right across Australia. As Jason \\nmentioned, and as the Prime Minister mentioned, those first five years are critical, and we have the capacity \\nthrough early childhood education and care to change the trajectory of a child\\'s life. No child born into any form of \\ndisadvantage, no matter who they are, no matter where they live, no matter what background they come from. \\nEvery single child has the capacity to grow and develop if we focus, if we get it right in those first five years. And \\nthis Productivity Commission Review led by Professor Brennan is going to be a huge part of our reforms in early \\nchildhood education and care, carrying on the Labor government\\'s legacy in this area. It was a Labor government \\nthat first introduced the National Quality Framework when we were last in government, and we will continue that Page 3 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nlegacy because we know just how important those first five years are in a child\\'s life. But also how important good \\nquality, affordable early childhood education and care are for the economy, for parents, for allowing women who are \\npredominantly primary caregivers to get out there, to work, to choose to continue their education and develop \\nthemselves if they so wish. So like Jason, and like the Prime Minister, and Alicia Payne, I\\'m really, really excited to \\nwelcome Professor Brennan to the Productivity Commission Review. Thank you.\\nPRIME MINISTER: As you can see, we\\'re very excited about Professor Brennan\\'s appointment here this morning. \\nHappy to take questions.\\nJOURNALIST: On housing affordability, there\\'s new legislation being introduced today. Obviously, that\\'s a long term \\nplan, but will there be any relief for renters in the May Budget?\\nPRIME MINISTER: We\\'ll have the May Budget in May, but we\\'re already taking significant action when it comes to \\nhousing, including the introduction of the legislation that we\\'ll have today for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \\nThat\\'s important legislation, to boost the supply of housing but particularly social and community housing. In \\naddition to that, we\\'ve said that of those 30,000 additional social housing units that will be created, 4,000 of them \\nwill be set aside for women and children escaping domestic violence. In addition to that, we have our Emergency \\nHousing Fund, a $100 million increase. In addition to that, we have our National Housing Accord with the Master \\nBuilders Association, with state and territory governments, with the private sector, working together with the private \\nsector to boost housing supply. In addition to that, we\\'re creating our Housing Supply and Affordability Council \\nagain. Working with state and territory governments, as well as local government about freeing up land, about \\ncreating more support there in the housing sector. In addition to that, there was over half a billion dollars just sitting \\nthere not being used for housing that we have tapped into to provide that support. So we have a comprehensive \\nplan when it comes to housing, you\\'ll see more roll out, in an orderly way, just like we\\'re rolling out today\\'s \\nannouncement in an orderly way.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the first Australian shipment of coal has arrived in China, do you know how many \\nmore are expected to arrive in the near future, and are you confident that the shipments can increase with Don \\nFarrell visiting in the near future as well?\\nPRIME MINISTER: What I\\'m confident of is that the dynamic between Australia and China has changed, from one \\nwhere there wasn\\'t dialogue between ministers, to one where there is. And that dialogue is always a good idea.

I\\'m Alicia Payne, the Federal Member for Canberra \\nand it\\'s my great pleasure this morning to be here at MOCCA in Manuka with the Prime Minister, Anthony \\nAlbanese, the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, and the Minister for Early Childhood, Anne Aly. And I want to \\nsay a huge thank you to Kara and the team here at MOCCA for welcoming us again to their beautiful centre, and to \\nthe children who we had such a lovely play with Lego this morning. I\\'m so proud that our government is a \\ngovernment that values early childhood education and care. And from 1 July this year, over one million families will \\nbenefit from our Cheaper Child Care policy. This is good for families, and you\\'ll have more young children gain \\naccess to the great benefits of early childhood education and care. And that more parents can better balance work \\nand parenting - particularly women. Because for too long the high costs of child care have put a brake on their \\neconomic participation. I know this is a huge issue for families in Canberra where we have some of the highest child \\ncare costs in the country. So I\\'m really pleased to hand over to the Prime Minister now to talk further.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Alicia. And it\\'s great to be back here at one of the \\ncentres where we came in opposition, to talk about what a difference a change of government would make in taking \\nchild care seriously and in promoting early learning. Early learning is good for young ones, it\\'s also good for \\nfamilies, it\\'s also good for our economy. Because if we support women to be able to participate fully in the \\nworkforce there will be productivity benefits. It benefits them and their family budgets, but it also benefits \\nbusinesses who employ women, because they\\'re able to have greater continuity in their career. They retire with \\nhigher savings than they would otherwise, and it changes the dynamic in our workplaces. This was the first major \\nPage 2 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\ncommitment that I gave in my first budget reply, in the days when opposition leaders had policies and that made \\nannouncements in budget replies. We campaigned for three years with this as the largest on-budget investment \\nthat we are making during this term, and it\\'s the largest on-budget investment because there is nothing that is more \\nimportant than giving the best chance in life for our youngest Australians, some of whom we\\'ve met here today. \\nLearning that social interaction that\\'s so important, as well as learning skills that will give them a good run up to \\nwhen they start school. But also it\\'s so important for our national economy. It\\'s one of the themes as well of the \\nJobs and Skills Summit, and I\\'m very pleased that we put in place the mechanisms last year, in our first term we \\ncarried the legislation for cheaper child care that will benefit 1.2 million Australian families from July 1, but we\\'re not \\nresting there. We also committed to do a Productivity Commission Inquiry into the universal provision of early \\nlearning. Just as Labor is the party of universal Medicare, of universal superannuation, we also want to be the party \\nthat delivers universal, affordable child care - very important going forward. And that\\'s why today we\\'re announcing \\nthe Productivity Commission Inquiry with Professor Deborah Brennan as the person to undertake that enquiry. \\nThere\\'s no one more qualified than Professor Brennan to undertake this work. It will be a comprehensive inquiry \\nthat will report back to the government on the next steps that we will make. I lead an orderly government. A \\ngovernment that indicates what we are going to do and then gets on and does it. Making a difference as we have in \\nour first eight months, this will make a difference and it\\'s my great pleasure to ask the Professor to make some \\ncomments.\\nPROFESSOR DEBORAH BRENNAN: Thanks, Prime Minister. I\\'m Deb Brennan, I\\'m from the University of New \\nSouth Wales and I\\'ve been around the early childhood education and care policy world for a very long time. So I\\'m \\nabsolutely thrilled to have this opportunity to participate in a co-leadership role in the Productivity Commission \\nInquiry. We\\'ve got the foundations of a fantastic early childhood learning and care system in Australia. But \\neverybody knows there\\'s work to do. We\\'ve got challenges around affordability, access, workforce, many areas, so \\nwe\\'re going to have a really good look at the sector and come up with some suggestions for advancing the system \\nso that every child in Australia gets access to high quality learning and care.\\nJASON CLARE, MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: This is really important. The first five years of your life are \\neverything. Everything you see, everything you hear, every book you read, and every person you meet shapes the \\nperson that you become. What happens in places like this shape the person you become. Early education is good \\nfor kids, it\\'s good for parents, and it\\'s good for the economy. We promised to do three things in the election; first, to \\ncut the cost of child care, and that starts on the first of July. The legislation we passed last year will cut the cost of \\nchild care for more than a million Australian families. We also promised an ACCC inquiry into the driving costs \\nbehind child care. That work is now underway and they will provide their interim report in June and their final report \\nin December. And thirdly, we promised a big and broad, far-reaching inquiry into our early education system to set \\nus up for the next decade and beyond done by the Productivity Commission. And I\\'ve got to say, I am so glad that \\nDeborah, you have agreed to do this work for us. Last night I picked up the phone and spoke to leaders in the \\nsector to tell them that Professor Deborah Brennan would be doing this work. And I\\'ve got to tell you, the response \\nwas overwhelming. If you talk to the same people I spoke to last night, you will hear the same thing. Because \\nhonestly, there is no one more experienced and no one more respected by the early education sector to do this \\nwork. Deborah, I know this has been your life\\'s work and I thank you so much for helping us to write the next \\nchapter.\\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: This Productivity Commission Review that\\'s \\ngoing to be led by Professor Brennan, who brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to this review is just one \\npart of the Albanese Government\\'s reforms in early childhood education and care. We\\'ve started that with making \\nearly childhood education and care more affordable for 1.2 million families right across Australia. As Jason \\nmentioned, and as the Prime Minister mentioned, those first five years are critical, and we have the capacity \\nthrough early childhood education and care to change the trajectory of a child\\'s life. No child born into any form of \\ndisadvantage, no matter who they are, no matter where they live, no matter what background they come from. \\nEvery single child has the capacity to grow and develop if we focus, if we get it right in those first five years. And \\nthis Productivity Commission Review led by Professor Brennan is going to be a huge part of our reforms in early \\nchildhood education and care, carrying on the Labor government\\'s legacy in this area. It was a Labor government \\nthat first introduced the National Quality Framework when we were last in government, and we will continue that Page 3 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nlegacy because we know just how important those first five years are in a child\\'s life. But also how important good \\nquality, affordable early childhood education and care are for the economy, for parents, for allowing women who are \\npredominantly primary caregivers to get out there, to work, to choose to continue their education and develop \\nthemselves if they so wish. So like Jason, and like the Prime Minister, and Alicia Payne, I\\'m really, really excited to \\nwelcome Professor Brennan to the Productivity Commission Review. Thank you.\\nPRIME MINISTER: As you can see, we\\'re very excited about Professor Brennan\\'s appointment here this morning. \\nHappy to take questions.\\nJOURNALIST: On housing affordability, there\\'s new legislation being introduced today. Obviously, that\\'s a long term \\nplan, but will there be any relief for renters in the May Budget?\\nPRIME MINISTER: We\\'ll have the May Budget in May, but we\\'re already taking significant action when it comes to \\nhousing, including the introduction of the legislation that we\\'ll have today for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \\nThat\\'s important legislation, to boost the supply of housing but particularly social and community housing. In \\naddition to that, we\\'ve said that of those 30,000 additional social housing units that will be created, 4,000 of them \\nwill be set aside for women and children escaping domestic violence. In addition to that, we have our Emergency \\nHousing Fund, a $100 million increase. In addition to that, we have our National Housing Accord with the Master \\nBuilders Association, with state and territory governments, with the private sector, working together with the private \\nsector to boost housing supply. In addition to that, we\\'re creating our Housing Supply and Affordability Council \\nagain. Working with state and territory governments, as well as local government about freeing up land, about \\ncreating more support there in the housing sector. In addition to that, there was over half a billion dollars just sitting \\nthere not being used for housing that we have tapped into to provide that support. So we have a comprehensive \\nplan when it comes to housing, you\\'ll see more roll out, in an orderly way, just like we\\'re rolling out today\\'s \\nannouncement in an orderly way.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the first Australian shipment of coal has arrived in China, do you know how many \\nmore are expected to arrive in the near future, and are you confident that the shipments can increase with Don \\nFarrell visiting in the near future as well?\\nPRIME MINISTER: What I\\'m confident of is that the dynamic between Australia and China has changed, from one \\nwhere there wasn\\'t dialogue between ministers, to one where there is. And that dialogue is always a good idea. I\\'ve \\nsaid with regards to the relationship with China, that we will cooperate where we can, we will disagree where we \\nmust, and we\\'ll engage in our national interest. And when I met with President Xi, I indicated to him publicly, but \\nalso of course, privately, that it quite clearly was in Australia\\'s interests to export more to China. China currently \\nreceives more exports by value than the next three major trading partners combined. So that relationship is \\nimportant for Australian jobs, for our national economy, but there\\'s another thing it\\'s good for too. It\\'s good for China \\nto receive those goods, because we have not just resources, but we have wine, meat, barley, seafood - the best in \\nthe world. And it is in China\\'s interest for any impediments to be removed. I\\'m very pleased that Don Farrell had a \\nconstructive meeting this week with his counterpart in China. I\\'m pleased that Penny Wong visited Beijing on \\nDecember 21st to mark the 50th anniversary of relations between Australia and the People\\'s Republic of China. \\nAnd I look forward to both of our countries going forward in a constructive, cooperative way. These reports haven\\'t \\nbeen confirmed yet. We are cautious about making announcements before they\\'re confirmed. But quite clearly, I \\nthink if Australian business and Australian industry, what they tell me, including last night with business people I\\'ve \\nmet with, is that they are very pleased with the constructive direction of the relationship.\\nJOURNALIST: Further on China, US officials say that Chinese spy balloons are part of an effort to assess the \\nmilitary capabilities around the world. Does that concern you and does this incident in the US, do you see that as a \\nsetback in the engagement that was seen between Washington and Beijing and Canada?\\nPRIME MINISTER: We support the sovereignty of nations, including the United States, our great friends in the \\nUnited States. We consider all of the matters relating to national security and respond in an appropriate way and \\nwill continue to do so.Page 4 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nJOURNALIST: Disability workers and age care workers got big pay rises recently. The Childcare Workers Union \\nhas called for a 25% pay rise. We know pay is a huge factor in this industry. Would you back a pay rise like that for \\nchild care workers?\\nPRIME MINISTER: The government doesn\\'t determine the level of wages for everybody in the sector.\\nJOURNALIST: But do you support their push?\\nPRIME MINISTER: What I support is people being paid fairly, and I won\\'t comment on specifics because that\\'s the \\njob of the Fair Work Commission to consider these matters independently of government and come to decisions. \\nWhat I would say though, and what I\\'ve said publicly a number of times, including yesterday at the UN International \\nWomen\\'s Day event that was held yesterday morning, is that if you look at the sectors where people are underpaid, \\nthey have something in common, two things: One, they are the very sectors that got us through the pandemic. Our \\ncleaners, our aged care workers, our childcare workers. There\\'s something else they\\'ve got in common as well. \\nThey are largely feminised industries, and that\\'s why, when we made changes to industrial regulations, I announced \\nat our campaign launch in Perth last year that we would very specially have measures that allowed the gender pay \\ngap to be considered. We had legislation yesterday as well about transparency, so that the gender pay gap can be \\nidentified for larger companies as well. So I will conclude with this by saying, early learning educators do a fantastic \\njob. They\\'re valued by parents, they\\'re valued by children who grow to love them and have a relationship with them. \\nThis isn\\'t just a normal job, as much as I love all the journalists here, our relationship is different. Between the \\neducators and the children who they look after. And I have every respect for the educators and the work that they \\ndo.\\nJOURNALIST: One on the Referendum Machinery Act please if I could. Yesterday, Katy Gallagher said that you \\nwould go ahead with the information pamphlet. In December, Don Farrell and Mark Dreyfus said \"there\\'s no longer \\nany need for taxpayers to pay for a pamphlet to be sent to every household. The Referendum Act does not reflect \\nmodern delivery and communications methods.\" Do you still agree with that? Has your view changed or is this \\nbringing back the pamphlet a concession to just get it through the Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Both things are right. The truth is, I don\\'t know about you Josh, when was the last letter you \\nsent?\\nJOURNALIST: I think it was around Christmas.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Apart from Christmas Cards, when was the last letter you sent?\\nJOURNALIST: You\\'re testing my memory, it\\'s not my press conference.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Has anyone here sent a letter this year?\\nJOURNALIST: Last week, to the US Consulate.\\nPRIME MINISTER: That\\'s not a letter, that\\'s an application. The world has changed how we communicate. But I \\ncould have said, we will engage constructively. One of the Senators approached, we made this decision a week \\nago, one of the Senators approached and said, this will make a big difference for our approach. I don\\'t know how \\nmany times I can say this at press conferences, we will do what we need to do to broaden support for this. The \\nreferendum that will be held later this year is about two things, recognition and consultation. Recognising Aboriginal \\nand Torres Strait Islander People in our Constitution and consulting them on matters that affect them, that\\'s what it\\'s \\nabout. Now we want to maximise support for that. So if anyone has, as I said, I await any member of the House of \\nRepresentatives or the Senate to examine the question and the draft changes that I put forward at Garma last year. \\nNow, I\\'ll give you the exclusive, just for you, so if everyone else can not listen, if there\\'s a constructive suggestion, \\nthat\\'s backed in by lawyers, we\\'ll change that. If there\\'s a suggestion, there hasn\\'t been one, there hasn\\'t been one. \\nI want this to succeed. I\\'m not being dogmatic about this. This is not our proposal, this is a proposal that came from \\nthe bottom up. And you need to think of the counterfactual of what happens if this referendum succeeds. If this \\nreferendum succeeds, Indigenous Australians will be shown the respect that they deserve. Australians will all know Page 5 of 5\\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\\nthat we\\'ve acknowledged the great privilege that we have of sharing this continent with the oldest continuous \\nculture on earth. And the world will see that Australia\\'s a mature country, a mature country that can be honest \\nabout our history and can celebrate that history. That\\'s what this is about. It\\'s not about party politics. And that\\'s \\nwhat every state Premier and Chief Minister understands. And I just say to my colleagues on the Hill, this isn\\'t the \\nopportunity to look for division. This is the opportunity to look for national unity, to embrace the opportunity which is \\nthere. So, if someone has a suggestion, by all means put it forward. I\\'m up for it, in terms of, whether a pamphlet \\ngoes out, it doesn\\'t hurt, a pamphlet going out. People are going to put things in letterboxes anyway during the \\nreferendum. If people want taxpayers to pay for it, there\\'s a judgement call there, fine. Taxpayers shouldn\\'t be \\nfunding the campaigns of Yes and No. That should be up to people to fund. There should be equal funding and \\nthere will be under the under the proposal that we have. I also welcome Simon Birmingham\\'s comments this \\nmorning. Simon Birmingham has said very clearly that there shouldn\\'t be funding of the Yes and No case. I \\nwelcome the comments of Simon Birmingham. I welcome anyone who wants to join this journey on the path to \\nreconciliation.\\nJOURNALIST: There are strong indications that Vladimir Putin signed off on the supply of weapons used to shoot \\ndown MH17. If you could look at him in the eye today, what would you say to Vladimir Putin?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I\\'d say that you are reprehensible. That Vladimir Putin, clearly, the shooting down of MH17 was \\nan act of terrorism that had an impact here in Australia, but on many countries as well. And we will continue to \\npursue these issues with every avenue at our disposal.\\nJOURNALIST: So how do you feel about the suspension of the criminal investigation into the downing of MH17?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I think I just answered how I feel about it. The issue, of course, of the Russian invasion of \\nUkraine, this is a guy who runs an authoritarian regime that doesn\\'t care about human rights, that doesn\\'t care \\nabout devastation of communities, whether it be in Ukraine, whether it be the oppression of its own citizens, or \\nwhether the acts outside of Russia of which we\\'ve seen a number. The travesty of MH17 is an issue in which he \\nshould be held to account and Australia will continue to pursue all of these issues with every avenue at our \\ndisposal.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, this morning the Deputy PM has indicated he wants to get rid of Chinese linked \\nsurveillance cameras from government buildings. We spoke about the relationship with China earlier, the last time \\nthe Australian government tried to ban or exclude a Chinese company from communications in any form in \\nAustralia, it was detrimental to our relationship with China. Are you concerned about how Beijing will react to the \\nremoval of those devices?\\nPRIME MINISTER: No, we act in accordance with Australia\\'s national interest. We do so transparently and that\\'s \\nwhat we\\'ll continue to do.

But when I show up at \\nnoon sharp, not a sign of life.\\nI\\'m busily texting Aly\\'s people when, luckily, we run into each other - Canberra is a small place - so we amble a few \\nmetres along until we come to a cafe on the corner that seems, well, convenient.\\nWe grab a table outside and Aly immediately launches into a monologue about how to make a lemon chicken \\ntagine, which involves soaking the tagine pot in a bath for 24 hours, rubbing it with oil and then cooking the Middle-\\nEastern deliciousness for another 24 hours in a very low oven.\\nWe are scanning the menu and Aly announces she \"doesn\\'t do rice\", which is a staple of Middle Eastern cuisine \\nand which makes her some sort of pariah at family events. She opts for the grilled fennel chicken (no butter please) \\nand a very hot almond milk cappuccino. I choose the zucchini fritters and a bean-a-colada, which disappointingly \\nhas neither beans nor booze.\\nAly, let it be said, is prone to the odd swear word, as am I, and over the next 60 minutes our conversation is \\npeppered with F-bombs.\\nPage 2 of 4\\n\\'I\\'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS\\' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN\\nThe thrice-married Aly had already lived a complex and somewhat haphazard life before she decided rather \\nspontaneously to run as the Labor candidate for the West Australian seat Cowan in 2016. She managed to turf out \\nthe Liberal incumbent Luke Simpkins by the finest of margins. \"It took 10 days to count the vote,\" she says.\\nIn 2019, she increased her margin and by 2022 she harnessed 46.9 per cent of the vote, adding more than 9 per \\ncent to her 2019 numbers.\\nOf that first campaign, she remembers standing at a train station with a picture of herself while waving at cars. A \\nyear ago to the day, she had been invited to speak at the White House at a counterterrorism conference. \"All I could \\nthink was from the White House to Greenwood station. What have I done?\"\\nAly was born Azza Mahmoud Fawzi Hosseini Ali el Serougi in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1967, the daughter of a nurse \\nand a textiles engineer who migrated to Australia in 1969. They were among the last migrants to be received at the \\nBonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre in Albury-Wodonga - which, having made the world\\'s headlines \\ntwo decades earlier over the death from malnutrition of 13 children, had improved conditions considerably.\\nThe family moved first to Marrickville in Sydney\\'s inner west and then, just on the cusp of shifting to Texas, they \\nrelocated to Brisbane, where Aly\\'s dad got a job at the Jennings factory, which made corsets and women\\'s \\nunderwear.\\nThey bought their first house in the very un-chi chi suburb of West End.\\n\"And then in 1974 came the flood. My parents came from a desert country, they had never seen anything like this,\" \\nAly says.\\n\"But it was a defining feature of our Australian story because what we found was a community. It was almost like \\nthey became Australian through the tragedy.\"\\nMoments like that, she says, stand in stark contrast to other moments of division and rancour that have \\ncharacterised the same-sex marriage plebiscite, the Voice referendum and the uncontained racism that followed the \\n9/11 attacks in New York.\\nThe current situation in Gaza is confronting, she says. Aly joined Ed Husic last month to warn Gaza\\'s 2.3 million \\nresidents were being \"collectively punished\" for the crimes of terrorists.\\nAs the Israel-Hamas war becomes more divisive, Aly says she is trying to demonstrate how \"important it is that we \\nrecognise each other\\'s humanity and show compassion to each other, even when we are hurting the most\".\\nAs the minister for early childhood education, and also the minister for youth, Aly has a lot on her plate as she \\nmarshals through two reviews of the childcare and early learning sectors.\\nThe government is moving, slowly, towards adopting a model of universal access. In July, it increased the \\nmaximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning up to $80,000, and a sliding scale in subsidies for families \\nearning less than $530,000.\\n\"The fact is Australia is one of the most expensive places for early childhood education and care,\" says Aly.\\n\"We have a quality system that is world-class, and a quality framework that has been in place for 10 years. The \\nissue is the cost and the fact that the market isn\\'t behaving the way you would expect. It doesn\\'t go to where the \\ndemand is, it goes to where the money is.\"\\nThe delivery of the Productivity Commission report this week and the Australian Competition and Consumer \\nCommission\\'s investigation will ensure childcare remains one of the hot button issues for the Albanese government \\nin coming months.Page 3 of 4\\n\\'I\\'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS\\' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN\\nAly will be familiar to most people, even if they haven\\'t connected the name to the face. She is the petite dark-\\nhaired, dark-eyed woman in colourful clothing who sits behind Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during question \\ntime. Aly is an active listener. She nods. She laughs. She scowls and boos. She never drifts off or checks her \\nphone.\\nAlways impeccably well-dressed, Aly\\'s choice of clothing has taken a twist in the past couple of years as she took \\nup crochet and knitting as a form of meditation and mindfulness as she takes endless flights between Canberra and \\nPerth.\\nThe white jumper she wears to lunch is handcrafted (and has a matching skirt), as was the crochet long dress she \\nwore to this year\\'s Mid-Winter Ball. She is already working on next year\\'s dress, which will feature crocheted \\nflowers, each unique, representing every woman who died from domestic violence during the year.\\nAly has her own story of domestic violence, one that is told in her 2018 autobiography Finding My Place: From \\nCairo to Canberra - the Irresistible Story of an Irrepressible Woman.\\nShe had married young, at the age of 20, while living back in Egypt, where she was studying English literature, with \\na minor in acting. The marriage wasn\\'t arranged, as was common for girls like her. Rather, it was a way of escaping \\nthe strictures of being a single woman in a Muslim country.\\n\"The marriage gave me a freedom that I didn\\'t have living under my parents\\' roof. It gave me the freedom to be a \\nrespectable married woman in Egypt. It meant I could go camping with friends, I could go to parties, I could come \\nhome when I wanted to.\"\\nThere were red flags which she ignored - or didn\\'t know any better.\\nBut after moving to Perth, the violence and contemptuous behaviour escalated.\\n\"There was a bit of martyrdom on my behalf. But there are a lot of stereotypes around women who are survivors, a \\nlot of us are high achievers. The feelings of responsibility and humiliation; we expect more of ourselves,\" she says.\\n\"I remember driving away once and saying out loud to myself: \\'You must be just the kind of woman that men hit.\\' I\\'d \\nresigned myself to it.\\n\"I describe domestic violence as this crack in a bone somewhere in your body that you carry with you through your \\nlife.\\n\"It\\'s hard to imagine myself as the person I was. I\\'m much more like me now than I was back then.\"\\nShe finally kicked him out of the family home after six long years and began the next chapter as a broke single mum \\nof two young sons, Karim and Adam. They only found out about the history of abuse when they read the \\nautobiography.\\nKeeping hearth and home together with a string of unskilled jobs, she retreated to her safe space: education. In all, \\nshe has four degrees, including a masters in education and a PhD on counterterrorism and security.\\nWhich, to circle back, might help explain the inappropriate ADHD comment, having completed the two-year masters \\nin nine months and the PhD in two years - it typically take four to seven years.\\n\"I\\'d put the boys to bed, study until 3 or 4am, and then get up at 7am.\"\\nThat led to another chapter, as a world-renowned researcher and professor specialising in countering online violent \\nextremism. It also got her invited to Oxford University and the White House to speak.\\nHer political spark was ignited after the rise of anti-Muslim sentiment across the world, witnessing one-too-many \\ninstances of casual racism in suburban Perth, and becoming a target of death threats because of her profile as a \\nresearcher in anti-terrorism.Page 4 of 4\\n\\'I\\'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS\\' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN\\nThe university moved her team to unidentified offices twice during the course of a year with strict instruction not to \\nreveal the location.\\nI have set aside 90 minutes for lunch, but after an hour a staffer taps Aly on the shoulder and says we have five \\nminutes to wrap it up.\\nHeavens, we haven\\'t even got on to husband number two, or heaven forbid Dave Allen, who is husband number \\nthree. (He is a Canadian-born former ice-hockey player, policeman and intelligence officer who she met while \\nworking in the WA public service and married in 2012).\\nWe need to talk more about childcare, whether the big for-profit corporates are price gouging, why the market is \\nfailing (and what to do about it).\\nTen minutes later, there is another tap on the shoulder.

I'm Mary Doyle, I'm the Labor Candidate for \\nthe Aston by-election. It's really exciting to be here at Swinburne TAFE with the Prime Minister and Ministers \\nO'Connor and Aly. And thanks to everyone including the wonderful students for showing us around this morning. \\nTAFE is something I'm hugely passionate about, having been a TAFE student myself many years ago. And I can \\ntell you, when I talk to people about the Albanese Government's plans for fee-free TAFE in critical sectors, they \\noverwhelmingly tell me it's a great idea. This is a Government that I want to be a part of. One that looks at the \\npressures facing families in the outer-eastern suburbs and then goes about making a practical difference to address \\nthose challenges. Whether it's cheaper child care, which will benefit 5,700 families here in Aston. Whether it's \\ncheaper medicines, already saving Aston locals more than $250,000 since that came in. Whether it's fee-free TAFE \\nfor 55,000 Victorians. I want to be a part of the team that delivers for the outer-east. If I'm elected to be part of the \\nAlbanese Government as the next Member for Aston, I promise you this I will always fight for TAFE, I will always \\nfight for cheaper child care, and I will always fight for locals. And I'm thrilled to welcome the PM back to Wantirna.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Well, thanks very much, Mary. And I do want to thank the staff and the \\nstudents at Swinburne TAFE here for the very warm welcome that I've received here this morning, along with my \\nMinister for Skills and Training, Brendan O'Connor, and my Minister who looks after Early Childhood Learning, \\nAnne Aly. We're here to talk to students. We're here also to hear firsthand from them the difference that fee-free \\nTAFE is making to their lives. We, arising out of the Jobs and Skills Summit last year, and a commitment we made \\nat the election to 180,000 fee-free TAFE places are happening right now. And what we heard from this morning is \\nstudents who not only are benefiting from that fee-free TAFE, but they're also working and earning an income while \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nthat is happening. We've learned from them firsthand that this was part of the incentive for them to enter an area \\nwhich has skill shortages. So, it's good for students, but it's good for the economy as well. And it's good for this \\nregion, because we also heard that the early learning centres which they are partaking in now, in terms of their work \\nexperience, are all local. And Mary Doyle understands that. That's why I want Mary Doyle, next Saturday, to \\nbecome the Member for Aston. Because this community needs a voice in government. A Labor Government. A \\nLabor Government that cares about people in the outer suburbs. A Labor Government that's committed to making a \\ndifference with fee-free TAFE, to making a difference with the cheaper pharmaceuticals, but making a difference as \\nwell in child care costs for families. One of the things that is happening here from the students we spoke to, not only \\nare they benefiting from free-free TAFE, they're benefiting from working, because there are skills shortages, but \\nthey're also having the bonus of our cheaper child care plan, that comes in on July 1, will mean that more women in \\nparticular can join the workforce. This isn't a welfare policy. This is a productivity enhancing economic policy. This is \\nabout improving women's workforce participation, it's about boosting productivity and also about boosting the \\npopulation. The three Ps of economic growth are all ticked by this policy. Mary Doyle understands this. She hasn't \\nshopped around for a seat. Mary Doyle ran for this seat last year, and she's been committed to her community, \\nwhere she has lived for a long period of time, here in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. And that's why I want \\nsomeone who actually understands this community, who's committed to this community, and who will represent this \\ncommunity in the by-election on April 1. People do have an opportunity to send a message to the Opposition that \\nthey need to do better than have Peter Dutton as their Leader. Peter Dutton, who has spent year after year in \\ngovernment deriding Victorians, condemning the sacrifices that they were making during the pandemic, and \\nsomeone who said that people weren't safe to go out in Melbourne. Like, he just doesn't get this city and he doesn't \\nget this state of Victoria. Mary Doyle does. She'll be a fantastic representative, and I look forward to her joining our \\nteam after April 1 and having input into the Budget that we'll be putting together in May, which will take further \\npressure off working families in communities like this. I'll get Brendan to say something, Anne, and then we're \\nhappy to take questions.\\nBRENDAN O'CONNOR, MINISTER FOR SKILLS AND TRAINING: Thanks, Prime Minister. It's great to be with the \\nPrime Minister and, of course, with Mary and Anne, here today at this fantastic dual sector provider at Swinburne. \\nIt's fair to say that when we were elected, we comprehended the challenge we had in supplying the skills to the \\nlabour market. There were skill shortages across the economy. Wherever you looked, whatever professional trade, \\nthere were shortages. It was for that reason the Prime Minister convened the Jobs and Skills Summit, bringing \\ntogether industry, bringing together state and territory governments, and finding solutions to the problems that we \\ninherited. And I'm happy to say that the 180,000 fee-free TAFE places decision that was made at that summit was \\nan absolutely critical part of the response by the Albanese Government to the skill shortages. And we're seeing it \\nhere today, as a result of that decision and as a result of decisions by the Albanese Government with eight separate \\ngovernments, eight state and territory governments, to have agreements in each jurisdiction, we can focus on the \\neconomies of each state and territory. And that's what we've done. 55,000 fee-free places in Victoria, and then a \\nlarge proportion of those, for example, in early childhood education, where there's a massive demand. 40 per cent \\nof the advertisements for those jobs are in Victoria. That's why we've dedicated 3,800 places to this state, and that's \\nwhy the students we've met today are able to enrol in those courses, knowing that they can afford it, knowing that \\nthey can cope with the cost of living pressures because the courses are fee-free, which also means, because \\nenrolments are going up, the supply of skilled workers to this really critical sector of our economy, looking after and \\nteaching our children, preschool children is absolutely vital, we'll be able to provide that pipeline. So, as a result of \\nthose agreements with state and territory governments, the fee-free component, which is ensuring that enrolments \\nare increasing, we are responding to the skill shortages across the economy, not just in that area, but today we are \\nfocussing on that area. And I believe that, certainly in talking with Mary, she fully understands the pressure that \\nparents are under in terms of costs, the pressure that students are under, and that's why we're providing fee-free \\nplaces and understands, too, that we need to be ensuring that we can supply the skilled workforce to an economy \\nthat is certainly in need of such a supply. It's because of these decisions we are seeing the benefits that are \\nhappening. And that's why in talking to the students today, it was quite obvious that it was a lot easier for them to \\nenter into these courses, acquire these much needed skills, because of the announcement and the decision of the \\nAlbanese Government, working with state and territory governments, providing fee-free options for them.Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: Thanks, Brendan. It's great to be here this \\nmorning, of course, with the Prime Minister, with Brendan O'Connor, and our wonderful candidate for Aston, Mary \\nDoyle. Mary is a local and she gets it. She gets what families here are going through and she understands the \\nimportance of early childhood education and care. And, in fact, Mary was saying that her own daughter went locally \\nhere, accessed early childhood education and care locally here, and still recognises her early childhood education \\nteacher at the shopping centre. That's because she's a local. She knows this area, and she understands and values \\nearly childhood education and care. Now, in just under 100 days, families right across Australia are going to reap \\nthe benefits of our reforms that are making early childhood education and care more affordable. And we know that \\nin order for that to be successful, we need a sustainable workforce. That is why the fee-free TAFE that the \\nAlbanese Labor Government has introduced is so important. And today, we had the pleasure of meeting students \\nlike Tiana and Connor who are using that fee-free TAFE. They are saving thousands of dollars and they are the \\nfuture workforce of early childhood education and care, but they're also the current workforce of early childhood \\neducation and care. Because, as the Prime Minister said, they are working as they are getting their degree in areas \\nof skill shortages. We know that our early childhood education and care reforms that make it much more affordable \\nfor families right across Australia are important, but we're also getting on with the job of ensuring that we have that \\nsustainable workforce. And I'm proud to be a part of a Labor Government, I look forward to welcoming Mary Doyle \\nas a Member for Aston after the election next week. I know she will make an extremely valuable contribution to the \\nLabor Caucus. And I look forward to seeing more students like Tiana and Connor taking advantage of that fee-free \\nTAFE, graduating with an Early Childhood Education and Care Certificate, and becoming part of our valuable \\nworkforce in early childhood education and care.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there's a lot of mortgage stress in the Aston area, what can your Government do to \\nalleviate some of that?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, what we're doing is having a comprehensive housing policy. There is legislation before the \\nParliament, before the Senate next week, the Housing Australia Future Fund. That has a number of components to \\nit. One is an increased investment in social and community housing, which will create 30,000 additional units over \\nthe next five years. But it also has within it as well, additional funding for emergency housing, some $100 million, \\nand it has, as part of that as well, funding specifically for veterans housing, as well as for women and children \\nescaping family and domestic violence. That's one element. The other thing we're doing is a housing accord, \\nworking with the private sector, with organisations like the Master Builders and the Housing Industry Association \\nand others, having an accord with state and territory governments to increase the supply of housing. Prices, of \\ncourse, are a product of demand and supply. So, what we want to do is to increase the supply of housing. We also \\nhave our Housing Supply and Affordability Council is part of the legislation for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \\nWhat that's aimed at doing is working with each level of government to make sure that approvals and land release \\nand those issues are dealt with in our outer suburbs in a way that assists people. We recognise that people are \\ndoing it tough. We are taking action on that. That's the other reason why we're making sure that we put downward \\npressure on inflation. The Reserve Bank Governor, in the statement that he made at the beginning of this month, \\nhas said that he hoped that inflation had peaked in the December quarter. Of course, the highest inflation rate \\ngrowth of any quarter this century was the March 2022 quarter last year. So, the last full quarter in which the \\nCoalition were in office was the highest inflation of any quarter in Australia this century. And that's why, as well, we \\nwill produce a responsible Budget. That's why we returned 99 per cent of the revenue gains to the Budget in \\nOctober last year. So there's no easy fix here. But we want to work with the Andrews Government to make sure that \\nwe deal with the housing stress, which is a national phenomenon. That's why we're working with all state and \\nterritory governments and the private sector. And that's why I'd urge the Senate next week to pass this legislation \\nthat will make a difference.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you expect the Premier to join you on the campaign trail in the last week here in Aston?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I'll be in Parliament next week.\\nJOURNALIST: Over the weekend maybe?Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well I won't be here over the weekend. There's a couple of elections on, this by-election. This \\nafternoon I'll be in Penrith, so a bit of notice for the media, I'll be in Penrith and I'll be in Riverstone this afternoon \\nand I'll be in a range of seats tomorrow in my home state of New South Wales, as you would expect.\\nJOURNALIST: Are you confident Chris Minns will get the job done?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Chris Minns, I think, will make an outstanding Premier of New South Wales. That's a decision \\nfor the people of New South Wales. I think, can I say this? I think that Dominic Perrottet and Chris Minns are both \\nvery good people. They're good human beings. I have a good relationship with both of them and I like both of them. \\nThe problem is that Dominic Perrottet's Government is a shambles. The Liberals are too busy fighting each other \\nand fighting the Nationals, and the Nationals fighting each other, to fight for the people of New South Wales. And \\nthat's why Chris Minns deserves and his team deserves to be elected to government tomorrow. I'll work with \\nwhoever is elected it, as I do constructively. I've had liaison with Premier Rockliff this morning. My Government \\nactually works for solutions. We look for unity. We don't look for division. The problem with the modern Liberal Party \\nis that it is so divided on itself. On itself. I mean, they can't make a decision on constitutional recognition for \\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in 2023. If they oppose it, they've got to say. When will that occur? How \\nlong? Is 122 years not long enough to wait to recognise that our history didn't begin in 1788? The Victorian Liberal \\nParty here are a shambles. We've seen them fighting each other. And the Caucus can't make a decision in \\nCanberra, in Peter Dutton. That's why we need to send a message to them that they need to do better. They need \\nto get their act together. That's why Mary Doyle deserves to be elected as the Member for Aston. If she joins our \\nCaucus, she'll join a united, coherent team. A united, coherent team that has plans for our economic growth, that \\nhas plans for social equity, that has plans for gender equality, that has plans for dealing with the challenge of \\nclimate change, that supports multiculturalism, that doesn't have to think about these things because it's in our core. \\nIt's our instinct. And that is what Mary Doyle, that's the team that she will join if she's elected.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Linda Burney that Peter Dutton is just looking for excuses to reject the Voice? \\nAnd secondly, will you release the Solicitor-General's advice on the wording?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well the two things are connected, because Peter Dutton knows that he sat in a Cabinet for \\nnine years and didn't release any advice to the Cabinet. It's not the way it works. And he knows that. He knows that. \\nSo what we saw from Peter Dutton, over a long period of time, was first in the lead-up to my speech at Garma, he \\nsaid, 'We don't know what the question is.' So, I released draft words. We received not a suggestion in between \\nJuly last year and yesterday when I released what will be in the legislation to go to Parliament next week. Not one \\nsuggestion from him or Julian Leeser, the Shadow Attorney-General, of any change. Not a word. And Julian Leeser, \\nwe know, has been involved with the wording since a decade ago. A decade ago. He was one of the people who \\nwere involved in that process, as Noel Pearson outlined in The Australian some weeks ago. So, Peter Dutton needs \\nto get real about this. This isn't about him, and it's not about me. This is about whether we are a better country \\ngoing forward. It's whether we can recognise Indigenous Australians in our nation's birth certificate. And then it's \\nonly about one other thing, which is will we get better outcomes if we consult the people who are impacted by those \\ndecisions? That's what this is about. It's a simple proposition before the Australian people, and I'm confident that \\nthe Australian people will vote yes. And the idea whenever any detail is given, and yesterday we released eight of \\nthe principles that will go towards the legislation in shaping the Voice. And the Voice can't be clearer, the words that \\nwill go forward include, the third point, 'The Parliament shall, subject to this constitution, have power to make laws \\nwith respect to matters relating to', which is a legal term, 'Relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, \\nincluding its composition, functions, powers and procedures'. Peter Dutton will be a part of the Parliament and \\nfuture members will be a part of future Parliaments, that will determine the function of the Voice. And he knows that \\nthat's the case. And we know from the Republic playbook that occurred last century, that it is nothing more than a \\ntactic, and it lacks genuineness to just continue to say 'We don't have the detail'. No matter how much detail is put \\nout, Peter Dutton will say, 'What about more detail?' That's the game that's being played here. And he should make \\na decision of where he stands on this issue, because this is an issue that isn't the creation of a Labor Government. \\nThis has arisen from the bottom up. And yesterday I had Ken Wyatt, who flew overnight to Canberra, the \\nIndigenous Affairs Minister in the Morrison Government, to stand next to me and with his fellow Aboriginal and \\nTorres Strait Islander people who've been a part of the Referendum Working Group, who've come to a unanimous \\nposition. And I'd say that this should be above politics as the 1967 referendum was.Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what economic benefits do you see from the Voice, and do you intend to sit down \\nwith Mr Dutton before next Thursday to discuss his concerns?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I sat down with him yesterday. I sat down with him before we did the press conference. Let's be \\nvery clear, that's the seventh time I have sat down with Peter Dutton. Peter Dutton has met with the Referendum \\nWorking Group twice. You know what? At those meetings we haven't had questions raised. He's had every \\nopportunity. There have been, I think it was Thomas Mayor yesterday, outlined the number of inquiries, details, \\ncommittees that have looked into this over more than a decade. The Uluru Statement from the Heart was in 2017. It \\ngrew out of a First Nations Constitutional Convention. It grew out of a five-year process from 2012 that began back \\nat the end of the last century. John Howard was Prime Minister when he said there needed to be constitutional \\nrecognition. Scott Morrison went to the election in 2019 and said there should be constitutional recognition. It was \\nthe Morrison Government that established the committee that Tom Calma and Marcia Langton presided over, with \\npeople like Chris Kenny and Frank Brennan and a range of people who participated and produced a report that is \\nhundreds of pages long. It went to the Cabinet of the Morrison Government, not my Government, not once, but \\ntwice. The detail is out there. The detail is out there. We need to know, as well, know this, that the programs that \\nhave been successful, that make a difference for Indigenous people, are ones in which they have been involved. \\nJustice reinvestment by the Coalition Government in New South Wales in places like Moree and Bourke, the \\nIndigenous Rangers Program, community health programs. Where people are involved, you get better outcomes. \\nAnd that is something that is just a fact, and that is why we had this coming together. Aboriginal and Torres Strait \\nIslander people are no less homogeneous than any other group that you want to pick. But what you had yesterday \\nwas people from different parts of Australia, from different parts of the country, coming together. And, you know, \\nthe great Galarrwuy Yunupingu, watching it there on Yolngu country in Arnhem Land, watching it, a product of his \\nlife's work. These people, their patience, their modesty, their humbleness, is inspirational. And they deserve, they \\ndeserve nothing less than for people to put politics aside and to get this done. And we will give the Australian \\npeople the opportunity to enlarge our country later this year. And we can be enlarged, or we can shrink. Shrink into \\nplaying old politics. And that's what people need to consider who are in positions of political leadership on this \\nissue.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you worried the wording leaves the door open for High Court challenges? Or are \\nyou confident that it's as watertight as you say it is?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I'm absolutely confident. But I'm confident on the basis of people like the former head of the \\nHigh Court, Justice French. He might know something about the Constitution. The leading academic in Australia \\non constitutional law, Professor Anne Twomey, might know something about the Constitution. This hasn't arisen in \\na vacuum. There's been all of this work done by the advisory group to the Referendum Working Group. It's very \\nclear that this is a straightforward proposition. People can read it themselves. I just read out the third clause that \\nmakes it clear that the Parliament is primary. The primacy of the Parliament is there, including its composition, \\nfunctions, powers and procedures. A key word, including. So, all matters, and it says, to matters relating to, matters \\nis often used as a legal term as well. And we took proper advice, and I'm very confident you will have an \\nopportunity. If you get ten lawyers in a room, you'll often get someone who gets a run in. That's what they're paid to \\ndo. That's why on different sides, to put this in perspective, that's why on different sides in courts, you have lawyers \\non one side and lawyers on the other side. They're paid to advocate. That's an honourable profession to do. But \\nyou shouldn't use that fact to say that there's someone out there who disagrees. Someone, I'm sure I can find you a \\nlawyer who can tell you that that jacket you're wearing is orange or pink. I can find that for you. Pay them enough, \\nthat'll happen.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just back to Aston. Do you think what's happening internally in the Liberal Party in \\nVictoria could actually work in Mary Doyle's favour in regards to Moira Deeming?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think the Liberal Party is dysfunctional here. We saw that in the lead-up to the state \\nelection. We saw that in the way that the Federal Liberal Party people here operate as well. Michael Sukkar was \\npretty desperate to stop the candidate being preselected here for Aston. He didn't have confidence that someone \\nfrom outside the area would be appropriate. I mean, we're a long way from the Melbourne City Council. And I think \\nthat that's just a fact, that it's a dysfunctional branch. They need to be given time to get their act together. In the Page 6 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nmeantime, we've got a fantastic candidate who secured the unanimous support of everyone, who ran last time, who \\nhasn't shopped around for a seat.

She opts for the grilled fennel chicken (no butter please) and a \\nvery hot almond milk cappuccino. I choose the zucchini fritters and a bean-a-colada, which, disappointingly has \\nneither booze nor beans.\\nAly, let it be said, is prone to the odd swear word, as am I, and over the next 60 minutes our conversation is \\npeppered with F-bombs.\\nPage 2 of 5\\nAnne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics\\nThe thrice-married Aly had already lived a complex and somewhat haphazard life before she decided rather \\nspontaneously to run as the Labor candidate for the West Australian seat Cowan in 2016. She managed to turf out \\nthe Liberal incumbent Luke Simpkins by the finest of margins.\\n\"It took 10 days to count the vote,\" she says.\\nIn 2019, she increased her margin and by 2022 she harnessed 46.9 per cent of the vote adding more than 9 per \\ncent to her 2019 numbers.\\nOf that first campaign, she remembers standing at a train station with a picture of herself while waving at cars. A \\nyear ago to the day, she had been invited to speak at the White House at a countering terrorism conference.\\n\"All I could think was from the White House to Greenwood station. What have I done?\"\\nThe migrant experience\\nAly was born Azza Mahmoud Fawzi Hosseini Ali el Serougi in Alexandria, Egypt in 1967. The daughter of a nurse \\nand a textiles engineer who immigrated to Australia in 1969. They were among the last migrants to be received at \\nthe Bonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre in Albury Wodonga - which, having made the world\\'s \\nheadlines two decades earlier over the death from malnutrition of 13 children, had improved conditions \\nconsiderably.\\nThe family moved first to Marrickville in Sydney\\'s inner west and then, just on the cusp of shifting to Texas, they \\nrelocated to Brisbane where Aly\\'s dad got a job with the Jennings factory, which produced corsets and women\\'s \\nunderwear.\\nThey bought their first house in the very un-chi chi West End.\\n\"And then in 1974 came the flood. My parents came from a desert country, they had never seen anything like this,\" \\nAly says.\\n\"But it was a defining feature of our Australian story because what we found was a community. It was almost like \\nthey became Australian through the tragedy.\"\\nThe \\'rational, calming voice\\'\\nMoments like that, she says, stand in stark contrast to other moments of division and rancour that have \\ncharacterised the same-sex marriage plebiscite, the Voice referendum and uncontained racism following the 9/11 \\nattacks in New York.\\nThe current situation in Gaza is confronting, she says. Aly joined Ed Husic last month to warn Gaza\\'s 2.3 million \\nresidents were being \"collectively punished\" for the crimes of terrorists.\\nAs the Israel-Gaza war becomes more divisive, Aly says she is trying to demonstrate how \"important it is that we \\nrecognise each other\\'s humanity and show compassion to each other even when we are hurting the most\".\\n\" I\\'ve spoken and met with the Muslim community and members of the Jewish community. And what I say is to \\ncommunities here, who have intergenerational trauma, and accumulative trauma and who are hurting, is that \\nsometimes the hardest thing to do is to be the rational, calming voice in a room of people who are hurting so much \\nthat the only thing that they can do is shout,\" she says.\\nThe problem with early childhood\\nAs the minister for early childhood education, and also the minister for youth, Aly has a lot on her plate as she \\nmarshalls through two reviews of the childcare and early learning sectors.Page 3 of 5\\nAnne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics\\nThe government is moving, slowly, towards adopting a model of universal access. In July, it increased the \\nmaximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning up to $80,000 and a sliding scale in subsidies for every \\nfamily earning less than $530,000.\\n\"The fact is Australia is one of the most expensive places for early childhood education and care,\" says Aly.\\n\"We have a quality system that is world-class, and a quality framework that has been in place for 10 years. The \\nissue is the cost and the fact that the market isn\\'t behaving the way you would expect. It doesn\\'t go to where the \\ndemand is, it goes to where the money is.\"\\nThe delivery of the Productivity Commission report this week and the Australian Competition and Consumer \\nCommission\\'s investigation will ensure childcare remains one of the hot button issues for the Albanese government \\nin coming months.\\nOne of the problems the government has commissioned the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to \\naddress is price gouging, which could see the benefits of more generous subsidies to parents whittled away to zero \\nby higher fees.\\n\"We\\'re going to be watching. People who are making a lot of money out of early childhood education and care at \\nthe expense of it being affordable and accessible for parents need to know we are watching,\" Aly says.\\nShe says the complexity of the system ranging from ASX-listed corporations to mum-and-dad small businesses, \\nmake it difficult to navigate but that her goal is to find a system \"that works for everyone\".\\n\"That could mean different kinds of service delivery in different areas and even different kinds of services. But it\\'s \\nwhere parents are confident of the quality and safety for their children.\"\\nA face you\\'ll know\\nAly will be familiar to most people, even if they haven\\'t connected the name to the face. She is the petite dark-\\nhaired, dark-eyed woman in colourful clothing who sits behind Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during question \\ntime. Aly is an active listener. She nods. She laughs. She scowls and boos. She never drifts off or checks her \\nphone.\\nAlways impeccably well-dressed, Aly\\'s choice of clothing has taken a twist in the past couple of years as she took \\nup crochet and knitting as a form of meditation and mindfulness as she takes endless flights between Canberra and \\nPerth.\\nThe white jumper she wears to lunch is handcrafted (and has a matching skirt) as was the crochet long dress to this \\nyear\\'s Mid-Winter Ball. She is already working on next year\\'s which will feature a crocheted flower, each unique, \\nrepresenting every woman who died from domestic violence during the year.\\nInstagram link\\n\"Then I will auction it off for a domestic violence charity,\" she says.\\nAly has her own story of domestic violence, one that is told in her 2018 autobiography Finding My Place: From \\nCairo to Canberra - the irresistible story of an irrepressible woman.\\nShe had married young, at the age of 20, while living back in Egypt where she was studying English literature, with \\na minor in acting. The marriage wasn\\'t arranged, as was common for girls like her. Rather, it was a way of escaping \\nthe strictures of being a single woman in a Muslim country.\\n\"The marriage gave me a freedom that I didn\\'t have living under my parents\\' roof. It gave me the freedom to be a \\nrespectable married woman in Egypt. It meant I could go camping with friends, I could go to parties, I could come \\nhome when I wanted to.\"Page 4 of 5\\nAnne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics\\nThere were red flags which she ignored - or didn\\'t know any better.\\nBut after moving to Perth, the violence and contemptuous behaviour escalated.\\n\"There was a bit of martyrdom on my behalf. But there are a lot of stereotypes around women who are survivors, a \\nlot of us are high achievers. The feelings of responsibility and humiliation; we expect more of ourselves,\" she says.\\n\"I remember driving away once and saying out loud to myself: \\'you must be just the kind of woman that men hit\\'. I\\'d \\nresigned myself to it.\\n\"I describe domestic violence as this crack in a bone somewhere in your body that you carry with you through your \\nlife.\\n\"It\\'s hard to imagine myself as the person I was. I\\'m much more like me now than I was back then.\"\\nShe finally kicked him out of the family home after six long years and began the next chapter as a broke single mum \\nof two young sons, Karim and Adam.

In all, \\nshe has four degrees, including a masters in education and a PhD on counter-terrorism and security.\\nWhich, to circle back, might help explain the inappropriate ADHD comment, having completed the two-year masters \\nin nine months and the PhD in two years - which typically take four to seven years.\\n\"I\\'d put the boys to bed, study until 3 or 4 am and then get up at 7am.\"\\nThat led to another chapter, as a world-renowned researcher and eventually professor specialising in countering \\nonline violent extremism. It also got her invited to Oxford University and the White House to speak.\\nHer political spark was ignited after the rise of anti-Muslim sentiment across the world, witnessing one-too-many \\ninstances of casual racism in suburban Perth, and becoming a target of death threats because of her profile as a \\nresearcher in anti-terrorism.\\n\"Some days I felt broken and beaten by it all - by the death threats and the calls to \\'hang [her] from a tree\\', \\'drown \\nher in pig\\'s blood\\' and \\'put a bullet in the bag\\',\" she writes in her autobiography.\\nThe university moved her team to unidentified offices twice during the course of a year with strict instruction not to \\nreveal the location.\\nA lot left unsaid\\nI have set aside 90 minutes for lunch, but after an hour a staffer taps Aly on the shoulder and says we have five \\nminutes to wrap it up.\\nHeavens, we haven\\'t even got on to husband number two, or heaven forbid Dave Allen, who is husband number \\nthree.

Are they representative of the \\nbroader population? This is what we found.\\nHow many of our politicians attended university?\\nOur politicians are overall a highly educated cohort - 77 per cent have a bachelor\\'s degree or higher.\\nThis figure is significantly greater than the national average, with Australian Bureau of Statistics data showing just \\n32 per cent of all Australians have graduated from university.\\nSo why is there a remarkably high percentage of university graduates in parliament?\\nIs it because people with an interest in politics or policy are more likely to go to university or is it that they get \\npoliticised while there? John Howard, when prime minister, certainly thought it was the latter, when in 2005 he \\nbanned students from automatically becoming members of the student unions because he saw it as a breeding \\nground for hot-headed lefties and socialists.\\nJohn Hawkins, a political historian from the University of Canberra, says the opposite is most likely the case.\\n\"I suspect it\\'s the other way around; that people who are interested in political ideas and policy are more likely to \\nwant to go to university,\" Hawkins says.\\nPage 2 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians, in six charts\\nOur analysis reveals that 83.5 per cent of Labor politicians have at least one degree compared to 68.6 per cent of \\nCoalition members.\\nPaul Strangio, emeritus professor of politics at Monash University, said the prevalence of politicians with degrees in \\nhistory, politics, sociology and law makes sense.\\n\"There\\'s a certain synchronicity. These degrees teach people analytical skills, as well as strong written and verbal \\ncommunication skills. Arguably, there\\'s a good match-up with the role of a politician,\" he says.\\nCertainly, universities are where many politicians get their first taste of politics and activism.\\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese is one such example. He was prominent in campus politics during his time at the \\nUniversity of Sydney, which culminated in his presidency of NSW Young Labor and later as a rising political staffer.\\nSimon Birmingham, leader of the opposition in the Senate, was president of the Adelaide University Liberal Club in \\n1993, and was a key member of Young Liberals in South Australia for most of the 1990s. He later became an \\nelectorate officer for Senator Robert Hill.\\nIt goes to show that the path from student politics to staffer to MP is well-trodden.\\nThere are countless politicians who cut their teeth in student politics. Opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was chair of \\nthe Bayside Young Liberals in 1990. As a student, Tony Burke, minister for industrial relations, was the president of \\nAustralian Young Labor. Foreign affairs minister Penny Wong was heavily involved in the Labor Club at Adelaide \\nUniversity and served on the national executive of the National Union of Students.\\nAnd that\\'s just for starters.\\nWhich universities produce the most politicians?\\nThe institution that has produced the most of our federal politicians is the University of Sydney, closely followed by \\nthe universities of Melbourne and Queensland.\\nUniversities in the Group of Eight (Go8) dominate the ranking, taking up eight out of 10 spots on the list.\\nJohn Hawkins makes the simple point: \"These are the main universities in the states with the biggest populations.\"\\nBut he adds they are also the institutions most likely to offer degrees in law, economics, history and philosophy, and \\nalso the most likely to offer double-degrees, which are a popular choice among the political classes.\\nFor some, however, the prevalence of degrees from Group of Eight universities is emblematic of entrenched elitism \\nand social division in the broader population.\\nGlenn Savage, associate professor of education policy at the University of Melbourne, has compared Australia\\'s \\n\"highly inequitable\" education system to an \"ecosystem\" with flow-on effects that influence an individual\\'s tertiary \\nstudy and, ultimately, employment.\\n\"It\\'s natural that young people who have more advantageous circumstances will end up in more advantageous \\npositions,\" he says.\\nWhat are our politicians most likely to study?\\nAlthough parliament largely consists of highly educated politicians, it\\'s a bit more monochrome when it comes to \\nwhat they studied - mostly arts and humanities.\\nAbout 40 per cent of federal politicians studied arts at university, which was by a long shot the most popular degree. \\nA double arts-law degree was also common, with 27 politicians, or 12 per cent, graduating with that particular \\ncombination.Page 3 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians, in six charts\\nClare O\\'Neil, Brendan O\\'Connor. Bill Shorten, Michelle Rowland, Julian Leeser, Anika Wells, Zoe McKenzie, Angus \\nTaylor, Adam Bandt and Andrew Gee are just a few of the current crop of politicians with double degrees.\\nThere is a range of majors under the broader umbrella of arts.\\nSenator Katy Gallagher studied in political science and sociology. Labor frontbencher Anne Aly majored in English \\nliterature, with a minor in acting. Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather and transport minister Catherine King studied \\nhistory and social work respectively.\\nOnly 20 politicians (or 9 per cent of parliament) are qualified in science or engineering. Seven studied medicine, \\nincluding independents Monique Ryan and Sophie Scamps. One - Emma McBride - did pharmacy. Greens MP \\nElizabeth Watson-Brown is an architect.\\nSavage says arts degrees, in particular law, politics, and other humanities, \"lend themselves very well to producing \\nthe kinds of knowledge and skill sets which would prove useful for a politician\".\\n\"These degrees would also expose students to theories into social dynamics that are of direct relevance to the \\npolitical and policy process,\" he says.\\nStrangio says that the lack of politicians with expertise and backgrounds in STEM \"may be a disadvantage for some \\nworkings of parliament in terms of committee work, where politicians really need to get into the nitty-gritty of policy\".\\n\"However, fundamentally, it\\'s a highly educated cohort. They probably have the skill sets in terms of research \\ncapacities and written communication skills,\" he says.\\nGavin Moodie, adjunct professor at the University of Toronto\\'s Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, says public \\npolicy would be better served if it was \"more informed by technology, science and engineering, because our current \\nand future challenges will be scientific and technological: climate change, health, and technological change.\"\\nAnd only five politicians have studied education. This includes Sue Lines, president of the Senate, as well as Labor \\nMP Ged Kearney.\\nWho are our most educated politicians?\\nProportionally, the Greens are the most formally educated party overall, with three out of 15 party members - 20 per \\ncent - holding PhDs.\\nAdam Bandt completed his PhD in political science at Monash while working part-time at law firm Slater & Gordon. \\nHis thesis was \"Work to Rule: Rethinking Pashukanis, Marx and Law.\"\\nThere are seven Labor politicians with PhDs - or 6.8 per cent of the party. Treasurer Jim Chalmers wrote his thesis \\non former prime minister Paul Keating, titled \"Brawler statesman: Paul Keating and prime ministerial leadership in \\nAustralia.\"\\nOthers Labor PhD holders include Anne Aly, Andrew Charlton, Andrew Leigh and Daniel Mulino.\\nIndependent Helen Haines and Nationals MP Anne Webster also hold PhDs.\\nIn total, the percentage of federal politicians with a PhD is 5.4 per cent - much higher than the 0.7 per cent of the \\nAustralian population (185,000 people) with PhDs.\\nStrangio says that having highly educated politicians is a good thing.\\n\"Legislation is complex. The issues they are dealing with are complex, and higher education can be an advantage.\"\\nWho are our least educated politicians?Page 4 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians, in six charts\\nIt turns out that higher education is not the only way to become a politician, with a sizeable chunk of politicians \\nchoosing an alternate pathway to Parliament House.\\nAlmost one in four politicians (23 per cent) did not graduate from university, while 3 per cent never finished high \\nschool.\\nThe least formally educated politicians come from the Coalition, with some entering the workforce as teenagers. \\nThis is despite the majority of them attending private schools.\\nWarren Entsch, left school at age 14, following his father into the Queensland railway department as a junior porter. \\nEntsch was originally tasked with being the chief toilet cleaner of the Mareeba railway station.\\nWest Australian senator Dorinda Cox joined the WA police force as a cadet at age 17. She was an Aboriginal police \\nliaison officer working on the frontlines, specialising in family violence and sexual assault.\\nDavid Pocock became a professional footballer at age 17, Rob Mitchell left after year 10 to do a shoe-making \\napprenticeship, and Luke Howarth has a certificate III in pest management and a diploma in business.\\nDr Sally Patfield, a lecturer at the University of Newcastle\\'s School of Education, says having a range of educational \\nbackgrounds in parliament is beneficial.\\n\"Politicians bring a diverse range of perspectives and opinions both in terms of their own background, and the \\npeople they represent in Australia. It\\'s important to have these experiences being represented, as it is more \\nreflective of the Australian population,\" she says.\\nHawkins, however, says it is reassuring to have a political cohort who is more educated than the general \\npopulation. \"You would want them to be smarter than the general public. Ideally, you\\'d want them to be more \\nhonest and trustworthy as well,\" Hawkins says.\\nWhere did our politicians go to school?\\nAlmost three in five politicians (57 per cent) were educated at private schools. In comparison, ABS data shows that \\n36 per cent of all students across Australia are enrolled in independent or private schools.\\nJust one politician - Greens senator Jordon Steele-John - was homeschooled.\\nAre there any conclusions to be drawn from this? Hawkins says it shows how old-fashioned notions of the make-up \\nof political parties no longer hold true.\\n\"Labor has traditionally been seen as the party of blue-collar workers, while the Liberals were seen as posh private \\nschool kids.

In July 2020 it established a special \\noperation on outlaw motorcycle gangs.\\nIn its report , the committee noted the ACIC had offered to provide detail on “the importance of evidence obtained \\nthrough its exercise of coercive powers in tackling serious and organised crime”, including “in camera” in a private \\nsession.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nLidia Thorpe’s relationship with ex-bikie should have been declared to law enforcement committee, Labor says\\nGuardian Australia does not suggest that Thorpe shared any confidential information with any person not \\nauthorised to receive it.\\n                                                               Sign up for our free morning newsletter  and afternoon email  to get your \\ndaily news roundup                                                           \\nAly told Guardian Australia “accountability and transparency are the responsibility of all members of parliament”. “ \\nThe committee has significant processes in place for members to declare all conflicts of interest – it’s disappointing \\nto learn a member may not have taken this responsibility to the Australian community seriously.\\n“Adam Bandt needs to explain what his office knew and what he knew, and if he wasn’t informed about these \\nissues, given his office was, why that is the case.”\\nIn a statement, Thorpe said she accepts she “made mistakes” and had “not exercised good judgment”.\\nThorpe told the ABC, which first revealed the relationship , she met Martin “through Blak activism and briefly dated \\nin early 2021”.\\n“We remain friends and have collaborated on our shared interests advocating for the rights of First Nations \\npeoples.”\\nThorpe acknowledged she did not advise Bandt of her relationship with Martin, but insisted that confidential \\ncommittee documents on how the AFP monitors outlaw motorcycle gangs were “treated in confidence”.\\nThorpe said Martin’s history with the Rebels was a “past connection”.\\n“Obviously, I’m concerned about the criminal activities of outlaw motorcycle clubs in general.

In doing \\nso, we send a strong message to mothers that they cannot afford to be out of the workforce for too long.\"\\nThe minister responsible for childcare, Anne Aly, who will hold a press conference with Labor candidate Mary \\nDoyle on Friday, said Campbell\\'s arguments proved she wanted to \"make the cost of living pressures in the outer-\\neast worse, not better\".\\n\"I hope Peter Dutton and his handpicked candidate travel to the outer-eastern suburbs to explain to local families \\nwhy they don\\'t deserve cost-of-living relief.

Aly, the early childhood \\neducation minister, suggested Israel could be investigated over whether it had committed war crimes.\\nThe comments from the first two Muslim ministers in an Australian federal government  go further than the foreign \\nminister, Penny Wong, who has urged all sides to show “restraint” in protecting civilian life.\\nThis week Labor senator Fatima Payman and MP Julian Hill also spoke out by condemning the killing of innocent \\ncivilians in Israel and Palestine.\\nThe opposition has sought to weaponise Labor’s position, arguing it is unfair to urge restraint on Israel, given its \\ncitizens were the victims of the Hamas attacks.\\nHusic, the industry and science minister, noted that about 3,000 Palestinians were dead , including approximately \\n1,000 children, according to the Gaza health ministry.\\n“You’ve got homes, schools, medical centres destroyed,” he told ABC radio on Thursday.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nAustralian ministers say Palestinians are being ‘collectively punished’ for Hamas barbarism\\n“That’s before we even contemplate how they’ll get rebuilt.

She opts for the grilled fennel chicken (no butter please) \\nand a very hot almond milk cappuccino. I choose the zucchini fritters and a bean-a-colada, which disappointingly \\nhas neither beans nor booze.\\nAly, let it be said, is prone to the odd swear word, as am I, and over the next 60 minutes our conversation is \\npeppered with F-bombs.\\nPage 2 of 4\\n\\'I\\'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS\\' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN\\nThe thrice-married Aly had already lived a complex and somewhat haphazard life before she decided rather \\nspontaneously to run as the Labor candidate for the West Australian seat Cowan in 2016. She managed to turf out \\nthe Liberal incumbent Luke Simpkins by the finest of margins. \"It took 10 days to count the vote,\" she says.\\nIn 2019, she increased her margin and by 2022 she harnessed 46.9 per cent of the vote, adding more than 9 per \\ncent to her 2019 numbers.\\nOf that first campaign, she remembers standing at a train station with a picture of herself while waving at cars. A \\nyear ago to the day, she had been invited to speak at the White House at a counterterrorism conference. \"All I could \\nthink was from the White House to Greenwood station. What have I done?\"\\nAly was born Azza Mahmoud Fawzi Hosseini Ali el Serougi in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1967, the daughter of a nurse \\nand a textiles engineer who migrated to Australia in 1969. They were among the last migrants to be received at the \\nBonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre in Albury-Wodonga - which, having made the world\\'s headlines \\ntwo decades earlier over the death from malnutrition of 13 children, had improved conditions considerably.\\nThe family moved first to Marrickville in Sydney\\'s inner west and then, just on the cusp of shifting to Texas, they \\nrelocated to Brisbane, where Aly\\'s dad got a job at the Jennings factory, which made corsets and women\\'s \\nunderwear.\\nThey bought their first house in the very un-chi chi suburb of West End.\\n\"And then in 1974 came the flood. My parents came from a desert country, they had never seen anything like this,\" \\nAly says.\\n\"But it was a defining feature of our Australian story because what we found was a community. It was almost like \\nthey became Australian through the tragedy.\"\\nMoments like that, she says, stand in stark contrast to other moments of division and rancour that have \\ncharacterised the same-sex marriage plebiscite, the Voice referendum and the uncontained racism that followed the \\n9/11 attacks in New York.\\nThe current situation in Gaza is confronting, she says. Aly joined Ed Husic last month to warn Gaza\\'s 2.3 million \\nresidents were being \"collectively punished\" for the crimes of terrorists.\\nAs the Israel-Hamas war becomes more divisive, Aly says she is trying to demonstrate how \"important it is that we \\nrecognise each other\\'s humanity and show compassion to each other, even when we are hurting the most\".\\nAs the minister for early childhood education, and also the minister for youth, Aly has a lot on her plate as she \\nmarshals through two reviews of the childcare and early learning sectors.\\nThe government is moving, slowly, towards adopting a model of universal access. In July, it increased the \\nmaximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning up to $80,000, and a sliding scale in subsidies for families \\nearning less than $530,000.\\n\"The fact is Australia is one of the most expensive places for early childhood education and care,\" says Aly.\\n\"We have a quality system that is world-class, and a quality framework that has been in place for 10 years. The \\nissue is the cost and the fact that the market isn\\'t behaving the way you would expect. It doesn\\'t go to where the \\ndemand is, it goes to where the money is.\"\\nThe delivery of the Productivity Commission report this week and the Australian Competition and Consumer \\nCommission\\'s investigation will ensure childcare remains one of the hot button issues for the Albanese government \\nin coming months.Page 3 of 4\\n\\'I\\'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS\\' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN\\nAly will be familiar to most people, even if they haven\\'t connected the name to the face.

The marriage wasn\\'t arranged, as was common for girls like her. Rather, it was a way of escaping \\nthe strictures of being a single woman in a Muslim country.\\n\"The marriage gave me a freedom that I didn\\'t have living under my parents\\' roof. It gave me the freedom to be a \\nrespectable married woman in Egypt. It meant I could go camping with friends, I could go to parties, I could come \\nhome when I wanted to.\"\\nThere were red flags which she ignored - or didn\\'t know any better.\\nBut after moving to Perth, the violence and contemptuous behaviour escalated.\\n\"There was a bit of martyrdom on my behalf. But there are a lot of stereotypes around women who are survivors, a \\nlot of us are high achievers. The feelings of responsibility and humiliation; we expect more of ourselves,\" she says.\\n\"I remember driving away once and saying out loud to myself: \\'You must be just the kind of woman that men hit.\\' I\\'d \\nresigned myself to it.\\n\"I describe domestic violence as this crack in a bone somewhere in your body that you carry with you through your \\nlife.\\n\"It\\'s hard to imagine myself as the person I was.

I choose the zucchini fritters and a bean-a-colada, which, disappointingly has \\nneither booze nor beans.\\nAly, let it be said, is prone to the odd swear word, as am I, and over the next 60 minutes our conversation is \\npeppered with F-bombs.\\nPage 2 of 5\\nAnne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics\\nThe thrice-married Aly had already lived a complex and somewhat haphazard life before she decided rather \\nspontaneously to run as the Labor candidate for the West Australian seat Cowan in 2016. She managed to turf out \\nthe Liberal incumbent Luke Simpkins by the finest of margins.\\n\"It took 10 days to count the vote,\" she says.\\nIn 2019, she increased her margin and by 2022 she harnessed 46.9 per cent of the vote adding more than 9 per \\ncent to her 2019 numbers.\\nOf that first campaign, she remembers standing at a train station with a picture of herself while waving at cars.

Aly joined Ed Husic last month to warn Gaza\\'s 2.3 million \\nresidents were being \"collectively punished\" for the crimes of terrorists.\\nAs the Israel-Gaza war becomes more divisive, Aly says she is trying to demonstrate how \"important it is that we \\nrecognise each other\\'s humanity and show compassion to each other even when we are hurting the most\".\\n\" I\\'ve spoken and met with the Muslim community and members of the Jewish community. And what I say is to \\ncommunities here, who have intergenerational trauma, and accumulative trauma and who are hurting, is that \\nsometimes the hardest thing to do is to be the rational, calming voice in a room of people who are hurting so much \\nthat the only thing that they can do is shout,\" she says.\\nThe problem with early childhood\\nAs the minister for early childhood education, and also the minister for youth, Aly has a lot on her plate as she \\nmarshalls through two reviews of the childcare and early learning sectors.Page 3 of 5\\nAnne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics\\nThe government is moving, slowly, towards adopting a model of universal access. In July, it increased the \\nmaximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning up to $80,000 and a sliding scale in subsidies for every \\nfamily earning less than $530,000.\\n\"The fact is Australia is one of the most expensive places for early childhood education and care,\" says Aly.\\n\"We have a quality system that is world-class, and a quality framework that has been in place for 10 years. The \\nissue is the cost and the fact that the market isn\\'t behaving the way you would expect. It doesn\\'t go to where the \\ndemand is, it goes to where the money is.\"\\nThe delivery of the Productivity Commission report this week and the Australian Competition and Consumer \\nCommission\\'s investigation will ensure childcare remains one of the hot button issues for the Albanese government \\nin coming months.\\nOne of the problems the government has commissioned the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to \\naddress is price gouging, which could see the benefits of more generous subsidies to parents whittled away to zero \\nby higher fees.\\n\"We\\'re going to be watching. People who are making a lot of money out of early childhood education and care at \\nthe expense of it being affordable and accessible for parents need to know we are watching,\" Aly says.\\nShe says the complexity of the system ranging from ASX-listed corporations to mum-and-dad small businesses, \\nmake it difficult to navigate but that her goal is to find a system \"that works for everyone\".\\n\"That could mean different kinds of service delivery in different areas and even different kinds of services.

She scowls and boos.

The marriage wasn\\'t arranged, as was common for girls like her. Rather, it was a way of escaping \\nthe strictures of being a single woman in a Muslim country.\\n\"The marriage gave me a freedom that I didn\\'t have living under my parents\\' roof. It gave me the freedom to be a \\nrespectable married woman in Egypt. It meant I could go camping with friends, I could go to parties, I could come \\nhome when I wanted to.\"Page 4 of 5\\nAnne Aly reinvented herself many times.

But there are a lot of stereotypes around women who are survivors, a \\nlot of us are high achievers. The feelings of responsibility and humiliation; we expect more of ourselves,\" she says.\\n\"I remember driving away once and saying out loud to myself: \\'you must be just the kind of woman that men hit\\'.

I'm Tania Lawrence, the Member for Hasluck. And it gives me great pleasure to be \\ntoday joined with the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Premier Roger Cook, my state parliamentary colleagues, \\nthe teachers, the trainers and students of North Metro TAFE. When we, even before the election in 2022, we knew \\nwe had a skills and labour shortage. So, one of the very first actions that the Albanese Labor Government took, was \\nto host a summit of unions, businesses, experts, economists, trainers from around the country to identify and \\narticulate the problem and work a pathway to solving it. I also hosted a roundtable here in Perth, with industry \\nleaders, TAFE institutions and with unions. And together, culminating now in this landmark agreement to really fund \\nthe institutions and vocational education training, with TAFE. And we all know, many of us here know, just how \\ncentral it is to having TAFE as the base for education. I myself, as a graduate of TAFE, my staff have done \\napprenticeships as well, and it really does create the careers and pathway opportunities, that have benefited the \\nnation. So with this, I'd love to hand over now to the Prime Minister.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA: Well, thanks very much, Tania, and it's great to be \\nback in the electorate of Hasluck. And it's terrific also to be here with our state parliamentary colleagues, led by \\nPremier Roger Cook, and the Training Minister Simone McGurk, but also Michelle Roberts, the local member here. \\nI am so excited to be in WA this weekend, because of course, it's Telethon Weekend. And you can feel a real uplift \\nhere, as WA does something that other states used to do, but don't do any more, unite in a common interest to \\nraise money to assist sick kids and their family. So, a big shout out at the beginning of this weekend, to all of those \\ninvolved in Telethon and an encouragement to dig deep over this weekend, to make sure that those young \\nAustralians who are so inspirational, who I look forward to meeting their ambassadors later today, and again to talk \\nto people tomorrow about the remarkable example that they show in their resilience, in their positivity, under \\ncircumstances which can be very difficult. But today, we are here at this wonderful TAFE institution to celebrate and \\nto mark the first National Skills Agreement since 2012. Throughout the entire period of my predecessors, there was \\nnot only no National Skills Agreement, there weren't skills agreements between indeed any individual jurisdiction \\nand the Commonwealth. Well, my Government is different. I went to an election saying that we would prioritise \\nTAFE at the center of the vocational education and training system and that we would value skills. The first \\nannouncement that I made as Labor Leader, was back here in Perth in 2019, where I announced the creation of \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nJobs and Skills Australia, a body to identify what the labour market needs were for Australian business going \\nforward, not just over a one year period, but five years, 10 years time. To make sure that our education and training \\nsystem was fit for purpose. To make sure, as well, that we didn't just rely upon temporary labour, bringing people in \\nand then sending them out, and bringing in other people to do the same job. That when we identify an area of skill \\nshortage, we actually have a strategy to tackle it. And that means firstly, training Australians for those jobs. We \\nneed also, of course, to have, migration will continue to play a role. But training Australians up, whether it be for \\ntheir first job or retraining. And it was fantastic to meet some of the students who are here, some of them new in \\ntheir first task that they're looking at doing but others looking at retraining, as well, for the jobs of the future, with the \\nconcentration that this TAFE will have on the renewable sector, which will require different skills. And that's why this \\n$12 billion program that we have put in place over a five year period, with $1.2 billion directly for Western Australia, \\nwill make an enormous difference going forward, over the next five years. And I pay tribute to all of the State and \\nTerritory Governments. A lot of work has gone into this, in the lead up to the National Cabinet meeting that we held \\non Monday, but all of the Premiers and Chief Ministers are very excited about the prospects of going forward. And \\nan example of the way that my Government is working cooperatively with State Governments. Not picking fights \\nwith them, not choosing to back Clive Palmer rather than the local State Government, but choosing instead to back \\nWestern Australians to deliver. Back in this most magnificent of economies, that has been so central to Australia's \\nemployment growth, to continue to be a powerhouse of the national economy. This week we had the labour market \\nfigures, showed an unemployment rate of 3.6 per cent. There have been 19 occasions since records began, where \\nunemployment has had a three in front of it and 16 of the of them have been under my Labor Government, since \\nwere elected last May. Now, we will continue to prioritise the creation of jobs, we will continue to prioritise lifting \\nwages and we will continue to prioritise giving people the skills, so they can fill those good, secure jobs. Now, the \\nFee-Free TAFE is already making an enormous difference. We committed to 180,000 Fee-Free TAFE places this \\nyear. We've delivered at least but still growing, 215,000. Here in WA, there were going to be 18,000 places, we've \\nalmost doubled that figure. WA was very quick off the mark in making a difference. And here at this TAFE, just one \\nexample of the difference that it has made, before Fee-Free TAFE this course in electronics used to cost $3,700. It \\nattracted about seven students each term. Fee-Free TAFE means that now the course has 85 students enrolled, \\nseven to 85. A practical example of how our commitment to Fee-Free TAFE, making a difference, working with \\nState Governments is making a difference to the economy. But importantly as well, making a difference to people's \\nlives by training them up and giving them the skills that they need for secure work into the future. So, I want to also \\nconclude by just giving a shout out to those people who are doing the training. A lot of people, when I've been to \\nTAFEs over the years, people who've already made a massive contribution through the skills and work that they've \\ndone, towards the end of their careers or sometimes after they're formally retired, go and impart those skills to the \\nnext generation coming through. And that's a really important thing about TAFE that we see and I thank those who \\nare doing that. And this course at this wonderful TAFE, I just think this is a really practical announcement and a \\npractical example of how my Government is getting on with dealing with cost of living pressures, dealing with the \\nchallenges which are in the economy and setting us up for a prosperous future. We're going to hear from the \\nPremier and then the WA Training Minister, Simone. And then we'll take questions.\\nROGER COOK, PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA: Thanks very much, Anthony. It's great to have the Prime \\nMinister back here in Western Australia and here in Midland at North Metropolitan TAFE, one of the centres that \\nwill be designed to train all the people we need for our renewable energy transition. So, it's terrific to be here to \\ncelebrate Fee-Free TAFE courses. I'm joined by Minister McGurk, I want to thank her for her leadership in the \\ntraining field, but also acknowledge Tania Lawrence the Member for Hasluck. And of course, the great local \\nMember for Midland, Michelle Roberts. This is an outstanding outcome for Western Australia. In 2023, 36,000 \\nWestern Australians took advantage of our Fee-Free courses, over and above the anticipated 180,000. And so \\nnow, we've got more in 24. And we're really looking forward to extending the Fee-Free TAFE courses under the \\nNational Skills Agreement. Now, my Government always fights for the best deal for Western Australians and the \\nNational Skills Agreement is an outstanding outcome for training Western Australians, not only for the jobs of today, \\nbut for the jobs of the future. It enables us to properly target our resources to those qualifications that we know are \\ngoing to be so vital for the ongoing prosperity of our economy. And it also provides us with an opportunity to target \\ncohorts that we want to see get into the courses, that are so valuable. People from disadvantaged backgrounds, \\ngender diversity in these courses. And so, this is an outstanding outcome. I was very proud to be at the National \\nCabinet meeting earlier in the week, where all the Premiers and Chief Ministers were able to sign off on the Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nNational Skills Agreement. It's a great sign of a Commonwealth Government, which is taking the lead to make sure \\nour economy has the workforce that we need to continue to prosper. This is also in addition to my Government's \\n$246 million redevelopment of our TAFE campuses, almost a quarter of a billion dollars around designing and \\nmaking sure that our TAFE campuses are fit for purpose, to continue to provide great job opportunities for those \\nskills that we'll need today, but to continue to make sure that we have the job opportunities for skills into the future. \\nSo, for instance, here at North Metropolitan TAFE, we'll be providing skills opportunities for those people looking to \\ntransition into the renewable energies future. We'll have a wind turbine here in the very near future, to provide skills \\nfor those people to be able to practice, not only working on wind turbines, but also working at height. So, you can \\nsee how these strategic investments are so important to providing people with jobs. And that's what my \\nGovernment's priority is, is to make sure that Western Australians get the jobs that they deserve. And our \\nunemployment rate figures, which were released yesterday, 3.3 per cent is an outstanding outcome for the Western \\nAustralian economy, and we want to do more. We want to continue to make sure that we provide opportunities for \\nWestern Australians to get rewarding jobs, in great industries, that are forward looking into the future. So, thank you \\nvery much to the Commonwealth Government. Congratulations to Minister McGurk for the National Skills \\nAgreement. This is a great day for Western Australian jobs and training, and very much looking forward to seeing \\nmore success in the Fee-Free TAFE courses into the future.\\nSIMONE MCGURK, WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR TRAINING: Thank you Premier and thank you \\nPrime Minister for being here, as well as Tania Lawrence and Michelle Roberts. I just wanted to acknowledge what \\nwe're able to achieve when we work in cooperation with the Federal Government and the State Government, both \\nbeing so committed in Western Australia to making sure that Western Australians are skilled to do the jobs that we \\nknow are out there and we know are coming. And this five year Skills Agreement, which will deliver $1.3 billion to \\nWestern Australia, $1.3 billion, and that would be $380 million more than we've had in previous, than previous \\nfunding arrangements with the Federal Government. But importantly, we have some certainty of funding for five \\nyears. And working together with a Commonwealth Government to understand what our priority areas are, for the \\njobs that we know are here now and the jobs that we know are coming at us. And to be here at North Metropolitan \\nTAFE here in Midland, where we're able to meet students who are taking advantage of significant Fee-Free \\ncourses, making significant savings. And as the Prime Minister said, we've met a couple of students who are \\nmature age and are coming back and taking the opportunity to upskill, but also young students who can see the \\nopportunities that are here. These are electronic students and you can tell, there's real buzz in the room. They've \\nreally taken advantage of what we're able to deliver with Fee-Free and I would just like to repeat my \\nacknowledgement of the cooperation that we're able to achieve with the Federal Government, when we work \\ntogether. And for the Federal Government, under Prime Minister Albanese and the Skills Minister Brendan \\nO'Connor, understanding that Western Australia has some real pressures and that we need to all work together to \\nput our shoulder to the wheel, to meet the skills demands that are with us today.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Simone. Happy to have questions, on this firstly. This is a really important \\nannouncement and I'm sure you have some other things you want to talk about.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Ed Husic and Anne Aly, who've accused Israel of collectively punishing \\nPalestinians? And if it's not collective punishment, what is it?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Ed Husic, Anne Aly and my entire team voted for a resolution in the Parliament and indeed Ed \\nand Anne spoke about it. That resolution was really important, it unequivocally condemned Hamas for the atrocities \\nthat it committed as a terrorist organisation, with its invasion of Israel. And with the atrocities that were committed, \\nincluding to young people who were attending a music festival, we had people kidnapped and taken from their \\nfamilies. Israel has a right to defend itself. We also acknowledged in that resolution, importantly, that the lives of \\ninnocent civilians needed to be protected. Every loss of an innocent life matters, whether they are Israeli or \\nPalestinian. And I do note the comments of President Biden today. This is what President Biden has had to say, \\n'The US remains committed to the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self determination. We mourn every \\ninnocent life lost. We can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians, who only want to live in peace.' And I \\napplaud the efforts of President Biden, to work with nations in the region to make sure that Gaza will be able to \\nhave access to food, water and medicine. President Biden went on to say, 'We cannot give up on peace and we \\ncannot give up on a two state solution.' And his comments are appropriate, I completely agree with them, and I Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nstand by, as does every Member of the Labor Party, the resolution that was adopted overwhelmingly in the \\nParliament, in the House of Representatives and the same resolution in the Senate just this week.\\nJOURNALIST: We learned just this morning that a 16 year old Aboriginal boy has become first death in custody in \\nWA in the last 50 years. The Voice was your key measure to avoid these sorts of outcomes. With that having failed, \\nwhat's next?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, firstly, can I say that this news is a terrible tragedy and I give my condolences to the family \\nand friends of this young person who has died. And there will now be, of course, a coronial inquiry and so on those \\nspecifics, it is not appropriate, therefore, to comment further. My Government is determined to Close the Gap with \\nIndigenous Australians. We answered the invitation of indigenous Australians to give constitutional recognition in \\nthe form which was requested, which was through a constitutionally enshrined Voice to Parliament. Australians did \\nnot vote for that. Our constitution is difficult to change. We're now on eight out of 45, and it is though the case that \\nIndigenous communities in remote Northern Territory, in places in the Kimberley, in Lockhart River and Palm Island \\nand the Tiwis and other communities, overwhelmingly did vote Yes in this referendum. And that will be a difficult \\ntime, it is a difficult time for Indigenous Australians. But we respect the outcome in our democracy and I have done \\nthat. What we will continue to do, we'll continue to work on Closing the Gap though. The National Skills Agreement \\nis an example, we have over $200 million of that agreement, is set aside for First Nation skills uplift. We want to \\nmake sure that there are more Indigenous apprentices, that there are more Indigenous trainees, that workforces are \\nable to benefit from skilling up Indigenous Australians. I know that many of the companies that were out there \\nsupporting the Voice, are those that have done a lot in terms of reconciliation action plans, in Indigenous \\napprenticeships, and here in Western Australia, of course, has led that quite often, and that's a good thing. But the \\nfact that we have this specific program is an indication that I believe whilst Australians did not vote in favour of the \\nreferendum, Australians do want to see the gap closed. They do want to see disadvantage dealt with, that is, in \\nIndigenous communities. And we'll continue to work in this area, but in health, in life expectancy, in community \\nservices, in all of these areas, with the programs that we have. But also consult with Indigenous communities, \\nbecause one of the things that I do know, and here in Western Australia of all places, is the case. I've been coming \\nhere for a long period of time. I've been here, I think, now 17 times as Prime Minister, that's more than one a month, \\nand it's certainly more than what I committed to, of ten visits a year. Because if you want to find out what's \\nhappening on the ground, here in Western Australia, I think West Australians understand this. They don't want \\ndecisions to just be made in Canberra. They want people to come, to talk to people on the ground, to get those \\nresults. Now, that's a principle that doesn't just apply in Indigenous affairs, it's one that applies across the board. It's \\none that my Government will continue to do, which is why I've engaged so strongly with the Premier, Roger Cook, \\nand why I engaged so strongly as well with his predecessor, Mark McGowan.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you have been coming here for a long time before you were Prime Minister and as \\nPrime Minister, as well. Did you expect such a strong No vote in this state?\\nPRIME MINISTER: People saw what polling was saying, we were determined, though. You had a call in 2017. \\nYou'll note that I was coming here in 2017, but I wasn't the Prime Minister. Nor was I the Prime Minister who \\nestablished a process, which asked Indigenous Australians to deliberate on what form constitutional recognition \\nshould take. That process, we had John Howard way back in, we had a vote on the Preamble, which had a similar \\noutcome, last century. We then had John Howard go to an election in 2007, we then had Tony Abbott and then \\nMalcolm Turnbull establish a process. That process came up with the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017. You \\nhad Ken Wyatt appointed as the Minister for Indigenous Australians and go to Garma in 2019. I was there when he \\nput forward the idea that there would be a referendum. That was the policy that Scott Morrison was elected on in \\n2019. It never happened. It never happened. I'm a Prime Minister who will promise to do things and then go and do \\nthem. I think that's how you restore faith in politics. That is something that we need to do. I launched my campaign \\nhere at the stadium and I promised on multiple occasions, that we would do this. And we gave Australians their say, \\nbut we respect the outcome that was given.\\nJOURNALIST: How concerned are you about the unlawful use of solitary confinement in our detention centre, that \\ncan see Indigenous kids held in their cell for 23 hours? Including the one -Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: I have no intention of commenting on, from Canberra, about the specifics of what occurs in \\nevery centre in Australia\\nJOURNALIST: But, if we're trying to Close the Gap\\nPRIME MINISTER: It's a question of the State. I'm not going to pretend, on a serious issue when it comes to \\nIndigenous Australians, that I am somehow an expert on every issue. That's the whole point that I'm making here, is \\nthat you need to get local engagement and local input on matters.\\nJOURNALIST: What do you make of the Opposition Leader's claims yesterday, urging you to fly to Washington via \\nTel Aviv, in the final moments of Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think that quite clearly, the conflict in the Middle East is a complex one. It's one that has \\ngone on for a considerable period of time. The responsibility for what is happening now rests firmly with Hamas and \\nthe actions that they have taken. But there are, of course, longer term issues which President Biden has indicated \\nthis morning again, has given people a reminder, that they are issues that need to be addressed. And I \\nacknowledge the suffering of Israeli, as well as Palestinian citizens, who are innocent, who just want to live a life in \\nsecurity and with justice, as the resolution carried by the Parliament said, going forward. I also acknowledge that \\nleaders have a responsibility at this time to make sure that there is, whilst there is some concern in the community \\nand hurt being felt for people who have relatives and friends in the Middle East, whether they be Israeli or \\nPalestinian, this is a very difficult time for the community. So, individuals and particularly people, I draw your \\nattention to the comments of the Director General of ASIO, Mike Burgess, who's spoken about the need to be \\nresponsible in comments and to be careful about language which is used at this time. We have a harmonious \\ncommunity here in Australia, I want to see that continue. There's no place here in Australia for anti-Semitism. \\nThere is also no place here in Australia for Islamophobia. The Leader of the Opposition chose to do that, that's a \\nmatter for him. I have scheduled a visit, that has been longstanding with President Biden, where the logistics of \\norganising that for Sunday, is when we will depart from Canberra. The leaders who have visited, and I note this, the \\nleaders who have visited are members of the P5, the Permanent Members of the Security Council. The United \\nStates has a particular role in that, as does the United Kingdom, as does the other people who have visited there. \\nAnd President Biden's visit produced outcomes of negotiating through with different states, but also was \\naccompanied by a considerable security effort for President Biden. This is not a secure area. Our priority has been \\nto engage and I've engaged, I've met personally with the Israeli Ambassador. I had him to my residence and had a \\ndiscussion. I've had discussions with leaders of the Palestinian community, leaders of the Jewish community here \\nin Australia, as well. The decision of the Leader of the Opposition to raise such an issue publicly, that's a matter for \\nhim. But at this point in time, I have no plans to visit the Middle East, and in terms of the security agencies as well, \\nthere's no disagreement from the position that I've taken.\\nJOURNALIST: From Joe Biden's speech, what are your thoughts, more specifically on these comments, that if we \\nwalk away and let Putin erase Ukraine's independence, would be aggressors, would be emboldened to try and do \\nthe same possibly in the Pacific and the Middle East more broadly?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, we're there with the people of Ukraine because the actions of Vladimir Putin, of invading, \\nillegally the sovereign state of Ukraine, is an attack on the international rule of law and on respect for national \\nboundaries and national sovereignty. That's why Australia has been a significant contributor to the struggle in \\nUkraine. And that's why we've provided support, including providing comfort and refuge for people fleeing Ukraine. \\nSimilarly, our priority hasn't been to get people into the Middle East, it's been to get people out of the Middle East. \\nAustralian citizens, is what we've been concentrating on, rather than having a whole contingent go into an area \\nwhich is clearly very volatile, to say the least. It's a state of war, is going on. The people of Ukraine are showing \\nextraordinary courage, extraordinary courage, and I support President Biden's call to continue to engage, to show \\nresolve. Australia will continue to be a part of the support for the people of Ukraine, for as long as it is required, \\nbecause this isn't just a struggle about what occurs in Ukraine.

Are they representative of the \\nbroader population? This is what we found.\\nHow many of our politicians attended university?\\nOur politicians are overall a highly educated cohort - 77 per cent have a bachelor\\'s degree or higher.\\nThis figure is significantly greater than the national average, with Australian Bureau of Statistics data showing just \\n32 per cent of all Australians have graduated from university.\\nSo why is there a remarkably high percentage of university graduates in parliament?\\nIs it because people with an interest in politics or policy are more likely to go to university or is it that they get \\npoliticised while there? John Howard, when prime minister, certainly thought it was the latter, when in 2005 he \\nbanned students from automatically becoming members of the student unions because he saw it as a breeding \\nground for hot-headed lefties and socialists.\\nJohn Hawkins, a political historian from the University of Canberra, says the opposite is most likely the case.\\n\"I suspect it\\'s the other way around; that people who are interested in political ideas and policy are more likely to \\nwant to go to university,\" Hawkins says.\\nPage 2 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians, in six charts\\nOur analysis reveals that 83.5 per cent of Labor politicians have at least one degree compared to 68.6 per cent of \\nCoalition members.\\nPaul Strangio, emeritus professor of politics at Monash University, said the prevalence of politicians with degrees in \\nhistory, politics, sociology and law makes sense.\\n\"There\\'s a certain synchronicity. These degrees teach people analytical skills, as well as strong written and verbal \\ncommunication skills. Arguably, there\\'s a good match-up with the role of a politician,\" he says.\\nCertainly, universities are where many politicians get their first taste of politics and activism.\\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese is one such example. He was prominent in campus politics during his time at the \\nUniversity of Sydney, which culminated in his presidency of NSW Young Labor and later as a rising political staffer.\\nSimon Birmingham, leader of the opposition in the Senate, was president of the Adelaide University Liberal Club in \\n1993, and was a key member of Young Liberals in South Australia for most of the 1990s. He later became an \\nelectorate officer for Senator Robert Hill.\\nIt goes to show that the path from student politics to staffer to MP is well-trodden.\\nThere are countless politicians who cut their teeth in student politics. Opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was chair of \\nthe Bayside Young Liberals in 1990. As a student, Tony Burke, minister for industrial relations, was the president of \\nAustralian Young Labor. Foreign affairs minister Penny Wong was heavily involved in the Labor Club at Adelaide \\nUniversity and served on the national executive of the National Union of Students.\\nAnd that\\'s just for starters.\\nWhich universities produce the most politicians?\\nThe institution that has produced the most of our federal politicians is the University of Sydney, closely followed by \\nthe universities of Melbourne and Queensland.\\nUniversities in the Group of Eight (Go8) dominate the ranking, taking up eight out of 10 spots on the list.\\nJohn Hawkins makes the simple point: \"These are the main universities in the states with the biggest populations.\"\\nBut he adds they are also the institutions most likely to offer degrees in law, economics, history and philosophy, and \\nalso the most likely to offer double-degrees, which are a popular choice among the political classes.\\nFor some, however, the prevalence of degrees from Group of Eight universities is emblematic of entrenched elitism \\nand social division in the broader population.\\nGlenn Savage, associate professor of education policy at the University of Melbourne, has compared Australia\\'s \\n\"highly inequitable\" education system to an \"ecosystem\" with flow-on effects that influence an individual\\'s tertiary \\nstudy and, ultimately, employment.\\n\"It\\'s natural that young people who have more advantageous circumstances will end up in more advantageous \\npositions,\" he says.\\nWhat are our politicians most likely to study?\\nAlthough parliament largely consists of highly educated politicians, it\\'s a bit more monochrome when it comes to \\nwhat they studied - mostly arts and humanities.\\nAbout 40 per cent of federal politicians studied arts at university, which was by a long shot the most popular degree. \\nA double arts-law degree was also common, with 27 politicians, or 12 per cent, graduating with that particular \\ncombination.Page 3 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians, in six charts\\nClare O\\'Neil, Brendan O\\'Connor. Bill Shorten, Michelle Rowland, Julian Leeser, Anika Wells, Zoe McKenzie, Angus \\nTaylor, Adam Bandt and Andrew Gee are just a few of the current crop of politicians with double degrees.\\nThere is a range of majors under the broader umbrella of arts.\\nSenator Katy Gallagher studied in political science and sociology. Labor frontbencher Anne Aly majored in English \\nliterature, with a minor in acting. Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather and transport minister Catherine King studied \\nhistory and social work respectively.\\nOnly 20 politicians (or 9 per cent of parliament) are qualified in science or engineering. Seven studied medicine, \\nincluding independents Monique Ryan and Sophie Scamps. One - Emma McBride - did pharmacy. Greens MP \\nElizabeth Watson-Brown is an architect.\\nSavage says arts degrees, in particular law, politics, and other humanities, \"lend themselves very well to producing \\nthe kinds of knowledge and skill sets which would prove useful for a politician\".\\n\"These degrees would also expose students to theories into social dynamics that are of direct relevance to the \\npolitical and policy process,\" he says.\\nStrangio says that the lack of politicians with expertise and backgrounds in STEM \"may be a disadvantage for some \\nworkings of parliament in terms of committee work, where politicians really need to get into the nitty-gritty of policy\".\\n\"However, fundamentally, it\\'s a highly educated cohort. They probably have the skill sets in terms of research \\ncapacities and written communication skills,\" he says.\\nGavin Moodie, adjunct professor at the University of Toronto\\'s Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, says public \\npolicy would be better served if it was \"more informed by technology, science and engineering, because our current \\nand future challenges will be scientific and technological: climate change, health, and technological change.\"\\nAnd only five politicians have studied education. This includes Sue Lines, president of the Senate, as well as Labor \\nMP Ged Kearney.\\nWho are our most educated politicians?\\nProportionally, the Greens are the most formally educated party overall, with three out of 15 party members - 20 per \\ncent - holding PhDs.\\nAdam Bandt completed his PhD in political science at Monash while working part-time at law firm Slater & Gordon. \\nHis thesis was \"Work to Rule: Rethinking Pashukanis, Marx and Law.\"\\nThere are seven Labor politicians with PhDs - or 6.8 per cent of the party. Treasurer Jim Chalmers wrote his thesis \\non former prime minister Paul Keating, titled \"Brawler statesman: Paul Keating and prime ministerial leadership in \\nAustralia.\"\\nOthers Labor PhD holders include Anne Aly, Andrew Charlton, Andrew Leigh and Daniel Mulino.\\nIndependent Helen Haines and Nationals MP Anne Webster also hold PhDs.\\nIn total, the percentage of federal politicians with a PhD is 5.4 per cent - much higher than the 0.7 per cent of the \\nAustralian population (185,000 people) with PhDs.\\nStrangio says that having highly educated politicians is a good thing.\\n\"Legislation is complex. The issues they are dealing with are complex, and higher education can be an advantage.\"\\nWho are our least educated politicians?Page 4 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians, in six charts\\nIt turns out that higher education is not the only way to become a politician, with a sizeable chunk of politicians \\nchoosing an alternate pathway to Parliament House.\\nAlmost one in four politicians (23 per cent) did not graduate from university, while 3 per cent never finished high \\nschool.\\nThe least formally educated politicians come from the Coalition, with some entering the workforce as teenagers. \\nThis is despite the majority of them attending private schools.\\nWarren Entsch, left school at age 14, following his father into the Queensland railway department as a junior porter. \\nEntsch was originally tasked with being the chief toilet cleaner of the Mareeba railway station.\\nWest Australian senator Dorinda Cox joined the WA police force as a cadet at age 17. She was an Aboriginal police \\nliaison officer working on the frontlines, specialising in family violence and sexual assault.\\nDavid Pocock became a professional footballer at age 17, Rob Mitchell left after year 10 to do a shoe-making \\napprenticeship, and Luke Howarth has a certificate III in pest management and a diploma in business.\\nDr Sally Patfield, a lecturer at the University of Newcastle\\'s School of Education, says having a range of educational \\nbackgrounds in parliament is beneficial.\\n\"Politicians bring a diverse range of perspectives and opinions both in terms of their own background, and the \\npeople they represent in Australia. It\\'s important to have these experiences being represented, as it is more \\nreflective of the Australian population,\" she says.\\nHawkins, however, says it is reassuring to have a political cohort who is more educated than the general \\npopulation. \"You would want them to be smarter than the general public. Ideally, you\\'d want them to be more \\nhonest and trustworthy as well,\" Hawkins says.\\nWhere did our politicians go to school?\\nAlmost three in five politicians (57 per cent) were educated at private schools. In comparison, ABS data shows that \\n36 per cent of all students across Australia are enrolled in independent or private schools.\\nJust one politician - Greens senator Jordon Steele-John - was homeschooled.\\nAre there any conclusions to be drawn from this?

I'm Mary Doyle, I'm the Labor Candidate for \\nthe Aston by-election. It's really exciting to be here at Swinburne TAFE with the Prime Minister and Ministers \\nO'Connor and Aly. And thanks to everyone including the wonderful students for showing us around this morning. \\nTAFE is something I'm hugely passionate about, having been a TAFE student myself many years ago. And I can \\ntell you, when I talk to people about the Albanese Government's plans for fee-free TAFE in critical sectors, they \\noverwhelmingly tell me it's a great idea. This is a Government that I want to be a part of. One that looks at the \\npressures facing families in the outer-eastern suburbs and then goes about making a practical difference to address \\nthose challenges. Whether it's cheaper child care, which will benefit 5,700 families here in Aston. Whether it's \\ncheaper medicines, already saving Aston locals more than $250,000 since that came in. Whether it's fee-free TAFE \\nfor 55,000 Victorians. I want to be a part of the team that delivers for the outer-east. If I'm elected to be part of the \\nAlbanese Government as the next Member for Aston, I promise you this I will always fight for TAFE, I will always \\nfight for cheaper child care, and I will always fight for locals. And I'm thrilled to welcome the PM back to Wantirna.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Well, thanks very much, Mary. And I do want to thank the staff and the \\nstudents at Swinburne TAFE here for the very warm welcome that I've received here this morning, along with my \\nMinister for Skills and Training, Brendan O'Connor, and my Minister who looks after Early Childhood Learning, \\nAnne Aly. We're here to talk to students. We're here also to hear firsthand from them the difference that fee-free \\nTAFE is making to their lives. We, arising out of the Jobs and Skills Summit last year, and a commitment we made \\nat the election to 180,000 fee-free TAFE places are happening right now. And what we heard from this morning is \\nstudents who not only are benefiting from that fee-free TAFE, but they're also working and earning an income while \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nthat is happening. We've learned from them firsthand that this was part of the incentive for them to enter an area \\nwhich has skill shortages. So, it's good for students, but it's good for the economy as well. And it's good for this \\nregion, because we also heard that the early learning centres which they are partaking in now, in terms of their work \\nexperience, are all local. And Mary Doyle understands that. That's why I want Mary Doyle, next Saturday, to \\nbecome the Member for Aston. Because this community needs a voice in government. A Labor Government. A \\nLabor Government that cares about people in the outer suburbs. A Labor Government that's committed to making a \\ndifference with fee-free TAFE, to making a difference with the cheaper pharmaceuticals, but making a difference as \\nwell in child care costs for families. One of the things that is happening here from the students we spoke to, not only \\nare they benefiting from free-free TAFE, they're benefiting from working, because there are skills shortages, but \\nthey're also having the bonus of our cheaper child care plan, that comes in on July 1, will mean that more women in \\nparticular can join the workforce. This isn't a welfare policy. This is a productivity enhancing economic policy. This is \\nabout improving women's workforce participation, it's about boosting productivity and also about boosting the \\npopulation. The three Ps of economic growth are all ticked by this policy. Mary Doyle understands this. She hasn't \\nshopped around for a seat. Mary Doyle ran for this seat last year, and she's been committed to her community, \\nwhere she has lived for a long period of time, here in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. And that's why I want \\nsomeone who actually understands this community, who's committed to this community, and who will represent this \\ncommunity in the by-election on April 1. People do have an opportunity to send a message to the Opposition that \\nthey need to do better than have Peter Dutton as their Leader. Peter Dutton, who has spent year after year in \\ngovernment deriding Victorians, condemning the sacrifices that they were making during the pandemic, and \\nsomeone who said that people weren't safe to go out in Melbourne. Like, he just doesn't get this city and he doesn't \\nget this state of Victoria. Mary Doyle does. She'll be a fantastic representative, and I look forward to her joining our \\nteam after April 1 and having input into the Budget that we'll be putting together in May, which will take further \\npressure off working families in communities like this. I'll get Brendan to say something, Anne, and then we're \\nhappy to take questions.\\nBRENDAN O'CONNOR, MINISTER FOR SKILLS AND TRAINING: Thanks, Prime Minister. It's great to be with the \\nPrime Minister and, of course, with Mary and Anne, here today at this fantastic dual sector provider at Swinburne. \\nIt's fair to say that when we were elected, we comprehended the challenge we had in supplying the skills to the \\nlabour market. There were skill shortages across the economy. Wherever you looked, whatever professional trade, \\nthere were shortages. It was for that reason the Prime Minister convened the Jobs and Skills Summit, bringing \\ntogether industry, bringing together state and territory governments, and finding solutions to the problems that we \\ninherited. And I'm happy to say that the 180,000 fee-free TAFE places decision that was made at that summit was \\nan absolutely critical part of the response by the Albanese Government to the skill shortages. And we're seeing it \\nhere today, as a result of that decision and as a result of decisions by the Albanese Government with eight separate \\ngovernments, eight state and territory governments, to have agreements in each jurisdiction, we can focus on the \\neconomies of each state and territory. And that's what we've done. 55,000 fee-free places in Victoria, and then a \\nlarge proportion of those, for example, in early childhood education, where there's a massive demand. 40 per cent \\nof the advertisements for those jobs are in Victoria. That's why we've dedicated 3,800 places to this state, and that's \\nwhy the students we've met today are able to enrol in those courses, knowing that they can afford it, knowing that \\nthey can cope with the cost of living pressures because the courses are fee-free, which also means, because \\nenrolments are going up, the supply of skilled workers to this really critical sector of our economy, looking after and \\nteaching our children, preschool children is absolutely vital, we'll be able to provide that pipeline. So, as a result of \\nthose agreements with state and territory governments, the fee-free component, which is ensuring that enrolments \\nare increasing, we are responding to the skill shortages across the economy, not just in that area, but today we are \\nfocussing on that area. And I believe that, certainly in talking with Mary, she fully understands the pressure that \\nparents are under in terms of costs, the pressure that students are under, and that's why we're providing fee-free \\nplaces and understands, too, that we need to be ensuring that we can supply the skilled workforce to an economy \\nthat is certainly in need of such a supply. It's because of these decisions we are seeing the benefits that are \\nhappening. And that's why in talking to the students today, it was quite obvious that it was a lot easier for them to \\nenter into these courses, acquire these much needed skills, because of the announcement and the decision of the \\nAlbanese Government, working with state and territory governments, providing fee-free options for them.Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: Thanks, Brendan. It's great to be here this \\nmorning, of course, with the Prime Minister, with Brendan O'Connor, and our wonderful candidate for Aston, Mary \\nDoyle. Mary is a local and she gets it. She gets what families here are going through and she understands the \\nimportance of early childhood education and care. And, in fact, Mary was saying that her own daughter went locally \\nhere, accessed early childhood education and care locally here, and still recognises her early childhood education \\nteacher at the shopping centre. That's because she's a local. She knows this area, and she understands and values \\nearly childhood education and care. Now, in just under 100 days, families right across Australia are going to reap \\nthe benefits of our reforms that are making early childhood education and care more affordable. And we know that \\nin order for that to be successful, we need a sustainable workforce. That is why the fee-free TAFE that the \\nAlbanese Labor Government has introduced is so important. And today, we had the pleasure of meeting students \\nlike Tiana and Connor who are using that fee-free TAFE. They are saving thousands of dollars and they are the \\nfuture workforce of early childhood education and care, but they're also the current workforce of early childhood \\neducation and care. Because, as the Prime Minister said, they are working as they are getting their degree in areas \\nof skill shortages. We know that our early childhood education and care reforms that make it much more affordable \\nfor families right across Australia are important, but we're also getting on with the job of ensuring that we have that \\nsustainable workforce. And I'm proud to be a part of a Labor Government, I look forward to welcoming Mary Doyle \\nas a Member for Aston after the election next week. I know she will make an extremely valuable contribution to the \\nLabor Caucus. And I look forward to seeing more students like Tiana and Connor taking advantage of that fee-free \\nTAFE, graduating with an Early Childhood Education and Care Certificate, and becoming part of our valuable \\nworkforce in early childhood education and care.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there's a lot of mortgage stress in the Aston area, what can your Government do to \\nalleviate some of that?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, what we're doing is having a comprehensive housing policy. There is legislation before the \\nParliament, before the Senate next week, the Housing Australia Future Fund. That has a number of components to \\nit. One is an increased investment in social and community housing, which will create 30,000 additional units over \\nthe next five years. But it also has within it as well, additional funding for emergency housing, some $100 million, \\nand it has, as part of that as well, funding specifically for veterans housing, as well as for women and children \\nescaping family and domestic violence. That's one element. The other thing we're doing is a housing accord, \\nworking with the private sector, with organisations like the Master Builders and the Housing Industry Association \\nand others, having an accord with state and territory governments to increase the supply of housing. Prices, of \\ncourse, are a product of demand and supply. So, what we want to do is to increase the supply of housing. We also \\nhave our Housing Supply and Affordability Council is part of the legislation for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \\nWhat that's aimed at doing is working with each level of government to make sure that approvals and land release \\nand those issues are dealt with in our outer suburbs in a way that assists people. We recognise that people are \\ndoing it tough. We are taking action on that. That's the other reason why we're making sure that we put downward \\npressure on inflation. The Reserve Bank Governor, in the statement that he made at the beginning of this month, \\nhas said that he hoped that inflation had peaked in the December quarter. Of course, the highest inflation rate \\ngrowth of any quarter this century was the March 2022 quarter last year. So, the last full quarter in which the \\nCoalition were in office was the highest inflation of any quarter in Australia this century. And that's why, as well, we \\nwill produce a responsible Budget. That's why we returned 99 per cent of the revenue gains to the Budget in \\nOctober last year. So there's no easy fix here. But we want to work with the Andrews Government to make sure that \\nwe deal with the housing stress, which is a national phenomenon. That's why we're working with all state and \\nterritory governments and the private sector. And that's why I'd urge the Senate next week to pass this legislation \\nthat will make a difference.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you expect the Premier to join you on the campaign trail in the last week here in Aston?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I'll be in Parliament next week.\\nJOURNALIST: Over the weekend maybe?Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well I won't be here over the weekend. There's a couple of elections on, this by-election. This \\nafternoon I'll be in Penrith, so a bit of notice for the media, I'll be in Penrith and I'll be in Riverstone this afternoon \\nand I'll be in a range of seats tomorrow in my home state of New South Wales, as you would expect.\\nJOURNALIST: Are you confident Chris Minns will get the job done?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Chris Minns, I think, will make an outstanding Premier of New South Wales. That's a decision \\nfor the people of New South Wales. I think, can I say this? I think that Dominic Perrottet and Chris Minns are both \\nvery good people. They're good human beings. I have a good relationship with both of them and I like both of them. \\nThe problem is that Dominic Perrottet's Government is a shambles. The Liberals are too busy fighting each other \\nand fighting the Nationals, and the Nationals fighting each other, to fight for the people of New South Wales. And \\nthat's why Chris Minns deserves and his team deserves to be elected to government tomorrow. I'll work with \\nwhoever is elected it, as I do constructively. I've had liaison with Premier Rockliff this morning. My Government \\nactually works for solutions. We look for unity. We don't look for division. The problem with the modern Liberal Party \\nis that it is so divided on itself. On itself. I mean, they can't make a decision on constitutional recognition for \\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in 2023. If they oppose it, they've got to say. When will that occur? How \\nlong? Is 122 years not long enough to wait to recognise that our history didn't begin in 1788? The Victorian Liberal \\nParty here are a shambles. We've seen them fighting each other. And the Caucus can't make a decision in \\nCanberra, in Peter Dutton. That's why we need to send a message to them that they need to do better. They need \\nto get their act together. That's why Mary Doyle deserves to be elected as the Member for Aston. If she joins our \\nCaucus, she'll join a united, coherent team. A united, coherent team that has plans for our economic growth, that \\nhas plans for social equity, that has plans for gender equality, that has plans for dealing with the challenge of \\nclimate change, that supports multiculturalism, that doesn't have to think about these things because it's in our core. \\nIt's our instinct. And that is what Mary Doyle, that's the team that she will join if she's elected.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Linda Burney that Peter Dutton is just looking for excuses to reject the Voice? \\nAnd secondly, will you release the Solicitor-General's advice on the wording?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well the two things are connected, because Peter Dutton knows that he sat in a Cabinet for \\nnine years and didn't release any advice to the Cabinet. It's not the way it works. And he knows that. He knows that. \\nSo what we saw from Peter Dutton, over a long period of time, was first in the lead-up to my speech at Garma, he \\nsaid, 'We don't know what the question is.' So, I released draft words. We received not a suggestion in between \\nJuly last year and yesterday when I released what will be in the legislation to go to Parliament next week. Not one \\nsuggestion from him or Julian Leeser, the Shadow Attorney-General, of any change. Not a word. And Julian Leeser, \\nwe know, has been involved with the wording since a decade ago. A decade ago. He was one of the people who \\nwere involved in that process, as Noel Pearson outlined in The Australian some weeks ago. So, Peter Dutton needs \\nto get real about this. This isn't about him, and it's not about me. This is about whether we are a better country \\ngoing forward. It's whether we can recognise Indigenous Australians in our nation's birth certificate. And then it's \\nonly about one other thing, which is will we get better outcomes if we consult the people who are impacted by those \\ndecisions? That's what this is about. It's a simple proposition before the Australian people, and I'm confident that \\nthe Australian people will vote yes. And the idea whenever any detail is given, and yesterday we released eight of \\nthe principles that will go towards the legislation in shaping the Voice. And the Voice can't be clearer, the words that \\nwill go forward include, the third point, 'The Parliament shall, subject to this constitution, have power to make laws \\nwith respect to matters relating to', which is a legal term, 'Relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, \\nincluding its composition, functions, powers and procedures'. Peter Dutton will be a part of the Parliament and \\nfuture members will be a part of future Parliaments, that will determine the function of the Voice. And he knows that \\nthat's the case. And we know from the Republic playbook that occurred last century, that it is nothing more than a \\ntactic, and it lacks genuineness to just continue to say 'We don't have the detail'. No matter how much detail is put \\nout, Peter Dutton will say, 'What about more detail?' That's the game that's being played here. And he should make \\na decision of where he stands on this issue, because this is an issue that isn't the creation of a Labor Government. \\nThis has arisen from the bottom up. And yesterday I had Ken Wyatt, who flew overnight to Canberra, the \\nIndigenous Affairs Minister in the Morrison Government, to stand next to me and with his fellow Aboriginal and \\nTorres Strait Islander people who've been a part of the Referendum Working Group, who've come to a unanimous \\nposition. And I'd say that this should be above politics as the 1967 referendum was.Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what economic benefits do you see from the Voice, and do you intend to sit down \\nwith Mr Dutton before next Thursday to discuss his concerns?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I sat down with him yesterday. I sat down with him before we did the press conference. Let's be \\nvery clear, that's the seventh time I have sat down with Peter Dutton. Peter Dutton has met with the Referendum \\nWorking Group twice. You know what? At those meetings we haven't had questions raised. He's had every \\nopportunity. There have been, I think it was Thomas Mayor yesterday, outlined the number of inquiries, details, \\ncommittees that have looked into this over more than a decade. The Uluru Statement from the Heart was in 2017. It \\ngrew out of a First Nations Constitutional Convention. It grew out of a five-year process from 2012 that began back \\nat the end of the last century. John Howard was Prime Minister when he said there needed to be constitutional \\nrecognition. Scott Morrison went to the election in 2019 and said there should be constitutional recognition. It was \\nthe Morrison Government that established the committee that Tom Calma and Marcia Langton presided over, with \\npeople like Chris Kenny and Frank Brennan and a range of people who participated and produced a report that is \\nhundreds of pages long. It went to the Cabinet of the Morrison Government, not my Government, not once, but \\ntwice. The detail is out there. The detail is out there. We need to know, as well, know this, that the programs that \\nhave been successful, that make a difference for Indigenous people, are ones in which they have been involved. \\nJustice reinvestment by the Coalition Government in New South Wales in places like Moree and Bourke, the \\nIndigenous Rangers Program, community health programs. Where people are involved, you get better outcomes. \\nAnd that is something that is just a fact, and that is why we had this coming together. Aboriginal and Torres Strait \\nIslander people are no less homogeneous than any other group that you want to pick. But what you had yesterday \\nwas people from different parts of Australia, from different parts of the country, coming together. And, you know, \\nthe great Galarrwuy Yunupingu, watching it there on Yolngu country in Arnhem Land, watching it, a product of his \\nlife's work. These people, their patience, their modesty, their humbleness, is inspirational. And they deserve, they \\ndeserve nothing less than for people to put politics aside and to get this done. And we will give the Australian \\npeople the opportunity to enlarge our country later this year. And we can be enlarged, or we can shrink. Shrink into \\nplaying old politics. And that's what people need to consider who are in positions of political leadership on this \\nissue.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you worried the wording leaves the door open for High Court challenges? Or are \\nyou confident that it's as watertight as you say it is?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I'm absolutely confident. But I'm confident on the basis of people like the former head of the \\nHigh Court, Justice French. He might know something about the Constitution. The leading academic in Australia \\non constitutional law, Professor Anne Twomey, might know something about the Constitution. This hasn't arisen in \\na vacuum. There's been all of this work done by the advisory group to the Referendum Working Group. It's very \\nclear that this is a straightforward proposition. People can read it themselves. I just read out the third clause that \\nmakes it clear that the Parliament is primary. The primacy of the Parliament is there, including its composition, \\nfunctions, powers and procedures. A key word, including. So, all matters, and it says, to matters relating to, matters \\nis often used as a legal term as well. And we took proper advice, and I'm very confident you will have an \\nopportunity. If you get ten lawyers in a room, you'll often get someone who gets a run in. That's what they're paid to \\ndo. That's why on different sides, to put this in perspective, that's why on different sides in courts, you have lawyers \\non one side and lawyers on the other side. They're paid to advocate. That's an honourable profession to do. But \\nyou shouldn't use that fact to say that there's someone out there who disagrees. Someone, I'm sure I can find you a \\nlawyer who can tell you that that jacket you're wearing is orange or pink. I can find that for you. Pay them enough, \\nthat'll happen.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just back to Aston. Do you think what's happening internally in the Liberal Party in \\nVictoria could actually work in Mary Doyle's favour in regards to Moira Deeming?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think the Liberal Party is dysfunctional here. We saw that in the lead-up to the state \\nelection. We saw that in the way that the Federal Liberal Party people here operate as well. Michael Sukkar was \\npretty desperate to stop the candidate being preselected here for Aston. He didn't have confidence that someone \\nfrom outside the area would be appropriate. I mean, we're a long way from the Melbourne City Council. And I think \\nthat that's just a fact, that it's a dysfunctional branch. They need to be given time to get their act together. In the Page 6 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nmeantime, we've got a fantastic candidate who secured the unanimous support of everyone, who ran last time, who \\nhasn't shopped around for a seat.

There is widespread suffering, no question about that,” Albanese said.\\nVamvakinou on Thursday said the federal government should take on a more “active role” in bringing peace to the \\nPalestine and Israel conflict. \\n“The blockade has to end, the actual incursion into Gaza shouldn’t happen and another way forward would be \\ncalling for parties to come to some dialogue to try and avert this humanitarian disaster,” Vamvakinou said.\\nFellow frontbencher Anne Aly had earlier stood by Husic’s comments, saying it was “difficult to argue” that \\nPalestinians, including hundreds of children who had been killed , were not being “collectively punished”.\\nThe calls echo those made recently by the Greens, with the leader, Adam Bandt, supporting Husic and Aly’s \\ncomments.\\nBandt said the ministers were sharing “the reality of what is happening on the ground” and that it was time for the \\nLabor government to “catch up” and call for the invasion to end.\\n“What the ministers are saying is right, and that must lead the Labor government to shift its position and now call for \\nan immediate ceasefire and for the invasion to end,” Bandt said.\\n“Because otherwise, that collective punishment, and the deaths and starvation and dehydration of civilians, is going \\nto continue.”\\nEarlier this week, the Labor senator Fatima Payman and MP Julian Hill also spoke out by condemning the killing of \\ninnocent civilians in Israel and Palestine.\\nHusic said there was “an obligation on governments, particularly the Israeli government to … follow the rules of \\ninternational law and to observe, in particular, that innocents should be protected”.\\n“I am very mindful of the words of our prime minister in saying that protecting innocent lives is not a sign of \\nweakness.\\nIt is a sign of strength. That is a really important thing that needs to be considered. I genuinely believe there needs \\nto be a de-escalation. I don’t think it’s in Israel’s interest, long-term, to engage in the occupation of Gaza. ”\\nCollective punishment is prohibited by international law , including article 33 of the Geneva conventions. Wilful \\nkilling of civilians and extensive destruction of property beyond what is necessary are war crimes.\\nIn a speech to the house on Tuesday, Vamvakinou said collective punishment was not within the rules of war, and \\nthat the people of Gaza should not be seen as “collateral damage”.\\n“Let’s be clear: ‘not within the rules of war’ is doublespeak for ‘illegal’, doublespeak for ‘crime’. The indiscriminate \\ntargeting of an unarmed civilian population, 40% of whom are under 15 years old, is not within the rules of war,” she \\nsaid.Page 3 of 3\\nAlbanese government accused of ‘deep division’ and ‘confusion’ over Israel -Hamas conflict stance\\n“The occupation of Palestine, the longest ongoing military occupation in modern history, and the siege and \\nblockade of Gaza is illegal.”\\nLoad-Date: October 19, 2023\\nEnd of Document', 'Page 1 of 4\\nWho\\'s in and who\\'s out after Albanese\\'s ministry reshuffle?\\nWho\\'s in and who\\'s out after Albanese\\'s ministry reshuffle?\\nABC Premium News (Australia)\\nJuly 28, 2024 Sunday\\nCopyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved\\nLength: 957 words\\nByline: By political reporter Jake Evans and Courtney Gould\\nHighlight: Promotions, demotions and retirements — find out who is entering cabinet or picking up a ministry out of \\nthe Albanese government\\'s reshuffle.\\nBody\\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese has shaken up his ministry as the federal government gears up for an election, \\nand seeks a circuit breaker after several tough months in the home affairs and immigration portfolios.\\nTwo senior ministers, Linda Burney and Brendan O\\'Connor, had already announced their retirements — now we \\nknow who has gotten what from a ministry reshuffle.\\nHere\\'s who is in and who is out of the government\\'s new-look cabinet and the wider ministry.\\nCabinet\\nRichard Marles, Defence\\nDeputy Prime Minister Richard Marles remains as Defence Minister.\\nPenny Wong, Foreign Affairs\\nPenny Wong remains as Foreign Affairs Minister.\\nJim Chalmers, Treasurer\\nJim Chalmers remains as Treasurer. \\nKaty Gallagher, Finance\\nPage 2 of 4\\nWho\\'s in and who\\'s out after Albanese\\'s ministry reshuffle?\\nKaty Gallagher remains as Finance Minister, Public Service Minister and Minister for Women.\\nDon Farrell, Trade and Tourism\\nDon Farrell remains as Trade and Tourism Minister as well as Special Minister of State.\\nChange: Tony Burke, Home Affairs, Immigration Cyber Security and Arts\\nTony Burke will become Home Affairs and Immigration Minister, replacing both Clare O\\'Neil and Andrew Giles who \\npreviously held the portfolios. \\nMr Burke will stay on as Arts Minister and remain Leader of the House of Representatives.\\nMark Butler, Health\\nMark Butler remains as Minister for Health and Aged Care.\\nChris Bowen, Climate Change and Energy\\nChris Bowen remains as Minister for Climate Change and Energy.\\nTanya Plibersek, Environment and Water\\nTanya Plibersek remains as Environment and Water Minister.\\nCatherine King, Infrastructure and Transport\\nCatherine King remains as Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government Minister\\nAmanda Rishworth, Social Services\\nAmanda Rishworth remains as Social Services Minister.\\nBill Shorten, NDIS and Government Services\\nBill Shorten remains as Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and as the Minister for Government \\nServices.\\nMark Dreyfus, Attorney-General\\nMark Dreyfus remains as Attorney-General.\\nRetiring: Linda Burney, Indigenous Australians\\nLinda Burney, the first Indigenous woman in the lower house and the first Indigenous woman to hold her portfolio, \\nhas stepped down from the ministry.\\nOn Thursday, Ms Burney announced her decision to retire from politics at the next federal election, in part \\nprompting the ministerial reshuffle.\\nMs Burney was elected to represent the seat of Barton in NSW \\nPromoted: Malarndirri McCarthy, Indigenous Australians\\nMalarndirri McCarthy will become the next Indigenous Australians Minister, replacing Linda Burney who has \\ndecided to retire.Page 3 of 4\\nWho\\'s in and who\\'s out after Albanese\\'s ministry reshuffle?\\nSenator McCarthy has represented the Northern Territory since 2016 and was serving as assistant minister in the \\nIndigenous Australians portfolio.\\nShe became a prominent voice for the government during its unsuccessful referendum campaign for an Indigenous \\nVoice to Parliament.\\nBefore entering federal politics Senator McCarthy was a member of the NT Legislative Assembly, and also worked \\nas a journalist for the ABC, NITV and SBS News.\\nJason Clare, Education\\nJason Clare remains as Education Minister.\\nChange: Julie Collins, Agriculture and Small Business\\nJulie Collins moves from Housing to Agriculture, returning to the portfolio she held in opposition.

Aly, the early childhood \\neducation minister, suggested Israel could be investigated over whether it had committed war crimes.\\nThe comments from the first two Muslim ministers in an Australian federal government  go further than the foreign \\nminister, Penny Wong, who has urged all sides to show “restraint” in protecting civilian life.\\nThis week Labor senator Fatima Payman and MP Julian Hill also spoke out by condemning the killing of innocent \\ncivilians in Israel and Palestine.\\nThe opposition has sought to weaponise Labor’s position, arguing it is unfair to urge restraint on Israel, given its \\ncitizens were the victims of the Hamas attacks.\\nHusic, the industry and science minister, noted that about 3,000 Palestinians were dead , including approximately \\n1,000 children, according to the Gaza health ministry.\\n“You’ve got homes, schools, medical centres destroyed,” he told ABC radio on Thursday.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nAustralian ministers say Palestinians are being ‘collectively punished’ for Hamas barbarism\\n“That’s before we even contemplate how they’ll get rebuilt.

That is a really important thing that needs to be considered. I genuinely believe there needs \\nto be a de-escalation. I don’t think it’s in Israel’s interest long term to engage in the occupation of Gaza.”\\nAly said it was “entirely appropriate” that parliament had passed a motion  condemning the Hamas attacks.\\n“But with the escalation of violence, and that was something that I feared from the very beginning – that the \\nescalation of violence would mean there would be more Palestinian lives lost and that has come to pass, and it will \\ncontinue,” she said.\\nAly urged Israel to abide by the rules of law developed by the international community to protect the human rights of \\ncivilians during conflict.\\nAsked if Israel had committed war crimes, Aly replied that: “That is something that possibly could be investigated. I \\nthink that anyone, any state or any group that commits war crimes, should be investigated and should be held \\naccountable.”\\nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has recognised Israel’s right to defend itself but also urged the Netanyahu \\ngovernment to “ operate by the rules of war  ” amid increasing expectations of an imminent ground operation in \\nGaza.\\nOn Monday, Hill told parliament that Israel’s right to defend itself did not extend to the “indiscriminate mass killing of \\ninnocent Palestinians”.\\nHill said he had heard an “overwhelming message” from his community “that the mass punishment of 2 million \\npeople in Gaza is not a proportionate response and this is a trap that Israel must not fall into – it is what Hamas is \\ntrying to provoke”.\\nPayman told the Senate that Australia “must condemn” civilian deaths as “Israeli missiles strike residential \\ndwellings, civilians, multi-story apartments, health facilities as well as places of worship, indiscriminately killing men, \\nwomen and children”.\\n“The price tag of Israel’s right to defend itself cannot be the destruction of Palestine. Israel’s right to defend its \\ncivilians cannot equate to the annihilation of Palestinian civilians.”\\nOn Thursday, the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, said she was “not going to get into” who was responsible  for \\nthe Al-Ahli Arab hospital strike because it was an “unfolding” situation.\\n“What we do know about this is that hundreds of innocent people, who were at a hospital evidently already \\nincredibly unwell and vulnerable, have lost their lives,” she said.\\n“his was set off by these violent and inhumane, barbaric attacks by Hamas.”\\n“What we now see is loss of innocent lives, of men, women and children in Gaza, and I want Australians to know \\nthat, for any innocent loss of life, we stand with Australian communities who experience this pain very deeply, \\nwhether they are Jewish Australians who are mourning the loss of life in the Middle East, or whether they are \\nPalestinian or Muslim Australians who are mourning the loss there.”Page 3 of 3\\nAustralian ministers say Palestinians are being ‘collectively punished’ for Hamas barbarism\\nLoad-Date: October 19, 2023\\nEnd of Document', 'Page 1 of 3\\nLabor minister in heated clash with Palestine activists\\nLabor minister in heated clash with Palestine activists\\nWish Magazine Online\\nMarch 19, 2024 Tuesday 3:12 AM AEDT\\nCopyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved\\nLength: 787 words\\nByline: Paul Garvey\\nBody\\nThe Albanese government\\'s most senior Muslim woman has been verbally attacked by pro-Palestinian activists, \\namid a sustained campaign to target Labor politicians over the Gaza-Israel war.\\nEarly Childhood Education Minister Anne Aly - the nation\\'s first female Muslim minister - was involved in a heated \\nconfrontation with pro-Palestine activists during a \"meet your member\" event at a suburban Perth park on the \\nweekend.\\nPlain-clothed Australian Federal Police officers had to intervene to shut down the event as tensions between Dr Aly \\nand the activists rose.\\nAs Dr Aly left the scene, activists could be heard calling her a \"coward\" and one woman shouted \"don\\'t call yourself \\na Muslim\".

John Howard, when prime minister, certainly thought it was the latter, when in 2005 he \\nbanned students from automatically becoming members of the student unions because he saw it as a breeding \\nground for hot-headed lefties and socialists.\\nJohn Hawkins, a political historian from the University of Canberra, says the opposite is most likely the case.\\n\"I suspect it\\'s the other way around; that people who are interested in political ideas and policy are more likely to \\nwant to go to university,\" Hawkins says.\\nPage 2 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians, in six charts\\nOur analysis reveals that 83.5 per cent of Labor politicians have at least one degree compared to 68.6 per cent of \\nCoalition members.\\nPaul Strangio, emeritus professor of politics at Monash University, said the prevalence of politicians with degrees in \\nhistory, politics, sociology and law makes sense.\\n\"There\\'s a certain synchronicity.

Aly, the early childhood \\neducation minister, suggested Israel could be investigated over whether it had committed war crimes.\\nThe comments from the first two Muslim ministers in an Australian federal government  go further than the foreign \\nminister, Penny Wong, who has urged all sides to show “restraint” in protecting civilian life.\\nThis week Labor senator Fatima Payman and MP Julian Hill also spoke out by condemning the killing of innocent \\ncivilians in Israel and Palestine.\\nThe opposition has sought to weaponise Labor’s position, arguing it is unfair to urge restraint on Israel, given its \\ncitizens were the victims of the Hamas attacks.\\nHusic, the industry and science minister, noted that about 3,000 Palestinians were dead , including approximately \\n1,000 children, according to the Gaza health ministry.\\n“You’ve got homes, schools, medical centres destroyed,” he told ABC radio on Thursday.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nAustralian ministers say Palestinians are being ‘collectively punished’ for Hamas barbarism\\n“That’s before we even contemplate how they’ll get rebuilt.

Climate change was front of mind for many voters, \\nwho backed independents including Allegra Spender - daughter of the late Zampatti - in the seat of Wentworth and \\nKate Chaney in Curtin, to speak up for the environment. \\nThis is in keeping with what ANU climate scientist Joëlle Gergis so aptly sums up in her new book, Humanity\\'s \\nMoment: A Climate Scientist\\'s Case for Hope, on sale this month: \"What an extraordinary time to be alive; we are \\npart of the generation that will help heal the world.\" The age of societal sustainability is upon us.\\nThe 47th parliament will be one of the most representative we\\'ve had, thanks to a new government and a collection \\nof MPs who accurately represent modern Australia. A record number of women will take their seats in the House of \\nRepresentatives. Many are not aligned to the traditional parties and make up the super-sized crossbench. Women \\ncount for 51 per cent of the Australian population and now comprise 38 per cent of the chamber in the new \\nparliament - the highest ever proportion on record - after 58 women were elected to the lower house, including 19 \\ndebutante MPs. The Senate reached and exceeded 50 per cent gender parity in the last parliament, and maintains \\nthis in the new parliament.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nOur new government\\'s force for change\\nWe\\'ve come a long way since Edith Cowan, our first female politician, was elected to the Western Australian \\nparliament in 1921. Her colleagues were so opposed to her being there, she had to make several attempts at \\npresenting her first speech, because the men kept interjecting as she spoke of wanting equal access to education \\nfor young Australian women.\\nStill, in 2003, the then newly minted cabinet minister Julie Bishop was infamously told how to dress by her male \\npeers. \"When I was first appointed to the ministry, I was asked to be the Minister for Ageing. And one of the prime \\nminister\\'s senior advisors rang me and said \\'Julie, take this the right way, but forget the Armani suits and forget the \\ncorporate look. You\\'re the minister for the ageing, you\\'re going into aged- care homes, you\\'ve got to dress \\nappropriately,\" Bishop has shared. \"I said \\'What? You mean like cardigans?\\' And he said, \\'Yeah more prints, more \\ncolour. Just not corporate.\\'\"\\nNot too long after this sermon from a \"faceless man\", Bishop went on to become Minister for Foreign Affairs and a \\nthree-time deputy leader of the Liberal party. And she did it all in good shoes and some of the best of Australian \\nfashion, including Rachel Gilbert, Rebecca Vallance and Dion Lee, and coined the phrase \"fashion diplomacy\" by \\nexclusively wearing homegrown Australian labels when on official visits.\\nHer work, putting fashion on the agenda, also helped put the wheels in motion for the Australian Fashion Council to \\nsecure a federal grant to establish an Australian Fashion trademark in 2021. The world-first campaign hopes to \\npromote the industry and create more local jobs. \"The Australian Fashion trademark will be a driving force in \\nbuilding the industry\\'s growth trajectory to deliver substantial economic, social and environmental gains over the \\nnext 10 years,\" CEO of Australian Fashion Council Leila Naja Hibri said in a statement. \\n\"We can show the world how prioritising people and the planet together with profit can lead to a legacy of thriving \\nprosperity.\"\\nWe\\'ve also come a long way since the ministerial wing was trodden, pretty much exclusively, by men in R.M. \\nWilliams boots in the first part of this century. R.M. Williams was, during those days, owned by luxury conglomerate \\nLVMH. But in 2020 the brand was brought home when it was acquired by Perth billionaire Andrew \\'Twiggy\\' Forrest \\nand his wife Nicola. \\nSince Australia\\'s richest man has taken over the bootmaker, vegan materials have been introduced and demand is \\nskyrocketing. And Prime Minister Anthony Albanese seems keen to tread new paths. One that is more female-\\nfocused, family-friendly and awake to the Australia we want to become.\\nNow, almost 10 per cent of the Senate identifies as Indigenous after the record number of Aboriginal and Torres \\nStrait Islander representatives elected, including four new Indigenous MPs, three of whom are women. Indigenous \\nAffairs Minister Linda Burney was bestowed her new job on election night. Burney, a proud Wiradjuri woman, knows \\nthe power that culture, and more specifically fashion, can have in politics. Since serving in federal politics from \\n2016, she has regularly been spotted on the shadow front bench in the odd Albus Lumen piece and Anna Quan \\nskirt.\\nAnother fashion force has also joined the Albanese government\\'s inner sanctum. The aforementioned Anne Aly, \\nMinister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth is as passionate about her portfolio as she is about \\nfashion, the statements style can make and where that style is made.\\nDr Aly is Australia\\'s first Muslim woman elected to parliament and is also the first Muslim woman MP who will sit in \\nthe outer ministry. Serendipitously, she represents the seat of Cowan - named after Edith Cowan - in Perth\\'s outer \\nsuburbs. Born in Egypt, Aly\\'s family moved to Sydney\\'s southwest when she was two. She is a survivor of domestic \\nviolence and an academic specialising in counter terrorism. She\\'s still considered a global authority into why \\nchildren are lured into extremism. She also achieved all this after spending her 20s working for the minimum wage \\nas a single mother of two boys.\\nAly has a deep love and appreciation of fashion and since being elected in 2016 has regularly worn local labels that \\nhave a strong sustainable ethos including KitX and Flannel to parliament and official functions. In 2017 she made Page 3 of 3\\nOur new government\\'s force for change\\nher catwalk debut for then 23-year-old designer Thomas Puttick, a designer who was showing sustainable clothes \\nbefore it went mainstream and cast \\'muses\\' such as Aly instead of models for his runway show.\\n\"It\\'s in my nature to disrupt because it is more often the case that I just end up being somewhere where I am not \\nexpected to be - like parliament or the catwalk of Australian Fashion Week,\" Dr Aly tells Vogue. Fashion is in her \\nblood. \"My dad studied textiles engineering. But when my family migrated to Australia, he couldn\\'t find work in his \\nfield so he drove buses,\" Aly shares. \"A story typical of so many who choose to make Australia home. Dad would \\nspend hours at the sewing machine making our school uniforms. He never lost his passion for design. My mum tells \\nme I\\'ve inherited his passion.\"\\nShe says that it was only after she was first elected that she realised what her career and success represented \\nwhen a constituent in Perth said she had told her young daughter that Dr Aly\\'s victory was proof girls, Muslim girls \\nespecially, in Australia could achieve anything. \\n\"The significance of it to other people, to the people watching really struck me at that point,\" she continues. \"I made \\na very conscious decision that, coming in here, I would do everything I could to not just open the door but break \\ndown the wall. I feel so heartened by the fact that I may have been the first, but I\\'m certainly not going to be the \\nlast.\"\\nThis article appears in the August issue of Vogue Australia, on sale now.\\nNotes\\nDocument links may not lead to an active page.

I'm Mary Doyle, I'm the Labor Candidate for \\nthe Aston by-election. It's really exciting to be here at Swinburne TAFE with the Prime Minister and Ministers \\nO'Connor and Aly. And thanks to everyone including the wonderful students for showing us around this morning. \\nTAFE is something I'm hugely passionate about, having been a TAFE student myself many years ago. And I can \\ntell you, when I talk to people about the Albanese Government's plans for fee-free TAFE in critical sectors, they \\noverwhelmingly tell me it's a great idea. This is a Government that I want to be a part of. One that looks at the \\npressures facing families in the outer-eastern suburbs and then goes about making a practical difference to address \\nthose challenges. Whether it's cheaper child care, which will benefit 5,700 families here in Aston. Whether it's \\ncheaper medicines, already saving Aston locals more than $250,000 since that came in. Whether it's fee-free TAFE \\nfor 55,000 Victorians. I want to be a part of the team that delivers for the outer-east. If I'm elected to be part of the \\nAlbanese Government as the next Member for Aston, I promise you this I will always fight for TAFE, I will always \\nfight for cheaper child care, and I will always fight for locals. And I'm thrilled to welcome the PM back to Wantirna.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Well, thanks very much, Mary. And I do want to thank the staff and the \\nstudents at Swinburne TAFE here for the very warm welcome that I've received here this morning, along with my \\nMinister for Skills and Training, Brendan O'Connor, and my Minister who looks after Early Childhood Learning, \\nAnne Aly. We're here to talk to students. We're here also to hear firsthand from them the difference that fee-free \\nTAFE is making to their lives. We, arising out of the Jobs and Skills Summit last year, and a commitment we made \\nat the election to 180,000 fee-free TAFE places are happening right now. And what we heard from this morning is \\nstudents who not only are benefiting from that fee-free TAFE, but they're also working and earning an income while \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nthat is happening. We've learned from them firsthand that this was part of the incentive for them to enter an area \\nwhich has skill shortages. So, it's good for students, but it's good for the economy as well. And it's good for this \\nregion, because we also heard that the early learning centres which they are partaking in now, in terms of their work \\nexperience, are all local. And Mary Doyle understands that. That's why I want Mary Doyle, next Saturday, to \\nbecome the Member for Aston. Because this community needs a voice in government. A Labor Government. A \\nLabor Government that cares about people in the outer suburbs. A Labor Government that's committed to making a \\ndifference with fee-free TAFE, to making a difference with the cheaper pharmaceuticals, but making a difference as \\nwell in child care costs for families. One of the things that is happening here from the students we spoke to, not only \\nare they benefiting from free-free TAFE, they're benefiting from working, because there are skills shortages, but \\nthey're also having the bonus of our cheaper child care plan, that comes in on July 1, will mean that more women in \\nparticular can join the workforce. This isn't a welfare policy. This is a productivity enhancing economic policy. This is \\nabout improving women's workforce participation, it's about boosting productivity and also about boosting the \\npopulation. The three Ps of economic growth are all ticked by this policy. Mary Doyle understands this. She hasn't \\nshopped around for a seat. Mary Doyle ran for this seat last year, and she's been committed to her community, \\nwhere she has lived for a long period of time, here in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. And that's why I want \\nsomeone who actually understands this community, who's committed to this community, and who will represent this \\ncommunity in the by-election on April 1. People do have an opportunity to send a message to the Opposition that \\nthey need to do better than have Peter Dutton as their Leader. Peter Dutton, who has spent year after year in \\ngovernment deriding Victorians, condemning the sacrifices that they were making during the pandemic, and \\nsomeone who said that people weren't safe to go out in Melbourne. Like, he just doesn't get this city and he doesn't \\nget this state of Victoria. Mary Doyle does. She'll be a fantastic representative, and I look forward to her joining our \\nteam after April 1 and having input into the Budget that we'll be putting together in May, which will take further \\npressure off working families in communities like this. I'll get Brendan to say something, Anne, and then we're \\nhappy to take questions.\\nBRENDAN O'CONNOR, MINISTER FOR SKILLS AND TRAINING: Thanks, Prime Minister. It's great to be with the \\nPrime Minister and, of course, with Mary and Anne, here today at this fantastic dual sector provider at Swinburne. \\nIt's fair to say that when we were elected, we comprehended the challenge we had in supplying the skills to the \\nlabour market. There were skill shortages across the economy. Wherever you looked, whatever professional trade, \\nthere were shortages. It was for that reason the Prime Minister convened the Jobs and Skills Summit, bringing \\ntogether industry, bringing together state and territory governments, and finding solutions to the problems that we \\ninherited. And I'm happy to say that the 180,000 fee-free TAFE places decision that was made at that summit was \\nan absolutely critical part of the response by the Albanese Government to the skill shortages. And we're seeing it \\nhere today, as a result of that decision and as a result of decisions by the Albanese Government with eight separate \\ngovernments, eight state and territory governments, to have agreements in each jurisdiction, we can focus on the \\neconomies of each state and territory. And that's what we've done. 55,000 fee-free places in Victoria, and then a \\nlarge proportion of those, for example, in early childhood education, where there's a massive demand. 40 per cent \\nof the advertisements for those jobs are in Victoria. That's why we've dedicated 3,800 places to this state, and that's \\nwhy the students we've met today are able to enrol in those courses, knowing that they can afford it, knowing that \\nthey can cope with the cost of living pressures because the courses are fee-free, which also means, because \\nenrolments are going up, the supply of skilled workers to this really critical sector of our economy, looking after and \\nteaching our children, preschool children is absolutely vital, we'll be able to provide that pipeline. So, as a result of \\nthose agreements with state and territory governments, the fee-free component, which is ensuring that enrolments \\nare increasing, we are responding to the skill shortages across the economy, not just in that area, but today we are \\nfocussing on that area. And I believe that, certainly in talking with Mary, she fully understands the pressure that \\nparents are under in terms of costs, the pressure that students are under, and that's why we're providing fee-free \\nplaces and understands, too, that we need to be ensuring that we can supply the skilled workforce to an economy \\nthat is certainly in need of such a supply. It's because of these decisions we are seeing the benefits that are \\nhappening. And that's why in talking to the students today, it was quite obvious that it was a lot easier for them to \\nenter into these courses, acquire these much needed skills, because of the announcement and the decision of the \\nAlbanese Government, working with state and territory governments, providing fee-free options for them.Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: Thanks, Brendan. It's great to be here this \\nmorning, of course, with the Prime Minister, with Brendan O'Connor, and our wonderful candidate for Aston, Mary \\nDoyle. Mary is a local and she gets it. She gets what families here are going through and she understands the \\nimportance of early childhood education and care. And, in fact, Mary was saying that her own daughter went locally \\nhere, accessed early childhood education and care locally here, and still recognises her early childhood education \\nteacher at the shopping centre. That's because she's a local. She knows this area, and she understands and values \\nearly childhood education and care. Now, in just under 100 days, families right across Australia are going to reap \\nthe benefits of our reforms that are making early childhood education and care more affordable. And we know that \\nin order for that to be successful, we need a sustainable workforce. That is why the fee-free TAFE that the \\nAlbanese Labor Government has introduced is so important. And today, we had the pleasure of meeting students \\nlike Tiana and Connor who are using that fee-free TAFE. They are saving thousands of dollars and they are the \\nfuture workforce of early childhood education and care, but they're also the current workforce of early childhood \\neducation and care. Because, as the Prime Minister said, they are working as they are getting their degree in areas \\nof skill shortages. We know that our early childhood education and care reforms that make it much more affordable \\nfor families right across Australia are important, but we're also getting on with the job of ensuring that we have that \\nsustainable workforce. And I'm proud to be a part of a Labor Government, I look forward to welcoming Mary Doyle \\nas a Member for Aston after the election next week. I know she will make an extremely valuable contribution to the \\nLabor Caucus. And I look forward to seeing more students like Tiana and Connor taking advantage of that fee-free \\nTAFE, graduating with an Early Childhood Education and Care Certificate, and becoming part of our valuable \\nworkforce in early childhood education and care.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there's a lot of mortgage stress in the Aston area, what can your Government do to \\nalleviate some of that?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, what we're doing is having a comprehensive housing policy. There is legislation before the \\nParliament, before the Senate next week, the Housing Australia Future Fund. That has a number of components to \\nit. One is an increased investment in social and community housing, which will create 30,000 additional units over \\nthe next five years. But it also has within it as well, additional funding for emergency housing, some $100 million, \\nand it has, as part of that as well, funding specifically for veterans housing, as well as for women and children \\nescaping family and domestic violence. That's one element. The other thing we're doing is a housing accord, \\nworking with the private sector, with organisations like the Master Builders and the Housing Industry Association \\nand others, having an accord with state and territory governments to increase the supply of housing. Prices, of \\ncourse, are a product of demand and supply. So, what we want to do is to increase the supply of housing. We also \\nhave our Housing Supply and Affordability Council is part of the legislation for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \\nWhat that's aimed at doing is working with each level of government to make sure that approvals and land release \\nand those issues are dealt with in our outer suburbs in a way that assists people. We recognise that people are \\ndoing it tough. We are taking action on that. That's the other reason why we're making sure that we put downward \\npressure on inflation. The Reserve Bank Governor, in the statement that he made at the beginning of this month, \\nhas said that he hoped that inflation had peaked in the December quarter. Of course, the highest inflation rate \\ngrowth of any quarter this century was the March 2022 quarter last year. So, the last full quarter in which the \\nCoalition were in office was the highest inflation of any quarter in Australia this century. And that's why, as well, we \\nwill produce a responsible Budget. That's why we returned 99 per cent of the revenue gains to the Budget in \\nOctober last year. So there's no easy fix here. But we want to work with the Andrews Government to make sure that \\nwe deal with the housing stress, which is a national phenomenon. That's why we're working with all state and \\nterritory governments and the private sector. And that's why I'd urge the Senate next week to pass this legislation \\nthat will make a difference.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you expect the Premier to join you on the campaign trail in the last week here in Aston?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I'll be in Parliament next week.\\nJOURNALIST: Over the weekend maybe?Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well I won't be here over the weekend. There's a couple of elections on, this by-election. This \\nafternoon I'll be in Penrith, so a bit of notice for the media, I'll be in Penrith and I'll be in Riverstone this afternoon \\nand I'll be in a range of seats tomorrow in my home state of New South Wales, as you would expect.\\nJOURNALIST: Are you confident Chris Minns will get the job done?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Chris Minns, I think, will make an outstanding Premier of New South Wales. That's a decision \\nfor the people of New South Wales. I think, can I say this? I think that Dominic Perrottet and Chris Minns are both \\nvery good people. They're good human beings. I have a good relationship with both of them and I like both of them. \\nThe problem is that Dominic Perrottet's Government is a shambles. The Liberals are too busy fighting each other \\nand fighting the Nationals, and the Nationals fighting each other, to fight for the people of New South Wales. And \\nthat's why Chris Minns deserves and his team deserves to be elected to government tomorrow. I'll work with \\nwhoever is elected it, as I do constructively. I've had liaison with Premier Rockliff this morning. My Government \\nactually works for solutions. We look for unity. We don't look for division. The problem with the modern Liberal Party \\nis that it is so divided on itself. On itself. I mean, they can't make a decision on constitutional recognition for \\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in 2023. If they oppose it, they've got to say. When will that occur? How \\nlong? Is 122 years not long enough to wait to recognise that our history didn't begin in 1788? The Victorian Liberal \\nParty here are a shambles. We've seen them fighting each other. And the Caucus can't make a decision in \\nCanberra, in Peter Dutton. That's why we need to send a message to them that they need to do better. They need \\nto get their act together. That's why Mary Doyle deserves to be elected as the Member for Aston. If she joins our \\nCaucus, she'll join a united, coherent team. A united, coherent team that has plans for our economic growth, that \\nhas plans for social equity, that has plans for gender equality, that has plans for dealing with the challenge of \\nclimate change, that supports multiculturalism, that doesn't have to think about these things because it's in our core. \\nIt's our instinct. And that is what Mary Doyle, that's the team that she will join if she's elected.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Linda Burney that Peter Dutton is just looking for excuses to reject the Voice? \\nAnd secondly, will you release the Solicitor-General's advice on the wording?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well the two things are connected, because Peter Dutton knows that he sat in a Cabinet for \\nnine years and didn't release any advice to the Cabinet. It's not the way it works. And he knows that. He knows that. \\nSo what we saw from Peter Dutton, over a long period of time, was first in the lead-up to my speech at Garma, he \\nsaid, 'We don't know what the question is.' So, I released draft words. We received not a suggestion in between \\nJuly last year and yesterday when I released what will be in the legislation to go to Parliament next week. Not one \\nsuggestion from him or Julian Leeser, the Shadow Attorney-General, of any change. Not a word. And Julian Leeser, \\nwe know, has been involved with the wording since a decade ago. A decade ago. He was one of the people who \\nwere involved in that process, as Noel Pearson outlined in The Australian some weeks ago. So, Peter Dutton needs \\nto get real about this. This isn't about him, and it's not about me. This is about whether we are a better country \\ngoing forward. It's whether we can recognise Indigenous Australians in our nation's birth certificate. And then it's \\nonly about one other thing, which is will we get better outcomes if we consult the people who are impacted by those \\ndecisions? That's what this is about. It's a simple proposition before the Australian people, and I'm confident that \\nthe Australian people will vote yes. And the idea whenever any detail is given, and yesterday we released eight of \\nthe principles that will go towards the legislation in shaping the Voice. And the Voice can't be clearer, the words that \\nwill go forward include, the third point, 'The Parliament shall, subject to this constitution, have power to make laws \\nwith respect to matters relating to', which is a legal term, 'Relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, \\nincluding its composition, functions, powers and procedures'. Peter Dutton will be a part of the Parliament and \\nfuture members will be a part of future Parliaments, that will determine the function of the Voice. And he knows that \\nthat's the case. And we know from the Republic playbook that occurred last century, that it is nothing more than a \\ntactic, and it lacks genuineness to just continue to say 'We don't have the detail'. No matter how much detail is put \\nout, Peter Dutton will say, 'What about more detail?' That's the game that's being played here. And he should make \\na decision of where he stands on this issue, because this is an issue that isn't the creation of a Labor Government. \\nThis has arisen from the bottom up. And yesterday I had Ken Wyatt, who flew overnight to Canberra, the \\nIndigenous Affairs Minister in the Morrison Government, to stand next to me and with his fellow Aboriginal and \\nTorres Strait Islander people who've been a part of the Referendum Working Group, who've come to a unanimous \\nposition. And I'd say that this should be above politics as the 1967 referendum was.Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what economic benefits do you see from the Voice, and do you intend to sit down \\nwith Mr Dutton before next Thursday to discuss his concerns?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I sat down with him yesterday. I sat down with him before we did the press conference. Let's be \\nvery clear, that's the seventh time I have sat down with Peter Dutton. Peter Dutton has met with the Referendum \\nWorking Group twice. You know what? At those meetings we haven't had questions raised. He's had every \\nopportunity. There have been, I think it was Thomas Mayor yesterday, outlined the number of inquiries, details, \\ncommittees that have looked into this over more than a decade. The Uluru Statement from the Heart was in 2017. It \\ngrew out of a First Nations Constitutional Convention. It grew out of a five-year process from 2012 that began back \\nat the end of the last century. John Howard was Prime Minister when he said there needed to be constitutional \\nrecognition. Scott Morrison went to the election in 2019 and said there should be constitutional recognition. It was \\nthe Morrison Government that established the committee that Tom Calma and Marcia Langton presided over, with \\npeople like Chris Kenny and Frank Brennan and a range of people who participated and produced a report that is \\nhundreds of pages long. It went to the Cabinet of the Morrison Government, not my Government, not once, but \\ntwice. The detail is out there. The detail is out there. We need to know, as well, know this, that the programs that \\nhave been successful, that make a difference for Indigenous people, are ones in which they have been involved. \\nJustice reinvestment by the Coalition Government in New South Wales in places like Moree and Bourke, the \\nIndigenous Rangers Program, community health programs. Where people are involved, you get better outcomes. \\nAnd that is something that is just a fact, and that is why we had this coming together. Aboriginal and Torres Strait \\nIslander people are no less homogeneous than any other group that you want to pick. But what you had yesterday \\nwas people from different parts of Australia, from different parts of the country, coming together. And, you know, \\nthe great Galarrwuy Yunupingu, watching it there on Yolngu country in Arnhem Land, watching it, a product of his \\nlife's work. These people, their patience, their modesty, their humbleness, is inspirational. And they deserve, they \\ndeserve nothing less than for people to put politics aside and to get this done. And we will give the Australian \\npeople the opportunity to enlarge our country later this year. And we can be enlarged, or we can shrink. Shrink into \\nplaying old politics. And that's what people need to consider who are in positions of political leadership on this \\nissue.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you worried the wording leaves the door open for High Court challenges? Or are \\nyou confident that it's as watertight as you say it is?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I'm absolutely confident. But I'm confident on the basis of people like the former head of the \\nHigh Court, Justice French. He might know something about the Constitution. The leading academic in Australia \\non constitutional law, Professor Anne Twomey, might know something about the Constitution. This hasn't arisen in \\na vacuum. There's been all of this work done by the advisory group to the Referendum Working Group. It's very \\nclear that this is a straightforward proposition. People can read it themselves. I just read out the third clause that \\nmakes it clear that the Parliament is primary. The primacy of the Parliament is there, including its composition, \\nfunctions, powers and procedures. A key word, including. So, all matters, and it says, to matters relating to, matters \\nis often used as a legal term as well. And we took proper advice, and I'm very confident you will have an \\nopportunity. If you get ten lawyers in a room, you'll often get someone who gets a run in. That's what they're paid to \\ndo. That's why on different sides, to put this in perspective, that's why on different sides in courts, you have lawyers \\non one side and lawyers on the other side. They're paid to advocate. That's an honourable profession to do. But \\nyou shouldn't use that fact to say that there's someone out there who disagrees. Someone, I'm sure I can find you a \\nlawyer who can tell you that that jacket you're wearing is orange or pink. I can find that for you. Pay them enough, \\nthat'll happen.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just back to Aston. Do you think what's happening internally in the Liberal Party in \\nVictoria could actually work in Mary Doyle's favour in regards to Moira Deeming?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think the Liberal Party is dysfunctional here. We saw that in the lead-up to the state \\nelection. We saw that in the way that the Federal Liberal Party people here operate as well. Michael Sukkar was \\npretty desperate to stop the candidate being preselected here for Aston. He didn't have confidence that someone \\nfrom outside the area would be appropriate. I mean, we're a long way from the Melbourne City Council. And I think \\nthat that's just a fact, that it's a dysfunctional branch. They need to be given time to get their act together. In the Page 6 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nmeantime, we've got a fantastic candidate who secured the unanimous support of everyone, who ran last time, who \\nhasn't shopped around for a seat. Who wants to represent this seat, this time after next Saturday. Thanks very \\nmuch.\\nLoad-Date: March 24, 2023\\nEnd of Document\", \"Page 1 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nStates News Service\\nOctober 20, 2023 Friday\\nCopyright 2023 States News Service\\nLength: 4025 words\\nByline: States News Service\\nDateline: CANBERRA, Australia \\nBody\\nThe following information was released by the office of the Prime Minister of Australia:\\nTANIA LAWRENCE MP, MEMBER FOR HASLUCK: Good morning and welcome to North Metropolitan TAFE in \\nMidland, in the seat of Hasluck. I'm Tania Lawrence, the Member for Hasluck. And it gives me great pleasure to be \\ntoday joined with the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Premier Roger Cook, my state parliamentary colleagues, \\nthe teachers, the trainers and students of North Metro TAFE. When we, even before the election in 2022, we knew \\nwe had a skills and labour shortage. So, one of the very first actions that the Albanese Labor Government took, was \\nto host a summit of unions, businesses, experts, economists, trainers from around the country to identify and \\narticulate the problem and work a pathway to solving it. I also hosted a roundtable here in Perth, with industry \\nleaders, TAFE institutions and with unions. And together, culminating now in this landmark agreement to really fund \\nthe institutions and vocational education training, with TAFE. And we all know, many of us here know, just how \\ncentral it is to having TAFE as the base for education. I myself, as a graduate of TAFE, my staff have done \\napprenticeships as well, and it really does create the careers and pathway opportunities, that have benefited the \\nnation. So with this, I'd love to hand over now to the Prime Minister.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA: Well, thanks very much, Tania, and it's great to be \\nback in the electorate of Hasluck. And it's terrific also to be here with our state parliamentary colleagues, led by \\nPremier Roger Cook, and the Training Minister Simone McGurk, but also Michelle Roberts, the local member here. \\nI am so excited to be in WA this weekend, because of course, it's Telethon Weekend. And you can feel a real uplift \\nhere, as WA does something that other states used to do, but don't do any more, unite in a common interest to \\nraise money to assist sick kids and their family. So, a big shout out at the beginning of this weekend, to all of those \\ninvolved in Telethon and an encouragement to dig deep over this weekend, to make sure that those young \\nAustralians who are so inspirational, who I look forward to meeting their ambassadors later today, and again to talk \\nto people tomorrow about the remarkable example that they show in their resilience, in their positivity, under \\ncircumstances which can be very difficult. But today, we are here at this wonderful TAFE institution to celebrate and \\nto mark the first National Skills Agreement since 2012. Throughout the entire period of my predecessors, there was \\nnot only no National Skills Agreement, there weren't skills agreements between indeed any individual jurisdiction \\nand the Commonwealth. Well, my Government is different. I went to an election saying that we would prioritise \\nTAFE at the center of the vocational education and training system and that we would value skills. The first \\nannouncement that I made as Labor Leader, was back here in Perth in 2019, where I announced the creation of \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nJobs and Skills Australia, a body to identify what the labour market needs were for Australian business going \\nforward, not just over a one year period, but five years, 10 years time. To make sure that our education and training \\nsystem was fit for purpose. To make sure, as well, that we didn't just rely upon temporary labour, bringing people in \\nand then sending them out, and bringing in other people to do the same job. That when we identify an area of skill \\nshortage, we actually have a strategy to tackle it. And that means firstly, training Australians for those jobs. We \\nneed also, of course, to have, migration will continue to play a role. But training Australians up, whether it be for \\ntheir first job or retraining. And it was fantastic to meet some of the students who are here, some of them new in \\ntheir first task that they're looking at doing but others looking at retraining, as well, for the jobs of the future, with the \\nconcentration that this TAFE will have on the renewable sector, which will require different skills. And that's why this \\n$12 billion program that we have put in place over a five year period, with $1.2 billion directly for Western Australia, \\nwill make an enormous difference going forward, over the next five years. And I pay tribute to all of the State and \\nTerritory Governments. A lot of work has gone into this, in the lead up to the National Cabinet meeting that we held \\non Monday, but all of the Premiers and Chief Ministers are very excited about the prospects of going forward. And \\nan example of the way that my Government is working cooperatively with State Governments. Not picking fights \\nwith them, not choosing to back Clive Palmer rather than the local State Government, but choosing instead to back \\nWestern Australians to deliver. Back in this most magnificent of economies, that has been so central to Australia's \\nemployment growth, to continue to be a powerhouse of the national economy. This week we had the labour market \\nfigures, showed an unemployment rate of 3.6 per cent. There have been 19 occasions since records began, where \\nunemployment has had a three in front of it and 16 of the of them have been under my Labor Government, since \\nwere elected last May. Now, we will continue to prioritise the creation of jobs, we will continue to prioritise lifting \\nwages and we will continue to prioritise giving people the skills, so they can fill those good, secure jobs. Now, the \\nFee-Free TAFE is already making an enormous difference. We committed to 180,000 Fee-Free TAFE places this \\nyear. We've delivered at least but still growing, 215,000. Here in WA, there were going to be 18,000 places, we've \\nalmost doubled that figure. WA was very quick off the mark in making a difference. And here at this TAFE, just one \\nexample of the difference that it has made, before Fee-Free TAFE this course in electronics used to cost $3,700. It \\nattracted about seven students each term. Fee-Free TAFE means that now the course has 85 students enrolled, \\nseven to 85. A practical example of how our commitment to Fee-Free TAFE, making a difference, working with \\nState Governments is making a difference to the economy. But importantly as well, making a difference to people's \\nlives by training them up and giving them the skills that they need for secure work into the future. So, I want to also \\nconclude by just giving a shout out to those people who are doing the training. A lot of people, when I've been to \\nTAFEs over the years, people who've already made a massive contribution through the skills and work that they've \\ndone, towards the end of their careers or sometimes after they're formally retired, go and impart those skills to the \\nnext generation coming through. And that's a really important thing about TAFE that we see and I thank those who \\nare doing that. And this course at this wonderful TAFE, I just think this is a really practical announcement and a \\npractical example of how my Government is getting on with dealing with cost of living pressures, dealing with the \\nchallenges which are in the economy and setting us up for a prosperous future. We're going to hear from the \\nPremier and then the WA Training Minister, Simone. And then we'll take questions.\\nROGER COOK, PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA: Thanks very much, Anthony. It's great to have the Prime \\nMinister back here in Western Australia and here in Midland at North Metropolitan TAFE, one of the centres that \\nwill be designed to train all the people we need for our renewable energy transition. So, it's terrific to be here to \\ncelebrate Fee-Free TAFE courses. I'm joined by Minister McGurk, I want to thank her for her leadership in the \\ntraining field, but also acknowledge Tania Lawrence the Member for Hasluck. And of course, the great local \\nMember for Midland, Michelle Roberts. This is an outstanding outcome for Western Australia. In 2023, 36,000 \\nWestern Australians took advantage of our Fee-Free courses, over and above the anticipated 180,000. And so \\nnow, we've got more in 24. And we're really looking forward to extending the Fee-Free TAFE courses under the \\nNational Skills Agreement. Now, my Government always fights for the best deal for Western Australians and the \\nNational Skills Agreement is an outstanding outcome for training Western Australians, not only for the jobs of today, \\nbut for the jobs of the future. It enables us to properly target our resources to those qualifications that we know are \\ngoing to be so vital for the ongoing prosperity of our economy. And it also provides us with an opportunity to target \\ncohorts that we want to see get into the courses, that are so valuable. People from disadvantaged backgrounds, \\ngender diversity in these courses. And so, this is an outstanding outcome. I was very proud to be at the National \\nCabinet meeting earlier in the week, where all the Premiers and Chief Ministers were able to sign off on the Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nNational Skills Agreement. It's a great sign of a Commonwealth Government, which is taking the lead to make sure \\nour economy has the workforce that we need to continue to prosper. This is also in addition to my Government's \\n$246 million redevelopment of our TAFE campuses, almost a quarter of a billion dollars around designing and \\nmaking sure that our TAFE campuses are fit for purpose, to continue to provide great job opportunities for those \\nskills that we'll need today, but to continue to make sure that we have the job opportunities for skills into the future. \\nSo, for instance, here at North Metropolitan TAFE, we'll be providing skills opportunities for those people looking to \\ntransition into the renewable energies future. We'll have a wind turbine here in the very near future, to provide skills \\nfor those people to be able to practice, not only working on wind turbines, but also working at height. So, you can \\nsee how these strategic investments are so important to providing people with jobs. And that's what my \\nGovernment's priority is, is to make sure that Western Australians get the jobs that they deserve. And our \\nunemployment rate figures, which were released yesterday, 3.3 per cent is an outstanding outcome for the Western \\nAustralian economy, and we want to do more. We want to continue to make sure that we provide opportunities for \\nWestern Australians to get rewarding jobs, in great industries, that are forward looking into the future. So, thank you \\nvery much to the Commonwealth Government. Congratulations to Minister McGurk for the National Skills \\nAgreement. This is a great day for Western Australian jobs and training, and very much looking forward to seeing \\nmore success in the Fee-Free TAFE courses into the future.\\nSIMONE MCGURK, WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR TRAINING: Thank you Premier and thank you \\nPrime Minister for being here, as well as Tania Lawrence and Michelle Roberts. I just wanted to acknowledge what \\nwe're able to achieve when we work in cooperation with the Federal Government and the State Government, both \\nbeing so committed in Western Australia to making sure that Western Australians are skilled to do the jobs that we \\nknow are out there and we know are coming. And this five year Skills Agreement, which will deliver $1.3 billion to \\nWestern Australia, $1.3 billion, and that would be $380 million more than we've had in previous, than previous \\nfunding arrangements with the Federal Government. But importantly, we have some certainty of funding for five \\nyears. And working together with a Commonwealth Government to understand what our priority areas are, for the \\njobs that we know are here now and the jobs that we know are coming at us. And to be here at North Metropolitan \\nTAFE here in Midland, where we're able to meet students who are taking advantage of significant Fee-Free \\ncourses, making significant savings. And as the Prime Minister said, we've met a couple of students who are \\nmature age and are coming back and taking the opportunity to upskill, but also young students who can see the \\nopportunities that are here. These are electronic students and you can tell, there's real buzz in the room. They've \\nreally taken advantage of what we're able to deliver with Fee-Free and I would just like to repeat my \\nacknowledgement of the cooperation that we're able to achieve with the Federal Government, when we work \\ntogether. And for the Federal Government, under Prime Minister Albanese and the Skills Minister Brendan \\nO'Connor, understanding that Western Australia has some real pressures and that we need to all work together to \\nput our shoulder to the wheel, to meet the skills demands that are with us today.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Simone. Happy to have questions, on this firstly. This is a really important \\nannouncement and I'm sure you have some other things you want to talk about.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Ed Husic and Anne Aly, who've accused Israel of collectively punishing \\nPalestinians? And if it's not collective punishment, what is it?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Ed Husic, Anne Aly and my entire team voted for a resolution in the Parliament and indeed Ed \\nand Anne spoke about it. That resolution was really important, it unequivocally condemned Hamas for the atrocities \\nthat it committed as a terrorist organisation, with its invasion of Israel. And with the atrocities that were committed, \\nincluding to young people who were attending a music festival, we had people kidnapped and taken from their \\nfamilies. Israel has a right to defend itself. We also acknowledged in that resolution, importantly, that the lives of \\ninnocent civilians needed to be protected. Every loss of an innocent life matters, whether they are Israeli or \\nPalestinian. And I do note the comments of President Biden today. This is what President Biden has had to say, \\n'The US remains committed to the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self determination. We mourn every \\ninnocent life lost. We can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians, who only want to live in peace.' And I \\napplaud the efforts of President Biden, to work with nations in the region to make sure that Gaza will be able to \\nhave access to food, water and medicine. President Biden went on to say, 'We cannot give up on peace and we \\ncannot give up on a two state solution.' And his comments are appropriate, I completely agree with them, and I Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nstand by, as does every Member of the Labor Party, the resolution that was adopted overwhelmingly in the \\nParliament, in the House of Representatives and the same resolution in the Senate just this week.\\nJOURNALIST: We learned just this morning that a 16 year old Aboriginal boy has become first death in custody in \\nWA in the last 50 years. The Voice was your key measure to avoid these sorts of outcomes. With that having failed, \\nwhat's next?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, firstly, can I say that this news is a terrible tragedy and I give my condolences to the family \\nand friends of this young person who has died. And there will now be, of course, a coronial inquiry and so on those \\nspecifics, it is not appropriate, therefore, to comment further. My Government is determined to Close the Gap with \\nIndigenous Australians. We answered the invitation of indigenous Australians to give constitutional recognition in \\nthe form which was requested, which was through a constitutionally enshrined Voice to Parliament. Australians did \\nnot vote for that. Our constitution is difficult to change. We're now on eight out of 45, and it is though the case that \\nIndigenous communities in remote Northern Territory, in places in the Kimberley, in Lockhart River and Palm Island \\nand the Tiwis and other communities, overwhelmingly did vote Yes in this referendum. And that will be a difficult \\ntime, it is a difficult time for Indigenous Australians. But we respect the outcome in our democracy and I have done \\nthat. What we will continue to do, we'll continue to work on Closing the Gap though. The National Skills Agreement \\nis an example, we have over $200 million of that agreement, is set aside for First Nation skills uplift. We want to \\nmake sure that there are more Indigenous apprentices, that there are more Indigenous trainees, that workforces are \\nable to benefit from skilling up Indigenous Australians. I know that many of the companies that were out there \\nsupporting the Voice, are those that have done a lot in terms of reconciliation action plans, in Indigenous \\napprenticeships, and here in Western Australia, of course, has led that quite often, and that's a good thing. But the \\nfact that we have this specific program is an indication that I believe whilst Australians did not vote in favour of the \\nreferendum, Australians do want to see the gap closed. They do want to see disadvantage dealt with, that is, in \\nIndigenous communities. And we'll continue to work in this area, but in health, in life expectancy, in community \\nservices, in all of these areas, with the programs that we have. But also consult with Indigenous communities, \\nbecause one of the things that I do know, and here in Western Australia of all places, is the case. I've been coming \\nhere for a long period of time. I've been here, I think, now 17 times as Prime Minister, that's more than one a month, \\nand it's certainly more than what I committed to, of ten visits a year. Because if you want to find out what's \\nhappening on the ground, here in Western Australia, I think West Australians understand this. They don't want \\ndecisions to just be made in Canberra. They want people to come, to talk to people on the ground, to get those \\nresults. Now, that's a principle that doesn't just apply in Indigenous affairs, it's one that applies across the board. It's \\none that my Government will continue to do, which is why I've engaged so strongly with the Premier, Roger Cook, \\nand why I engaged so strongly as well with his predecessor, Mark McGowan.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you have been coming here for a long time before you were Prime Minister and as \\nPrime Minister, as well. Did you expect such a strong No vote in this state?\\nPRIME MINISTER: People saw what polling was saying, we were determined, though. You had a call in 2017. \\nYou'll note that I was coming here in 2017, but I wasn't the Prime Minister. Nor was I the Prime Minister who \\nestablished a process, which asked Indigenous Australians to deliberate on what form constitutional recognition \\nshould take. That process, we had John Howard way back in, we had a vote on the Preamble, which had a similar \\noutcome, last century. We then had John Howard go to an election in 2007, we then had Tony Abbott and then \\nMalcolm Turnbull establish a process. That process came up with the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017. You \\nhad Ken Wyatt appointed as the Minister for Indigenous Australians and go to Garma in 2019. I was there when he \\nput forward the idea that there would be a referendum. That was the policy that Scott Morrison was elected on in \\n2019. It never happened. It never happened. I'm a Prime Minister who will promise to do things and then go and do \\nthem. I think that's how you restore faith in politics. That is something that we need to do. I launched my campaign \\nhere at the stadium and I promised on multiple occasions, that we would do this. And we gave Australians their say, \\nbut we respect the outcome that was given.\\nJOURNALIST: How concerned are you about the unlawful use of solitary confinement in our detention centre, that \\ncan see Indigenous kids held in their cell for 23 hours? Including the one -Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: I have no intention of commenting on, from Canberra, about the specifics of what occurs in \\nevery centre in Australia\\nJOURNALIST: But, if we're trying to Close the Gap\\nPRIME MINISTER: It's a question of the State. I'm not going to pretend, on a serious issue when it comes to \\nIndigenous Australians, that I am somehow an expert on every issue. That's the whole point that I'm making here, is \\nthat you need to get local engagement and local input on matters.\\nJOURNALIST: What do you make of the Opposition Leader's claims yesterday, urging you to fly to Washington via \\nTel Aviv, in the final moments of Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think that quite clearly, the conflict in the Middle East is a complex one. It's one that has \\ngone on for a considerable period of time. The responsibility for what is happening now rests firmly with Hamas and \\nthe actions that they have taken. But there are, of course, longer term issues which President Biden has indicated \\nthis morning again, has given people a reminder, that they are issues that need to be addressed. And I \\nacknowledge the suffering of Israeli, as well as Palestinian citizens, who are innocent, who just want to live a life in \\nsecurity and with justice, as the resolution carried by the Parliament said, going forward. I also acknowledge that \\nleaders have a responsibility at this time to make sure that there is, whilst there is some concern in the community \\nand hurt being felt for people who have relatives and friends in the Middle East, whether they be Israeli or \\nPalestinian, this is a very difficult time for the community. So, individuals and particularly people, I draw your \\nattention to the comments of the Director General of ASIO, Mike Burgess, who's spoken about the need to be \\nresponsible in comments and to be careful about language which is used at this time. We have a harmonious \\ncommunity here in Australia, I want to see that continue. There's no place here in Australia for anti-Semitism. \\nThere is also no place here in Australia for Islamophobia. The Leader of the Opposition chose to do that, that's a \\nmatter for him. I have scheduled a visit, that has been longstanding with President Biden, where the logistics of \\norganising that for Sunday, is when we will depart from Canberra. The leaders who have visited, and I note this, the \\nleaders who have visited are members of the P5, the Permanent Members of the Security Council. The United \\nStates has a particular role in that, as does the United Kingdom, as does the other people who have visited there. \\nAnd President Biden's visit produced outcomes of negotiating through with different states, but also was \\naccompanied by a considerable security effort for President Biden. This is not a secure area. Our priority has been \\nto engage and I've engaged, I've met personally with the Israeli Ambassador. I had him to my residence and had a \\ndiscussion. I've had discussions with leaders of the Palestinian community, leaders of the Jewish community here \\nin Australia, as well. The decision of the Leader of the Opposition to raise such an issue publicly, that's a matter for \\nhim. But at this point in time, I have no plans to visit the Middle East, and in terms of the security agencies as well, \\nthere's no disagreement from the position that I've taken.\\nJOURNALIST: From Joe Biden's speech, what are your thoughts, more specifically on these comments, that if we \\nwalk away and let Putin erase Ukraine's independence, would be aggressors, would be emboldened to try and do \\nthe same possibly in the Pacific and the Middle East more broadly?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, we're there with the people of Ukraine because the actions of Vladimir Putin, of invading, \\nillegally the sovereign state of Ukraine, is an attack on the international rule of law and on respect for national \\nboundaries and national sovereignty. That's why Australia has been a significant contributor to the struggle in \\nUkraine. And that's why we've provided support, including providing comfort and refuge for people fleeing Ukraine. \\nSimilarly, our priority hasn't been to get people into the Middle East, it's been to get people out of the Middle East. \\nAustralian citizens, is what we've been concentrating on, rather than having a whole contingent go into an area \\nwhich is clearly very volatile, to say the least. It's a state of war, is going on. The people of Ukraine are showing \\nextraordinary courage, extraordinary courage, and I support President Biden's call to continue to engage, to show \\nresolve. Australia will continue to be a part of the support for the people of Ukraine, for as long as it is required, \\nbecause this isn't just a struggle about what occurs in Ukraine.

The Greens, for example, have the highest proportion of PhDs \\namong those who represent us at Parliament House.\\nThe Coalition, on the other hand, has the highest proportion of members who went to a private school. But unlike \\nthe privately schooled population, who are more likely to go to university than those who go to government schools, \\nonly a small proportion of Coalition members went on to gain a degree.\\nLink to Image\\nTheAustralian Financial Review has analysed the educational backgrounds of all 226 federal politicians in \\nAustralia, which encompasses the 151 MPs and 75 senators currently in office. Are they representative of the \\nbroader population? This is what we found.\\nHow many of our politicians attended university?\\nOur politicians are overall a highly educated cohort - 77 per cent have a bachelor\\'s degree or higher.\\nThis figure is significantly greater than the national average, with Australian Bureau of Statistics data showing just \\n32 per cent of all Australians have graduated from university.\\nSo why is there a remarkably high percentage of university graduates in parliament?\\nIs it because people with an interest in politics or policy are more likely to go to university or is it that they get \\npoliticised while there? John Howard, when prime minister, certainly thought it was the latter, when in 2005 he \\nbanned students from automatically becoming members of the student unions because he saw it as a breeding \\nground for hot-headed lefties and socialists.\\nJohn Hawkins, a political historian from the University of Canberra, says the opposite is most likely the case.\\n\"I suspect it\\'s the other way around; that people who are interested in political ideas and policy are more likely to \\nwant to go to university,\" Hawkins says.\\nPage 2 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians, in six charts\\nOur analysis reveals that 83.5 per cent of Labor politicians have at least one degree compared to 68.6 per cent of \\nCoalition members.\\nPaul Strangio, emeritus professor of politics at Monash University, said the prevalence of politicians with degrees in \\nhistory, politics, sociology and law makes sense.\\n\"There\\'s a certain synchronicity. These degrees teach people analytical skills, as well as strong written and verbal \\ncommunication skills. Arguably, there\\'s a good match-up with the role of a politician,\" he says.\\nCertainly, universities are where many politicians get their first taste of politics and activism.\\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese is one such example. He was prominent in campus politics during his time at the \\nUniversity of Sydney, which culminated in his presidency of NSW Young Labor and later as a rising political staffer.\\nSimon Birmingham, leader of the opposition in the Senate, was president of the Adelaide University Liberal Club in \\n1993, and was a key member of Young Liberals in South Australia for most of the 1990s. He later became an \\nelectorate officer for Senator Robert Hill.\\nIt goes to show that the path from student politics to staffer to MP is well-trodden.\\nThere are countless politicians who cut their teeth in student politics. Opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was chair of \\nthe Bayside Young Liberals in 1990. As a student, Tony Burke, minister for industrial relations, was the president of \\nAustralian Young Labor. Foreign affairs minister Penny Wong was heavily involved in the Labor Club at Adelaide \\nUniversity and served on the national executive of the National Union of Students.\\nAnd that\\'s just for starters.\\nWhich universities produce the most politicians?\\nThe institution that has produced the most of our federal politicians is the University of Sydney, closely followed by \\nthe universities of Melbourne and Queensland.\\nUniversities in the Group of Eight (Go8) dominate the ranking, taking up eight out of 10 spots on the list.\\nJohn Hawkins makes the simple point: \"These are the main universities in the states with the biggest populations.\"\\nBut he adds they are also the institutions most likely to offer degrees in law, economics, history and philosophy, and \\nalso the most likely to offer double-degrees, which are a popular choice among the political classes.\\nFor some, however, the prevalence of degrees from Group of Eight universities is emblematic of entrenched elitism \\nand social division in the broader population.\\nGlenn Savage, associate professor of education policy at the University of Melbourne, has compared Australia\\'s \\n\"highly inequitable\" education system to an \"ecosystem\" with flow-on effects that influence an individual\\'s tertiary \\nstudy and, ultimately, employment.\\n\"It\\'s natural that young people who have more advantageous circumstances will end up in more advantageous \\npositions,\" he says.\\nWhat are our politicians most likely to study?\\nAlthough parliament largely consists of highly educated politicians, it\\'s a bit more monochrome when it comes to \\nwhat they studied - mostly arts and humanities.\\nAbout 40 per cent of federal politicians studied arts at university, which was by a long shot the most popular degree. \\nA double arts-law degree was also common, with 27 politicians, or 12 per cent, graduating with that particular \\ncombination.Page 3 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians, in six charts\\nClare O\\'Neil, Brendan O\\'Connor. Bill Shorten, Michelle Rowland, Julian Leeser, Anika Wells, Zoe McKenzie, Angus \\nTaylor, Adam Bandt and Andrew Gee are just a few of the current crop of politicians with double degrees.\\nThere is a range of majors under the broader umbrella of arts.\\nSenator Katy Gallagher studied in political science and sociology. Labor frontbencher Anne Aly majored in English \\nliterature, with a minor in acting. Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather and transport minister Catherine King studied \\nhistory and social work respectively.\\nOnly 20 politicians (or 9 per cent of parliament) are qualified in science or engineering. Seven studied medicine, \\nincluding independents Monique Ryan and Sophie Scamps. One - Emma McBride - did pharmacy. Greens MP \\nElizabeth Watson-Brown is an architect.\\nSavage says arts degrees, in particular law, politics, and other humanities, \"lend themselves very well to producing \\nthe kinds of knowledge and skill sets which would prove useful for a politician\".\\n\"These degrees would also expose students to theories into social dynamics that are of direct relevance to the \\npolitical and policy process,\" he says.\\nStrangio says that the lack of politicians with expertise and backgrounds in STEM \"may be a disadvantage for some \\nworkings of parliament in terms of committee work, where politicians really need to get into the nitty-gritty of policy\".\\n\"However, fundamentally, it\\'s a highly educated cohort. They probably have the skill sets in terms of research \\ncapacities and written communication skills,\" he says.\\nGavin Moodie, adjunct professor at the University of Toronto\\'s Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, says public \\npolicy would be better served if it was \"more informed by technology, science and engineering, because our current \\nand future challenges will be scientific and technological: climate change, health, and technological change.\"\\nAnd only five politicians have studied education. This includes Sue Lines, president of the Senate, as well as Labor \\nMP Ged Kearney.\\nWho are our most educated politicians?\\nProportionally, the Greens are the most formally educated party overall, with three out of 15 party members - 20 per \\ncent - holding PhDs.\\nAdam Bandt completed his PhD in political science at Monash while working part-time at law firm Slater & Gordon. \\nHis thesis was \"Work to Rule: Rethinking Pashukanis, Marx and Law.\"\\nThere are seven Labor politicians with PhDs - or 6.8 per cent of the party. Treasurer Jim Chalmers wrote his thesis \\non former prime minister Paul Keating, titled \"Brawler statesman: Paul Keating and prime ministerial leadership in \\nAustralia.\"\\nOthers Labor PhD holders include Anne Aly, Andrew Charlton, Andrew Leigh and Daniel Mulino.\\nIndependent Helen Haines and Nationals MP Anne Webster also hold PhDs.\\nIn total, the percentage of federal politicians with a PhD is 5.4 per cent - much higher than the 0.7 per cent of the \\nAustralian population (185,000 people) with PhDs.\\nStrangio says that having highly educated politicians is a good thing.\\n\"Legislation is complex. The issues they are dealing with are complex, and higher education can be an advantage.\"\\nWho are our least educated politicians?Page 4 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians, in six charts\\nIt turns out that higher education is not the only way to become a politician, with a sizeable chunk of politicians \\nchoosing an alternate pathway to Parliament House.\\nAlmost one in four politicians (23 per cent) did not graduate from university, while 3 per cent never finished high \\nschool.\\nThe least formally educated politicians come from the Coalition, with some entering the workforce as teenagers. \\nThis is despite the majority of them attending private schools.\\nWarren Entsch, left school at age 14, following his father into the Queensland railway department as a junior porter. \\nEntsch was originally tasked with being the chief toilet cleaner of the Mareeba railway station.\\nWest Australian senator Dorinda Cox joined the WA police force as a cadet at age 17. She was an Aboriginal police \\nliaison officer working on the frontlines, specialising in family violence and sexual assault.\\nDavid Pocock became a professional footballer at age 17, Rob Mitchell left after year 10 to do a shoe-making \\napprenticeship, and Luke Howarth has a certificate III in pest management and a diploma in business.\\nDr Sally Patfield, a lecturer at the University of Newcastle\\'s School of Education, says having a range of educational \\nbackgrounds in parliament is beneficial.\\n\"Politicians bring a diverse range of perspectives and opinions both in terms of their own background, and the \\npeople they represent in Australia. It\\'s important to have these experiences being represented, as it is more \\nreflective of the Australian population,\" she says.\\nHawkins, however, says it is reassuring to have a political cohort who is more educated than the general \\npopulation. \"You would want them to be smarter than the general public. Ideally, you\\'d want them to be more \\nhonest and trustworthy as well,\" Hawkins says.\\nWhere did our politicians go to school?\\nAlmost three in five politicians (57 per cent) were educated at private schools. In comparison, ABS data shows that \\n36 per cent of all students across Australia are enrolled in independent or private schools.\\nJust one politician - Greens senator Jordon Steele-John - was homeschooled.\\nAre there any conclusions to be drawn from this? Hawkins says it shows how old-fashioned notions of the make-up \\nof political parties no longer hold true.\\n\"Labor has traditionally been seen as the party of blue-collar workers, while the Liberals were seen as posh private \\nschool kids.

The Greens, for example, have the highest proportion of PhDs \\namong those who represent us at Parliament House.\\nThe Coalition, on the other hand, has the highest proportion of members who went to a private school. But unlike \\nthe privately schooled population, who are more likely to go to university than those who go to government schools, \\nonly a small proportion of Coalition members went on to gain a degree.\\nThe Australian Financial Review has analysed the educational backgrounds of all 226 federal politicians, which \\nencompasses the 151 MPs and 75 senators currently in office. Are they representative of the broader population? \\nThis is what we found.\\nHow many of our politicians\\nattended university?Our politicians are overall a highly educated cohort - 77 per cent have a bachelor\\'s degree or \\nhigher.\\nThis figure is significantly greater than the national average, with Australian Bureau of Statistics data showing just \\n32 per cent of all Australians have graduated from university.\\nSo why is there a remarkably high percentage of university graduates in parliament?\\nIs it because people with an interest in politics or policy are more likely to go to university or is it that they get \\npoliticised while there? John Howard, when prime minister, certainly thought it was the latter, when in 2005 he \\nbanned students from automatically becoming members of the student unions because he saw it as a breeding \\nground for hot-headed lefties and socialists.\\nJohn Hawkins, a political historian from the University of Canberra, says the opposite is most likely the case.\\nPage 2 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians\\n\"I suspect it\\'s the other way around; that people who are interested in political ideas and policy are more likely to \\nwant to go to university,\" Hawkins says.\\nOur analysis reveals that 83.5 per cent of Labor politicians have at least one degree compared with 68.6 per cent of \\nCoalition members.\\nPaul Strangio, emeritus professor of politics at Monash University, says the prevalence of politicians with degrees in \\nhistory, politics, sociology and law makes sense.\\n\"There\\'s a certain synchronicity. These degrees teach people analytical skills, as well as strong written and verbal \\ncommunication skills. Arguably, there\\'s a good match-up with the role of a politician,\" he says.\\nCertainly, universities are where many politicians get their first taste of politics and activism.\\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese is one such example. He was prominent in campus politics during his time at the \\nUniversity of Sydney, which culminated in his presidency of NSW Young Labor and later as a rising political staffer.\\nSimon Birmingham, leader of the opposition in the Senate, was president of the Adelaide University Liberal Club in \\n1993, and part of Young Liberals in South Australia for most of the 1990s. He later became an electorate officer for \\nSenator Robert Hill.\\nIt goes to show that the path from student politics to staffer to MP is well-trodden.\\nThere are countless politicians who cut their teeth in student politics. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton was chairman \\nof the Bayside Young Liberals in 1990. As a student, Tony Burke, minister for industrial relations, was the president \\nof Australian Young Labor. Foreign affairs minister Penny Wong was heavily involved in the Labor Club at Adelaide \\nUniversity and served on the national executive of the National Union of Students.\\nAnd that\\'s just for starters.\\nWhich universities produce\\nthe most politicians?The institution that has produced the most of our federal politicians is the University of Sydney, \\nclosely followed by the universities of Melbourne and Queensland.\\nUniversities in the Group of Eight (Go8) dominate the ranking, taking up eight out of 10 spots on the list.\\nJohn Hawkins makes the simple point: \"These are the main universities in the states with the biggest populations.\"\\nBut he adds that they are also the institutions most likely to offer degrees in law, economics, history and philosophy, \\nand also the most likely to offer double-degrees, which are a popular choice among the political classes.\\nFor some, however, the prevalence of degrees from Group of Eight universities is emblematic of entrenched elitism \\nand social division in the broader population.\\nGlenn Savage, associate professor of education policy at the University of Melbourne, has compared Australia\\'s \\n\"highly inequitable\" education system to an \"ecosystem\" with flow-on effects that influence an individual\\'s tertiary \\nstudy and, ultimately, employment.\\n\"It\\'s natural that young people who have more advantageous circumstances will end up in more advantageous \\npositions,\" he says.\\nWhat are our politicians\\nmost likely to study?Although parliament largely consists of highly educated politicians, it\\'s a bit more monochrome \\nwhen it comes to what they studied - mostly arts and humanities.Page 3 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians\\nAbout 40 per cent of federal politicians studied arts at university, which was by a long shot the most popular degree. \\nA double arts-law degree was also common, with 27 politicians, or 12 per cent, graduating with that particular \\ncombination.\\nClare O\\'Neil, Brendan O\\'Connor. Bill Shorten, Michelle Rowland, Julian Leeser, Anika Wells, Zoe McKenzie, Angus \\nTaylor, Adam Bandt and Andrew Gee are just a few of the current crop of politicians with double degrees.\\nThere is a range of majors under the broader umbrella of arts.\\nKaty Gallagher studied political science and sociology. Labor frontbencher Anne Aly majored in English literature, \\nwith a minor in acting. Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather and transport minister Catherine King studied history and \\nsocial work, respectively.\\nOnly 20 politicians (or 9 per cent of parliament) are qualified in science or engineering. Seven studied medicine, \\nincluding independents Monique Ryan and Sophie Scamps. One - Emma McBride - did pharmacy. Greens MP \\nElizabeth Watson-Brown is an architect.\\nSavage says arts degrees, in particular law, politics, and other humanities, \"lend themselves very well to producing \\nthe kinds of knowledge and skill sets which would prove useful for a politician\".\\n\"These degrees would also expose students to theories into social dynamics that are of direct relevance to the \\npolitical and policy process,\" he says.\\nStrangio says the lack of politicians with expertise and backgrounds in STEM \"may be a disadvantage for some \\nworkings of parliament in terms of committee work, where politicians really need to get into the nitty-gritty of policy\".\\n\"However, fundamentally, it\\'s a highly educated cohort. They probably have the skill sets in terms of research \\ncapacities and written communication skills,\" he says.\\nGavin Moodie, adjunct professor at the University of Toronto\\'s Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, says public \\npolicy would be better served if it was \"more informed by technology, science and engineering, because our current \\nand future challenges will be scientific and technological: climate change, health, and technological change\".\\nOnly five politicians have studied education. These include Sue Lines, president of the Senate, as well as Labor MP \\nGed Kearney.\\nWho are our most educated\\npoliticians?Proportionally, the Greens are the most formally educated party overall, with three out of 15 party \\nmembers - 20 per cent - holding PhDs.\\nAdam Bandt completed his PhD in political science at Monash while working part-time at law firm Slater & Gordon. \\nHis thesis was \"Work to Rule: Rethinking Pashukanis, Marx and Law\".\\nThere are seven Labor politicians with PhDs - or 6.8 per cent of the party. Treasurer Jim Chalmers wrote his thesis \\non former prime minister Paul Keating, titled \"Brawler statesman: Paul Keating and prime ministerial leadership in \\nAustralia\".\\nOthers Labor PhD holders include Anne Aly, Andrew Charlton, Andrew Leigh and Daniel Mulino.\\nIndependent Helen Haines and Nationals MP Anne Webster also hold PhDs.\\nIn total, the percentage of federal politicians with a PhD is 5.4 per cent - much higher than the 0.7 per cent of the \\nAustralian population (185,000 people) with PhDs.\\nStrangio says that having highly educated politicians is a good thing.Page 4 of 4\\nOur most and least educated politicians\\n\"Legislation is complex. The issues they are dealing with are complex, and higher education can be an advantage.\"\\nWho are our least educated\\npoliticians?It turns out that higher education is not the only way to become a politician - a sizeable chunk of \\npoliticians choose an alternate pathway to Parliament House. Almost one in four politicians (23 per cent) did not \\ngraduate from university, and 3 per cent never finished high school.\\nThe least formally educated politicians come from the Coalition, with some entering the workforce as teenagers. \\nThis is despite the majority of them attending private schools.\\nWarren Entsch, left school at age 14, following his father into the Queensland railway department as a junior porter. \\nEntsch was originally tasked with being the chief toilet cleaner of the Mareeba railway station.\\nWest Australian senator Dorinda Cox joined the WA police force as a cadet at age 17. She was an Aboriginal police \\nliaison officer working on the frontlines, specialising in family violence and sexual assault.\\nDavid Pocock became a professional footballer at age 17, Rob Mitchell left after year 10 to do a shoe-making \\napprenticeship, and Luke Howarth has a certificate III in pest management and a diploma in business.\\nDr Sally Patfield, a lecturer at the University of Newcastle\\'s School of Education, says having a range of educational \\nbackgrounds in parliament is beneficial.\\n\"Politicians bring a diverse range of perspectives and opinions both in terms of their own background, and the \\npeople they represent in Australia. It\\'s important to have these experiences being represented, as it is more \\nreflective of the Australian population,\" she says.\\nHawkins, however, says it is reassuring to have a political cohort that is more educated than the general population. \\n\"You would want them to be smarter than the general public. Ideally, you\\'d want them to be more honest and \\ntrustworthy as well,\" Hawkins says.\\nWhere did our politicians\\ngo to school?Almost three in five politicians (57 per cent) were educated at private schools. In comparison, ABS \\ndata shows that 36 per cent of all students across Australia are enrolled in independent or private schools.\\nJust one politician - Greens senator Jordon Steele-John - was homeschooled.\\nAre there any conclusions to be drawn from this? Howarth says it shows how old-fashioned notions of the make-up \\nof political parties no longer hold true. \"Labor has traditionally been seen as the party of blue-collar workers, while \\nthe Liberals were seen as posh private school kids.

week when we get paid,\" she said.\\n\"It\\'s an absolute slap in the face, they make no effort to address educator shortages unless they address wages.\\n\"Everything they do is completely tokenistic and as a workforce we know that.\"\\nThe budget committed an extra $9 billion to the sector, bringing the total spend on childcare to $55.3 billion in the \\nnext four years.\\nIt also included $724 million across five years to support training for educators and the care sector with more than \\n80,000 early childhood educators expected to benefit.\\nAlong with educators, the budget focused on making childcare more accessible and affordable for families, with \\nabout 1.2 million to benefit from July.\\nSt Nicholas executive director David Healy said he welcomed the increased training measures but said more \\nneeded to be done to retain the workforce.\\n\"To be frank it\\'s a national-level issue and this is chicken feed being thrown at it, it looks attractive but realistically \\nit\\'s going to take years for those shortages to resolve themselves,\" he said.\\nMr Healy said their centres operate up to 50 weeks a year and the concern is that the sector is losing skilled, \\nqualified workers to teaching which offers longer breaks, shorter hours and better pay.\\nHe said he can\\'t run his centres at full capacity because of staffing shortages, and said that although it was great to \\nsee subsidies for parents to assist them with childcare the issue is having enough staff to offer them a place.\\n\"It\\'s hard to say what\\'s not attracting people to the sector,

Limited All Rights Reserved\\nLength: 732 words\\nHighlight: Childcare workers will be able to use strike action as a bargaining chip in multi-employer deals under \\nLabor\\'s employment bill designed to drive up wages.\\nBody\\nEarly Childhood Education Minister Dr Anne Aly said a new ability for childcare workers to use strike action as a \\nbargaining chip in multi-employer deals is crucial leverage in the fight for better pay.\\nThe controversial wages bill Workplace Relations Minister Tony Burke wants to ram through the lower house this \\nweek gives workers in low-paid, female-dominated jobs such as early learning and aged care the right to launch \\nindustrial action across several employers to help secure higher incomes.\\nLink to Image\\nAlex Ellinghausen\\nAcademics and union leaders hosed down the prospect of multi-employer bargaining leading to widespread strikes \\nduring a parliamentary inquiry into the government\\'s Secure Jobs, Better Pay bill last week following outcry from \\nbusiness leaders over the economic impact of the reforms.\\nAfter a roundtable with the Independent Education Union in Sydney on Friday, Aly told this masthead the new right \\nfor childcare workers to undertake industrial action in multi-employer bargaining was \"incredibly crucial\".\\n\"It just makes it a lot more effective,\" Aly said, highlighting how workers would be able to bargain across employers \\ngrouped by location or the nature of the enterprise. \"It\\'s going to provide a much more effective bargaining system \\nfor the early education and childcare sector.\"\\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese and Burke have singled out childcare and aged care as among the most \\nimportant beneficiaries of the reforms.\\nBusiness leaders argue the sweeping workplace law changes will empower unions to trigger industry-wide strikes \\nand rope employers into pay deals without their consent.\\nAustralian Industry Group head Innes Willox said: \"If this right to strike proposal gets up across the childcare sector, \\nits proponents can explain to parents why their children won\\'t get care due to widespread industrial action, and why \\nworkers don\\'t get paid as they are forced not to work.\"\\nPage 2 of 2\\nPower to go on strike will be \\'crucial\\' for childcare workers: minister\\n\"If the government wants childcare, aged care and disability sectors to be paid substantially more, they simply will \\nhave to pay for it, since these are sectors principally supported by government funding,\" he said.\\nEarly Childhood Australia chief executive Samantha Page said the \"masculine, adversarial\" notion around striking \\ndidn\\'t necessarily translate to a female-dominated sector where staff developed close, working relationships with \\nchildren and families.\\n\"Walking off a building site is one thing, but walking out of an aged-care or early learning centre is a different thing,\" \\nPage said.\\nUnder the bill, the Fair Work Commission will be able to force the government to take part in multi-employer wage \\ndeal negotiations for sectors it heavily funds, including aged care and childcare.\\nEarly educators want their pay to match similar roles in primary schools, which would mean a 30 per cent increase \\nin most categories. Asked whether the government was willing to be party to those wage deals, Aly said it was a \\nmatter for the industrial umpire.\\nThe government is also being pressed to urgently fund an interim, 10 per cent pay rise to stop workers leaving the \\nsector - which is suffering more than 7000 vacancies a month - ahead of its cheaper childcare reforms that will add \\nto staffing pressures by increasing demand.\\nAly said retention issues couldn\\'t be fixed with Band-Aid or short-term solutions but there were \"low-hanging fruit\" \\nstop-gaps, such as skilled migration, that could address the shortfall immediately.\\n\"We\\'re working with the sector to look at what we can do in the short-, medium- and long-term,\" she said. \"It\\'s \\nsomething this government has put as a priority.\"\\nIn welcoming the Fair Work decision to award aged-care workers an interim 15 per cent pay rise on Saturday, \\nAlbanese said wages had been held back in feminised industries because of the lack of bargaining power.\\n\"It\\'s an important decision, it\\'s just a couple more stages to go, but it\\'s a sign that the Fair Work Commission \\nunderstands how important it is,\" he said.\\nThe government has promised to fund the wage rise for aged-care workers. Asked how much it would cost during a \\npress conference, the Prime Minister replied there were further stages to the Fair Work process.\\n\"I can say that we allowed for a contingency in the budget that was handed down on Tuesday night two weeks ago \\nbecause we anticipated a wage increase coming through,\" he said, adding the government didn\\'t declare the \\namount.\\nGraphic\\n \\nMinister for Early Childhood Education Dr Anne Aly empowering childcare workers to strike is crucial.\\nLoad-Date: November 6, 2022\\nEnd of Document']}, {'name': 'Michelle Rowland', 'type': 'person', 'description': \"Communications Minister who supports the government's efforts to address misinformation and disinformation.\", 'article_refs': [{'title': 'Unknown', 'date': 'Unknown', 'media_outlet': 'Unknown'}], 'contents': [\"Page 1 of 2\\nFederal Government's online safety crackdown\\nFederal Government's online safety crackdown\\nThe World Today (ABC transcript)\\nSeptember 12, 2024 Thursday\\nCopyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved\\nLength: 585 words\\nHighlight: Tech companies are in the federal government's sights, with new laws being introduced to crack down \\non misinformation and disinformation online.\\nBody\\nRachel Mealey: Tech companies are in the Federal Government's sights, with new laws being introduced to crack \\ndown on misinformation and disinformation online.

home.\"\\n\\'Huge\\' barriers to accessing childcare\\nEveryone has a legal right to access childcare under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.\\nIn reality, very few facilities have the staff or equipment to cater for high-needs children and they don\\'t have to make \\nchanges that would cause \"unjustifiable hardship\".\\nMonique Power started her company Ripple Ability to help parents navigate the National Disability Insurance \\nScheme (NDIS) after her own experience advocating for her daughter left her frustrated.\\nShe and her colleagues realised the extent of the problem when a funeral for one of their young clients was \\nattended by many children, all of whom couldn\\'t be put in childcare.\\nTheir research has since exposed the barriers to accessing childcare for kids with disabilities.\\n\"We know that childcare centres are discriminating against [these] children,\" Ms Power said.\\nRipple Ability has rung dozens of childcare centres in Western Australia trying to find care for clients.\\n\"We were met with a resounding no … the ones that we didn\\'t get an explicit no from said we\\'ll call you back \\n[and] we never heard from them again,\" she said.\\nNeed for purpose-built centres\\nMs Power believes the answer is a new model, involving purpose-built centres with flexible hours, equipment and \\nmedically trained staff and therapists.\\n\"Parents would know [their child] is in a safe space and could walk away feeling confident about that,\" she said.\\n\"Kids with complex needs don\\'t miraculously become better.\\n\"But they would have an opportunity to make friends and build social networks with people that look like them and \\nhave lives like theirs, which makes a huge difference on mental health in the long run.\"\\nMs Power believes having access to such a centre would also be life-changing for parents.\\n\"It will provide people with the opportunity to pursue higher education [or] hold down a meaningful career,\" she said.\\n\"But in addition to that, a centre like this would provide women with the opportunity to go to a gynaecology \\nappointment alone or go out for coffee with a friend that they haven\\'t seen for three years.\"\\nThere are significant barriers to opening such a centre, however, including the current childcare subsidy offered to \\nparents.\\n\"We could open a model like this tomorrow but there\\'s no way that [families] can afford it and that\\'s the biggest \\nproblem,\" Ms Power said.\\n\"We need a new subsidy through Services Australia that has these children in mind to cater for the skills necessary \\nto provide that level of care.Page 3 of 4\\nCalls for purpose-built childcare centres for children with a disability amid \\'discrimination\\'\\n\"You\\'re going to have to pay a paediatric nurse $75 an hour … so the subsidy needs to offer these families the sort \\nof rebate that every other family enjoys under the current childcare legislation.\"\\n\\'Game-changing\\' childcare centre on the cards\\nDespite the barriers, some childcare centres are still working hard to be inclusive.\\nLake Joondalup Early Learning Program has been running for 12 years and welcomes children of all abilities and \\nneeds.\\nCo-founders Debra Gibson and Jodie Jones are hoping to build a second facility on the same site that caters to \\nchildren with more complex clinical needs.\\n\"I think it\\'s going to be huge — a game changer,\" Ms Jones said.\\n\"All those children that have fallen through the gaps through the years — to finally have something they can access \\nis actually really exciting.\"\\nLike Ripple Ability, they\\'ve identified inadequate childcare subsidies as a barrier to the plan.\\n\"Right now we fund extra support so these children can receive one-to-one care but that\\'s coming at a cost to our \\nservice,\" Ms Gibson said.\\n\"One of our concerns is that we\\'re going to be dipping into the current service here to actually fund the new service \\nout the back — obviously that\\'s not viable for the long term.\"\\nThe centre is in talks with the Federal Minister for Early Childhood Education Anne Aly to become a pilot facility for \\na new childcare subsidy model.\\n\"We\\'re not sure what it will look like because we\\'re waiting to hear back but we\\'re pretty excited about it,\" Ms Jones \\nsaid.\\nBarriers under review\\nAside from the issue of subsidies, advocates also spent years campaigning for legislative change.\\nChildcare providers aren\\'t currently covered under the Disability Standards for Education Act 2005.\\nThree government reviews have flagged this as a problem, with the most recent in 2020 recommending that draft \\namendments be prepared to extend the law to childcare centres.\\nThe Federal Minister for Early Childhood Education Anne Aly said that work is happening.\\nThere are also two separate inquires underway into early childhood education and care.\\nThe Productivity Commission is due to release its draft report in November, while the ACCC will hand down its final \\nreport on supply of childcare services in December.\\n\"I don\\'t want to pre-empt anything that comes out of the Productivity Commission review or the ACCC review, but I \\nknow a lot of the consultation that\\'s gone out has had … input from parents of children with disability … and the \\nthings that they have said will be taken into account,\" Ms Aly said.\\n\"I see a huge opportunity here for us to really come together as a government across those different portfolios, as \\nwe have done with the Early Years Strategy.\"\\nAdvocates sceptical reviews will lead to changePage 4 of 4\\nCalls for purpose-built childcare centres for children with a disability amid \\'discrimination\\'\\nMonique Power will launch a petition this week calling for better access to childcare.\\n\"I am an optimist … but I am incredibly pessimistic that [any] changes will [reflect] the cohort of kids that we\\'re \\ndealing with,\" she said.\\n\"Am I optimistic that the government is going to address the most critical and vulnerable [kids] in our society with \\nthese reforms?\\n\"I\\'m not confident at all.\"\\nRipple Ability has made submissions to the inquires but is struggling to get meetings with relevant ministers, \\nincluding Ms Aly.\\n\"We want an audience with them to have a conversation about the extensive body of work that we have done and \\nthe solutions that we have put together … to start the ball rolling towards some meaningful change,\" Ms

Aly, the early childhood \\neducation minister, suggested Israel could be investigated over whether it had committed war crimes.\\nThe comments from the first two Muslim ministers in an Australian federal government  go further than the foreign \\nminister, Penny Wong, who has urged all sides to show “restraint” in protecting civilian life.\\nThis week Labor senator Fatima Payman and MP Julian Hill also spoke out by condemning the killing of innocent \\ncivilians in Israel and Palestine.\\nThe opposition has sought to weaponise Labor’s position, arguing it is unfair to urge restraint on Israel, given its \\ncitizens were the victims of the Hamas attacks.\\nHusic, the industry and science minister, noted that about 3,000 Palestinians were dead , including approximately \\n1,000 children, according to the Gaza health ministry.\\n“You’ve got homes, schools, medical centres destroyed,” he told ABC radio on Thursday.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nAustralian ministers say Palestinians are being ‘collectively punished’ for Hamas barbarism\\n“That’s before we even contemplate how they’ll get rebuilt. No food, fuel, medicines, water. I feel very strongly that \\nPalestinians are being collectively punished here for Hamas’s barbarism.”\\nHusic said there was “an obligation on governments, particularly the Israeli government to … follow the rules of \\ninternational law and to observe in particular, that innocents should be protected”.\\n“I am very mindful of the words of our prime minister in saying that protecting innocent lives is not a sign of \\nweakness.\\n“It is a sign of strength. That is a really important thing that needs to be considered. I genuinely believe there needs \\nto be a de-escalation. I don’t think it’s in Israel’s interest long term to engage in the occupation of Gaza.”\\nAly said it was “entirely appropriate” that parliament had passed a motion  condemning the Hamas attacks.\\n“But with the escalation of violence, and that was something that I feared from the very beginning – that the \\nescalation of violence would mean there would be more Palestinian lives lost and that has come to pass, and it will \\ncontinue,” she said.\\nAly urged Israel to abide by the rules of law developed by the international community to protect the human rights of \\ncivilians during conflict.\\nAsked if Israel had committed war crimes, Aly replied that: “That is something that possibly could be investigated. I \\nthink that anyone, any state or any group that commits war crimes, should be investigated and should be held \\naccountable.”\\nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has recognised Israel’s right to defend itself but also urged the Netanyahu \\ngovernment to “ operate by the rules of war  ” amid increasing expectations of an imminent ground operation in \\nGaza.\\nOn Monday, Hill told parliament that Israel’s right to defend itself did not extend to the “indiscriminate mass killing of \\ninnocent Palestinians”.\\nHill said he had heard an “overwhelming message” from his community “that the mass punishment of 2 million \\npeople in Gaza is not a proportionate response and this is a trap that Israel must not fall into – it is what Hamas is \\ntrying to provoke”.\\nPayman told the Senate that Australia “must condemn” civilian deaths as “Israeli missiles strike residential \\ndwellings, civilians, multi-story apartments, health facilities as well as places of worship, indiscriminately killing men, \\nwomen and children”.\\n“The price tag of Israel’s right to defend itself cannot be the destruction of Palestine. Israel’s right to defend its \\ncivilians cannot equate to the annihilation of Palestinian civilians.”\\nOn Thursday, the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, said she was “not going to get into” who was responsible  for \\nthe Al-Ahli Arab hospital strike because it was an “unfolding” situation.\\n“What we do know about this is that hundreds of innocent people, who were at a hospital evidently already \\nincredibly unwell and vulnerable, have lost their lives,” she said.\\n“his was set off by these violent and inhumane, barbaric attacks by Hamas.”\\n“What we now see is loss of innocent lives, of men, women and children in Gaza, and I want Australians to know \\nthat, for any innocent loss of life, we stand with Australian communities who experience this pain very deeply, \\nwhether they are Jewish Australians who are mourning the loss of life in the Middle East, or whether they are \\nPalestinian or Muslim Australians who are mourning the loss there.”Page 3 of 3\\nAustralian ministers say Palestinians are being ‘collectively punished’ for Hamas barbarism\\nLoad-Date: October 19, 2023\\nEnd of Document', 'Page 1 of 3\\nPalestinians in Gaza are being collectively punished, two Labor ministers say\\nPalestinians in Gaza are being collectively punished, two Labor ministers \\nsay\\nThe Sydney Morning Herald (Australia) - Online\\nOctober 19, 2023 Thursday 1:10 AM UTC\\nCopyright 2023 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Labor has stood by Israel \\nsince Hamas launched its assault on Israeli civilians on October 7 and Israel retaliated, leading to a conflict that has \\nkilled more than 1300 Israelis and 3000 Palestinians.\\nHusic, a senior cabinet minister and the first Muslim elected to parliament, made a passionate plea for Australia to \\nstep up support for Palestinians as they faced what he described as a \"humanitarian catastrophe\" with 1000 \\nchildren dead, civilian infrastructure destroyed and a blockade on food, fuel, medicine and water.\\n\"I feel very strongly that Palestinians are being collectively punished here for Hamas\\' barbarism,\" he said in an \\ninterview on ABC Radio National.\\n\"I think it\\'s really important ... that we contribute to international voices speaking up for Palestinians ... to say that \\nthere has got to be a more strategic and precise way to hold Hamas to account but not affect innocent Palestinian \\nfamilies.\"\\nHe also sought to explain strong reactions from advocates in Australia, who have rallied on behalf of Palestinians. \\n\"Let me put it in a way that might be difficult for some to hear,\" Husic said.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nPalestinians in Gaza are being collectively punished, two Labor ministers say\\n\"Israel has described what happened on October 7 [as] Israel\\'s equivalent of 9/11. The number of Palestinians that \\nhave been killed so far equates to the number of people who lost their lives in 9/11.

I feel the pain of Australian Muslims, and I know \\nthat Palestinians have for a long time felt that they have not been seen and have not been heard, that they have \\nbeen forgotten by the international community, and I want to acknowledge that to them.\"\\nParliament has been divided this week over its response to the unfolding war. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has \\nurged the protection of civilian lives while asserting Israel\\'s right to self-defence, while Opposition Leader Peter \\nDutton said Israel should show no restraint in retaliating to Hamas\\' attacks.\\nThe Greens this week voted in parliament to condemn Israel of war crimes in motions that were voted down in both \\nhouses.\\nYoutube link\\nLabor senator Fatima Payman, who was born in Afghanistan, spoke out in the Senate on Tuesday when she said \\nIsrael\\'s right to defend itself could not equate to the annihilation of Palestinian civilians.\\n\"Yet today, the world watches, the state of Israel deprives an entire population - men, women and children - of the \\nbasic necessities of life: food, water, electricity, gas and medicines. We must condemn it,\" she said.\\nAly on Thursday said it was \"hard to argue that this is not a form of collective punishment\".\\n\"The idea of war crimes is something that needs to be investigated,\" she said. \"I would be loath to claim war crimes \\nwithout a full investigation, that is how international law operates. But I would say and I would urge Israel to abide \\nby international laws on the rules of engagement.\"\\nHusic said there had been strong and dehumanising language used about Palestinians - referring to them as \\nanimals or collateral damage - which affected wider communities and could shape government decisions.\\nRegarding Israel\\'s actions, he said: \"Governments are different to terrorist organisations. [With] governments, there \\nis a higher expectation that there will be a protection of innocent lives.\"\\nHe also said he strongly felt there had been no practical commitment to a two-state solution, which is Labor policy.\\n\"Speaking completely frankly, I think there was an important point in time when we sort of started saying: \\'It\\'s \\nimportant that there is a two-state solution that we fight for that\\',\" he said.\\n\"What I\\'m genuinely concerned about now, is that this is spoken more as a way in which we can just comfort \\nourselves at these points. And then when the situation and the tension subside, nothing practically happens.\"\\nHome Affairs Minister Clare O\\'Neil said she was proud to sit with Husic in cabinet, when asked about his \\ncomments. However, she did not say the government should rethink how it talks about the conflict.\\n\"Israel does have a right to defend itself.

Princess Diana donned a red blazer and purple skirt when she sat alone outside the Taj Mahal in 1992 \\nas her marriage crumbled. Her daughter-in-law, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, recreated the look for one of her final \\nofficial duties as a working royal in 2019. And in 2022, clutching a pink Qur\\'an, Anne Aly wore a red Acler skirt and \\npurple blouse to Government House where she was sworn in as Australia\\'s first Muslim female minister.\\nAly\\'s appointment comes on the heels of a significant changing of the guard in Australian politics. For the first time \\nin our political history, there will be a record number of Carla Zampatti dresses, as opposed to the once prevalent \\nMJ Bale suits, in both houses of parliament. The federal election was a win, not just for the Greens and the teal \\nwave, but also for a new world order of sorts.\\nThere is a new guard looming. One that is all about difference, diversity and diverging from a place of \"that\\'s just the \\nway it is\" to a new chapter in Canberra that champions equality. Climate change was front of mind for many voters, \\nwho backed independents including Allegra Spender - daughter of the late Zampatti - in the seat of Wentworth and \\nKate Chaney in Curtin, to speak up for the environment. \\nThis is in keeping with what ANU climate scientist Joëlle Gergis so aptly sums up in her new book, Humanity\\'s \\nMoment: A Climate Scientist\\'s Case for Hope, on sale this month: \"What an extraordinary time to be alive; we are \\npart of the generation that will help heal the world.\" The age of societal sustainability is upon us.\\nThe 47th parliament will be one of the most representative we\\'ve had, thanks to a new government and a collection \\nof MPs who accurately represent modern Australia. A record number of women will take their seats in the House of \\nRepresentatives. Many are not aligned to the traditional parties and make up the super-sized crossbench. Women \\ncount for 51 per cent of the Australian population and now comprise 38 per cent of the chamber in the new \\nparliament - the highest ever proportion on record - after 58 women were elected to the lower house, including 19 \\ndebutante MPs. The Senate reached and exceeded 50 per cent gender parity in the last parliament, and maintains \\nthis in the new parliament.\\nPage 2 of 3\\nOur new government\\'s force for change\\nWe\\'ve come a long way since Edith Cowan, our first female politician, was elected to the Western Australian \\nparliament in 1921. Her colleagues were so opposed to her being there, she had to make several attempts at \\npresenting her first speech, because the men kept interjecting as she spoke of wanting equal access to education \\nfor young Australian women.\\nStill, in 2003, the then newly minted cabinet minister Julie Bishop was infamously told how to dress by her male \\npeers. \"When I was first appointed to the ministry, I was asked to be the Minister for Ageing. And one of the prime \\nminister\\'s senior advisors rang me and said \\'Julie, take this the right way, but forget the Armani suits and forget the \\ncorporate look. You\\'re the minister for the ageing, you\\'re going into aged- care homes, you\\'ve got to dress \\nappropriately,\" Bishop has shared. \"I said \\'What? You mean like cardigans?\\' And he said, \\'Yeah more prints, more \\ncolour. Just not corporate.\\'\"\\nNot too long after this sermon from a \"faceless man\", Bishop went on to become Minister for Foreign Affairs and a \\nthree-time deputy leader of the Liberal party. And she did it all in good shoes and some of the best of Australian \\nfashion, including Rachel Gilbert, Rebecca Vallance and Dion Lee, and coined the phrase \"fashion diplomacy\" by \\nexclusively wearing homegrown Australian labels when on official visits.\\nHer work, putting fashion on the agenda, also helped put the wheels in motion for the Australian Fashion Council to \\nsecure a federal grant to establish an Australian Fashion trademark in 2021. The world-first campaign hopes to \\npromote the industry and create more local jobs. \"The Australian Fashion trademark will be a driving force in \\nbuilding the industry\\'s growth trajectory to deliver substantial economic, social and environmental gains over the \\nnext 10 years,\" CEO of Australian Fashion Council Leila Naja Hibri said in a statement. \\n\"We can show the world how prioritising people and the planet together with profit can lead to a legacy of thriving \\nprosperity.\"\\nWe\\'ve also come a long way since the ministerial wing was trodden, pretty much exclusively, by men in R.M. \\nWilliams boots in the first part of this century. R.M. Williams was, during those days, owned by luxury conglomerate \\nLVMH. But in 2020 the brand was brought home when it was acquired by Perth billionaire Andrew \\'Twiggy\\' Forrest \\nand his wife Nicola. \\nSince Australia\\'s richest man has taken over the bootmaker, vegan materials have been introduced and demand is \\nskyrocketing. And Prime Minister Anthony Albanese seems keen to tread new paths. One that is more female-\\nfocused, family-friendly and awake to the Australia we want to become.\\nNow, almost 10 per cent of the Senate identifies as Indigenous after the record number of Aboriginal and Torres \\nStrait Islander representatives elected, including four new Indigenous MPs, three of whom are women. Indigenous \\nAffairs Minister Linda Burney was bestowed her new job on election night. Burney, a proud Wiradjuri woman, knows \\nthe power that culture, and more specifically fashion, can have in politics.

She is the petite dark-\\nhaired, dark-eyed woman in colourful clothing who sits behind Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during question \\ntime. Aly is an active listener. She nods. She laughs. She scowls and boos. She never drifts off or checks her \\nphone.\\nAlways impeccably well-dressed, Aly\\'s choice of clothing has taken a twist in the past couple of years as she took \\nup crochet and knitting as a form of meditation and mindfulness as she takes endless flights between Canberra and \\nPerth.\\nThe white jumper she wears to lunch is handcrafted (and has a matching skirt), as was the crochet long dress she \\nwore to this year\\'s Mid-Winter Ball. She is already working on next year\\'s dress, which will feature crocheted \\nflowers, each unique, representing every woman who died from domestic violence during the year.\\nAly has her own story of domestic violence, one that is told in her 2018 autobiography Finding My Place: From \\nCairo to Canberra - the Irresistible Story of an Irrepressible Woman.\\nShe had married young, at the age of 20, while living back in Egypt, where she was studying English literature, with \\na minor in acting. The marriage wasn\\'t arranged, as was common for girls like her. Rather, it was a way of escaping \\nthe strictures of being a single woman in a Muslim country.\\n\"The marriage gave me a freedom that I didn\\'t have living under my parents\\' roof. It gave me the freedom to be a \\nrespectable married woman in Egypt. It meant I could go camping with friends, I could go to parties, I could come \\nhome when I wanted to.\"\\nThere were red flags which she ignored - or didn\\'t know any better.\\nBut after moving to Perth, the violence and contemptuous behaviour escalated.\\n\"There was a bit of martyrdom on my behalf. But there are a lot of stereotypes around women who are survivors, a \\nlot of us are high achievers. The feelings of responsibility and humiliation; we expect more of ourselves,\" she says.\\n\"I remember driving away once and saying out loud to myself: \\'You must be just the kind of woman that men hit.\\' I\\'d \\nresigned myself to it.\\n\"I describe domestic violence as this crack in a bone somewhere in your body that you carry with you through your \\nlife.\\n\"It\\'s hard to imagine myself as the person I was. I\\'m much more like me now than I was back then.\"\\nShe finally kicked him out of the family home after six long years and began the next chapter as a broke single mum \\nof two young sons, Karim and Adam. They only found out about the history of abuse when they read the \\nautobiography.\\nKeeping hearth and home together with a string of unskilled jobs, she retreated to her safe space: education. In all, \\nshe has four degrees, including a masters in education and a PhD on counterterrorism and security.\\nWhich, to circle back, might help explain the inappropriate ADHD comment, having completed the two-year masters \\nin nine months and the PhD in two years - it typically take four to seven years.\\n\"I\\'d put the boys to bed, study until 3 or 4am, and then get up at 7am.\"\\nThat led to another chapter, as a world-renowned researcher and professor specialising in countering online violent \\nextremism. It also got her invited to Oxford University and the White House to speak.\\nHer political spark was ignited after the rise of anti-Muslim sentiment across the world, witnessing one-too-many \\ninstances of casual racism in suburban Perth, and becoming a target of death threats because of her profile as a \\nresearcher in anti-terrorism.Page 4 of 4\\n\\'I\\'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS\\' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN\\nThe university moved her team to unidentified offices twice during the course of a year with strict instruction not to \\nreveal the location.\\nI have set aside 90 minutes for lunch, but after an hour a staffer taps Aly on the shoulder and says we have five \\nminutes to wrap it up.\\nHeavens, we haven\\'t even got on to husband number two, or heaven forbid Dave Allen, who is husband number \\nthree.

There is a lot more to it,\" Aly said.\\n\"Obviously, any opportunity to deliver our commitments earlier than expected will be good.\\n\"So we\\'re just playing it by ear at the moment, working towards that and I don\\'t want to pre-empt any kind of \\nchanges to that.\"\\nPrevious overhauls of the subsidy system have required months of implementation time so the government and \\nchildcare centres and providers can upgrade their IT systems.\\nThe Parenthood executive director Georgie Dent said early learning was a huge cost pressure on families, \\nespecially when combined with high inflation and interest rate rises.\\n\"If it is feasible to bring it forwards, potentially to January, then that would absolutely be worthwhile,\" she said.\\nThe existing system subsidises between 85 per cent and 20 per cent of fees, depending on a family\\'s income.\\nThe highest subsidies go to families earning below about $70,000 a year. The rate steps down so families earning \\nbetween $175,000 and $254,300 receive a 50 per cent subsidy and then steps further so those earning between \\n$344,300 and $354,300 get a 20 per cent subsidy. Above this income threshold, there is no subsidy.\\nChanges that started in March increased the subsidy rate for second and subsequent children where families have \\nmore than one child under the age of 5 in care, by 30 percentage points, up to a maximum of 95 per cent.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nParents set to save hundreds on childcare fees - but not until next year\\nLabor\\'s proposal will lift the subsidy rate for all families, smooth out the taper rate so it doesn\\'t abruptly step down, \\nand gives subsidies to families earning up to $530,000. It will also keep the higher subsidies for younger siblings.\\nAly will task the Productivity Commission before year\\'s end with examining the entire sector, with an aim of a \\nuniversal subsidy of 90 per cent. She\\'ll also ask the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to design a \\nprice regulation mechanism to make sure higher subsidies don\\'t translate into higher fees.\\nWhile the Coalition attacked Labor\\'s plan for paying the fees of wealthy families, those at the top end of the income \\nscale get the lowest subsidies - about 7 per cent for a household income of $500,000.\\nAn analysis of the proposal by ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods associate professor Ben Phillips finds \\nthat while the largest benefits in dollar terms would go to parents in the top 20 per cent of incomes, that is because \\nthey get either no subsidy or a lower level under the existing scheme.\\nThose earning up to $86,000 will be an average $358 better off a year.\\nOut of the almost 1.2 million families using childcare each year, all but about 14,300 would be better off than they \\nare now.\\nDent said it was also important the government dealt with existing workforce shortages before adding extra demand \\nfor childcare.\\nShe\\'s been hearing from parents whose childcare centres are having to restrict the number of places on offer or \\neven close rooms because they can\\'t get enough staff.\\n\"The situation with the workforce is a crisis and it\\'s only increasing,\" she said.\\nAly says addressing the workforce shortage has to be a cross-portfolio effort. She doesn\\'t want to take anything off \\nthe table, including migration and improving pay and conditions.\\nBut she\\'s confident the transitional approach - with the sliding scale of subsidies first - will allow the sector to meet \\nthe increased demand.\\nCut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis from Jacqueline Maley. \\nSubscribers can sign up to our weekly Inside Politics newsletter here.\\nLoad-Date: June 12, 2022\\nEnd of Document', 'Page 1 of 5\\nAnne Aly reinvented herself many times.

Which \\nis just as well because so far, things aren\\'t going according to plan.\\nWe had arranged to meet at Zeytin Turkish Cuisine on the foreshore of Lake Burley Griffin. But when I show up at \\nnoon sharp, not a sign of life.\\nI\\'m busily texting Aly\\'s people when, luckily, we run into each other - Canberra is a small place - so we amble a few \\nmetres along until we come to a cafe on the corner that seems, well, convenient.\\nWe grab a table outside and Aly immediately launches into a monologue about how to make a lemon chicken \\ntagine, which involves soaking the tagine pot in a bath for 24 hours, rubbing it with oil and then cooking the Middle-\\nEastern deliciousness for another 24 hours in a very low oven.\\nWe are scanning the menu and Aly announces she \"doesn\\'t do rice\", which is a staple of Middle Eastern cuisine \\nand which makes her some sort of pariah at family events. She opts for the grilled fennel chicken (no butter please) \\nand a very hot almond milk cappuccino. I choose the zucchini fritters and a bean-a-colada, which disappointingly \\nhas neither beans nor booze.\\nAly, let it be said, is prone to the odd swear word, as am I, and over the next 60 minutes our conversation is \\npeppered with F-bombs.\\nPage 2 of 4\\n\\'I\\'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS\\' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN\\nThe thrice-married Aly had already lived a complex and somewhat haphazard life before she decided rather \\nspontaneously to run as the Labor candidate for the West Australian seat Cowan in 2016. She managed to turf out \\nthe Liberal incumbent Luke Simpkins by the finest of margins. \"It took 10 days to count the vote,\" she says.\\nIn 2019, she increased her margin and by 2022 she harnessed 46.9 per cent of the vote, adding more than 9 per \\ncent to her 2019 numbers.\\nOf that first campaign, she remembers standing at a train station with a picture of herself while waving at cars. A \\nyear ago to the day, she had been invited to speak at the White House at a counterterrorism conference. \"All I could \\nthink was from the White House to Greenwood station. What have I done?\"\\nAly was born Azza Mahmoud Fawzi Hosseini Ali el Serougi in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1967, the daughter of a nurse \\nand a textiles engineer who migrated to Australia in 1969. They were among the last migrants to be received at the \\nBonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre in Albury-Wodonga - which, having made the world\\'s headlines \\ntwo decades earlier over the death from malnutrition of 13 children, had improved conditions considerably.\\nThe family moved first to Marrickville in Sydney\\'s inner west and then, just on the cusp of shifting to Texas, they \\nrelocated to Brisbane, where Aly\\'s dad got a job at the Jennings factory, which made corsets and women\\'s \\nunderwear.\\nThey bought their first house in the very un-chi chi suburb of West End.\\n\"And then in 1974 came the flood. My parents came from a desert country, they had never seen anything like this,\" \\nAly says.\\n\"But it was a defining feature of our Australian story because what we found was a community. It was almost like \\nthey became Australian through the tragedy.\"\\nMoments like that, she says, stand in stark contrast to other moments of division and rancour that have \\ncharacterised the same-sex marriage plebiscite, the Voice referendum and the uncontained racism that followed the \\n9/11 attacks in New York.\\nThe current situation in Gaza is confronting, she says. Aly joined Ed Husic last month to warn Gaza\\'s 2.3 million \\nresidents were being \"collectively punished\" for the crimes of terrorists.\\nAs the Israel-Hamas war becomes more divisive, Aly says she is trying to demonstrate how \"important it is that we \\nrecognise each other\\'s humanity and show compassion to each other, even when we are hurting the most\".\\nAs the minister for early childhood education, and also the minister for youth, Aly has a lot on her plate as she \\nmarshals through two reviews of the childcare and early learning sectors.\\nThe government is moving, slowly, towards adopting a model of universal access. In July, it increased the \\nmaximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning up to $80,000, and a sliding scale in subsidies for families \\nearning less than $530,000.\\n\"The fact is Australia is one of the most expensive places for early childhood education and care,\" says Aly.\\n\"We have a quality system that is world-class, and a quality framework that has been in place for 10 years.

The federal government has announced a 15% wage increase to be \\nrolled out over 12 months from this December. Advocates say the bump in pay is also a major step forward for \\ngender equity, as Kathleen Ferguson reports.\\nAnthony Albanese: What do you think about my drawing, Ned? Do you think it's good?\\nKathleen Ferguson: The Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, has a crack at some of the crafts which help nurture \\nthe country's young.\\nAnthony Albanese: Hey, what do you reckon?\\nOpinion: That looks weird. Can I have a look? Can I have a look, Tom?\\nKathleen Ferguson: He visited the Sydney Early Childcare Centre after announcing a 15% pay increase for the \\nsector's workers.\\nAnthony Albanese: They deserve more than our thanks. They deserve decent wages and conditions.\\nKathleen Ferguson: Under the deal, workers will get 10% by this Christmas and a further 5% by December next \\nyear. It equates to around an extra $100 a week and will cost $3.6 billion. Karen Moran is a long-time educator.\\nKaren Moran: This decision today will change people's lives. It means that early childhood educators who've been \\nrelying on Food Bank to feed their own families won't have to do that anymore. And those that work two and three \\njobs just to make ends meet will be able to spend more time with their families.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nBig pay increase for early childcare workers\\nKathleen Ferguson: But the deal is conditional. In order to receive the pay bump, childcare centres will have to \\nlimit their fee increases to 4.4% during the next 12 months. The Minister for Early Childcare, Education and Youth, \\nDr Anne Aly, says the sector's role in society is critical.\\nDr Anne Aly: We know that brain development is... 90% of brain development occurs in those first five years. This \\nis not babysitting, this is not wiping bums and noses. This is education. We see you, we hear you, we acknowledge \\nyou. We know the vital and professional work that you do.\\nKathleen Ferguson: The early childcare sector says it's been a long and hard-fought battle. Georgie Dent is the \\nCEO of advocacy group The Parenthood.\\nGeorgie Dent: This is a long overdue recognition of the incredible contribution that early childhood educators make \\nto our children, to our communities, to families. It is such a fantastic achievement.\\nKathleen Ferguson: Georgie Dent says this pay increase is desperately needed to combat a worker shortage in \\nthe sector, which is mostly made up of women.\\nGeorgie Dent: The sector is overjoyed. This has been a long-realised dream. We have known that early childhood \\neducators have been chronically underpaid and undervalued. We have seen in recent years the accelerating exit of \\nearly educators from the sector, which has put incredible pressure on services.\\nKathleen Ferguson: This is an interim measure which will be in place for two years while the federal government \\nreviews the sector. The federal education minister, Jason Clare, says it will be up to childcare centres and providers \\nto sign on to the scheme. And he says if centres don't sign up, they should be prepared to lose staff to competitors.\\nJason Clare: This is a cost-of-living win-win. It's good for workers and it's good for parents. And at its heart, this is \\ngood for education, for the next generation, setting our kids up for success.\\nKathleen Ferguson: Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor supports higher wages but says bringing down inflation is \\nthe best way to increase pay.\\nAngus Taylor: Well, we want to see higher real wages, which means lower prices for everything, for all Australians, \\nPK. And we'll look at the detail of this proposal that Labor's putting forward. If it can raise real wages for Australians, \\nof course we're going to support it. That's our position.\\nKathleen Ferguson: The United Workers Union says the increase sends a strong message to women. Jo \\nSchofield is the union's national president.\\nJo Schofield: Just this week, we did a survey that showed 60% of educators wanted to leave within three years. \\n97% of centres have seen educators walk out in the last year, and the single factor in that is the low pay.\\nKathleen Ferguson: She says while the union will continue advocating for better pay and conditions, this is a good \\nstart.\\nStephanie Smail: Kathleen Ferguson reporting.\\nLoad-Date: August 8, 2024\\nEnd of Document\"]}, {'name': 'Ben Phillips', 'type': 'person', 'description': 'Associate professor at ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods who analyzed the childcare subsidy proposal.', 'article_refs': [{'title': 'Unknown', 'date': 'Unknown', 'media_outlet': 'Unknown'}], 'contents': ['Page 1 of 2\\nParents set to save hundreds on childcare fees - but not until next year\\nParents set to save hundreds on childcare fees - but not until next year\\nThe Age (Melbourne, Australia) - Online\\nJune 13, 2022 Monday 05:00 AM GMT\\nCopyright 2022 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

I'm Mary Doyle, I'm the Labor Candidate for \\nthe Aston by-election. It's really exciting to be here at Swinburne TAFE with the Prime Minister and Ministers \\nO'Connor and Aly. And thanks to everyone including the wonderful students for showing us around this morning. \\nTAFE is something I'm hugely passionate about, having been a TAFE student myself many years ago. And I can \\ntell you, when I talk to people about the Albanese Government's plans for fee-free TAFE in critical sectors, they \\noverwhelmingly tell me it's a great idea. This is a Government that I want to be a part of. One that looks at the \\npressures facing families in the outer-eastern suburbs and then goes about making a practical difference to address \\nthose challenges. Whether it's cheaper child care, which will benefit 5,700 families here in Aston. Whether it's \\ncheaper medicines, already saving Aston locals more than $250,000 since that came in. Whether it's fee-free TAFE \\nfor 55,000 Victorians. I want to be a part of the team that delivers for the outer-east. If I'm elected to be part of the \\nAlbanese Government as the next Member for Aston, I promise you this I will always fight for TAFE, I will always \\nfight for cheaper child care, and I will always fight for locals. And I'm thrilled to welcome the PM back to Wantirna.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Well, thanks very much, Mary. And I do want to thank the staff and the \\nstudents at Swinburne TAFE here for the very warm welcome that I've received here this morning, along with my \\nMinister for Skills and Training, Brendan O'Connor, and my Minister who looks after Early Childhood Learning, \\nAnne Aly. We're here to talk to students. We're here also to hear firsthand from them the difference that fee-free \\nTAFE is making to their lives. We, arising out of the Jobs and Skills Summit last year, and a commitment we made \\nat the election to 180,000 fee-free TAFE places are happening right now. And what we heard from this morning is \\nstudents who not only are benefiting from that fee-free TAFE, but they're also working and earning an income while \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nthat is happening. We've learned from them firsthand that this was part of the incentive for them to enter an area \\nwhich has skill shortages. So, it's good for students, but it's good for the economy as well. And it's good for this \\nregion, because we also heard that the early learning centres which they are partaking in now, in terms of their work \\nexperience, are all local. And Mary Doyle understands that. That's why I want Mary Doyle, next Saturday, to \\nbecome the Member for Aston. Because this community needs a voice in government. A Labor Government. A \\nLabor Government that cares about people in the outer suburbs. A Labor Government that's committed to making a \\ndifference with fee-free TAFE, to making a difference with the cheaper pharmaceuticals, but making a difference as \\nwell in child care costs for families. One of the things that is happening here from the students we spoke to, not only \\nare they benefiting from free-free TAFE, they're benefiting from working, because there are skills shortages, but \\nthey're also having the bonus of our cheaper child care plan, that comes in on July 1, will mean that more women in \\nparticular can join the workforce. This isn't a welfare policy. This is a productivity enhancing economic policy. This is \\nabout improving women's workforce participation, it's about boosting productivity and also about boosting the \\npopulation. The three Ps of economic growth are all ticked by this policy. Mary Doyle understands this. She hasn't \\nshopped around for a seat. Mary Doyle ran for this seat last year, and she's been committed to her community, \\nwhere she has lived for a long period of time, here in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. And that's why I want \\nsomeone who actually understands this community, who's committed to this community, and who will represent this \\ncommunity in the by-election on April 1. People do have an opportunity to send a message to the Opposition that \\nthey need to do better than have Peter Dutton as their Leader. Peter Dutton, who has spent year after year in \\ngovernment deriding Victorians, condemning the sacrifices that they were making during the pandemic, and \\nsomeone who said that people weren't safe to go out in Melbourne. Like, he just doesn't get this city and he doesn't \\nget this state of Victoria. Mary Doyle does. She'll be a fantastic representative, and I look forward to her joining our \\nteam after April 1 and having input into the Budget that we'll be putting together in May, which will take further \\npressure off working families in communities like this. I'll get Brendan to say something, Anne, and then we're \\nhappy to take questions.\\nBRENDAN O'CONNOR, MINISTER FOR SKILLS AND TRAINING: Thanks, Prime Minister. It's great to be with the \\nPrime Minister and, of course, with Mary and Anne, here today at this fantastic dual sector provider at Swinburne. \\nIt's fair to say that when we were elected, we comprehended the challenge we had in supplying the skills to the \\nlabour market. There were skill shortages across the economy. Wherever you looked, whatever professional trade, \\nthere were shortages. It was for that reason the Prime Minister convened the Jobs and Skills Summit, bringing \\ntogether industry, bringing together state and territory governments, and finding solutions to the problems that we \\ninherited. And I'm happy to say that the 180,000 fee-free TAFE places decision that was made at that summit was \\nan absolutely critical part of the response by the Albanese Government to the skill shortages. And we're seeing it \\nhere today, as a result of that decision and as a result of decisions by the Albanese Government with eight separate \\ngovernments, eight state and territory governments, to have agreements in each jurisdiction, we can focus on the \\neconomies of each state and territory. And that's what we've done. 55,000 fee-free places in Victoria, and then a \\nlarge proportion of those, for example, in early childhood education, where there's a massive demand. 40 per cent \\nof the advertisements for those jobs are in Victoria. That's why we've dedicated 3,800 places to this state, and that's \\nwhy the students we've met today are able to enrol in those courses, knowing that they can afford it, knowing that \\nthey can cope with the cost of living pressures because the courses are fee-free, which also means, because \\nenrolments are going up, the supply of skilled workers to this really critical sector of our economy, looking after and \\nteaching our children, preschool children is absolutely vital, we'll be able to provide that pipeline. So, as a result of \\nthose agreements with state and territory governments, the fee-free component, which is ensuring that enrolments \\nare increasing, we are responding to the skill shortages across the economy, not just in that area, but today we are \\nfocussing on that area. And I believe that, certainly in talking with Mary, she fully understands the pressure that \\nparents are under in terms of costs, the pressure that students are under, and that's why we're providing fee-free \\nplaces and understands, too, that we need to be ensuring that we can supply the skilled workforce to an economy \\nthat is certainly in need of such a supply. It's because of these decisions we are seeing the benefits that are \\nhappening. And that's why in talking to the students today, it was quite obvious that it was a lot easier for them to \\nenter into these courses, acquire these much needed skills, because of the announcement and the decision of the \\nAlbanese Government, working with state and territory governments, providing fee-free options for them.Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: Thanks, Brendan. It's great to be here this \\nmorning, of course, with the Prime Minister, with Brendan O'Connor, and our wonderful candidate for Aston, Mary \\nDoyle. Mary is a local and she gets it. She gets what families here are going through and she understands the \\nimportance of early childhood education and care. And, in fact, Mary was saying that her own daughter went locally \\nhere, accessed early childhood education and care locally here, and still recognises her early childhood education \\nteacher at the shopping centre. That's because she's a local. She knows this area, and she understands and values \\nearly childhood education and care. Now, in just under 100 days, families right across Australia are going to reap \\nthe benefits of our reforms that are making early childhood education and care more affordable. And we know that \\nin order for that to be successful, we need a sustainable workforce. That is why the fee-free TAFE that the \\nAlbanese Labor Government has introduced is so important. And today, we had the pleasure of meeting students \\nlike Tiana and Connor who are using that fee-free TAFE. They are saving thousands of dollars and they are the \\nfuture workforce of early childhood education and care, but they're also the current workforce of early childhood \\neducation and care. Because, as the Prime Minister said, they are working as they are getting their degree in areas \\nof skill shortages. We know that our early childhood education and care reforms that make it much more affordable \\nfor families right across Australia are important, but we're also getting on with the job of ensuring that we have that \\nsustainable workforce. And I'm proud to be a part of a Labor Government, I look forward to welcoming Mary Doyle \\nas a Member for Aston after the election next week. I know she will make an extremely valuable contribution to the \\nLabor Caucus. And I look forward to seeing more students like Tiana and Connor taking advantage of that fee-free \\nTAFE, graduating with an Early Childhood Education and Care Certificate, and becoming part of our valuable \\nworkforce in early childhood education and care.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there's a lot of mortgage stress in the Aston area, what can your Government do to \\nalleviate some of that?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, what we're doing is having a comprehensive housing policy. There is legislation before the \\nParliament, before the Senate next week, the Housing Australia Future Fund. That has a number of components to \\nit. One is an increased investment in social and community housing, which will create 30,000 additional units over \\nthe next five years. But it also has within it as well, additional funding for emergency housing, some $100 million, \\nand it has, as part of that as well, funding specifically for veterans housing, as well as for women and children \\nescaping family and domestic violence. That's one element. The other thing we're doing is a housing accord, \\nworking with the private sector, with organisations like the Master Builders and the Housing Industry Association \\nand others, having an accord with state and territory governments to increase the supply of housing. Prices, of \\ncourse, are a product of demand and supply. So, what we want to do is to increase the supply of housing. We also \\nhave our Housing Supply and Affordability Council is part of the legislation for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \\nWhat that's aimed at doing is working with each level of government to make sure that approvals and land release \\nand those issues are dealt with in our outer suburbs in a way that assists people. We recognise that people are \\ndoing it tough. We are taking action on that. That's the other reason why we're making sure that we put downward \\npressure on inflation. The Reserve Bank Governor, in the statement that he made at the beginning of this month, \\nhas said that he hoped that inflation had peaked in the December quarter. Of course, the highest inflation rate \\ngrowth of any quarter this century was the March 2022 quarter last year. So, the last full quarter in which the \\nCoalition were in office was the highest inflation of any quarter in Australia this century. And that's why, as well, we \\nwill produce a responsible Budget. That's why we returned 99 per cent of the revenue gains to the Budget in \\nOctober last year. So there's no easy fix here. But we want to work with the Andrews Government to make sure that \\nwe deal with the housing stress, which is a national phenomenon. That's why we're working with all state and \\nterritory governments and the private sector. And that's why I'd urge the Senate next week to pass this legislation \\nthat will make a difference.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you expect the Premier to join you on the campaign trail in the last week here in Aston?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I'll be in Parliament next week.\\nJOURNALIST: Over the weekend maybe?Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well I won't be here over the weekend. There's a couple of elections on, this by-election. This \\nafternoon I'll be in Penrith, so a bit of notice for the media, I'll be in Penrith and I'll be in Riverstone this afternoon \\nand I'll be in a range of seats tomorrow in my home state of New South Wales, as you would expect.\\nJOURNALIST: Are you confident Chris Minns will get the job done?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Chris Minns, I think, will make an outstanding Premier of New South Wales. That's a decision \\nfor the people of New South Wales. I think, can I say this? I think that Dominic Perrottet and Chris Minns are both \\nvery good people. They're good human beings. I have a good relationship with both of them and I like both of them. \\nThe problem is that Dominic Perrottet's Government is a shambles. The Liberals are too busy fighting each other \\nand fighting the Nationals, and the Nationals fighting each other, to fight for the people of New South Wales. And \\nthat's why Chris Minns deserves and his team deserves to be elected to government tomorrow. I'll work with \\nwhoever is elected it, as I do constructively. I've had liaison with Premier Rockliff this morning. My Government \\nactually works for solutions. We look for unity. We don't look for division. The problem with the modern Liberal Party \\nis that it is so divided on itself. On itself. I mean, they can't make a decision on constitutional recognition for \\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in 2023. If they oppose it, they've got to say. When will that occur? How \\nlong? Is 122 years not long enough to wait to recognise that our history didn't begin in 1788? The Victorian Liberal \\nParty here are a shambles. We've seen them fighting each other. And the Caucus can't make a decision in \\nCanberra, in Peter Dutton. That's why we need to send a message to them that they need to do better. They need \\nto get their act together. That's why Mary Doyle deserves to be elected as the Member for Aston. If she joins our \\nCaucus, she'll join a united, coherent team. A united, coherent team that has plans for our economic growth, that \\nhas plans for social equity, that has plans for gender equality, that has plans for dealing with the challenge of \\nclimate change, that supports multiculturalism, that doesn't have to think about these things because it's in our core. \\nIt's our instinct. And that is what Mary Doyle, that's the team that she will join if she's elected.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Linda Burney that Peter Dutton is just looking for excuses to reject the Voice? \\nAnd secondly, will you release the Solicitor-General's advice on the wording?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well the two things are connected, because Peter Dutton knows that he sat in a Cabinet for \\nnine years and didn't release any advice to the Cabinet. It's not the way it works. And he knows that. He knows that. \\nSo what we saw from Peter Dutton, over a long period of time, was first in the lead-up to my speech at Garma, he \\nsaid, 'We don't know what the question is.' So, I released draft words. We received not a suggestion in between \\nJuly last year and yesterday when I released what will be in the legislation to go to Parliament next week. Not one \\nsuggestion from him or Julian Leeser, the Shadow Attorney-General, of any change. Not a word. And Julian Leeser, \\nwe know, has been involved with the wording since a decade ago. A decade ago. He was one of the people who \\nwere involved in that process, as Noel Pearson outlined in The Australian some weeks ago. So, Peter Dutton needs \\nto get real about this. This isn't about him, and it's not about me. This is about whether we are a better country \\ngoing forward. It's whether we can recognise Indigenous Australians in our nation's birth certificate. And then it's \\nonly about one other thing, which is will we get better outcomes if we consult the people who are impacted by those \\ndecisions? That's what this is about. It's a simple proposition before the Australian people, and I'm confident that \\nthe Australian people will vote yes. And the idea whenever any detail is given, and yesterday we released eight of \\nthe principles that will go towards the legislation in shaping the Voice. And the Voice can't be clearer, the words that \\nwill go forward include, the third point, 'The Parliament shall, subject to this constitution, have power to make laws \\nwith respect to matters relating to', which is a legal term, 'Relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, \\nincluding its composition, functions, powers and procedures'. Peter Dutton will be a part of the Parliament and \\nfuture members will be a part of future Parliaments, that will determine the function of the Voice. And he knows that \\nthat's the case. And we know from the Republic playbook that occurred last century, that it is nothing more than a \\ntactic, and it lacks genuineness to just continue to say 'We don't have the detail'. No matter how much detail is put \\nout, Peter Dutton will say, 'What about more detail?' That's the game that's being played here. And he should make \\na decision of where he stands on this issue, because this is an issue that isn't the creation of a Labor Government. \\nThis has arisen from the bottom up. And yesterday I had Ken Wyatt, who flew overnight to Canberra, the \\nIndigenous Affairs Minister in the Morrison Government, to stand next to me and with his fellow Aboriginal and \\nTorres Strait Islander people who've been a part of the Referendum Working Group, who've come to a unanimous \\nposition. And I'd say that this should be above politics as the 1967 referendum was.Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what economic benefits do you see from the Voice, and do you intend to sit down \\nwith Mr Dutton before next Thursday to discuss his concerns?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I sat down with him yesterday. I sat down with him before we did the press conference. Let's be \\nvery clear, that's the seventh time I have sat down with Peter Dutton. Peter Dutton has met with the Referendum \\nWorking Group twice. You know what? At those meetings we haven't had questions raised. He's had every \\nopportunity. There have been, I think it was Thomas Mayor yesterday, outlined the number of inquiries, details, \\ncommittees that have looked into this over more than a decade. The Uluru Statement from the Heart was in 2017. It \\ngrew out of a First Nations Constitutional Convention. It grew out of a five-year process from 2012 that began back \\nat the end of the last century. John Howard was Prime Minister when he said there needed to be constitutional \\nrecognition. Scott Morrison went to the election in 2019 and said there should be constitutional recognition. It was \\nthe Morrison Government that established the committee that Tom Calma and Marcia Langton presided over, with \\npeople like Chris Kenny and Frank Brennan and a range of people who participated and produced a report that is \\nhundreds of pages long. It went to the Cabinet of the Morrison Government, not my Government, not once, but \\ntwice. The detail is out there. The detail is out there. We need to know, as well, know this, that the programs that \\nhave been successful, that make a difference for Indigenous people, are ones in which they have been involved. \\nJustice reinvestment by the Coalition Government in New South Wales in places like Moree and Bourke, the \\nIndigenous Rangers Program, community health programs. Where people are involved, you get better outcomes. \\nAnd that is something that is just a fact, and that is why we had this coming together. Aboriginal and Torres Strait \\nIslander people are no less homogeneous than any other group that you want to pick. But what you had yesterday \\nwas people from different parts of Australia, from different parts of the country, coming together. And, you know, \\nthe great Galarrwuy Yunupingu, watching it there on Yolngu country in Arnhem Land, watching it, a product of his \\nlife's work. These people, their patience, their modesty, their humbleness, is inspirational. And they deserve, they \\ndeserve nothing less than for people to put politics aside and to get this done. And we will give the Australian \\npeople the opportunity to enlarge our country later this year. And we can be enlarged, or we can shrink. Shrink into \\nplaying old politics. And that's what people need to consider who are in positions of political leadership on this \\nissue.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you worried the wording leaves the door open for High Court challenges? Or are \\nyou confident that it's as watertight as you say it is?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I'm absolutely confident. But I'm confident on the basis of people like the former head of the \\nHigh Court, Justice French. He might know something about the Constitution. The leading academic in Australia \\non constitutional law, Professor Anne Twomey, might know something about the Constitution. This hasn't arisen in \\na vacuum. There's been all of this work done by the advisory group to the Referendum Working Group. It's very \\nclear that this is a straightforward proposition. People can read it themselves. I just read out the third clause that \\nmakes it clear that the Parliament is primary. The primacy of the Parliament is there, including its composition, \\nfunctions, powers and procedures. A key word, including. So, all matters, and it says, to matters relating to, matters \\nis often used as a legal term as well. And we took proper advice, and I'm very confident you will have an \\nopportunity. If you get ten lawyers in a room, you'll often get someone who gets a run in. That's what they're paid to \\ndo. That's why on different sides, to put this in perspective, that's why on different sides in courts, you have lawyers \\non one side and lawyers on the other side. They're paid to advocate. That's an honourable profession to do. But \\nyou shouldn't use that fact to say that there's someone out there who disagrees. Someone, I'm sure I can find you a \\nlawyer who can tell you that that jacket you're wearing is orange or pink. I can find that for you. Pay them enough, \\nthat'll happen.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just back to Aston. Do you think what's happening internally in the Liberal Party in \\nVictoria could actually work in Mary Doyle's favour in regards to Moira Deeming?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think the Liberal Party is dysfunctional here. We saw that in the lead-up to the state \\nelection. We saw that in the way that the Federal Liberal Party people here operate as well. Michael Sukkar was \\npretty desperate to stop the candidate being preselected here for Aston. He didn't have confidence that someone \\nfrom outside the area would be appropriate. I mean, we're a long way from the Melbourne City Council. And I think \\nthat that's just a fact, that it's a dysfunctional branch. They need to be given time to get their act together. In the Page 6 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nmeantime, we've got a fantastic candidate who secured the unanimous support of everyone, who ran last time, who \\nhasn't shopped around for a seat.

Whether it's fee-free TAFE \\nfor 55,000 Victorians. I want to be a part of the team that delivers for the outer-east. If I'm elected to be part of the \\nAlbanese Government as the next Member for Aston, I promise you this I will always fight for TAFE, I will always \\nfight for cheaper child care, and I will always fight for locals. And I'm thrilled to welcome the PM back to Wantirna.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Well, thanks very much, Mary. And I do want to thank the staff and the \\nstudents at Swinburne TAFE here for the very warm welcome that I've received here this morning, along with my \\nMinister for Skills and Training, Brendan O'Connor, and my Minister who looks after Early Childhood Learning, \\nAnne Aly. We're here to talk to students. We're here also to hear firsthand from them the difference that fee-free \\nTAFE is making to their lives. We, arising out of the Jobs and Skills Summit last year, and a commitment we made \\nat the election to 180,000 fee-free TAFE places are happening right now. And what we heard from this morning is \\nstudents who not only are benefiting from that fee-free TAFE, but they're also working and earning an income while \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nthat is happening. We've learned from them firsthand that this was part of the incentive for them to enter an area \\nwhich has skill shortages. So, it's good for students, but it's good for the economy as well. And it's good for this \\nregion, because we also heard that the early learning centres which they are partaking in now, in terms of their work \\nexperience, are all local. And Mary Doyle understands that. That's why I want Mary Doyle, next Saturday, to \\nbecome the Member for Aston. Because this community needs a voice in government. A Labor Government. A \\nLabor Government that cares about people in the outer suburbs. A Labor Government that's committed to making a \\ndifference with fee-free TAFE, to making a difference with the cheaper pharmaceuticals, but making a difference as \\nwell in child care costs for families. One of the things that is happening here from the students we spoke to, not only \\nare they benefiting from free-free TAFE, they're benefiting from working, because there are skills shortages, but \\nthey're also having the bonus of our cheaper child care plan, that comes in on July 1, will mean that more women in \\nparticular can join the workforce. This isn't a welfare policy. This is a productivity enhancing economic policy. This is \\nabout improving women's workforce participation, it's about boosting productivity and also about boosting the \\npopulation. The three Ps of economic growth are all ticked by this policy. Mary Doyle understands this. She hasn't \\nshopped around for a seat. Mary Doyle ran for this seat last year, and she's been committed to her community, \\nwhere she has lived for a long period of time, here in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. And that's why I want \\nsomeone who actually understands this community, who's committed to this community, and who will represent this \\ncommunity in the by-election on April 1. People do have an opportunity to send a message to the Opposition that \\nthey need to do better than have Peter Dutton as their Leader. Peter Dutton, who has spent year after year in \\ngovernment deriding Victorians, condemning the sacrifices that they were making during the pandemic, and \\nsomeone who said that people weren't safe to go out in Melbourne. Like, he just doesn't get this city and he doesn't \\nget this state of Victoria. Mary Doyle does. She'll be a fantastic representative, and I look forward to her joining our \\nteam after April 1 and having input into the Budget that we'll be putting together in May, which will take further \\npressure off working families in communities like this. I'll get Brendan to say something, Anne, and then we're \\nhappy to take questions.\\nBRENDAN O'CONNOR, MINISTER FOR SKILLS AND TRAINING: Thanks, Prime Minister. It's great to be with the \\nPrime Minister and, of course, with Mary and Anne, here today at this fantastic dual sector provider at Swinburne. \\nIt's fair to say that when we were elected, we comprehended the challenge we had in supplying the skills to the \\nlabour market. There were skill shortages across the economy. Wherever you looked, whatever professional trade, \\nthere were shortages. It was for that reason the Prime Minister convened the Jobs and Skills Summit, bringing \\ntogether industry, bringing together state and territory governments, and finding solutions to the problems that we \\ninherited. And I'm happy to say that the 180,000 fee-free TAFE places decision that was made at that summit was \\nan absolutely critical part of the response by the Albanese Government to the skill shortages. And we're seeing it \\nhere today, as a result of that decision and as a result of decisions by the Albanese Government with eight separate \\ngovernments, eight state and territory governments, to have agreements in each jurisdiction, we can focus on the \\neconomies of each state and territory. And that's what we've done. 55,000 fee-free places in Victoria, and then a \\nlarge proportion of those, for example, in early childhood education, where there's a massive demand. 40 per cent \\nof the advertisements for those jobs are in Victoria. That's why we've dedicated 3,800 places to this state, and that's \\nwhy the students we've met today are able to enrol in those courses, knowing that they can afford it, knowing that \\nthey can cope with the cost of living pressures because the courses are fee-free, which also means, because \\nenrolments are going up, the supply of skilled workers to this really critical sector of our economy, looking after and \\nteaching our children, preschool children is absolutely vital, we'll be able to provide that pipeline. So, as a result of \\nthose agreements with state and territory governments, the fee-free component, which is ensuring that enrolments \\nare increasing, we are responding to the skill shortages across the economy, not just in that area, but today we are \\nfocussing on that area. And I believe that, certainly in talking with Mary, she fully understands the pressure that \\nparents are under in terms of costs, the pressure that students are under, and that's why we're providing fee-free \\nplaces and understands, too, that we need to be ensuring that we can supply the skilled workforce to an economy \\nthat is certainly in need of such a supply. It's because of these decisions we are seeing the benefits that are \\nhappening. And that's why in talking to the students today, it was quite obvious that it was a lot easier for them to \\nenter into these courses, acquire these much needed skills, because of the announcement and the decision of the \\nAlbanese Government, working with state and territory governments, providing fee-free options for them.Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: Thanks, Brendan. It's great to be here this \\nmorning, of course, with the Prime Minister, with Brendan O'Connor, and our wonderful candidate for Aston, Mary \\nDoyle. Mary is a local and she gets it. She gets what families here are going through and she understands the \\nimportance of early childhood education and care. And, in fact, Mary was saying that her own daughter went locally \\nhere, accessed early childhood education and care locally here, and still recognises her early childhood education \\nteacher at the shopping centre. That's because she's a local. She knows this area, and she understands and values \\nearly childhood education and care. Now, in just under 100 days, families right across Australia are going to reap \\nthe benefits of our reforms that are making early childhood education and care more affordable. And we know that \\nin order for that to be successful, we need a sustainable workforce. That is why the fee-free TAFE that the \\nAlbanese Labor Government has introduced is so important. And today, we had the pleasure of meeting students \\nlike Tiana and Connor who are using that fee-free TAFE. They are saving thousands of dollars and they are the \\nfuture workforce of early childhood education and care, but they're also the current workforce of early childhood \\neducation and care. Because, as the Prime Minister said, they are working as they are getting their degree in areas \\nof skill shortages. We know that our early childhood education and care reforms that make it much more affordable \\nfor families right across Australia are important, but we're also getting on with the job of ensuring that we have that \\nsustainable workforce. And I'm proud to be a part of a Labor Government, I look forward to welcoming Mary Doyle \\nas a Member for Aston after the election next week. I know she will make an extremely valuable contribution to the \\nLabor Caucus. And I look forward to seeing more students like Tiana and Connor taking advantage of that fee-free \\nTAFE, graduating with an Early Childhood Education and Care Certificate, and becoming part of our valuable \\nworkforce in early childhood education and care.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there's a lot of mortgage stress in the Aston area, what can your Government do to \\nalleviate some of that?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, what we're doing is having a comprehensive housing policy. There is legislation before the \\nParliament, before the Senate next week, the Housing Australia Future Fund. That has a number of components to \\nit. One is an increased investment in social and community housing, which will create 30,000 additional units over \\nthe next five years. But it also has within it as well, additional funding for emergency housing, some $100 million, \\nand it has, as part of that as well, funding specifically for veterans housing, as well as for women and children \\nescaping family and domestic violence. That's one element. The other thing we're doing is a housing accord, \\nworking with the private sector, with organisations like the Master Builders and the Housing Industry Association \\nand others, having an accord with state and territory governments to increase the supply of housing. Prices, of \\ncourse, are a product of demand and supply. So, what we want to do is to increase the supply of housing. We also \\nhave our Housing Supply and Affordability Council is part of the legislation for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \\nWhat that's aimed at doing is working with each level of government to make sure that approvals and land release \\nand those issues are dealt with in our outer suburbs in a way that assists people. We recognise that people are \\ndoing it tough. We are taking action on that. That's the other reason why we're making sure that we put downward \\npressure on inflation. The Reserve Bank Governor, in the statement that he made at the beginning of this month, \\nhas said that he hoped that inflation had peaked in the December quarter. Of course, the highest inflation rate \\ngrowth of any quarter this century was the March 2022 quarter last year. So, the last full quarter in which the \\nCoalition were in office was the highest inflation of any quarter in Australia this century. And that's why, as well, we \\nwill produce a responsible Budget. That's why we returned 99 per cent of the revenue gains to the Budget in \\nOctober last year. So there's no easy fix here. But we want to work with the Andrews Government to make sure that \\nwe deal with the housing stress, which is a national phenomenon. That's why we're working with all state and \\nterritory governments and the private sector. And that's why I'd urge the Senate next week to pass this legislation \\nthat will make a difference.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you expect the Premier to join you on the campaign trail in the last week here in Aston?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I'll be in Parliament next week.\\nJOURNALIST: Over the weekend maybe?Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well I won't be here over the weekend. There's a couple of elections on, this by-election. This \\nafternoon I'll be in Penrith, so a bit of notice for the media, I'll be in Penrith and I'll be in Riverstone this afternoon \\nand I'll be in a range of seats tomorrow in my home state of New South Wales, as you would expect.\\nJOURNALIST: Are you confident Chris Minns will get the job done?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Chris Minns, I think, will make an outstanding Premier of New South Wales. That's a decision \\nfor the people of New South Wales. I think, can I say this? I think that Dominic Perrottet and Chris Minns are both \\nvery good people. They're good human beings. I have a good relationship with both of them and I like both of them. \\nThe problem is that Dominic Perrottet's Government is a shambles. The Liberals are too busy fighting each other \\nand fighting the Nationals, and the Nationals fighting each other, to fight for the people of New South Wales. And \\nthat's why Chris Minns deserves and his team deserves to be elected to government tomorrow. I'll work with \\nwhoever is elected it, as I do constructively. I've had liaison with Premier Rockliff this morning. My Government \\nactually works for solutions. We look for unity. We don't look for division. The problem with the modern Liberal Party \\nis that it is so divided on itself. On itself. I mean, they can't make a decision on constitutional recognition for \\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in 2023. If they oppose it, they've got to say. When will that occur? How \\nlong? Is 122 years not long enough to wait to recognise that our history didn't begin in 1788? The Victorian Liberal \\nParty here are a shambles. We've seen them fighting each other. And the Caucus can't make a decision in \\nCanberra, in Peter Dutton. That's why we need to send a message to them that they need to do better. They need \\nto get their act together. That's why Mary Doyle deserves to be elected as the Member for Aston. If she joins our \\nCaucus, she'll join a united, coherent team. A united, coherent team that has plans for our economic growth, that \\nhas plans for social equity, that has plans for gender equality, that has plans for dealing with the challenge of \\nclimate change, that supports multiculturalism, that doesn't have to think about these things because it's in our core. \\nIt's our instinct. And that is what Mary Doyle, that's the team that she will join if she's elected.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Linda Burney that Peter Dutton is just looking for excuses to reject the Voice? \\nAnd secondly, will you release the Solicitor-General's advice on the wording?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well the two things are connected, because Peter Dutton knows that he sat in a Cabinet for \\nnine years and didn't release any advice to the Cabinet. It's not the way it works. And he knows that. He knows that. \\nSo what we saw from Peter Dutton, over a long period of time, was first in the lead-up to my speech at Garma, he \\nsaid, 'We don't know what the question is.' So, I released draft words. We received not a suggestion in between \\nJuly last year and yesterday when I released what will be in the legislation to go to Parliament next week. Not one \\nsuggestion from him or Julian Leeser, the Shadow Attorney-General, of any change. Not a word. And Julian Leeser, \\nwe know, has been involved with the wording since a decade ago. A decade ago. He was one of the people who \\nwere involved in that process, as Noel Pearson outlined in The Australian some weeks ago. So, Peter Dutton needs \\nto get real about this. This isn't about him, and it's not about me. This is about whether we are a better country \\ngoing forward. It's whether we can recognise Indigenous Australians in our nation's birth certificate. And then it's \\nonly about one other thing, which is will we get better outcomes if we consult the people who are impacted by those \\ndecisions? That's what this is about. It's a simple proposition before the Australian people, and I'm confident that \\nthe Australian people will vote yes. And the idea whenever any detail is given, and yesterday we released eight of \\nthe principles that will go towards the legislation in shaping the Voice. And the Voice can't be clearer, the words that \\nwill go forward include, the third point, 'The Parliament shall, subject to this constitution, have power to make laws \\nwith respect to matters relating to', which is a legal term, 'Relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, \\nincluding its composition, functions, powers and procedures'. Peter Dutton will be a part of the Parliament and \\nfuture members will be a part of future Parliaments, that will determine the function of the Voice. And he knows that \\nthat's the case. And we know from the Republic playbook that occurred last century, that it is nothing more than a \\ntactic, and it lacks genuineness to just continue to say 'We don't have the detail'. No matter how much detail is put \\nout, Peter Dutton will say, 'What about more detail?' That's the game that's being played here. And he should make \\na decision of where he stands on this issue, because this is an issue that isn't the creation of a Labor Government. \\nThis has arisen from the bottom up. And yesterday I had Ken Wyatt, who flew overnight to Canberra, the \\nIndigenous Affairs Minister in the Morrison Government, to stand next to me and with his fellow Aboriginal and \\nTorres Strait Islander people who've been a part of the Referendum Working Group, who've come to a unanimous \\nposition. And I'd say that this should be above politics as the 1967 referendum was.Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what economic benefits do you see from the Voice, and do you intend to sit down \\nwith Mr Dutton before next Thursday to discuss his concerns?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I sat down with him yesterday. I sat down with him before we did the press conference. Let's be \\nvery clear, that's the seventh time I have sat down with Peter Dutton. Peter Dutton has met with the Referendum \\nWorking Group twice. You know what? At those meetings we haven't had questions raised. He's had every \\nopportunity. There have been, I think it was Thomas Mayor yesterday, outlined the number of inquiries, details, \\ncommittees that have looked into this over more than a decade. The Uluru Statement from the Heart was in 2017. It \\ngrew out of a First Nations Constitutional Convention. It grew out of a five-year process from 2012 that began back \\nat the end of the last century. John Howard was Prime Minister when he said there needed to be constitutional \\nrecognition. Scott Morrison went to the election in 2019 and said there should be constitutional recognition. It was \\nthe Morrison Government that established the committee that Tom Calma and Marcia Langton presided over, with \\npeople like Chris Kenny and Frank Brennan and a range of people who participated and produced a report that is \\nhundreds of pages long. It went to the Cabinet of the Morrison Government, not my Government, not once, but \\ntwice. The detail is out there. The detail is out there. We need to know, as well, know this, that the programs that \\nhave been successful, that make a difference for Indigenous people, are ones in which they have been involved. \\nJustice reinvestment by the Coalition Government in New South Wales in places like Moree and Bourke, the \\nIndigenous Rangers Program, community health programs. Where people are involved, you get better outcomes. \\nAnd that is something that is just a fact, and that is why we had this coming together. Aboriginal and Torres Strait \\nIslander people are no less homogeneous than any other group that you want to pick. But what you had yesterday \\nwas people from different parts of Australia, from different parts of the country, coming together. And, you know, \\nthe great Galarrwuy Yunupingu, watching it there on Yolngu country in Arnhem Land, watching it, a product of his \\nlife's work. These people, their patience, their modesty, their humbleness, is inspirational. And they deserve, they \\ndeserve nothing less than for people to put politics aside and to get this done. And we will give the Australian \\npeople the opportunity to enlarge our country later this year. And we can be enlarged, or we can shrink. Shrink into \\nplaying old politics. And that's what people need to consider who are in positions of political leadership on this \\nissue.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you worried the wording leaves the door open for High Court challenges? Or are \\nyou confident that it's as watertight as you say it is?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I'm absolutely confident. But I'm confident on the basis of people like the former head of the \\nHigh Court, Justice French. He might know something about the Constitution. The leading academic in Australia \\non constitutional law, Professor Anne Twomey, might know something about the Constitution. This hasn't arisen in \\na vacuum. There's been all of this work done by the advisory group to the Referendum Working Group. It's very \\nclear that this is a straightforward proposition. People can read it themselves. I just read out the third clause that \\nmakes it clear that the Parliament is primary. The primacy of the Parliament is there, including its composition, \\nfunctions, powers and procedures. A key word, including. So, all matters, and it says, to matters relating to, matters \\nis often used as a legal term as well. And we took proper advice, and I'm very confident you will have an \\nopportunity. If you get ten lawyers in a room, you'll often get someone who gets a run in. That's what they're paid to \\ndo. That's why on different sides, to put this in perspective, that's why on different sides in courts, you have lawyers \\non one side and lawyers on the other side. They're paid to advocate. That's an honourable profession to do. But \\nyou shouldn't use that fact to say that there's someone out there who disagrees. Someone, I'm sure I can find you a \\nlawyer who can tell you that that jacket you're wearing is orange or pink. I can find that for you. Pay them enough, \\nthat'll happen.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just back to Aston. Do you think what's happening internally in the Liberal Party in \\nVictoria could actually work in Mary Doyle's favour in regards to Moira Deeming?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think the Liberal Party is dysfunctional here. We saw that in the lead-up to the state \\nelection. We saw that in the way that the Federal Liberal Party people here operate as well. Michael Sukkar was \\npretty desperate to stop the candidate being preselected here for Aston. He didn't have confidence that someone \\nfrom outside the area would be appropriate. I mean, we're a long way from the Melbourne City Council. And I think \\nthat that's just a fact, that it's a dysfunctional branch. They need to be given time to get their act together. In the Page 6 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nmeantime, we've got a fantastic candidate who secured the unanimous support of everyone, who ran last time, who \\nhasn't shopped around for a seat.

That's why we've dedicated 3,800 places to this state, and that's \\nwhy the students we've met today are able to enrol in those courses, knowing that they can afford it, knowing that \\nthey can cope with the cost of living pressures because the courses are fee-free, which also means, because \\nenrolments are going up, the supply of skilled workers to this really critical sector of our economy, looking after and \\nteaching our children, preschool children is absolutely vital, we'll be able to provide that pipeline. So, as a result of \\nthose agreements with state and territory governments, the fee-free component, which is ensuring that enrolments \\nare increasing, we are responding to the skill shortages across the economy, not just in that area, but today we are \\nfocussing on that area. And I believe that, certainly in talking with Mary, she fully understands the pressure that \\nparents are under in terms of costs, the pressure that students are under, and that's why we're providing fee-free \\nplaces and understands, too, that we need to be ensuring that we can supply the skilled workforce to an economy \\nthat is certainly in need of such a supply. It's because of these decisions we are seeing the benefits that are \\nhappening. And that's why in talking to the students today, it was quite obvious that it was a lot easier for them to \\nenter into these courses, acquire these much needed skills, because of the announcement and the decision of the \\nAlbanese Government, working with state and territory governments, providing fee-free options for them.Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: Thanks, Brendan. It's great to be here this \\nmorning, of course, with the Prime Minister, with Brendan O'Connor, and our wonderful candidate for Aston, Mary \\nDoyle. Mary is a local and she gets it. She gets what families here are going through and she understands the \\nimportance of early childhood education and care. And, in fact, Mary was saying that her own daughter went locally \\nhere, accessed early childhood education and care locally here, and still recognises her early childhood education \\nteacher at the shopping centre. That's because she's a local. She knows this area, and she understands and values \\nearly childhood education and care. Now, in just under 100 days, families right across Australia are going to reap \\nthe benefits of our reforms that are making early childhood education and care more affordable. And we know that \\nin order for that to be successful, we need a sustainable workforce. That is why the fee-free TAFE that the \\nAlbanese Labor Government has introduced is so important. And today, we had the pleasure of meeting students \\nlike Tiana and Connor who are using that fee-free TAFE. They are saving thousands of dollars and they are the \\nfuture workforce of early childhood education and care, but they're also the current workforce of early childhood \\neducation and care. Because, as the Prime Minister said, they are working as they are getting their degree in areas \\nof skill shortages. We know that our early childhood education and care reforms that make it much more affordable \\nfor families right across Australia are important, but we're also getting on with the job of ensuring that we have that \\nsustainable workforce. And I'm proud to be a part of a Labor Government, I look forward to welcoming Mary Doyle \\nas a Member for Aston after the election next week. I know she will make an extremely valuable contribution to the \\nLabor Caucus. And I look forward to seeing more students like Tiana and Connor taking advantage of that fee-free \\nTAFE, graduating with an Early Childhood Education and Care Certificate, and becoming part of our valuable \\nworkforce in early childhood education and care.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there's a lot of mortgage stress in the Aston area, what can your Government do to \\nalleviate some of that?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, what we're doing is having a comprehensive housing policy. There is legislation before the \\nParliament, before the Senate next week, the Housing Australia Future Fund. That has a number of components to \\nit. One is an increased investment in social and community housing, which will create 30,000 additional units over \\nthe next five years. But it also has within it as well, additional funding for emergency housing, some $100 million, \\nand it has, as part of that as well, funding specifically for veterans housing, as well as for women and children \\nescaping family and domestic violence. That's one element. The other thing we're doing is a housing accord, \\nworking with the private sector, with organisations like the Master Builders and the Housing Industry Association \\nand others, having an accord with state and territory governments to increase the supply of housing. Prices, of \\ncourse, are a product of demand and supply. So, what we want to do is to increase the supply of housing. We also \\nhave our Housing Supply and Affordability Council is part of the legislation for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \\nWhat that's aimed at doing is working with each level of government to make sure that approvals and land release \\nand those issues are dealt with in our outer suburbs in a way that assists people. We recognise that people are \\ndoing it tough. We are taking action on that. That's the other reason why we're making sure that we put downward \\npressure on inflation. The Reserve Bank Governor, in the statement that he made at the beginning of this month, \\nhas said that he hoped that inflation had peaked in the December quarter. Of course, the highest inflation rate \\ngrowth of any quarter this century was the March 2022 quarter last year. So, the last full quarter in which the \\nCoalition were in office was the highest inflation of any quarter in Australia this century. And that's why, as well, we \\nwill produce a responsible Budget. That's why we returned 99 per cent of the revenue gains to the Budget in \\nOctober last year. So there's no easy fix here. But we want to work with the Andrews Government to make sure that \\nwe deal with the housing stress, which is a national phenomenon. That's why we're working with all state and \\nterritory governments and the private sector. And that's why I'd urge the Senate next week to pass this legislation \\nthat will make a difference.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you expect the Premier to join you on the campaign trail in the last week here in Aston?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I'll be in Parliament next week.\\nJOURNALIST: Over the weekend maybe?Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well I won't be here over the weekend. There's a couple of elections on, this by-election. This \\nafternoon I'll be in Penrith, so a bit of notice for the media, I'll be in Penrith and I'll be in Riverstone this afternoon \\nand I'll be in a range of seats tomorrow in my home state of New South Wales, as you would expect.\\nJOURNALIST: Are you confident Chris Minns will get the job done?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Chris Minns, I think, will make an outstanding Premier of New South Wales. That's a decision \\nfor the people of New South Wales. I think, can I say this? I think that Dominic Perrottet and Chris Minns are both \\nvery good people. They're good human beings. I have a good relationship with both of them and I like both of them. \\nThe problem is that Dominic Perrottet's Government is a shambles. The Liberals are too busy fighting each other \\nand fighting the Nationals, and the Nationals fighting each other, to fight for the people of New South Wales. And \\nthat's why Chris Minns deserves and his team deserves to be elected to government tomorrow. I'll work with \\nwhoever is elected it, as I do constructively. I've had liaison with Premier Rockliff this morning. My Government \\nactually works for solutions. We look for unity. We don't look for division. The problem with the modern Liberal Party \\nis that it is so divided on itself. On itself. I mean, they can't make a decision on constitutional recognition for \\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in 2023. If they oppose it, they've got to say. When will that occur? How \\nlong? Is 122 years not long enough to wait to recognise that our history didn't begin in 1788? The Victorian Liberal \\nParty here are a shambles. We've seen them fighting each other. And the Caucus can't make a decision in \\nCanberra, in Peter Dutton. That's why we need to send a message to them that they need to do better. They need \\nto get their act together. That's why Mary Doyle deserves to be elected as the Member for Aston. If she joins our \\nCaucus, she'll join a united, coherent team. A united, coherent team that has plans for our economic growth, that \\nhas plans for social equity, that has plans for gender equality, that has plans for dealing with the challenge of \\nclimate change, that supports multiculturalism, that doesn't have to think about these things because it's in our core. \\nIt's our instinct. And that is what Mary Doyle, that's the team that she will join if she's elected.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Linda Burney that Peter Dutton is just looking for excuses to reject the Voice? \\nAnd secondly, will you release the Solicitor-General's advice on the wording?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well the two things are connected, because Peter Dutton knows that he sat in a Cabinet for \\nnine years and didn't release any advice to the Cabinet. It's not the way it works. And he knows that. He knows that. \\nSo what we saw from Peter Dutton, over a long period of time, was first in the lead-up to my speech at Garma, he \\nsaid, 'We don't know what the question is.' So, I released draft words. We received not a suggestion in between \\nJuly last year and yesterday when I released what will be in the legislation to go to Parliament next week. Not one \\nsuggestion from him or Julian Leeser, the Shadow Attorney-General, of any change. Not a word. And Julian Leeser, \\nwe know, has been involved with the wording since a decade ago. A decade ago. He was one of the people who \\nwere involved in that process, as Noel Pearson outlined in The Australian some weeks ago. So, Peter Dutton needs \\nto get real about this. This isn't about him, and it's not about me. This is about whether we are a better country \\ngoing forward. It's whether we can recognise Indigenous Australians in our nation's birth certificate. And then it's \\nonly about one other thing, which is will we get better outcomes if we consult the people who are impacted by those \\ndecisions? That's what this is about. It's a simple proposition before the Australian people, and I'm confident that \\nthe Australian people will vote yes. And the idea whenever any detail is given, and yesterday we released eight of \\nthe principles that will go towards the legislation in shaping the Voice. And the Voice can't be clearer, the words that \\nwill go forward include, the third point, 'The Parliament shall, subject to this constitution, have power to make laws \\nwith respect to matters relating to', which is a legal term, 'Relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, \\nincluding its composition, functions, powers and procedures'. Peter Dutton will be a part of the Parliament and \\nfuture members will be a part of future Parliaments, that will determine the function of the Voice. And he knows that \\nthat's the case. And we know from the Republic playbook that occurred last century, that it is nothing more than a \\ntactic, and it lacks genuineness to just continue to say 'We don't have the detail'. No matter how much detail is put \\nout, Peter Dutton will say, 'What about more detail?' That's the game that's being played here. And he should make \\na decision of where he stands on this issue, because this is an issue that isn't the creation of a Labor Government. \\nThis has arisen from the bottom up. And yesterday I had Ken Wyatt, who flew overnight to Canberra, the \\nIndigenous Affairs Minister in the Morrison Government, to stand next to me and with his fellow Aboriginal and \\nTorres Strait Islander people who've been a part of the Referendum Working Group, who've come to a unanimous \\nposition. And I'd say that this should be above politics as the 1967 referendum was.Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what economic benefits do you see from the Voice, and do you intend to sit down \\nwith Mr Dutton before next Thursday to discuss his concerns?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I sat down with him yesterday. I sat down with him before we did the press conference. Let's be \\nvery clear, that's the seventh time I have sat down with Peter Dutton. Peter Dutton has met with the Referendum \\nWorking Group twice. You know what? At those meetings we haven't had questions raised. He's had every \\nopportunity. There have been, I think it was Thomas Mayor yesterday, outlined the number of inquiries, details, \\ncommittees that have looked into this over more than a decade. The Uluru Statement from the Heart was in 2017. It \\ngrew out of a First Nations Constitutional Convention. It grew out of a five-year process from 2012 that began back \\nat the end of the last century. John Howard was Prime Minister when he said there needed to be constitutional \\nrecognition. Scott Morrison went to the election in 2019 and said there should be constitutional recognition. It was \\nthe Morrison Government that established the committee that Tom Calma and Marcia Langton presided over, with \\npeople like Chris Kenny and Frank Brennan and a range of people who participated and produced a report that is \\nhundreds of pages long. It went to the Cabinet of the Morrison Government, not my Government, not once, but \\ntwice. The detail is out there. The detail is out there. We need to know, as well, know this, that the programs that \\nhave been successful, that make a difference for Indigenous people, are ones in which they have been involved. \\nJustice reinvestment by the Coalition Government in New South Wales in places like Moree and Bourke, the \\nIndigenous Rangers Program, community health programs. Where people are involved, you get better outcomes. \\nAnd that is something that is just a fact, and that is why we had this coming together. Aboriginal and Torres Strait \\nIslander people are no less homogeneous than any other group that you want to pick. But what you had yesterday \\nwas people from different parts of Australia, from different parts of the country, coming together. And, you know, \\nthe great Galarrwuy Yunupingu, watching it there on Yolngu country in Arnhem Land, watching it, a product of his \\nlife's work. These people, their patience, their modesty, their humbleness, is inspirational. And they deserve, they \\ndeserve nothing less than for people to put politics aside and to get this done. And we will give the Australian \\npeople the opportunity to enlarge our country later this year. And we can be enlarged, or we can shrink. Shrink into \\nplaying old politics. And that's what people need to consider who are in positions of political leadership on this \\nissue.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you worried the wording leaves the door open for High Court challenges? Or are \\nyou confident that it's as watertight as you say it is?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I'm absolutely confident. But I'm confident on the basis of people like the former head of the \\nHigh Court, Justice French. He might know something about the Constitution. The leading academic in Australia \\non constitutional law, Professor Anne Twomey, might know something about the Constitution. This hasn't arisen in \\na vacuum. There's been all of this work done by the advisory group to the Referendum Working Group. It's very \\nclear that this is a straightforward proposition. People can read it themselves. I just read out the third clause that \\nmakes it clear that the Parliament is primary. The primacy of the Parliament is there, including its composition, \\nfunctions, powers and procedures. A key word, including. So, all matters, and it says, to matters relating to, matters \\nis often used as a legal term as well. And we took proper advice, and I'm very confident you will have an \\nopportunity. If you get ten lawyers in a room, you'll often get someone who gets a run in. That's what they're paid to \\ndo. That's why on different sides, to put this in perspective, that's why on different sides in courts, you have lawyers \\non one side and lawyers on the other side. They're paid to advocate. That's an honourable profession to do. But \\nyou shouldn't use that fact to say that there's someone out there who disagrees. Someone, I'm sure I can find you a \\nlawyer who can tell you that that jacket you're wearing is orange or pink. I can find that for you. Pay them enough, \\nthat'll happen.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just back to Aston. Do you think what's happening internally in the Liberal Party in \\nVictoria could actually work in Mary Doyle's favour in regards to Moira Deeming?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think the Liberal Party is dysfunctional here. We saw that in the lead-up to the state \\nelection. We saw that in the way that the Federal Liberal Party people here operate as well. Michael Sukkar was \\npretty desperate to stop the candidate being preselected here for Aston. He didn't have confidence that someone \\nfrom outside the area would be appropriate. I mean, we're a long way from the Melbourne City Council. And I think \\nthat that's just a fact, that it's a dysfunctional branch. They need to be given time to get their act together. In the Page 6 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nmeantime, we've got a fantastic candidate who secured the unanimous support of everyone, who ran last time, who \\nhasn't shopped around for a seat.

I'm Mary Doyle, I'm the Labor Candidate for \\nthe Aston by-election. It's really exciting to be here at Swinburne TAFE with the Prime Minister and Ministers \\nO'Connor and Aly. And thanks to everyone including the wonderful students for showing us around this morning. \\nTAFE is something I'm hugely passionate about, having been a TAFE student myself many years ago. And I can \\ntell you, when I talk to people about the Albanese Government's plans for fee-free TAFE in critical sectors, they \\noverwhelmingly tell me it's a great idea. This is a Government that I want to be a part of. One that looks at the \\npressures facing families in the outer-eastern suburbs and then goes about making a practical difference to address \\nthose challenges. Whether it's cheaper child care, which will benefit 5,700 families here in Aston. Whether it's \\ncheaper medicines, already saving Aston locals more than $250,000 since that came in. Whether it's fee-free TAFE \\nfor 55,000 Victorians. I want to be a part of the team that delivers for the outer-east. If I'm elected to be part of the \\nAlbanese Government as the next Member for Aston, I promise you this I will always fight for TAFE, I will always \\nfight for cheaper child care, and I will always fight for locals. And I'm thrilled to welcome the PM back to Wantirna.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Well, thanks very much, Mary. And I do want to thank the staff and the \\nstudents at Swinburne TAFE here for the very warm welcome that I've received here this morning, along with my \\nMinister for Skills and Training, Brendan O'Connor, and my Minister who looks after Early Childhood Learning, \\nAnne Aly. We're here to talk to students. We're here also to hear firsthand from them the difference that fee-free \\nTAFE is making to their lives. We, arising out of the Jobs and Skills Summit last year, and a commitment we made \\nat the election to 180,000 fee-free TAFE places are happening right now. And what we heard from this morning is \\nstudents who not only are benefiting from that fee-free TAFE, but they're also working and earning an income while \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nthat is happening. We've learned from them firsthand that this was part of the incentive for them to enter an area \\nwhich has skill shortages. So, it's good for students, but it's good for the economy as well. And it's good for this \\nregion, because we also heard that the early learning centres which they are partaking in now, in terms of their work \\nexperience, are all local. And Mary Doyle understands that. That's why I want Mary Doyle, next Saturday, to \\nbecome the Member for Aston. Because this community needs a voice in government. A Labor Government. A \\nLabor Government that cares about people in the outer suburbs. A Labor Government that's committed to making a \\ndifference with fee-free TAFE, to making a difference with the cheaper pharmaceuticals, but making a difference as \\nwell in child care costs for families. One of the things that is happening here from the students we spoke to, not only \\nare they benefiting from free-free TAFE, they're benefiting from working, because there are skills shortages, but \\nthey're also having the bonus of our cheaper child care plan, that comes in on July 1, will mean that more women in \\nparticular can join the workforce. This isn't a welfare policy. This is a productivity enhancing economic policy. This is \\nabout improving women's workforce participation, it's about boosting productivity and also about boosting the \\npopulation. The three Ps of economic growth are all ticked by this policy. Mary Doyle understands this. She hasn't \\nshopped around for a seat. Mary Doyle ran for this seat last year, and she's been committed to her community, \\nwhere she has lived for a long period of time, here in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. And that's why I want \\nsomeone who actually understands this community, who's committed to this community, and who will represent this \\ncommunity in the by-election on April 1. People do have an opportunity to send a message to the Opposition that \\nthey need to do better than have Peter Dutton as their Leader. Peter Dutton, who has spent year after year in \\ngovernment deriding Victorians, condemning the sacrifices that they were making during the pandemic, and \\nsomeone who said that people weren't safe to go out in Melbourne. Like, he just doesn't get this city and he doesn't \\nget this state of Victoria. Mary Doyle does. She'll be a fantastic representative, and I look forward to her joining our \\nteam after April 1 and having input into the Budget that we'll be putting together in May, which will take further \\npressure off working families in communities like this. I'll get Brendan to say something, Anne, and then we're \\nhappy to take questions.\\nBRENDAN O'CONNOR, MINISTER FOR SKILLS AND TRAINING: Thanks, Prime Minister. It's great to be with the \\nPrime Minister and, of course, with Mary and Anne, here today at this fantastic dual sector provider at Swinburne. \\nIt's fair to say that when we were elected, we comprehended the challenge we had in supplying the skills to the \\nlabour market. There were skill shortages across the economy. Wherever you looked, whatever professional trade, \\nthere were shortages. It was for that reason the Prime Minister convened the Jobs and Skills Summit, bringing \\ntogether industry, bringing together state and territory governments, and finding solutions to the problems that we \\ninherited. And I'm happy to say that the 180,000 fee-free TAFE places decision that was made at that summit was \\nan absolutely critical part of the response by the Albanese Government to the skill shortages. And we're seeing it \\nhere today, as a result of that decision and as a result of decisions by the Albanese Government with eight separate \\ngovernments, eight state and territory governments, to have agreements in each jurisdiction, we can focus on the \\neconomies of each state and territory. And that's what we've done. 55,000 fee-free places in Victoria, and then a \\nlarge proportion of those, for example, in early childhood education, where there's a massive demand. 40 per cent \\nof the advertisements for those jobs are in Victoria.

And \\nthat's why Chris Minns deserves and his team deserves to be elected to government tomorrow. I'll work with \\nwhoever is elected it, as I do constructively. I've had liaison with Premier Rockliff this morning. My Government \\nactually works for solutions. We look for unity. We don't look for division. The problem with the modern Liberal Party \\nis that it is so divided on itself. On itself. I mean, they can't make a decision on constitutional recognition for \\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in 2023. If they oppose it, they've got to say. When will that occur? How \\nlong? Is 122 years not long enough to wait to recognise that our history didn't begin in 1788? The Victorian Liberal \\nParty here are a shambles. We've seen them fighting each other. And the Caucus can't make a decision in \\nCanberra, in Peter Dutton. That's why we need to send a message to them that they need to do better. They need \\nto get their act together. That's why Mary Doyle deserves to be elected as the Member for Aston. If she joins our \\nCaucus, she'll join a united, coherent team. A united, coherent team that has plans for our economic growth, that \\nhas plans for social equity, that has plans for gender equality, that has plans for dealing with the challenge of \\nclimate change, that supports multiculturalism, that doesn't have to think about these things because it's in our core. \\nIt's our instinct. And that is what Mary Doyle, that's the team that she will join if she's elected.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Linda Burney that Peter Dutton is just looking for excuses to reject the Voice? \\nAnd secondly, will you release the Solicitor-General's advice on the wording?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well the two things are connected, because Peter Dutton knows that he sat in a Cabinet for \\nnine years and didn't release any advice to the Cabinet. It's not the way it works. And he knows that. He knows that. \\nSo what we saw from Peter Dutton, over a long period of time, was first in the lead-up to my speech at Garma, he \\nsaid, 'We don't know what the question is.' So, I released draft words. We received not a suggestion in between \\nJuly last year and yesterday when I released what will be in the legislation to go to Parliament next week. Not one \\nsuggestion from him or Julian Leeser, the Shadow Attorney-General, of any change. Not a word. And Julian Leeser, \\nwe know, has been involved with the wording since a decade ago. A decade ago. He was one of the people who \\nwere involved in that process, as Noel Pearson outlined in The Australian some weeks ago. So, Peter Dutton needs \\nto get real about this. This isn't about him, and it's not about me. This is about whether we are a better country \\ngoing forward. It's whether we can recognise Indigenous Australians in our nation's birth certificate. And then it's \\nonly about one other thing, which is will we get better outcomes if we consult the people who are impacted by those \\ndecisions? That's what this is about. It's a simple proposition before the Australian people, and I'm confident that \\nthe Australian people will vote yes. And the idea whenever any detail is given, and yesterday we released eight of \\nthe principles that will go towards the legislation in shaping the Voice. And the Voice can't be clearer, the words that \\nwill go forward include, the third point, 'The Parliament shall, subject to this constitution, have power to make laws \\nwith respect to matters relating to', which is a legal term, 'Relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, \\nincluding its composition, functions, powers and procedures'. Peter Dutton will be a part of the Parliament and \\nfuture members will be a part of future Parliaments, that will determine the function of the Voice. And he knows that \\nthat's the case. And we know from the Republic playbook that occurred last century, that it is nothing more than a \\ntactic, and it lacks genuineness to just continue to say 'We don't have the detail'. No matter how much detail is put \\nout, Peter Dutton will say, 'What about more detail?' That's the game that's being played here. And he should make \\na decision of where he stands on this issue, because this is an issue that isn't the creation of a Labor Government. \\nThis has arisen from the bottom up. And yesterday I had Ken Wyatt, who flew overnight to Canberra, the \\nIndigenous Affairs Minister in the Morrison Government, to stand next to me and with his fellow Aboriginal and \\nTorres Strait Islander people who've been a part of the Referendum Working Group, who've come to a unanimous \\nposition. And I'd say that this should be above politics as the 1967 referendum was.Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what economic benefits do you see from the Voice, and do you intend to sit down \\nwith Mr Dutton before next Thursday to discuss his concerns?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I sat down with him yesterday. I sat down with him before we did the press conference. Let's be \\nvery clear, that's the seventh time I have sat down with Peter Dutton. Peter Dutton has met with the Referendum \\nWorking Group twice. You know what? At those meetings we haven't had questions raised. He's had every \\nopportunity. There have been, I think it was Thomas Mayor yesterday, outlined the number of inquiries, details, \\ncommittees that have looked into this over more than a decade. The Uluru Statement from the Heart was in 2017. It \\ngrew out of a First Nations Constitutional Convention. It grew out of a five-year process from 2012 that began back \\nat the end of the last century. John Howard was Prime Minister when he said there needed to be constitutional \\nrecognition. Scott Morrison went to the election in 2019 and said there should be constitutional recognition. It was \\nthe Morrison Government that established the committee that Tom Calma and Marcia Langton presided over, with \\npeople like Chris Kenny and Frank Brennan and a range of people who participated and produced a report that is \\nhundreds of pages long. It went to the Cabinet of the Morrison Government, not my Government, not once, but \\ntwice. The detail is out there. The detail is out there. We need to know, as well, know this, that the programs that \\nhave been successful, that make a difference for Indigenous people, are ones in which they have been involved. \\nJustice reinvestment by the Coalition Government in New South Wales in places like Moree and Bourke, the \\nIndigenous Rangers Program, community health programs. Where people are involved, you get better outcomes. \\nAnd that is something that is just a fact, and that is why we had this coming together. Aboriginal and Torres Strait \\nIslander people are no less homogeneous than any other group that you want to pick. But what you had yesterday \\nwas people from different parts of Australia, from different parts of the country, coming together. And, you know, \\nthe great Galarrwuy Yunupingu, watching it there on Yolngu country in Arnhem Land, watching it, a product of his \\nlife's work. These people, their patience, their modesty, their humbleness, is inspirational. And they deserve, they \\ndeserve nothing less than for people to put politics aside and to get this done. And we will give the Australian \\npeople the opportunity to enlarge our country later this year. And we can be enlarged, or we can shrink. Shrink into \\nplaying old politics. And that's what people need to consider who are in positions of political leadership on this \\nissue.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you worried the wording leaves the door open for High Court challenges? Or are \\nyou confident that it's as watertight as you say it is?\\nPRIME MINISTER: I'm absolutely confident. But I'm confident on the basis of people like the former head of the \\nHigh Court, Justice French. He might know something about the Constitution. The leading academic in Australia \\non constitutional law, Professor Anne Twomey, might know something about the Constitution. This hasn't arisen in \\na vacuum. There's been all of this work done by the advisory group to the Referendum Working Group. It's very \\nclear that this is a straightforward proposition. People can read it themselves. I just read out the third clause that \\nmakes it clear that the Parliament is primary. The primacy of the Parliament is there, including its composition, \\nfunctions, powers and procedures. A key word, including. So, all matters, and it says, to matters relating to, matters \\nis often used as a legal term as well. And we took proper advice, and I'm very confident you will have an \\nopportunity. If you get ten lawyers in a room, you'll often get someone who gets a run in. That's what they're paid to \\ndo. That's why on different sides, to put this in perspective, that's why on different sides in courts, you have lawyers \\non one side and lawyers on the other side. They're paid to advocate. That's an honourable profession to do. But \\nyou shouldn't use that fact to say that there's someone out there who disagrees. Someone, I'm sure I can find you a \\nlawyer who can tell you that that jacket you're wearing is orange or pink. I can find that for you. Pay them enough, \\nthat'll happen.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just back to Aston. Do you think what's happening internally in the Liberal Party in \\nVictoria could actually work in Mary Doyle's favour in regards to Moira Deeming?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think the Liberal Party is dysfunctional here. We saw that in the lead-up to the state \\nelection. We saw that in the way that the Federal Liberal Party people here operate as well. Michael Sukkar was \\npretty desperate to stop the candidate being preselected here for Aston. He didn't have confidence that someone \\nfrom outside the area would be appropriate. I mean, we're a long way from the Melbourne City Council. And I think \\nthat that's just a fact, that it's a dysfunctional branch. They need to be given time to get their act together. In the Page 6 of 6\\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\\nmeantime, we've got a fantastic candidate who secured the unanimous support of everyone, who ran last time, who \\nhasn't shopped around for a seat.

They deserve decent wages and conditions.\\nKathleen Ferguson: Under the deal, workers will get 10% by this Christmas and a further 5% by December next \\nyear. It equates to around an extra $100 a week and will cost $3.6 billion. Karen Moran is a long-time educator.\\nKaren Moran: This decision today will change people's lives. It means that early childhood educators who've been \\nrelying on Food Bank to feed their own families won't have to do that anymore. And those that work two and three \\njobs just to make ends meet will be able to spend more time with their families.\\nPage 2 of 2\\nBig pay increase for early childcare workers\\nKathleen Ferguson: But the deal is conditional. In order to receive the pay bump, childcare centres will have to \\nlimit their fee increases to 4.4% during the next 12 months.

Georgie Dent is the \\nCEO of advocacy group The Parenthood.\\nGeorgie Dent: This is a long overdue recognition of the incredible contribution that early childhood educators make \\nto our children, to our communities, to families. It is such a fantastic achievement.\\nKathleen Ferguson: Georgie Dent says this pay increase is desperately needed to combat a worker shortage in \\nthe sector, which is mostly made up of women.\\nGeorgie Dent: The sector is overjoyed. This has been a long-realised dream. We have known that early childhood \\neducators have been chronically underpaid and undervalued. We have seen in recent years the accelerating exit of \\nearly educators from the sector, which has put incredible pressure on services.\\nKathleen Ferguson: This is an interim measure which will be in place for two years while the federal government \\nreviews the sector. The federal education minister, Jason Clare, says it will be up to childcare centres and providers \\nto sign on to the scheme. And he says if centres don't sign up, they should be prepared to lose staff to competitors.\\nJason Clare: This is a cost-of-living win-win. It's good for workers and it's good for parents.

And we'll look at the detail of this proposal that Labor's putting forward. If it can raise real wages for Australians, \\nof course we're going to support it. That's our position.\\nKathleen Ferguson: The United Workers Union says the increase sends a strong message to women. Jo \\nSchofield is the union's national president.\\nJo Schofield: Just this week, we did a survey that showed 60% of educators wanted to leave within three years. \\n97% of centres have seen educators walk out in the last year, and the single factor in that is the low pay.\\nKathleen Ferguson: She says while the union will continue advocating for better pay and conditions, this is a good \\nstart.\\nStephanie Smail: Kathleen Ferguson reporting.\\nLoad-Date: August 8, 2024\\nEnd of Document\", 'Page 1 of 2\\nPower to go on strike will be \\'crucial\\' for childcare workers: minister\\nPower to go on strike will be \\'crucial\\' for childcare workers: minister\\nThe Age (Melbourne, Australia) - Online\\nNovember 5, 2022 Saturday 6:00 PM UTC\\nCopyright 2022 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Minister for Early Childhood Education and Youth, Dr Anne Aly, will travel to Amman, Jordan on \\nbehalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to attend an international conference convened by Egypt, Jordan and the \\nUnited Nations on the urgent humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\\nAustralia has been advocating for urgent humanitarian assistance to reach Palestinians in Gaza in desperate \\nneed. We have been clear that Israel must comply with the binding orders of the International Court of Justice, \\nincluding to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance at scale.\\nSince the conflict began on 7 October, Australia has committed $62.5 million in humanitarian assistance to the \\nregion, including $41 million to address urgent needs in Gaza. Our funding is being directed to conflict-affected \\npeople with a focus on women and children, including to support food, water, medicines, and shelter.\\nThe conference, known as International Call to Action: Urgent Humanitarian Response for Gaza, will be held on 11 \\nJune local time.\\nQuotes attributable to Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon Penny Wong:\\n\"This war must end. The human suffering in Gaza is unacceptable. Australia has been part of the international \\npush for a ceasefire, for humanitarian aid to reach Gazans in desperate need, and for hostages to be released. \\nAustralia\\'s participation in this conference is part of that international effort.\\n\"Dr Anne Aly and her family are among many in the Australian community who have lived experience and \\nunderstanding of the long and devastating conflict in the Middle East. We are fortunate that Dr Aly will bring her \\ndeep professional expertise and her perspectives as an Egyptian-born Australian in representing our country at this \\nconference hosted by Egypt, Jordan and the UN.\"\\nQuotes attributable to Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth, the Hon Dr Anne Aly MP:\\nPage 2 of 2\\nDR ANNE ALY TO REPRESENT AUSTRALIA AT GAZA HUMANITARIAN CONFERENCE\\n\"The humanitarian situation in Gaza is catastrophic.

I'm Tania Lawrence, the Member for Hasluck. And it gives me great pleasure to be \\ntoday joined with the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Premier Roger Cook, my state parliamentary colleagues, \\nthe teachers, the trainers and students of North Metro TAFE. When we, even before the election in 2022, we knew \\nwe had a skills and labour shortage. So, one of the very first actions that the Albanese Labor Government took, was \\nto host a summit of unions, businesses, experts, economists, trainers from around the country to identify and \\narticulate the problem and work a pathway to solving it. I also hosted a roundtable here in Perth, with industry \\nleaders, TAFE institutions and with unions. And together, culminating now in this landmark agreement to really fund \\nthe institutions and vocational education training, with TAFE. And we all know, many of us here know, just how \\ncentral it is to having TAFE as the base for education. I myself, as a graduate of TAFE, my staff have done \\napprenticeships as well, and it really does create the careers and pathway opportunities, that have benefited the \\nnation. So with this, I'd love to hand over now to the Prime Minister.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA: Well, thanks very much, Tania, and it's great to be \\nback in the electorate of Hasluck. And it's terrific also to be here with our state parliamentary colleagues, led by \\nPremier Roger Cook, and the Training Minister Simone McGurk, but also Michelle Roberts, the local member here. \\nI am so excited to be in WA this weekend, because of course, it's Telethon Weekend. And you can feel a real uplift \\nhere, as WA does something that other states used to do, but don't do any more, unite in a common interest to \\nraise money to assist sick kids and their family. So, a big shout out at the beginning of this weekend, to all of those \\ninvolved in Telethon and an encouragement to dig deep over this weekend, to make sure that those young \\nAustralians who are so inspirational, who I look forward to meeting their ambassadors later today, and again to talk \\nto people tomorrow about the remarkable example that they show in their resilience, in their positivity, under \\ncircumstances which can be very difficult. But today, we are here at this wonderful TAFE institution to celebrate and \\nto mark the first National Skills Agreement since 2012. Throughout the entire period of my predecessors, there was \\nnot only no National Skills Agreement, there weren't skills agreements between indeed any individual jurisdiction \\nand the Commonwealth. Well, my Government is different. I went to an election saying that we would prioritise \\nTAFE at the center of the vocational education and training system and that we would value skills. The first \\nannouncement that I made as Labor Leader, was back here in Perth in 2019, where I announced the creation of \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nJobs and Skills Australia, a body to identify what the labour market needs were for Australian business going \\nforward, not just over a one year period, but five years, 10 years time. To make sure that our education and training \\nsystem was fit for purpose. To make sure, as well, that we didn't just rely upon temporary labour, bringing people in \\nand then sending them out, and bringing in other people to do the same job. That when we identify an area of skill \\nshortage, we actually have a strategy to tackle it. And that means firstly, training Australians for those jobs. We \\nneed also, of course, to have, migration will continue to play a role. But training Australians up, whether it be for \\ntheir first job or retraining. And it was fantastic to meet some of the students who are here, some of them new in \\ntheir first task that they're looking at doing but others looking at retraining, as well, for the jobs of the future, with the \\nconcentration that this TAFE will have on the renewable sector, which will require different skills. And that's why this \\n$12 billion program that we have put in place over a five year period, with $1.2 billion directly for Western Australia, \\nwill make an enormous difference going forward, over the next five years. And I pay tribute to all of the State and \\nTerritory Governments. A lot of work has gone into this, in the lead up to the National Cabinet meeting that we held \\non Monday, but all of the Premiers and Chief Ministers are very excited about the prospects of going forward. And \\nan example of the way that my Government is working cooperatively with State Governments. Not picking fights \\nwith them, not choosing to back Clive Palmer rather than the local State Government, but choosing instead to back \\nWestern Australians to deliver. Back in this most magnificent of economies, that has been so central to Australia's \\nemployment growth, to continue to be a powerhouse of the national economy. This week we had the labour market \\nfigures, showed an unemployment rate of 3.6 per cent. There have been 19 occasions since records began, where \\nunemployment has had a three in front of it and 16 of the of them have been under my Labor Government, since \\nwere elected last May. Now, we will continue to prioritise the creation of jobs, we will continue to prioritise lifting \\nwages and we will continue to prioritise giving people the skills, so they can fill those good, secure jobs. Now, the \\nFee-Free TAFE is already making an enormous difference. We committed to 180,000 Fee-Free TAFE places this \\nyear. We've delivered at least but still growing, 215,000. Here in WA, there were going to be 18,000 places, we've \\nalmost doubled that figure. WA was very quick off the mark in making a difference. And here at this TAFE, just one \\nexample of the difference that it has made, before Fee-Free TAFE this course in electronics used to cost $3,700. It \\nattracted about seven students each term. Fee-Free TAFE means that now the course has 85 students enrolled, \\nseven to 85. A practical example of how our commitment to Fee-Free TAFE, making a difference, working with \\nState Governments is making a difference to the economy. But importantly as well, making a difference to people's \\nlives by training them up and giving them the skills that they need for secure work into the future. So, I want to also \\nconclude by just giving a shout out to those people who are doing the training. A lot of people, when I've been to \\nTAFEs over the years, people who've already made a massive contribution through the skills and work that they've \\ndone, towards the end of their careers or sometimes after they're formally retired, go and impart those skills to the \\nnext generation coming through. And that's a really important thing about TAFE that we see and I thank those who \\nare doing that. And this course at this wonderful TAFE, I just think this is a really practical announcement and a \\npractical example of how my Government is getting on with dealing with cost of living pressures, dealing with the \\nchallenges which are in the economy and setting us up for a prosperous future. We're going to hear from the \\nPremier and then the WA Training Minister, Simone. And then we'll take questions.\\nROGER COOK, PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA: Thanks very much, Anthony. It's great to have the Prime \\nMinister back here in Western Australia and here in Midland at North Metropolitan TAFE, one of the centres that \\nwill be designed to train all the people we need for our renewable energy transition. So, it's terrific to be here to \\ncelebrate Fee-Free TAFE courses. I'm joined by Minister McGurk, I want to thank her for her leadership in the \\ntraining field, but also acknowledge Tania Lawrence the Member for Hasluck. And of course, the great local \\nMember for Midland, Michelle Roberts. This is an outstanding outcome for Western Australia. In 2023, 36,000 \\nWestern Australians took advantage of our Fee-Free courses, over and above the anticipated 180,000. And so \\nnow, we've got more in 24. And we're really looking forward to extending the Fee-Free TAFE courses under the \\nNational Skills Agreement. Now, my Government always fights for the best deal for Western Australians and the \\nNational Skills Agreement is an outstanding outcome for training Western Australians, not only for the jobs of today, \\nbut for the jobs of the future. It enables us to properly target our resources to those qualifications that we know are \\ngoing to be so vital for the ongoing prosperity of our economy. And it also provides us with an opportunity to target \\ncohorts that we want to see get into the courses, that are so valuable. People from disadvantaged backgrounds, \\ngender diversity in these courses. And so, this is an outstanding outcome. I was very proud to be at the National \\nCabinet meeting earlier in the week, where all the Premiers and Chief Ministers were able to sign off on the Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nNational Skills Agreement. It's a great sign of a Commonwealth Government, which is taking the lead to make sure \\nour economy has the workforce that we need to continue to prosper. This is also in addition to my Government's \\n$246 million redevelopment of our TAFE campuses, almost a quarter of a billion dollars around designing and \\nmaking sure that our TAFE campuses are fit for purpose, to continue to provide great job opportunities for those \\nskills that we'll need today, but to continue to make sure that we have the job opportunities for skills into the future. \\nSo, for instance, here at North Metropolitan TAFE, we'll be providing skills opportunities for those people looking to \\ntransition into the renewable energies future. We'll have a wind turbine here in the very near future, to provide skills \\nfor those people to be able to practice, not only working on wind turbines, but also working at height. So, you can \\nsee how these strategic investments are so important to providing people with jobs. And that's what my \\nGovernment's priority is, is to make sure that Western Australians get the jobs that they deserve. And our \\nunemployment rate figures, which were released yesterday, 3.3 per cent is an outstanding outcome for the Western \\nAustralian economy, and we want to do more. We want to continue to make sure that we provide opportunities for \\nWestern Australians to get rewarding jobs, in great industries, that are forward looking into the future. So, thank you \\nvery much to the Commonwealth Government. Congratulations to Minister McGurk for the National Skills \\nAgreement. This is a great day for Western Australian jobs and training, and very much looking forward to seeing \\nmore success in the Fee-Free TAFE courses into the future.\\nSIMONE MCGURK, WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR TRAINING: Thank you Premier and thank you \\nPrime Minister for being here, as well as Tania Lawrence and Michelle Roberts. I just wanted to acknowledge what \\nwe're able to achieve when we work in cooperation with the Federal Government and the State Government, both \\nbeing so committed in Western Australia to making sure that Western Australians are skilled to do the jobs that we \\nknow are out there and we know are coming. And this five year Skills Agreement, which will deliver $1.3 billion to \\nWestern Australia, $1.3 billion, and that would be $380 million more than we've had in previous, than previous \\nfunding arrangements with the Federal Government. But importantly, we have some certainty of funding for five \\nyears. And working together with a Commonwealth Government to understand what our priority areas are, for the \\njobs that we know are here now and the jobs that we know are coming at us. And to be here at North Metropolitan \\nTAFE here in Midland, where we're able to meet students who are taking advantage of significant Fee-Free \\ncourses, making significant savings. And as the Prime Minister said, we've met a couple of students who are \\nmature age and are coming back and taking the opportunity to upskill, but also young students who can see the \\nopportunities that are here. These are electronic students and you can tell, there's real buzz in the room. They've \\nreally taken advantage of what we're able to deliver with Fee-Free and I would just like to repeat my \\nacknowledgement of the cooperation that we're able to achieve with the Federal Government, when we work \\ntogether. And for the Federal Government, under Prime Minister Albanese and the Skills Minister Brendan \\nO'Connor, understanding that Western Australia has some real pressures and that we need to all work together to \\nput our shoulder to the wheel, to meet the skills demands that are with us today.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Simone. Happy to have questions, on this firstly. This is a really important \\nannouncement and I'm sure you have some other things you want to talk about.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Ed Husic and Anne Aly, who've accused Israel of collectively punishing \\nPalestinians? And if it's not collective punishment, what is it?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Ed Husic, Anne Aly and my entire team voted for a resolution in the Parliament and indeed Ed \\nand Anne spoke about it. That resolution was really important, it unequivocally condemned Hamas for the atrocities \\nthat it committed as a terrorist organisation, with its invasion of Israel. And with the atrocities that were committed, \\nincluding to young people who were attending a music festival, we had people kidnapped and taken from their \\nfamilies. Israel has a right to defend itself. We also acknowledged in that resolution, importantly, that the lives of \\ninnocent civilians needed to be protected. Every loss of an innocent life matters, whether they are Israeli or \\nPalestinian. And I do note the comments of President Biden today. This is what President Biden has had to say, \\n'The US remains committed to the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self determination. We mourn every \\ninnocent life lost. We can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians, who only want to live in peace.' And I \\napplaud the efforts of President Biden, to work with nations in the region to make sure that Gaza will be able to \\nhave access to food, water and medicine. President Biden went on to say, 'We cannot give up on peace and we \\ncannot give up on a two state solution.' And his comments are appropriate, I completely agree with them, and I Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nstand by, as does every Member of the Labor Party, the resolution that was adopted overwhelmingly in the \\nParliament, in the House of Representatives and the same resolution in the Senate just this week.\\nJOURNALIST: We learned just this morning that a 16 year old Aboriginal boy has become first death in custody in \\nWA in the last 50 years. The Voice was your key measure to avoid these sorts of outcomes. With that having failed, \\nwhat's next?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, firstly, can I say that this news is a terrible tragedy and I give my condolences to the family \\nand friends of this young person who has died. And there will now be, of course, a coronial inquiry and so on those \\nspecifics, it is not appropriate, therefore, to comment further. My Government is determined to Close the Gap with \\nIndigenous Australians. We answered the invitation of indigenous Australians to give constitutional recognition in \\nthe form which was requested, which was through a constitutionally enshrined Voice to Parliament. Australians did \\nnot vote for that. Our constitution is difficult to change. We're now on eight out of 45, and it is though the case that \\nIndigenous communities in remote Northern Territory, in places in the Kimberley, in Lockhart River and Palm Island \\nand the Tiwis and other communities, overwhelmingly did vote Yes in this referendum. And that will be a difficult \\ntime, it is a difficult time for Indigenous Australians. But we respect the outcome in our democracy and I have done \\nthat. What we will continue to do, we'll continue to work on Closing the Gap though. The National Skills Agreement \\nis an example, we have over $200 million of that agreement, is set aside for First Nation skills uplift. We want to \\nmake sure that there are more Indigenous apprentices, that there are more Indigenous trainees, that workforces are \\nable to benefit from skilling up Indigenous Australians. I know that many of the companies that were out there \\nsupporting the Voice, are those that have done a lot in terms of reconciliation action plans, in Indigenous \\napprenticeships, and here in Western Australia, of course, has led that quite often, and that's a good thing. But the \\nfact that we have this specific program is an indication that I believe whilst Australians did not vote in favour of the \\nreferendum, Australians do want to see the gap closed. They do want to see disadvantage dealt with, that is, in \\nIndigenous communities. And we'll continue to work in this area, but in health, in life expectancy, in community \\nservices, in all of these areas, with the programs that we have. But also consult with Indigenous communities, \\nbecause one of the things that I do know, and here in Western Australia of all places, is the case. I've been coming \\nhere for a long period of time. I've been here, I think, now 17 times as Prime Minister, that's more than one a month, \\nand it's certainly more than what I committed to, of ten visits a year. Because if you want to find out what's \\nhappening on the ground, here in Western Australia, I think West Australians understand this. They don't want \\ndecisions to just be made in Canberra. They want people to come, to talk to people on the ground, to get those \\nresults. Now, that's a principle that doesn't just apply in Indigenous affairs, it's one that applies across the board. It's \\none that my Government will continue to do, which is why I've engaged so strongly with the Premier, Roger Cook, \\nand why I engaged so strongly as well with his predecessor, Mark McGowan.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you have been coming here for a long time before you were Prime Minister and as \\nPrime Minister, as well. Did you expect such a strong No vote in this state?\\nPRIME MINISTER: People saw what polling was saying, we were determined, though. You had a call in 2017. \\nYou'll note that I was coming here in 2017, but I wasn't the Prime Minister. Nor was I the Prime Minister who \\nestablished a process, which asked Indigenous Australians to deliberate on what form constitutional recognition \\nshould take. That process, we had John Howard way back in, we had a vote on the Preamble, which had a similar \\noutcome, last century. We then had John Howard go to an election in 2007, we then had Tony Abbott and then \\nMalcolm Turnbull establish a process. That process came up with the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017. You \\nhad Ken Wyatt appointed as the Minister for Indigenous Australians and go to Garma in 2019. I was there when he \\nput forward the idea that there would be a referendum. That was the policy that Scott Morrison was elected on in \\n2019. It never happened. It never happened. I'm a Prime Minister who will promise to do things and then go and do \\nthem. I think that's how you restore faith in politics. That is something that we need to do. I launched my campaign \\nhere at the stadium and I promised on multiple occasions, that we would do this. And we gave Australians their say, \\nbut we respect the outcome that was given.\\nJOURNALIST: How concerned are you about the unlawful use of solitary confinement in our detention centre, that \\ncan see Indigenous kids held in their cell for 23 hours? Including the one -Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: I have no intention of commenting on, from Canberra, about the specifics of what occurs in \\nevery centre in Australia\\nJOURNALIST: But, if we're trying to Close the Gap\\nPRIME MINISTER: It's a question of the State. I'm not going to pretend, on a serious issue when it comes to \\nIndigenous Australians, that I am somehow an expert on every issue. That's the whole point that I'm making here, is \\nthat you need to get local engagement and local input on matters.\\nJOURNALIST: What do you make of the Opposition Leader's claims yesterday, urging you to fly to Washington via \\nTel Aviv, in the final moments of Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think that quite clearly, the conflict in the Middle East is a complex one. It's one that has \\ngone on for a considerable period of time. The responsibility for what is happening now rests firmly with Hamas and \\nthe actions that they have taken. But there are, of course, longer term issues which President Biden has indicated \\nthis morning again, has given people a reminder, that they are issues that need to be addressed. And I \\nacknowledge the suffering of Israeli, as well as Palestinian citizens, who are innocent, who just want to live a life in \\nsecurity and with justice, as the resolution carried by the Parliament said, going forward. I also acknowledge that \\nleaders have a responsibility at this time to make sure that there is, whilst there is some concern in the community \\nand hurt being felt for people who have relatives and friends in the Middle East, whether they be Israeli or \\nPalestinian, this is a very difficult time for the community. So, individuals and particularly people, I draw your \\nattention to the comments of the Director General of ASIO, Mike Burgess, who's spoken about the need to be \\nresponsible in comments and to be careful about language which is used at this time. We have a harmonious \\ncommunity here in Australia, I want to see that continue. There's no place here in Australia for anti-Semitism. \\nThere is also no place here in Australia for Islamophobia. The Leader of the Opposition chose to do that, that's a \\nmatter for him. I have scheduled a visit, that has been longstanding with President Biden, where the logistics of \\norganising that for Sunday, is when we will depart from Canberra. The leaders who have visited, and I note this, the \\nleaders who have visited are members of the P5, the Permanent Members of the Security Council. The United \\nStates has a particular role in that, as does the United Kingdom, as does the other people who have visited there. \\nAnd President Biden's visit produced outcomes of negotiating through with different states, but also was \\naccompanied by a considerable security effort for President Biden. This is not a secure area. Our priority has been \\nto engage and I've engaged, I've met personally with the Israeli Ambassador. I had him to my residence and had a \\ndiscussion. I've had discussions with leaders of the Palestinian community, leaders of the Jewish community here \\nin Australia, as well. The decision of the Leader of the Opposition to raise such an issue publicly, that's a matter for \\nhim. But at this point in time, I have no plans to visit the Middle East, and in terms of the security agencies as well, \\nthere's no disagreement from the position that I've taken.\\nJOURNALIST: From Joe Biden's speech, what are your thoughts, more specifically on these comments, that if we \\nwalk away and let Putin erase Ukraine's independence, would be aggressors, would be emboldened to try and do \\nthe same possibly in the Pacific and the Middle East more broadly?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, we're there with the people of Ukraine because the actions of Vladimir Putin, of invading, \\nillegally the sovereign state of Ukraine, is an attack on the international rule of law and on respect for national \\nboundaries and national sovereignty. That's why Australia has been a significant contributor to the struggle in \\nUkraine. And that's why we've provided support, including providing comfort and refuge for people fleeing Ukraine. \\nSimilarly, our priority hasn't been to get people into the Middle East, it's been to get people out of the Middle East. \\nAustralian citizens, is what we've been concentrating on, rather than having a whole contingent go into an area \\nwhich is clearly very volatile, to say the least. It's a state of war, is going on. The people of Ukraine are showing \\nextraordinary courage, extraordinary courage, and I support President Biden's call to continue to engage, to show \\nresolve. Australia will continue to be a part of the support for the people of Ukraine, for as long as it is required, \\nbecause this isn't just a struggle about what occurs in Ukraine.

she said.\\n\"It\\'s an absolute slap in the face, they make no effort to address educator shortages unless they address wages.\\n\"Everything they do is completely tokenistic and as a workforce we know that.\"\\nThe budget committed an extra $9 billion to the sector, bringing the total spend on childcare to $55.3 billion in the \\nnext four years.\\nIt also included $724 million across five years to support training for educators and the care sector with more than \\n80,000 early childhood educators expected to benefit.\\nAlong with educators, the budget focused on making childcare more accessible and affordable for families, with \\nabout 1.2 million to benefit from July.\\nSt Nicholas executive director David Healy said he welcomed the increased training measures but said more \\nneeded to be done to retain the workforce.\\n\"To be frank it\\'s a national-level issue and this is chicken feed being thrown at it, it looks attractive but realistically \\nit\\'s going to take years for those shortages to resolve themselves,\" he said.\\nMr Healy said their centres operate up to 50 weeks a year and the concern is that the sector is losing skilled, \\nqualified workers to teaching which offers longer breaks, shorter hours and better pay.\\nHe said he can\\'t run his centres at full capacity because of staffing shortages, and said that although it was great to \\nsee subsidies for parents to assist them with childcare the issue is having enough staff to offer them a place.\\n\"It\\'s hard to say what\\'s not attracting people to the sector, certainly having further support to drive and encourage \\nopportunities for people in the educator workforce who want to upskill will ultimately increase the number of degree-\\nqualified early childhood teachers and that is welcome,\" he said.\\n\"On a national level the funding appears attractive on the face of it, but if you break it down to the shortages being \\nexperienced I\\'m not confident it does go far enough.\"\\nUnited Workers Union early education director Helen Gibbons said educators are passionate about providing \\nquality learning to children and professional development that supports their practice is a \"must\".\\n\"Better access to training and development will improve centres\\' ability to attract and retain educators, but it\\'s not \\nenough alone,\" she said.\\n\"To properly response to the massive workforce crisis in early learning, the federal government must follow through \\nand play its role in improving wages.\\n\"The only way to keep educators from leaving the sector at current crisis levels is by paying them a wage that \\nrespects their vital contribution to our society.\"\\nThe union is calling on the federal government to fund a 25 per cent pay rise for

words\\nByline: States News Service\\nDateline: CANBERRA, Australia \\nBody\\nThe following information was released by the office of the Prime Minister of Australia:\\nTANIA LAWRENCE MP, MEMBER FOR HASLUCK: Good morning and welcome to North Metropolitan TAFE in \\nMidland, in the seat of Hasluck. I'm Tania Lawrence, the Member for Hasluck. And it gives me great pleasure to be \\ntoday joined with the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Premier Roger Cook, my state parliamentary colleagues, \\nthe teachers, the trainers and students of North Metro TAFE. When we, even before the election in 2022, we knew \\nwe had a skills and labour shortage. So, one of the very first actions that the Albanese Labor Government took, was \\nto host a summit of unions, businesses, experts, economists, trainers from around the country to identify and \\narticulate the problem and work a pathway to solving it. I also hosted a roundtable here in Perth, with industry \\nleaders, TAFE institutions and with unions. And together, culminating now in this landmark agreement to really fund \\nthe institutions and vocational education training, with TAFE. And we all know, many of us here know, just how \\ncentral it is to having TAFE as the base for education. I myself, as a graduate of TAFE, my staff have done \\napprenticeships as well, and it really does create the careers and pathway opportunities, that have benefited the \\nnation. So with this, I'd love to hand over now to the Prime Minister.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA: Well, thanks very much, Tania, and it's great to be \\nback in the electorate of Hasluck. And it's terrific also to be here with our state parliamentary colleagues, led by \\nPremier Roger Cook, and the Training Minister Simone McGurk, but also Michelle Roberts, the local member here. \\nI am so excited to be in WA this weekend, because of course, it's Telethon Weekend. And you can feel a real uplift \\nhere, as WA does something that other states used to do, but don't do any more, unite in a common interest to \\nraise money to assist sick kids and their family. So, a big shout out at the beginning of this weekend, to all of those \\ninvolved in Telethon and an encouragement to dig deep over this weekend, to make sure that those young \\nAustralians who are so inspirational, who I look forward to meeting their ambassadors later today, and again to talk \\nto people tomorrow about the remarkable example that they show in their resilience, in their positivity, under \\ncircumstances which can be very difficult. But today, we are here at this wonderful TAFE institution to celebrate and \\nto mark the first National Skills Agreement since 2012. Throughout the entire period of my predecessors, there was \\nnot only no National Skills Agreement, there weren't skills agreements between indeed any individual jurisdiction \\nand the Commonwealth. Well, my Government is different. I went to an election saying that we would prioritise \\nTAFE at the center of the vocational education and training system and that we would value skills. The first \\nannouncement that I made as Labor Leader, was back here in Perth in 2019, where I announced the creation of \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nJobs and Skills Australia, a body to identify what the labour market needs were for Australian business going \\nforward, not just over a one year period, but five years, 10 years time. To make sure that our education and training \\nsystem was fit for purpose. To make sure, as well, that we didn't just rely upon temporary labour, bringing people in \\nand then sending them out, and bringing in other people to do the same job. That when we identify an area of skill \\nshortage, we actually have a strategy to tackle it. And that means firstly, training Australians for those jobs. We \\nneed also, of course, to have, migration will continue to play a role. But training Australians up, whether it be for \\ntheir first job or retraining. And it was fantastic to meet some of the students who are here, some of them new in \\ntheir first task that they're looking at doing but others looking at retraining, as well, for the jobs of the future, with the \\nconcentration that this TAFE will have on the renewable sector, which will require different skills. And that's why this \\n$12 billion program that we have put in place over a five year period, with $1.2 billion directly for Western Australia, \\nwill make an enormous difference going forward, over the next five years. And I pay tribute to all of the State and \\nTerritory Governments. A lot of work has gone into this, in the lead up to the National Cabinet meeting that we held \\non Monday, but all of the Premiers and Chief Ministers are very excited about the prospects of going forward. And \\nan example of the way that my Government is working cooperatively with State Governments. Not picking fights \\nwith them, not choosing to back Clive Palmer rather than the local State Government, but choosing instead to back \\nWestern Australians to deliver. Back in this most magnificent of economies, that has been so central to Australia's \\nemployment growth, to continue to be a powerhouse of the national economy. This week we had the labour market \\nfigures, showed an unemployment rate of 3.6 per cent. There have been 19 occasions since records began, where \\nunemployment has had a three in front of it and 16 of the of them have been under my Labor Government, since \\nwere elected last May. Now, we will continue to prioritise the creation of jobs, we will continue to prioritise lifting \\nwages and we will continue to prioritise giving people the skills, so they can fill those good, secure jobs. Now, the \\nFee-Free TAFE is already making an enormous difference. We committed to 180,000 Fee-Free TAFE places this \\nyear. We've delivered at least but still growing, 215,000. Here in WA, there were going to be 18,000 places, we've \\nalmost doubled that figure. WA was very quick off the mark in making a difference. And here at this TAFE, just one \\nexample of the difference that it has made, before Fee-Free TAFE this course in electronics used to cost $3,700. It \\nattracted about seven students each term. Fee-Free TAFE means that now the course has 85 students enrolled, \\nseven to 85. A practical example of how our commitment to Fee-Free TAFE, making a difference, working with \\nState Governments is making a difference to the economy. But importantly as well, making a difference to people's \\nlives by training them up and giving them the skills that they need for secure work into the future. So, I want to also \\nconclude by just giving a shout out to those people who are doing the training. A lot of people, when I've been to \\nTAFEs over the years, people who've already made a massive contribution through the skills and work that they've \\ndone, towards the end of their careers or sometimes after they're formally retired, go and impart those skills to the \\nnext generation coming through. And that's a really important thing about TAFE that we see and I thank those who \\nare doing that. And this course at this wonderful TAFE, I just think this is a really practical announcement and a \\npractical example of how my Government is getting on with dealing with cost of living pressures, dealing with the \\nchallenges which are in the economy and setting us up for a prosperous future. We're going to hear from the \\nPremier and then the WA Training Minister, Simone. And then we'll take questions.\\nROGER COOK, PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA: Thanks very much, Anthony. It's great to have the Prime \\nMinister back here in Western Australia and here in Midland at North Metropolitan TAFE, one of the centres that \\nwill be designed to train all the people we need for our renewable energy transition. So, it's terrific to be here to \\ncelebrate Fee-Free TAFE courses. I'm joined by Minister McGurk, I want to thank her for her leadership in the \\ntraining field, but also acknowledge Tania Lawrence the Member for Hasluck. And of course, the great local \\nMember for Midland, Michelle Roberts. This is an outstanding outcome for Western Australia. In 2023, 36,000 \\nWestern Australians took advantage of our Fee-Free courses, over and above the anticipated 180,000. And so \\nnow, we've got more in 24. And we're really looking forward to extending the Fee-Free TAFE courses under the \\nNational Skills Agreement. Now, my Government always fights for the best deal for Western Australians and the \\nNational Skills Agreement is an outstanding outcome for training Western Australians, not only for the jobs of today, \\nbut for the jobs of the future. It enables us to properly target our resources to those qualifications that we know are \\ngoing to be so vital for the ongoing prosperity of our economy. And it also provides us with an opportunity to target \\ncohorts that we want to see get into the courses, that are so valuable. People from disadvantaged backgrounds, \\ngender diversity in these courses. And so, this is an outstanding outcome. I was very proud to be at the National \\nCabinet meeting earlier in the week, where all the Premiers and Chief Ministers were able to sign off on the Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nNational Skills Agreement. It's a great sign of a Commonwealth Government, which is taking the lead to make sure \\nour economy has the workforce that we need to continue to prosper. This is also in addition to my Government's \\n$246 million redevelopment of our TAFE campuses, almost a quarter of a billion dollars around designing and \\nmaking sure that our TAFE campuses are fit for purpose, to continue to provide great job opportunities for those \\nskills that we'll need today, but to continue to make sure that we have the job opportunities for skills into the future. \\nSo, for instance, here at North Metropolitan TAFE, we'll be providing skills opportunities for those people looking to \\ntransition into the renewable energies future. We'll have a wind turbine here in the very near future, to provide skills \\nfor those people to be able to practice, not only working on wind turbines, but also working at height. So, you can \\nsee how these strategic investments are so important to providing people with jobs. And that's what my \\nGovernment's priority is, is to make sure that Western Australians get the jobs that they deserve. And our \\nunemployment rate figures, which were released yesterday, 3.3 per cent is an outstanding outcome for the Western \\nAustralian economy, and we want to do more. We want to continue to make sure that we provide opportunities for \\nWestern Australians to get rewarding jobs, in great industries, that are forward looking into the future. So, thank you \\nvery much to the Commonwealth Government. Congratulations to Minister McGurk for the National Skills \\nAgreement. This is a great day for Western Australian jobs and training, and very much looking forward to seeing \\nmore success in the Fee-Free TAFE courses into the future.\\nSIMONE MCGURK, WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR TRAINING: Thank you Premier and thank you \\nPrime Minister for being here, as well as Tania Lawrence and Michelle Roberts. I just wanted to acknowledge what \\nwe're able to achieve when we work in cooperation with the Federal Government and the State Government, both \\nbeing so committed in Western Australia to making sure that Western Australians are skilled to do the jobs that we \\nknow are out there and we know are coming. And this five year Skills Agreement, which will deliver $1.3 billion to \\nWestern Australia, $1.3 billion, and that would be $380 million more than we've had in previous, than previous \\nfunding arrangements with the Federal Government. But importantly, we have some certainty of funding for five \\nyears. And working together with a Commonwealth Government to understand what our priority areas are, for the \\njobs that we know are here now and the jobs that we know are coming at us. And to be here at North Metropolitan \\nTAFE here in Midland, where we're able to meet students who are taking advantage of significant Fee-Free \\ncourses, making significant savings. And as the Prime Minister said, we've met a couple of students who are \\nmature age and are coming back and taking the opportunity to upskill, but also young students who can see the \\nopportunities that are here. These are electronic students and you can tell, there's real buzz in the room. They've \\nreally taken advantage of what we're able to deliver with Fee-Free and I would just like to repeat my \\nacknowledgement of the cooperation that we're able to achieve with the Federal Government, when we work \\ntogether. And for the Federal Government, under Prime Minister Albanese and the Skills Minister Brendan \\nO'Connor, understanding that Western Australia has some real pressures and that we need to all work together to \\nput our shoulder to the wheel, to meet the skills demands that are with us today.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Simone. Happy to have questions, on this firstly. This is a really important \\nannouncement and I'm sure you have some other things you want to talk about.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Ed Husic and Anne Aly, who've accused Israel of collectively punishing \\nPalestinians? And if it's not collective punishment, what is it?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Ed Husic, Anne Aly and my entire team voted for a resolution in the Parliament and indeed Ed \\nand Anne spoke about it. That resolution was really important, it unequivocally condemned Hamas for the atrocities \\nthat it committed as a terrorist organisation, with its invasion of Israel. And with the atrocities that were committed, \\nincluding to young people who were attending a music festival, we had people kidnapped and taken from their \\nfamilies. Israel has a right to defend itself. We also acknowledged in that resolution, importantly, that the lives of \\ninnocent civilians needed to be protected. Every loss of an innocent life matters, whether they are Israeli or \\nPalestinian. And I do note the comments of President Biden today. This is what President Biden has had to say, \\n'The US remains committed to the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self determination. We mourn every \\ninnocent life lost. We can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians, who only want to live in peace.' And I \\napplaud the efforts of President Biden, to work with nations in the region to make sure that Gaza will be able to \\nhave access to food, water and medicine. President Biden went on to say, 'We cannot give up on peace and we \\ncannot give up on a two state solution.' And his comments are appropriate, I completely agree with them, and I Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nstand by, as does every Member of the Labor Party, the resolution that was adopted overwhelmingly in the \\nParliament, in the House of Representatives and the same resolution in the Senate just this week.\\nJOURNALIST: We learned just this morning that a 16 year old Aboriginal boy has become first death in custody in \\nWA in the last 50 years. The Voice was your key measure to avoid these sorts of outcomes. With that having failed, \\nwhat's next?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, firstly, can I say that this news is a terrible tragedy and I give my condolences to the family \\nand friends of this young person who has died. And there will now be, of course, a coronial inquiry and so on those \\nspecifics, it is not appropriate, therefore, to comment further. My Government is determined to Close the Gap with \\nIndigenous Australians. We answered the invitation of indigenous Australians to give constitutional recognition in \\nthe form which was requested, which was through a constitutionally enshrined Voice to Parliament. Australians did \\nnot vote for that. Our constitution is difficult to change. We're now on eight out of 45, and it is though the case that \\nIndigenous communities in remote Northern Territory, in places in the Kimberley, in Lockhart River and Palm Island \\nand the Tiwis and other communities, overwhelmingly did vote Yes in this referendum. And that will be a difficult \\ntime, it is a difficult time for Indigenous Australians. But we respect the outcome in our democracy and I have done \\nthat. What we will continue to do, we'll continue to work on Closing the Gap though. The National Skills Agreement \\nis an example, we have over $200 million of that agreement, is set aside for First Nation skills uplift. We want to \\nmake sure that there are more Indigenous apprentices, that there are more Indigenous trainees, that workforces are \\nable to benefit from skilling up Indigenous Australians. I know that many of the companies that were out there \\nsupporting the Voice, are those that have done a lot in terms of reconciliation action plans, in Indigenous \\napprenticeships, and here in Western Australia, of course, has led that quite often, and that's a good thing. But the \\nfact that we have this specific program is an indication that I believe whilst Australians did not vote in favour of the \\nreferendum, Australians do want to see the gap closed. They do want to see disadvantage dealt with, that is, in \\nIndigenous communities. And we'll continue to work in this area, but in health, in life expectancy, in community \\nservices, in all of these areas, with the programs that we have. But also consult with Indigenous communities, \\nbecause one of the things that I do know, and here in Western Australia of all places, is the case. I've been coming \\nhere for a long period of time. I've been here, I think, now 17 times as Prime Minister, that's more than one a month, \\nand it's certainly more than what I committed to, of ten visits a year. Because if you want to find out what's \\nhappening on the ground, here in Western Australia, I think West Australians understand this. They don't want \\ndecisions to just be made in Canberra. They want people to come, to talk to people on the ground, to get those \\nresults. Now, that's a principle that doesn't just apply in Indigenous affairs, it's one that applies across the board. It's \\none that my Government will continue to do, which is why I've engaged so strongly with the Premier, Roger Cook, \\nand why I engaged so strongly as well with his predecessor, Mark McGowan.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you have been coming here for a long time before you were Prime Minister and as \\nPrime Minister, as well. Did you expect such a strong No vote in this state?\\nPRIME MINISTER: People saw what polling was saying, we were determined, though. You had a call in 2017. \\nYou'll note that I was coming here in 2017, but I wasn't the Prime Minister. Nor was I the Prime Minister who \\nestablished a process, which asked Indigenous Australians to deliberate on what form constitutional recognition \\nshould take. That process, we had John Howard way back in, we had a vote on the Preamble, which had a similar \\noutcome, last century. We then had John Howard go to an election in 2007, we then had Tony Abbott and then \\nMalcolm Turnbull establish a process. That process came up with the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017. You \\nhad Ken Wyatt appointed as the Minister for Indigenous Australians and go to Garma in 2019. I was there when he \\nput forward the idea that there would be a referendum. That was the policy that Scott Morrison was elected on in \\n2019. It never happened. It never happened. I'm a Prime Minister who will promise to do things and then go and do \\nthem. I think that's how you restore faith in politics. That is something that we need to do. I launched my campaign \\nhere at the stadium and I promised on multiple occasions, that we would do this. And we gave Australians their say, \\nbut we respect the outcome that was given.\\nJOURNALIST: How concerned are you about the unlawful use of solitary confinement in our detention centre, that \\ncan see Indigenous kids held in their cell for 23 hours? Including the one -Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: I have no intention of commenting on, from Canberra, about the specifics of what occurs in \\nevery centre in Australia\\nJOURNALIST: But, if we're trying to Close the Gap\\nPRIME MINISTER: It's a question of the State. I'm not going to pretend, on a serious issue when it comes to \\nIndigenous Australians, that I am somehow an expert on every issue. That's the whole point that I'm making here, is \\nthat you need to get local engagement and local input on matters.\\nJOURNALIST: What do you make of the Opposition Leader's claims yesterday, urging you to fly to Washington via \\nTel Aviv, in the final moments of Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think that quite clearly, the conflict in the Middle East is a complex one. It's one that has \\ngone on for a considerable period of time. The responsibility for what is happening now rests firmly with Hamas and \\nthe actions that they have taken. But there are, of course, longer term issues which President Biden has indicated \\nthis morning again, has given people a reminder, that they are issues that need to be addressed. And I \\nacknowledge the suffering of Israeli, as well as Palestinian citizens, who are innocent, who just want to live a life in \\nsecurity and with justice, as the resolution carried by the Parliament said, going forward. I also acknowledge that \\nleaders have a responsibility at this time to make sure that there is, whilst there is some concern in the community \\nand hurt being felt for people who have relatives and friends in the Middle East, whether they be Israeli or \\nPalestinian, this is a very difficult time for the community. So, individuals and particularly people, I draw your \\nattention to the comments of the Director General of ASIO, Mike Burgess, who's spoken about the need to be \\nresponsible in comments and to be careful about language which is used at this time. We have a harmonious \\ncommunity here in Australia, I want to see that continue. There's no place here in Australia for anti-Semitism. \\nThere is also no place here in Australia for Islamophobia. The Leader of the Opposition chose to do that, that's a \\nmatter for him. I have scheduled a visit, that has been longstanding with President Biden, where the logistics of \\norganising that for Sunday, is when we will depart from Canberra. The leaders who have visited, and I note this, the \\nleaders who have visited are members of the P5, the Permanent Members of the Security Council. The United \\nStates has a particular role in that, as does the United Kingdom, as does the other people who have visited there. \\nAnd President Biden's visit produced outcomes of negotiating through with different states, but also was \\naccompanied by a considerable security effort for President Biden. This is not a secure area. Our priority has been \\nto engage and I've engaged, I've met personally with the Israeli Ambassador. I had him to my residence and had a \\ndiscussion. I've had discussions with leaders of the Palestinian community, leaders of the Jewish community here \\nin Australia, as well. The decision of the Leader of the Opposition to raise such an issue publicly, that's a matter for \\nhim. But at this point in time, I have no plans to visit the Middle East, and in terms of the security agencies as well, \\nthere's no disagreement from the position that I've taken.\\nJOURNALIST: From Joe Biden's speech, what are your thoughts, more specifically on these comments, that if we \\nwalk away and let Putin erase Ukraine's independence, would be aggressors, would be emboldened to try and do \\nthe same possibly in the Pacific and the Middle East more broadly?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, we're there with the people of Ukraine because the actions of Vladimir Putin, of invading, \\nillegally the sovereign state of Ukraine, is an attack on the international rule of law and on respect for national \\nboundaries and national sovereignty. That's why Australia has been a significant contributor to the struggle in \\nUkraine. And that's why we've provided support, including providing comfort and refuge for people fleeing Ukraine. \\nSimilarly, our priority hasn't been to get people into the Middle East, it's been to get people out of the Middle East. \\nAustralian citizens, is what we've been concentrating on, rather than having a whole contingent go into an area \\nwhich is clearly very volatile, to say the least. It's a state of war, is going on. The people of Ukraine are showing \\nextraordinary courage, extraordinary courage, and I support President Biden's call to continue to engage, to show \\nresolve. Australia will continue to be a part of the support for the people of Ukraine, for as long as it is required, \\nbecause this isn't just a struggle about what occurs in Ukraine.

I'm Tania Lawrence, the Member for Hasluck. And it gives me great pleasure to be \\ntoday joined with the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Premier Roger Cook, my state parliamentary colleagues, \\nthe teachers, the trainers and students of North Metro TAFE. When we, even before the election in 2022, we knew \\nwe had a skills and labour shortage. So, one of the very first actions that the Albanese Labor Government took, was \\nto host a summit of unions, businesses, experts, economists, trainers from around the country to identify and \\narticulate the problem and work a pathway to solving it. I also hosted a roundtable here in Perth, with industry \\nleaders, TAFE institutions and with unions. And together, culminating now in this landmark agreement to really fund \\nthe institutions and vocational education training, with TAFE. And we all know, many of us here know, just how \\ncentral it is to having TAFE as the base for education. I myself, as a graduate of TAFE, my staff have done \\napprenticeships as well, and it really does create the careers and pathway opportunities, that have benefited the \\nnation. So with this, I'd love to hand over now to the Prime Minister.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA: Well, thanks very much, Tania, and it's great to be \\nback in the electorate of Hasluck. And it's terrific also to be here with our state parliamentary colleagues, led by \\nPremier Roger Cook, and the Training Minister Simone McGurk, but also Michelle Roberts, the local member here. \\nI am so excited to be in WA this weekend, because of course, it's Telethon Weekend. And you can feel a real uplift \\nhere, as WA does something that other states used to do, but don't do any more, unite in a common interest to \\nraise money to assist sick kids and their family. So, a big shout out at the beginning of this weekend, to all of those \\ninvolved in Telethon and an encouragement to dig deep over this weekend, to make sure that those young \\nAustralians who are so inspirational, who I look forward to meeting their ambassadors later today, and again to talk \\nto people tomorrow about the remarkable example that they show in their resilience, in their positivity, under \\ncircumstances which can be very difficult. But today, we are here at this wonderful TAFE institution to celebrate and \\nto mark the first National Skills Agreement since 2012. Throughout the entire period of my predecessors, there was \\nnot only no National Skills Agreement, there weren't skills agreements between indeed any individual jurisdiction \\nand the Commonwealth. Well, my Government is different. I went to an election saying that we would prioritise \\nTAFE at the center of the vocational education and training system and that we would value skills. The first \\nannouncement that I made as Labor Leader, was back here in Perth in 2019, where I announced the creation of \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nJobs and Skills Australia, a body to identify what the labour market needs were for Australian business going \\nforward, not just over a one year period, but five years, 10 years time. To make sure that our education and training \\nsystem was fit for purpose. To make sure, as well, that we didn't just rely upon temporary labour, bringing people in \\nand then sending them out, and bringing in other people to do the same job. That when we identify an area of skill \\nshortage, we actually have a strategy to tackle it. And that means firstly, training Australians for those jobs. We \\nneed also, of course, to have, migration will continue to play a role. But training Australians up, whether it be for \\ntheir first job or retraining. And it was fantastic to meet some of the students who are here, some of them new in \\ntheir first task that they're looking at doing but others looking at retraining, as well, for the jobs of the future, with the \\nconcentration that this TAFE will have on the renewable sector, which will require different skills. And that's why this \\n$12 billion program that we have put in place over a five year period, with $1.2 billion directly for Western Australia, \\nwill make an enormous difference going forward, over the next five years. And I pay tribute to all of the State and \\nTerritory Governments. A lot of work has gone into this, in the lead up to the National Cabinet meeting that we held \\non Monday, but all of the Premiers and Chief Ministers are very excited about the prospects of going forward. And \\nan example of the way that my Government is working cooperatively with State Governments. Not picking fights \\nwith them, not choosing to back Clive Palmer rather than the local State Government, but choosing instead to back \\nWestern Australians to deliver. Back in this most magnificent of economies, that has been so central to Australia's \\nemployment growth, to continue to be a powerhouse of the national economy. This week we had the labour market \\nfigures, showed an unemployment rate of 3.6 per cent. There have been 19 occasions since records began, where \\nunemployment has had a three in front of it and 16 of the of them have been under my Labor Government, since \\nwere elected last May. Now, we will continue to prioritise the creation of jobs, we will continue to prioritise lifting \\nwages and we will continue to prioritise giving people the skills, so they can fill those good, secure jobs. Now, the \\nFee-Free TAFE is already making an enormous difference. We committed to 180,000 Fee-Free TAFE places this \\nyear. We've delivered at least but still growing, 215,000. Here in WA, there were going to be 18,000 places, we've \\nalmost doubled that figure. WA was very quick off the mark in making a difference. And here at this TAFE, just one \\nexample of the difference that it has made, before Fee-Free TAFE this course in electronics used to cost $3,700. It \\nattracted about seven students each term. Fee-Free TAFE means that now the course has 85 students enrolled, \\nseven to 85. A practical example of how our commitment to Fee-Free TAFE, making a difference, working with \\nState Governments is making a difference to the economy. But importantly as well, making a difference to people's \\nlives by training them up and giving them the skills that they need for secure work into the future. So, I want to also \\nconclude by just giving a shout out to those people who are doing the training. A lot of people, when I've been to \\nTAFEs over the years, people who've already made a massive contribution through the skills and work that they've \\ndone, towards the end of their careers or sometimes after they're formally retired, go and impart those skills to the \\nnext generation coming through. And that's a really important thing about TAFE that we see and I thank those who \\nare doing that. And this course at this wonderful TAFE, I just think this is a really practical announcement and a \\npractical example of how my Government is getting on with dealing with cost of living pressures, dealing with the \\nchallenges which are in the economy and setting us up for a prosperous future. We're going to hear from the \\nPremier and then the WA Training Minister, Simone. And then we'll take questions.\\nROGER COOK, PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA: Thanks very much, Anthony. It's great to have the Prime \\nMinister back here in Western Australia and here in Midland at North Metropolitan TAFE, one of the centres that \\nwill be designed to train all the people we need for our renewable energy transition. So, it's terrific to be here to \\ncelebrate Fee-Free TAFE courses. I'm joined by Minister McGurk, I want to thank her for her leadership in the \\ntraining field, but also acknowledge Tania Lawrence the Member for Hasluck. And of course, the great local \\nMember for Midland, Michelle Roberts. This is an outstanding outcome for Western Australia. In 2023, 36,000 \\nWestern Australians took advantage of our Fee-Free courses, over and above the anticipated 180,000. And so \\nnow, we've got more in 24. And we're really looking forward to extending the Fee-Free TAFE courses under the \\nNational Skills Agreement. Now, my Government always fights for the best deal for Western Australians and the \\nNational Skills Agreement is an outstanding outcome for training Western Australians, not only for the jobs of today, \\nbut for the jobs of the future. It enables us to properly target our resources to those qualifications that we know are \\ngoing to be so vital for the ongoing prosperity of our economy. And it also provides us with an opportunity to target \\ncohorts that we want to see get into the courses, that are so valuable. People from disadvantaged backgrounds, \\ngender diversity in these courses. And so, this is an outstanding outcome. I was very proud to be at the National \\nCabinet meeting earlier in the week, where all the Premiers and Chief Ministers were able to sign off on the Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nNational Skills Agreement. It's a great sign of a Commonwealth Government, which is taking the lead to make sure \\nour economy has the workforce that we need to continue to prosper. This is also in addition to my Government's \\n$246 million redevelopment of our TAFE campuses, almost a quarter of a billion dollars around designing and \\nmaking sure that our TAFE campuses are fit for purpose, to continue to provide great job opportunities for those \\nskills that we'll need today, but to continue to make sure that we have the job opportunities for skills into the future. \\nSo, for instance, here at North Metropolitan TAFE, we'll be providing skills opportunities for those people looking to \\ntransition into the renewable energies future. We'll have a wind turbine here in the very near future, to provide skills \\nfor those people to be able to practice, not only working on wind turbines, but also working at height. So, you can \\nsee how these strategic investments are so important to providing people with jobs. And that's what my \\nGovernment's priority is, is to make sure that Western Australians get the jobs that they deserve. And our \\nunemployment rate figures, which were released yesterday, 3.3 per cent is an outstanding outcome for the Western \\nAustralian economy, and we want to do more. We want to continue to make sure that we provide opportunities for \\nWestern Australians to get rewarding jobs, in great industries, that are forward looking into the future. So, thank you \\nvery much to the Commonwealth Government. Congratulations to Minister McGurk for the National Skills \\nAgreement. This is a great day for Western Australian jobs and training, and very much looking forward to seeing \\nmore success in the Fee-Free TAFE courses into the future.\\nSIMONE MCGURK, WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR TRAINING: Thank you Premier and thank you \\nPrime Minister for being here, as well as Tania Lawrence and Michelle Roberts. I just wanted to acknowledge what \\nwe're able to achieve when we work in cooperation with the Federal Government and the State Government, both \\nbeing so committed in Western Australia to making sure that Western Australians are skilled to do the jobs that we \\nknow are out there and we know are coming. And this five year Skills Agreement, which will deliver $1.3 billion to \\nWestern Australia, $1.3 billion, and that would be $380 million more than we've had in previous, than previous \\nfunding arrangements with the Federal Government. But importantly, we have some certainty of funding for five \\nyears. And working together with a Commonwealth Government to understand what our priority areas are, for the \\njobs that we know are here now and the jobs that we know are coming at us. And to be here at North Metropolitan \\nTAFE here in Midland, where we're able to meet students who are taking advantage of significant Fee-Free \\ncourses, making significant savings. And as the Prime Minister said, we've met a couple of students who are \\nmature age and are coming back and taking the opportunity to upskill, but also young students who can see the \\nopportunities that are here. These are electronic students and you can tell, there's real buzz in the room. They've \\nreally taken advantage of what we're able to deliver with Fee-Free and I would just like to repeat my \\nacknowledgement of the cooperation that we're able to achieve with the Federal Government, when we work \\ntogether. And for the Federal Government, under Prime Minister Albanese and the Skills Minister Brendan \\nO'Connor, understanding that Western Australia has some real pressures and that we need to all work together to \\nput our shoulder to the wheel, to meet the skills demands that are with us today.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Simone. Happy to have questions, on this firstly. This is a really important \\nannouncement and I'm sure you have some other things you want to talk about.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Ed Husic and Anne Aly, who've accused Israel of collectively punishing \\nPalestinians? And if it's not collective punishment, what is it?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Ed Husic, Anne Aly and my entire team voted for a resolution in the Parliament and indeed Ed \\nand Anne spoke about it. That resolution was really important, it unequivocally condemned Hamas for the atrocities \\nthat it committed as a terrorist organisation, with its invasion of Israel. And with the atrocities that were committed, \\nincluding to young people who were attending a music festival, we had people kidnapped and taken from their \\nfamilies. Israel has a right to defend itself. We also acknowledged in that resolution, importantly, that the lives of \\ninnocent civilians needed to be protected. Every loss of an innocent life matters, whether they are Israeli or \\nPalestinian. And I do note the comments of President Biden today. This is what President Biden has had to say, \\n'The US remains committed to the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self determination. We mourn every \\ninnocent life lost. We can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians, who only want to live in peace.' And I \\napplaud the efforts of President Biden, to work with nations in the region to make sure that Gaza will be able to \\nhave access to food, water and medicine. President Biden went on to say, 'We cannot give up on peace and we \\ncannot give up on a two state solution.' And his comments are appropriate, I completely agree with them, and I Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nstand by, as does every Member of the Labor Party, the resolution that was adopted overwhelmingly in the \\nParliament, in the House of Representatives and the same resolution in the Senate just this week.\\nJOURNALIST: We learned just this morning that a 16 year old Aboriginal boy has become first death in custody in \\nWA in the last 50 years. The Voice was your key measure to avoid these sorts of outcomes. With that having failed, \\nwhat's next?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, firstly, can I say that this news is a terrible tragedy and I give my condolences to the family \\nand friends of this young person who has died. And there will now be, of course, a coronial inquiry and so on those \\nspecifics, it is not appropriate, therefore, to comment further. My Government is determined to Close the Gap with \\nIndigenous Australians. We answered the invitation of indigenous Australians to give constitutional recognition in \\nthe form which was requested, which was through a constitutionally enshrined Voice to Parliament. Australians did \\nnot vote for that. Our constitution is difficult to change. We're now on eight out of 45, and it is though the case that \\nIndigenous communities in remote Northern Territory, in places in the Kimberley, in Lockhart River and Palm Island \\nand the Tiwis and other communities, overwhelmingly did vote Yes in this referendum. And that will be a difficult \\ntime, it is a difficult time for Indigenous Australians. But we respect the outcome in our democracy and I have done \\nthat. What we will continue to do, we'll continue to work on Closing the Gap though. The National Skills Agreement \\nis an example, we have over $200 million of that agreement, is set aside for First Nation skills uplift. We want to \\nmake sure that there are more Indigenous apprentices, that there are more Indigenous trainees, that workforces are \\nable to benefit from skilling up Indigenous Australians. I know that many of the companies that were out there \\nsupporting the Voice, are those that have done a lot in terms of reconciliation action plans, in Indigenous \\napprenticeships, and here in Western Australia, of course, has led that quite often, and that's a good thing. But the \\nfact that we have this specific program is an indication that I believe whilst Australians did not vote in favour of the \\nreferendum, Australians do want to see the gap closed. They do want to see disadvantage dealt with, that is, in \\nIndigenous communities. And we'll continue to work in this area, but in health, in life expectancy, in community \\nservices, in all of these areas, with the programs that we have. But also consult with Indigenous communities, \\nbecause one of the things that I do know, and here in Western Australia of all places, is the case. I've been coming \\nhere for a long period of time. I've been here, I think, now 17 times as Prime Minister, that's more than one a month, \\nand it's certainly more than what I committed to, of ten visits a year. Because if you want to find out what's \\nhappening on the ground, here in Western Australia, I think West Australians understand this. They don't want \\ndecisions to just be made in Canberra. They want people to come, to talk to people on the ground, to get those \\nresults. Now, that's a principle that doesn't just apply in Indigenous affairs, it's one that applies across the board. It's \\none that my Government will continue to do, which is why I've engaged so strongly with the Premier, Roger Cook, \\nand why I engaged so strongly as well with his predecessor, Mark McGowan.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you have been coming here for a long time before you were Prime Minister and as \\nPrime Minister, as well. Did you expect such a strong No vote in this state?\\nPRIME MINISTER: People saw what polling was saying, we were determined, though.

So, one of the very first actions that the Albanese Labor Government took, was \\nto host a summit of unions, businesses, experts, economists, trainers from around the country to identify and \\narticulate the problem and work a pathway to solving it. I also hosted a roundtable here in Perth, with industry \\nleaders, TAFE institutions and with unions. And together, culminating now in this landmark agreement to really fund \\nthe institutions and vocational education training, with TAFE. And we all know, many of us here know, just how \\ncentral it is to having TAFE as the base for education. I myself, as a graduate of TAFE, my staff have done \\napprenticeships as well, and it really does create the careers and pathway opportunities, that have benefited the \\nnation. So with this, I'd love to hand over now to the Prime Minister.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA: Well, thanks very much, Tania, and it's great to be \\nback in the electorate of Hasluck. And it's terrific also to be here with our state parliamentary colleagues, led by \\nPremier Roger Cook, and the Training Minister Simone McGurk, but also Michelle Roberts, the local member here. \\nI am so excited to be in WA this weekend, because of course, it's Telethon Weekend. And you can feel a real uplift \\nhere, as WA does something that other states used to do, but don't do any more, unite in a common interest to \\nraise money to assist sick kids and their family. So, a big shout out at the beginning of this weekend, to all of those \\ninvolved in Telethon and an encouragement to dig deep over this weekend, to make sure that those young \\nAustralians who are so inspirational, who I look forward to meeting their ambassadors later today, and again to talk \\nto people tomorrow about the remarkable example that they show in their resilience, in their positivity, under \\ncircumstances which can be very difficult. But today, we are here at this wonderful TAFE institution to celebrate and \\nto mark the first National Skills Agreement since 2012. Throughout the entire period of my predecessors, there was \\nnot only no National Skills Agreement, there weren't skills agreements between indeed any individual jurisdiction \\nand the Commonwealth. Well, my Government is different. I went to an election saying that we would prioritise \\nTAFE at the center of the vocational education and training system and that we would value skills. The first \\nannouncement that I made as Labor Leader, was back here in Perth in 2019, where I announced the creation of \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nJobs and Skills Australia, a body to identify what the labour market needs were for Australian business going \\nforward, not just over a one year period, but five years, 10 years time. To make sure that our education and training \\nsystem was fit for purpose. To make sure, as well, that we didn't just rely upon temporary labour, bringing people in \\nand then sending them out, and bringing in other people to do the same job. That when we identify an area of skill \\nshortage, we actually have a strategy to tackle it. And that means firstly, training Australians for those jobs. We \\nneed also, of course, to have, migration will continue to play a role. But training Australians up, whether it be for \\ntheir first job or retraining. And it was fantastic to meet some of the students who are here, some of them new in \\ntheir first task that they're looking at doing but others looking at retraining, as well, for the jobs of the future, with the \\nconcentration that this TAFE will have on the renewable sector, which will require different skills. And that's why this \\n$12 billion program that we have put in place over a five year period, with $1.2 billion directly for Western Australia, \\nwill make an enormous difference going forward, over the next five years. And I pay tribute to all of the State and \\nTerritory Governments. A lot of work has gone into this, in the lead up to the National Cabinet meeting that we held \\non Monday, but all of the Premiers and Chief Ministers are very excited about the prospects of going forward. And \\nan example of the way that my Government is working cooperatively with State Governments. Not picking fights \\nwith them, not choosing to back Clive Palmer rather than the local State Government, but choosing instead to back \\nWestern Australians to deliver. Back in this most magnificent of economies, that has been so central to Australia's \\nemployment growth, to continue to be a powerhouse of the national economy. This week we had the labour market \\nfigures, showed an unemployment rate of 3.6 per cent. There have been 19 occasions since records began, where \\nunemployment has had a three in front of it and 16 of the of them have been under my Labor Government, since \\nwere elected last May. Now, we will continue to prioritise the creation of jobs, we will continue to prioritise lifting \\nwages and we will continue to prioritise giving people the skills, so they can fill those good, secure jobs. Now, the \\nFee-Free TAFE is already making an enormous difference. We committed to 180,000 Fee-Free TAFE places this \\nyear. We've delivered at least but still growing, 215,000. Here in WA, there were going to be 18,000 places, we've \\nalmost doubled that figure. WA was very quick off the mark in making a difference. And here at this TAFE, just one \\nexample of the difference that it has made, before Fee-Free TAFE this course in electronics used to cost $3,700. It \\nattracted about seven students each term. Fee-Free TAFE means that now the course has 85 students enrolled, \\nseven to 85. A practical example of how our commitment to Fee-Free TAFE, making a difference, working with \\nState Governments is making a difference to the economy. But importantly as well, making a difference to people's \\nlives by training them up and giving them the skills that they need for secure work into the future. So, I want to also \\nconclude by just giving a shout out to those people who are doing the training. A lot of people, when I've been to \\nTAFEs over the years, people who've already made a massive contribution through the skills and work that they've \\ndone, towards the end of their careers or sometimes after they're formally retired, go and impart those skills to the \\nnext generation coming through. And that's a really important thing about TAFE that we see and I thank those who \\nare doing that. And this course at this wonderful TAFE, I just think this is a really practical announcement and a \\npractical example of how my Government is getting on with dealing with cost of living pressures, dealing with the \\nchallenges which are in the economy and setting us up for a prosperous future. We're going to hear from the \\nPremier and then the WA Training Minister, Simone. And then we'll take questions.\\nROGER COOK, PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA: Thanks very much, Anthony. It's great to have the Prime \\nMinister back here in Western Australia and here in Midland at North Metropolitan TAFE, one of the centres that \\nwill be designed to train all the people we need for our renewable energy transition. So, it's terrific to be here to \\ncelebrate Fee-Free TAFE courses. I'm joined by Minister McGurk, I want to thank her for her leadership in the \\ntraining field, but also acknowledge Tania Lawrence the Member for Hasluck. And of course, the great local \\nMember for Midland, Michelle Roberts. This is an outstanding outcome for Western Australia. In 2023, 36,000 \\nWestern Australians took advantage of our Fee-Free courses, over and above the anticipated 180,000. And so \\nnow, we've got more in 24. And we're really looking forward to extending the Fee-Free TAFE courses under the \\nNational Skills Agreement. Now, my Government always fights for the best deal for Western Australians and the \\nNational Skills Agreement is an outstanding outcome for training Western Australians, not only for the jobs of today, \\nbut for the jobs of the future. It enables us to properly target our resources to those qualifications that we know are \\ngoing to be so vital for the ongoing prosperity of our economy. And it also provides us with an opportunity to target \\ncohorts that we want to see get into the courses, that are so valuable. People from disadvantaged backgrounds, \\ngender diversity in these courses. And so, this is an outstanding outcome. I was very proud to be at the National \\nCabinet meeting earlier in the week, where all the Premiers and Chief Ministers were able to sign off on the Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nNational Skills Agreement. It's a great sign of a Commonwealth Government, which is taking the lead to make sure \\nour economy has the workforce that we need to continue to prosper. This is also in addition to my Government's \\n$246 million redevelopment of our TAFE campuses, almost a quarter of a billion dollars around designing and \\nmaking sure that our TAFE campuses are fit for purpose, to continue to provide great job opportunities for those \\nskills that we'll need today, but to continue to make sure that we have the job opportunities for skills into the future. \\nSo, for instance, here at North Metropolitan TAFE, we'll be providing skills opportunities for those people looking to \\ntransition into the renewable energies future. We'll have a wind turbine here in the very near future, to provide skills \\nfor those people to be able to practice, not only working on wind turbines, but also working at height. So, you can \\nsee how these strategic investments are so important to providing people with jobs. And that's what my \\nGovernment's priority is, is to make sure that Western Australians get the jobs that they deserve. And our \\nunemployment rate figures, which were released yesterday, 3.3 per cent is an outstanding outcome for the Western \\nAustralian economy, and we want to do more. We want to continue to make sure that we provide opportunities for \\nWestern Australians to get rewarding jobs, in great industries, that are forward looking into the future. So, thank you \\nvery much to the Commonwealth Government. Congratulations to Minister McGurk for the National Skills \\nAgreement. This is a great day for Western Australian jobs and training, and very much looking forward to seeing \\nmore success in the Fee-Free TAFE courses into the future.\\nSIMONE MCGURK, WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR TRAINING: Thank you Premier and thank you \\nPrime Minister for being here, as well as Tania Lawrence and Michelle Roberts. I just wanted to acknowledge what \\nwe're able to achieve when we work in cooperation with the Federal Government and the State Government, both \\nbeing so committed in Western Australia to making sure that Western Australians are skilled to do the jobs that we \\nknow are out there and we know are coming. And this five year Skills Agreement, which will deliver $1.3 billion to \\nWestern Australia, $1.3 billion, and that would be $380 million more than we've had in previous, than previous \\nfunding arrangements with the Federal Government. But importantly, we have some certainty of funding for five \\nyears. And working together with a Commonwealth Government to understand what our priority areas are, for the \\njobs that we know are here now and the jobs that we know are coming at us. And to be here at North Metropolitan \\nTAFE here in Midland, where we're able to meet students who are taking advantage of significant Fee-Free \\ncourses, making significant savings. And as the Prime Minister said, we've met a couple of students who are \\nmature age and are coming back and taking the opportunity to upskill, but also young students who can see the \\nopportunities that are here. These are electronic students and you can tell, there's real buzz in the room. They've \\nreally taken advantage of what we're able to deliver with Fee-Free and I would just like to repeat my \\nacknowledgement of the cooperation that we're able to achieve with the Federal Government, when we work \\ntogether. And for the Federal Government, under Prime Minister Albanese and the Skills Minister Brendan \\nO'Connor, understanding that Western Australia has some real pressures and that we need to all work together to \\nput our shoulder to the wheel, to meet the skills demands that are with us today.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Simone. Happy to have questions, on this firstly. This is a really important \\nannouncement and I'm sure you have some other things you want to talk about.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Ed Husic and Anne Aly, who've accused Israel of collectively punishing \\nPalestinians? And if it's not collective punishment, what is it?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Ed Husic, Anne Aly and my entire team voted for a resolution in the Parliament and indeed Ed \\nand Anne spoke about it. That resolution was really important, it unequivocally condemned Hamas for the atrocities \\nthat it committed as a terrorist organisation, with its invasion of Israel. And with the atrocities that were committed, \\nincluding to young people who were attending a music festival, we had people kidnapped and taken from their \\nfamilies. Israel has a right to defend itself. We also acknowledged in that resolution, importantly, that the lives of \\ninnocent civilians needed to be protected. Every loss of an innocent life matters, whether they are Israeli or \\nPalestinian. And I do note the comments of President Biden today. This is what President Biden has had to say, \\n'The US remains committed to the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self determination. We mourn every \\ninnocent life lost. We can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians, who only want to live in peace.' And I \\napplaud the efforts of President Biden, to work with nations in the region to make sure that Gaza will be able to \\nhave access to food, water and medicine. President Biden went on to say, 'We cannot give up on peace and we \\ncannot give up on a two state solution.' And his comments are appropriate, I completely agree with them, and I Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nstand by, as does every Member of the Labor Party, the resolution that was adopted overwhelmingly in the \\nParliament, in the House of Representatives and the same resolution in the Senate just this week.\\nJOURNALIST: We learned just this morning that a 16 year old Aboriginal boy has become first death in custody in \\nWA in the last 50 years. The Voice was your key measure to avoid these sorts of outcomes. With that having failed, \\nwhat's next?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, firstly, can I say that this news is a terrible tragedy and I give my condolences to the family \\nand friends of this young person who has died. And there will now be, of course, a coronial inquiry and so on those \\nspecifics, it is not appropriate, therefore, to comment further. My Government is determined to Close the Gap with \\nIndigenous Australians. We answered the invitation of indigenous Australians to give constitutional recognition in \\nthe form which was requested, which was through a constitutionally enshrined Voice to Parliament. Australians did \\nnot vote for that. Our constitution is difficult to change. We're now on eight out of 45, and it is though the case that \\nIndigenous communities in remote Northern Territory, in places in the Kimberley, in Lockhart River and Palm Island \\nand the Tiwis and other communities, overwhelmingly did vote Yes in this referendum. And that will be a difficult \\ntime, it is a difficult time for Indigenous Australians. But we respect the outcome in our democracy and I have done \\nthat. What we will continue to do, we'll continue to work on Closing the Gap though. The National Skills Agreement \\nis an example, we have over $200 million of that agreement, is set aside for First Nation skills uplift. We want to \\nmake sure that there are more Indigenous apprentices, that there are more Indigenous trainees, that workforces are \\nable to benefit from skilling up Indigenous Australians. I know that many of the companies that were out there \\nsupporting the Voice, are those that have done a lot in terms of reconciliation action plans, in Indigenous \\napprenticeships, and here in Western Australia, of course, has led that quite often, and that's a good thing. But the \\nfact that we have this specific program is an indication that I believe whilst Australians did not vote in favour of the \\nreferendum, Australians do want to see the gap closed. They do want to see disadvantage dealt with, that is, in \\nIndigenous communities. And we'll continue to work in this area, but in health, in life expectancy, in community \\nservices, in all of these areas, with the programs that we have. But also consult with Indigenous communities, \\nbecause one of the things that I do know, and here in Western Australia of all places, is the case. I've been coming \\nhere for a long period of time. I've been here, I think, now 17 times as Prime Minister, that's more than one a month, \\nand it's certainly more than what I committed to, of ten visits a year. Because if you want to find out what's \\nhappening on the ground, here in Western Australia, I think West Australians understand this. They don't want \\ndecisions to just be made in Canberra. They want people to come, to talk to people on the ground, to get those \\nresults. Now, that's a principle that doesn't just apply in Indigenous affairs, it's one that applies across the board. It's \\none that my Government will continue to do, which is why I've engaged so strongly with the Premier, Roger Cook, \\nand why I engaged so strongly as well with his predecessor, Mark McGowan.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you have been coming here for a long time before you were Prime Minister and as \\nPrime Minister, as well. Did you expect such a strong No vote in this state?\\nPRIME MINISTER: People saw what polling was saying, we were determined, though. You had a call in 2017. \\nYou'll note that I was coming here in 2017, but I wasn't the Prime Minister. Nor was I the Prime Minister who \\nestablished a process, which asked Indigenous Australians to deliberate on what form constitutional recognition \\nshould take. That process, we had John Howard way back in, we had a vote on the Preamble, which had a similar \\noutcome, last century. We then had John Howard go to an election in 2007, we then had Tony Abbott and then \\nMalcolm Turnbull establish a process. That process came up with the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017. You \\nhad Ken Wyatt appointed as the Minister for Indigenous Australians and go to Garma in 2019. I was there when he \\nput forward the idea that there would be a referendum. That was the policy that Scott Morrison was elected on in \\n2019. It never happened. It never happened. I'm a Prime Minister who will promise to do things and then go and do \\nthem. I think that's how you restore faith in politics. That is something that we need to do. I launched my campaign \\nhere at the stadium and I promised on multiple occasions, that we would do this. And we gave Australians their say, \\nbut we respect the outcome that was given.\\nJOURNALIST: How concerned are you about the unlawful use of solitary confinement in our detention centre, that \\ncan see Indigenous kids held in their cell for 23 hours? Including the one -Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: I have no intention of commenting on, from Canberra, about the specifics of what occurs in \\nevery centre in Australia\\nJOURNALIST: But, if we're trying to Close the Gap\\nPRIME MINISTER: It's a question of the State. I'm not going to pretend, on a serious issue when it comes to \\nIndigenous Australians, that I am somehow an expert on every issue. That's the whole point that I'm making here, is \\nthat you need to get local engagement and local input on matters.\\nJOURNALIST: What do you make of the Opposition Leader's claims yesterday, urging you to fly to Washington via \\nTel Aviv, in the final moments of Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think that quite clearly, the conflict in the Middle East is a complex one. It's one that has \\ngone on for a considerable period of time. The responsibility for what is happening now rests firmly with Hamas and \\nthe actions that they have taken. But there are, of course, longer term issues which President Biden has indicated \\nthis morning again, has given people a reminder, that they are issues that need to be addressed. And I \\nacknowledge the suffering of Israeli, as well as Palestinian citizens, who are innocent, who just want to live a life in \\nsecurity and with justice, as the resolution carried by the Parliament said, going forward. I also acknowledge that \\nleaders have a responsibility at this time to make sure that there is, whilst there is some concern in the community \\nand hurt being felt for people who have relatives and friends in the Middle East, whether they be Israeli or \\nPalestinian, this is a very difficult time for the community. So, individuals and particularly people, I draw your \\nattention to the comments of the Director General of ASIO, Mike Burgess, who's spoken about the need to be \\nresponsible in comments and to be careful about language which is used at this time. We have a harmonious \\ncommunity here in Australia, I want to see that continue. There's no place here in Australia for anti-Semitism. \\nThere is also no place here in Australia for Islamophobia. The Leader of the Opposition chose to do that, that's a \\nmatter for him. I have scheduled a visit, that has been longstanding with President Biden, where the logistics of \\norganising that for Sunday, is when we will depart from Canberra. The leaders who have visited, and I note this, the \\nleaders who have visited are members of the P5, the Permanent Members of the Security Council. The United \\nStates has a particular role in that, as does the United Kingdom, as does the other people who have visited there. \\nAnd President Biden's visit produced outcomes of negotiating through with different states, but also was \\naccompanied by a considerable security effort for President Biden. This is not a secure area. Our priority has been \\nto engage and I've engaged, I've met personally with the Israeli Ambassador. I had him to my residence and had a \\ndiscussion. I've had discussions with leaders of the Palestinian community, leaders of the Jewish community here \\nin Australia, as well. The decision of the Leader of the Opposition to raise such an issue publicly, that's a matter for \\nhim. But at this point in time, I have no plans to visit the Middle East, and in terms of the security agencies as well, \\nthere's no disagreement from the position that I've taken.\\nJOURNALIST: From Joe Biden's speech, what are your thoughts, more specifically on these comments, that if we \\nwalk away and let Putin erase Ukraine's independence, would be aggressors, would be emboldened to try and do \\nthe same possibly in the Pacific and the Middle East more broadly?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, we're there with the people of Ukraine because the actions of Vladimir Putin, of invading, \\nillegally the sovereign state of Ukraine, is an attack on the international rule of law and on respect for national \\nboundaries and national sovereignty. That's why Australia has been a significant contributor to the struggle in \\nUkraine. And that's why we've provided support, including providing comfort and refuge for people fleeing Ukraine. \\nSimilarly, our priority hasn't been to get people into the Middle East, it's been to get people out of the Middle East. \\nAustralian citizens, is what we've been concentrating on, rather than having a whole contingent go into an area \\nwhich is clearly very volatile, to say the least. It's a state of war, is going on. The people of Ukraine are showing \\nextraordinary courage, extraordinary courage, and I support President Biden's call to continue to engage, to show \\nresolve. Australia will continue to be a part of the support for the people of Ukraine, for as long as it is required, \\nbecause this isn't just a struggle about what occurs in Ukraine.

People from disadvantaged backgrounds, \\ngender diversity in these courses. And so, this is an outstanding outcome. I was very proud to be at the National \\nCabinet meeting earlier in the week, where all the Premiers and Chief Ministers were able to sign off on the Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nNational Skills Agreement. It's a great sign of a Commonwealth Government, which is taking the lead to make sure \\nour economy has the workforce that we need to continue to prosper. This is also in addition to my Government's \\n$246 million redevelopment of our TAFE campuses, almost a quarter of a billion dollars around designing and \\nmaking sure that our TAFE campuses are fit for purpose, to continue to provide great job opportunities for those \\nskills that we'll need today, but to continue to make sure that we have the job opportunities for skills into the future. \\nSo, for instance, here at North Metropolitan TAFE, we'll be providing skills opportunities for those people looking to \\ntransition into the renewable energies future. We'll have a wind turbine here in the very near future, to provide skills \\nfor those people to be able to practice, not only working on wind turbines, but also working at height. So, you can \\nsee how these strategic investments are so important to providing people with jobs. And that's what my \\nGovernment's priority is, is to make sure that Western Australians get the jobs that they deserve. And our \\nunemployment rate figures, which were released yesterday, 3.3 per cent is an outstanding outcome for the Western \\nAustralian economy, and we want to do more. We want to continue to make sure that we provide opportunities for \\nWestern Australians to get rewarding jobs, in great industries, that are forward looking into the future. So, thank you \\nvery much to the Commonwealth Government. Congratulations to Minister McGurk for the National Skills \\nAgreement. This is a great day for Western Australian jobs and training, and very much looking forward to seeing \\nmore success in the Fee-Free TAFE courses into the future.\\nSIMONE MCGURK, WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR TRAINING: Thank you Premier and thank you \\nPrime Minister for being here, as well as Tania Lawrence and Michelle Roberts. I just wanted to acknowledge what \\nwe're able to achieve when we work in cooperation with the Federal Government and the State Government, both \\nbeing so committed in Western Australia to making sure that Western Australians are skilled to do the jobs that we \\nknow are out there and we know are coming. And this five year Skills Agreement, which will deliver $1.3 billion to \\nWestern Australia, $1.3 billion, and that would be $380 million more than we've had in previous, than previous \\nfunding arrangements with the Federal Government. But importantly, we have some certainty of funding for five \\nyears. And working together with a Commonwealth Government to understand what our priority areas are, for the \\njobs that we know are here now and the jobs that we know are coming at us. And to be here at North Metropolitan \\nTAFE here in Midland, where we're able to meet students who are taking advantage of significant Fee-Free \\ncourses, making significant savings. And as the Prime Minister said, we've met a couple of students who are \\nmature age and are coming back and taking the opportunity to upskill, but also young students who can see the \\nopportunities that are here. These are electronic students and you can tell, there's real buzz in the room. They've \\nreally taken advantage of what we're able to deliver with Fee-Free and I would just like to repeat my \\nacknowledgement of the cooperation that we're able to achieve with the Federal Government, when we work \\ntogether. And for the Federal Government, under Prime Minister Albanese and the Skills Minister Brendan \\nO'Connor, understanding that Western Australia has some real pressures and that we need to all work together to \\nput our shoulder to the wheel, to meet the skills demands that are with us today.\\nPRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Simone. Happy to have questions, on this firstly. This is a really important \\nannouncement and I'm sure you have some other things you want to talk about.\\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Ed Husic and Anne Aly, who've accused Israel of collectively punishing \\nPalestinians? And if it's not collective punishment, what is it?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Ed Husic, Anne Aly and my entire team voted for a resolution in the Parliament and indeed Ed \\nand Anne spoke about it. That resolution was really important, it unequivocally condemned Hamas for the atrocities \\nthat it committed as a terrorist organisation, with its invasion of Israel. And with the atrocities that were committed, \\nincluding to young people who were attending a music festival, we had people kidnapped and taken from their \\nfamilies. Israel has a right to defend itself. We also acknowledged in that resolution, importantly, that the lives of \\ninnocent civilians needed to be protected. Every loss of an innocent life matters, whether they are Israeli or \\nPalestinian. And I do note the comments of President Biden today. This is what President Biden has had to say, \\n'The US remains committed to the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self determination. We mourn every \\ninnocent life lost. We can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians, who only want to live in peace.' And I \\napplaud the efforts of President Biden, to work with nations in the region to make sure that Gaza will be able to \\nhave access to food, water and medicine. President Biden went on to say, 'We cannot give up on peace and we \\ncannot give up on a two state solution.' And his comments are appropriate, I completely agree with them, and I Page 4 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nstand by, as does every Member of the Labor Party, the resolution that was adopted overwhelmingly in the \\nParliament, in the House of Representatives and the same resolution in the Senate just this week.\\nJOURNALIST: We learned just this morning that a 16 year old Aboriginal boy has become first death in custody in \\nWA in the last 50 years. The Voice was your key measure to avoid these sorts of outcomes. With that having failed, \\nwhat's next?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, firstly, can I say that this news is a terrible tragedy and I give my condolences to the family \\nand friends of this young person who has died. And there will now be, of course, a coronial inquiry and so on those \\nspecifics, it is not appropriate, therefore, to comment further. My Government is determined to Close the Gap with \\nIndigenous Australians. We answered the invitation of indigenous Australians to give constitutional recognition in \\nthe form which was requested, which was through a constitutionally enshrined Voice to Parliament. Australians did \\nnot vote for that. Our constitution is difficult to change. We're now on eight out of 45, and it is though the case that \\nIndigenous communities in remote Northern Territory, in places in the Kimberley, in Lockhart River and Palm Island \\nand the Tiwis and other communities, overwhelmingly did vote Yes in this referendum. And that will be a difficult \\ntime, it is a difficult time for Indigenous Australians. But we respect the outcome in our democracy and I have done \\nthat. What we will continue to do, we'll continue to work on Closing the Gap though. The National Skills Agreement \\nis an example, we have over $200 million of that agreement, is set aside for First Nation skills uplift. We want to \\nmake sure that there are more Indigenous apprentices, that there are more Indigenous trainees, that workforces are \\nable to benefit from skilling up Indigenous Australians. I know that many of the companies that were out there \\nsupporting the Voice, are those that have done a lot in terms of reconciliation action plans, in Indigenous \\napprenticeships, and here in Western Australia, of course, has led that quite often, and that's a good thing. But the \\nfact that we have this specific program is an indication that I believe whilst Australians did not vote in favour of the \\nreferendum, Australians do want to see the gap closed. They do want to see disadvantage dealt with, that is, in \\nIndigenous communities. And we'll continue to work in this area, but in health, in life expectancy, in community \\nservices, in all of these areas, with the programs that we have. But also consult with Indigenous communities, \\nbecause one of the things that I do know, and here in Western Australia of all places, is the case. I've been coming \\nhere for a long period of time. I've been here, I think, now 17 times as Prime Minister, that's more than one a month, \\nand it's certainly more than what I committed to, of ten visits a year. Because if you want to find out what's \\nhappening on the ground, here in Western Australia, I think West Australians understand this. They don't want \\ndecisions to just be made in Canberra. They want people to come, to talk to people on the ground, to get those \\nresults. Now, that's a principle that doesn't just apply in Indigenous affairs, it's one that applies across the board. It's \\none that my Government will continue to do, which is why I've engaged so strongly with the Premier, Roger Cook, \\nand why I engaged so strongly as well with his predecessor, Mark McGowan.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you have been coming here for a long time before you were Prime Minister and as \\nPrime Minister, as well. Did you expect such a strong No vote in this state?\\nPRIME MINISTER: People saw what polling was saying, we were determined, though. You had a call in 2017. \\nYou'll note that I was coming here in 2017, but I wasn't the Prime Minister. Nor was I the Prime Minister who \\nestablished a process, which asked Indigenous Australians to deliberate on what form constitutional recognition \\nshould take. That process, we had John Howard way back in, we had a vote on the Preamble, which had a similar \\noutcome, last century. We then had John Howard go to an election in 2007, we then had Tony Abbott and then \\nMalcolm Turnbull establish a process. That process came up with the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017. You \\nhad Ken Wyatt appointed as the Minister for Indigenous Australians and go to Garma in 2019. I was there when he \\nput forward the idea that there would be a referendum. That was the policy that Scott Morrison was elected on in \\n2019. It never happened. It never happened. I'm a Prime Minister who will promise to do things and then go and do \\nthem. I think that's how you restore faith in politics. That is something that we need to do. I launched my campaign \\nhere at the stadium and I promised on multiple occasions, that we would do this. And we gave Australians their say, \\nbut we respect the outcome that was given.\\nJOURNALIST: How concerned are you about the unlawful use of solitary confinement in our detention centre, that \\ncan see Indigenous kids held in their cell for 23 hours? Including the one -Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: I have no intention of commenting on, from Canberra, about the specifics of what occurs in \\nevery centre in Australia\\nJOURNALIST: But, if we're trying to Close the Gap\\nPRIME MINISTER: It's a question of the State. I'm not going to pretend, on a serious issue when it comes to \\nIndigenous Australians, that I am somehow an expert on every issue. That's the whole point that I'm making here, is \\nthat you need to get local engagement and local input on matters.\\nJOURNALIST: What do you make of the Opposition Leader's claims yesterday, urging you to fly to Washington via \\nTel Aviv, in the final moments of Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think that quite clearly, the conflict in the Middle East is a complex one. It's one that has \\ngone on for a considerable period of time. The responsibility for what is happening now rests firmly with Hamas and \\nthe actions that they have taken. But there are, of course, longer term issues which President Biden has indicated \\nthis morning again, has given people a reminder, that they are issues that need to be addressed. And I \\nacknowledge the suffering of Israeli, as well as Palestinian citizens, who are innocent, who just want to live a life in \\nsecurity and with justice, as the resolution carried by the Parliament said, going forward. I also acknowledge that \\nleaders have a responsibility at this time to make sure that there is, whilst there is some concern in the community \\nand hurt being felt for people who have relatives and friends in the Middle East, whether they be Israeli or \\nPalestinian, this is a very difficult time for the community. So, individuals and particularly people, I draw your \\nattention to the comments of the Director General of ASIO, Mike Burgess, who's spoken about the need to be \\nresponsible in comments and to be careful about language which is used at this time. We have a harmonious \\ncommunity here in Australia, I want to see that continue. There's no place here in Australia for anti-Semitism. \\nThere is also no place here in Australia for Islamophobia. The Leader of the Opposition chose to do that, that's a \\nmatter for him. I have scheduled a visit, that has been longstanding with President Biden, where the logistics of \\norganising that for Sunday, is when we will depart from Canberra. The leaders who have visited, and I note this, the \\nleaders who have visited are members of the P5, the Permanent Members of the Security Council. The United \\nStates has a particular role in that, as does the United Kingdom, as does the other people who have visited there. \\nAnd President Biden's visit produced outcomes of negotiating through with different states, but also was \\naccompanied by a considerable security effort for President Biden. This is not a secure area. Our priority has been \\nto engage and I've engaged, I've met personally with the Israeli Ambassador. I had him to my residence and had a \\ndiscussion. I've had discussions with leaders of the Palestinian community, leaders of the Jewish community here \\nin Australia, as well. The decision of the Leader of the Opposition to raise such an issue publicly, that's a matter for \\nhim. But at this point in time, I have no plans to visit the Middle East, and in terms of the security agencies as well, \\nthere's no disagreement from the position that I've taken.\\nJOURNALIST: From Joe Biden's speech, what are your thoughts, more specifically on these comments, that if we \\nwalk away and let Putin erase Ukraine's independence, would be aggressors, would be emboldened to try and do \\nthe same possibly in the Pacific and the Middle East more broadly?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, we're there with the people of Ukraine because the actions of Vladimir Putin, of invading, \\nillegally the sovereign state of Ukraine, is an attack on the international rule of law and on respect for national \\nboundaries and national sovereignty. That's why Australia has been a significant contributor to the struggle in \\nUkraine. And that's why we've provided support, including providing comfort and refuge for people fleeing Ukraine. \\nSimilarly, our priority hasn't been to get people into the Middle East, it's been to get people out of the Middle East. \\nAustralian citizens, is what we've been concentrating on, rather than having a whole contingent go into an area \\nwhich is clearly very volatile, to say the least. It's a state of war, is going on. The people of Ukraine are showing \\nextraordinary courage, extraordinary courage, and I support President Biden's call to continue to engage, to show \\nresolve. Australia will continue to be a part of the support for the people of Ukraine, for as long as it is required, \\nbecause this isn't just a struggle about what occurs in Ukraine.

I'm Tania Lawrence, the Member for Hasluck. And it gives me great pleasure to be \\ntoday joined with the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Premier Roger Cook, my state parliamentary colleagues, \\nthe teachers, the trainers and students of North Metro TAFE. When we, even before the election in 2022, we knew \\nwe had a skills and labour shortage. So, one of the very first actions that the Albanese Labor Government took, was \\nto host a summit of unions, businesses, experts, economists, trainers from around the country to identify and \\narticulate the problem and work a pathway to solving it. I also hosted a roundtable here in Perth, with industry \\nleaders, TAFE institutions and with unions. And together, culminating now in this landmark agreement to really fund \\nthe institutions and vocational education training, with TAFE. And we all know, many of us here know, just how \\ncentral it is to having TAFE as the base for education. I myself, as a graduate of TAFE, my staff have done \\napprenticeships as well, and it really does create the careers and pathway opportunities, that have benefited the \\nnation. So with this, I'd love to hand over now to the Prime Minister.\\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA: Well, thanks very much, Tania, and it's great to be \\nback in the electorate of Hasluck. And it's terrific also to be here with our state parliamentary colleagues, led by \\nPremier Roger Cook, and the Training Minister Simone McGurk, but also Michelle Roberts, the local member here. \\nI am so excited to be in WA this weekend, because of course, it's Telethon Weekend. And you can feel a real uplift \\nhere, as WA does something that other states used to do, but don't do any more, unite in a common interest to \\nraise money to assist sick kids and their family. So, a big shout out at the beginning of this weekend, to all of those \\ninvolved in Telethon and an encouragement to dig deep over this weekend, to make sure that those young \\nAustralians who are so inspirational, who I look forward to meeting their ambassadors later today, and again to talk \\nto people tomorrow about the remarkable example that they show in their resilience, in their positivity, under \\ncircumstances which can be very difficult. But today, we are here at this wonderful TAFE institution to celebrate and \\nto mark the first National Skills Agreement since 2012. Throughout the entire period of my predecessors, there was \\nnot only no National Skills Agreement, there weren't skills agreements between indeed any individual jurisdiction \\nand the Commonwealth. Well, my Government is different. I went to an election saying that we would prioritise \\nTAFE at the center of the vocational education and training system and that we would value skills. The first \\nannouncement that I made as Labor Leader, was back here in Perth in 2019, where I announced the creation of \\nPage 2 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nJobs and Skills Australia, a body to identify what the labour market needs were for Australian business going \\nforward, not just over a one year period, but five years, 10 years time. To make sure that our education and training \\nsystem was fit for purpose. To make sure, as well, that we didn't just rely upon temporary labour, bringing people in \\nand then sending them out, and bringing in other people to do the same job. That when we identify an area of skill \\nshortage, we actually have a strategy to tackle it. And that means firstly, training Australians for those jobs. We \\nneed also, of course, to have, migration will continue to play a role. But training Australians up, whether it be for \\ntheir first job or retraining. And it was fantastic to meet some of the students who are here, some of them new in \\ntheir first task that they're looking at doing but others looking at retraining, as well, for the jobs of the future, with the \\nconcentration that this TAFE will have on the renewable sector, which will require different skills. And that's why this \\n$12 billion program that we have put in place over a five year period, with $1.2 billion directly for Western Australia, \\nwill make an enormous difference going forward, over the next five years. And I pay tribute to all of the State and \\nTerritory Governments. A lot of work has gone into this, in the lead up to the National Cabinet meeting that we held \\non Monday, but all of the Premiers and Chief Ministers are very excited about the prospects of going forward. And \\nan example of the way that my Government is working cooperatively with State Governments. Not picking fights \\nwith them, not choosing to back Clive Palmer rather than the local State Government, but choosing instead to back \\nWestern Australians to deliver. Back in this most magnificent of economies, that has been so central to Australia's \\nemployment growth, to continue to be a powerhouse of the national economy. This week we had the labour market \\nfigures, showed an unemployment rate of 3.6 per cent. There have been 19 occasions since records began, where \\nunemployment has had a three in front of it and 16 of the of them have been under my Labor Government, since \\nwere elected last May. Now, we will continue to prioritise the creation of jobs, we will continue to prioritise lifting \\nwages and we will continue to prioritise giving people the skills, so they can fill those good, secure jobs. Now, the \\nFee-Free TAFE is already making an enormous difference. We committed to 180,000 Fee-Free TAFE places this \\nyear. We've delivered at least but still growing, 215,000. Here in WA, there were going to be 18,000 places, we've \\nalmost doubled that figure. WA was very quick off the mark in making a difference. And here at this TAFE, just one \\nexample of the difference that it has made, before Fee-Free TAFE this course in electronics used to cost $3,700. It \\nattracted about seven students each term. Fee-Free TAFE means that now the course has 85 students enrolled, \\nseven to 85. A practical example of how our commitment to Fee-Free TAFE, making a difference, working with \\nState Governments is making a difference to the economy. But importantly as well, making a difference to people's \\nlives by training them up and giving them the skills that they need for secure work into the future. So, I want to also \\nconclude by just giving a shout out to those people who are doing the training. A lot of people, when I've been to \\nTAFEs over the years, people who've already made a massive contribution through the skills and work that they've \\ndone, towards the end of their careers or sometimes after they're formally retired, go and impart those skills to the \\nnext generation coming through. And that's a really important thing about TAFE that we see and I thank those who \\nare doing that. And this course at this wonderful TAFE, I just think this is a really practical announcement and a \\npractical example of how my Government is getting on with dealing with cost of living pressures, dealing with the \\nchallenges which are in the economy and setting us up for a prosperous future. We're going to hear from the \\nPremier and then the WA Training Minister, Simone. And then we'll take questions.\\nROGER COOK, PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA: Thanks very much, Anthony. It's great to have the Prime \\nMinister back here in Western Australia and here in Midland at North Metropolitan TAFE, one of the centres that \\nwill be designed to train all the people we need for our renewable energy transition. So, it's terrific to be here to \\ncelebrate Fee-Free TAFE courses. I'm joined by Minister McGurk, I want to thank her for her leadership in the \\ntraining field, but also acknowledge Tania Lawrence the Member for Hasluck. And of course, the great local \\nMember for Midland, Michelle Roberts. This is an outstanding outcome for Western Australia. In 2023, 36,000 \\nWestern Australians took advantage of our Fee-Free courses, over and above the anticipated 180,000. And so \\nnow, we've got more in 24. And we're really looking forward to extending the Fee-Free TAFE courses under the \\nNational Skills Agreement. Now, my Government always fights for the best deal for Western Australians and the \\nNational Skills Agreement is an outstanding outcome for training Western Australians, not only for the jobs of today, \\nbut for the jobs of the future. It enables us to properly target our resources to those qualifications that we know are \\ngoing to be so vital for the ongoing prosperity of our economy. And it also provides us with an opportunity to target \\ncohorts that we want to see get into the courses, that are so valuable. People from disadvantaged backgrounds, \\ngender diversity in these courses. And so, this is an outstanding outcome. I was very proud to be at the National \\nCabinet meeting earlier in the week, where all the Premiers and Chief Ministers were able to sign off on the Page 3 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nNational Skills Agreement. It's a great sign of a Commonwealth Government, which is taking the lead to make sure \\nour economy has the workforce that we need to continue to prosper. This is also in addition to my Government's \\n$246 million redevelopment of our TAFE campuses, almost a quarter of a billion dollars around designing and \\nmaking sure that our TAFE campuses are fit for purpose, to continue to provide great job opportunities for those \\nskills that we'll need today, but to continue to make sure that we have the job opportunities for skills into the future. \\nSo, for instance, here at North Metropolitan TAFE, we'll be providing skills opportunities for those people looking to \\ntransition into the renewable energies future.

I've been here, I think, now 17 times as Prime Minister, that's more than one a month, \\nand it's certainly more than what I committed to, of ten visits a year. Because if you want to find out what's \\nhappening on the ground, here in Western Australia, I think West Australians understand this. They don't want \\ndecisions to just be made in Canberra. They want people to come, to talk to people on the ground, to get those \\nresults. Now, that's a principle that doesn't just apply in Indigenous affairs, it's one that applies across the board. It's \\none that my Government will continue to do, which is why I've engaged so strongly with the Premier, Roger Cook, \\nand why I engaged so strongly as well with his predecessor, Mark McGowan.\\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you have been coming here for a long time before you were Prime Minister and as \\nPrime Minister, as well. Did you expect such a strong No vote in this state?\\nPRIME MINISTER: People saw what polling was saying, we were determined, though. You had a call in 2017. \\nYou'll note that I was coming here in 2017, but I wasn't the Prime Minister. Nor was I the Prime Minister who \\nestablished a process, which asked Indigenous Australians to deliberate on what form constitutional recognition \\nshould take. That process, we had John Howard way back in, we had a vote on the Preamble, which had a similar \\noutcome, last century. We then had John Howard go to an election in 2007, we then had Tony Abbott and then \\nMalcolm Turnbull establish a process. That process came up with the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017. You \\nhad Ken Wyatt appointed as the Minister for Indigenous Australians and go to Garma in 2019. I was there when he \\nput forward the idea that there would be a referendum. That was the policy that Scott Morrison was elected on in \\n2019. It never happened. It never happened. I'm a Prime Minister who will promise to do things and then go and do \\nthem. I think that's how you restore faith in politics. That is something that we need to do. I launched my campaign \\nhere at the stadium and I promised on multiple occasions, that we would do this. And we gave Australians their say, \\nbut we respect the outcome that was given.\\nJOURNALIST: How concerned are you about the unlawful use of solitary confinement in our detention centre, that \\ncan see Indigenous kids held in their cell for 23 hours? Including the one -Page 5 of 6\\nDOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023\\nPRIME MINISTER: I have no intention of commenting on, from Canberra, about the specifics of what occurs in \\nevery centre in Australia\\nJOURNALIST: But, if we're trying to Close the Gap\\nPRIME MINISTER: It's a question of the State. I'm not going to pretend, on a serious issue when it comes to \\nIndigenous Australians, that I am somehow an expert on every issue. That's the whole point that I'm making here, is \\nthat you need to get local engagement and local input on matters.\\nJOURNALIST: What do you make of the Opposition Leader's claims yesterday, urging you to fly to Washington via \\nTel Aviv, in the final moments of Parliament?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think that quite clearly, the conflict in the Middle East is a complex one. It's one that has \\ngone on for a considerable period of time. The responsibility for what is happening now rests firmly with Hamas and \\nthe actions that they have taken. But there are, of course, longer term issues which President Biden has indicated \\nthis morning again, has given people a reminder, that they are issues that need to be addressed. And I \\nacknowledge the suffering of Israeli, as well as Palestinian citizens, who are innocent, who just want to live a life in \\nsecurity and with justice, as the resolution carried by the Parliament said, going forward. I also acknowledge that \\nleaders have a responsibility at this time to make sure that there is, whilst there is some concern in the community \\nand hurt being felt for people who have relatives and friends in the Middle East, whether they be Israeli or \\nPalestinian, this is a very difficult time for the community. So, individuals and particularly people, I draw your \\nattention to the comments of the Director General of ASIO, Mike Burgess, who's spoken about the need to be \\nresponsible in comments and to be careful about language which is used at this time. We have a harmonious \\ncommunity here in Australia, I want to see that continue. There's no place here in Australia for anti-Semitism. \\nThere is also no place here in Australia for Islamophobia. The Leader of the Opposition chose to do that, that's a \\nmatter for him. I have scheduled a visit, that has been longstanding with President Biden, where the logistics of \\norganising that for Sunday, is when we will depart from Canberra. The leaders who have visited, and I note this, the \\nleaders who have visited are members of the P5, the Permanent Members of the Security Council. The United \\nStates has a particular role in that, as does the United Kingdom, as does the other people who have visited there. \\nAnd President Biden's visit produced outcomes of negotiating through with different states, but also was \\naccompanied by a considerable security effort for President Biden. This is not a secure area. Our priority has been \\nto engage and I've engaged, I've met personally with the Israeli Ambassador. I had him to my residence and had a \\ndiscussion. I've had discussions with leaders of the Palestinian community, leaders of the Jewish community here \\nin Australia, as well. The decision of the Leader of the Opposition to raise such an issue publicly, that's a matter for \\nhim. But at this point in time, I have no plans to visit the Middle East, and in terms of the security agencies as well, \\nthere's no disagreement from the position that I've taken.\\nJOURNALIST: From Joe Biden's speech, what are your thoughts, more specifically on these comments, that if we \\nwalk away and let Putin erase Ukraine's independence, would be aggressors, would be emboldened to try and do \\nthe same possibly in the Pacific and the Middle East more broadly?\\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, we're there with the people of Ukraine because the actions of Vladimir Putin, of invading, \\nillegally the sovereign state of Ukraine, is an attack on the international rule of law and on respect for national \\nboundaries and national sovereignty. That's why Australia has been a significant contributor to the struggle in \\nUkraine. And that's why we've provided support, including providing comfort and refuge for people fleeing Ukraine. \\nSimilarly, our priority hasn't been to get people into the Middle East, it's been to get people out of the Middle East. \\nAustralian citizens, is what we've been concentrating on, rather than having a whole contingent go into an area \\nwhich is clearly very volatile, to say the least. It's a state of war, is going on. The people of Ukraine are showing \\nextraordinary courage, extraordinary courage, and I support President Biden's call to continue to engage, to show \\nresolve. Australia will continue to be a part of the support for the people of Ukraine, for as long as it is required, \\nbecause this isn't just a struggle about what occurs in Ukraine.

      "- **Cultural Resonance:** Aly’s engagement with **Hilltop Hoods and Mohamed Ramadan** is more informal but helps shape her public persona and relatability.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Stakeholders with Direct Influence on Anne Aly**\n",
      "- **Islamophobia Register Australia** (Supportive): Their reports and advocacy align with Aly’s policy goals, strengthening her credibility on minority rights.\n",
      "- **Leila Naja Hibri & Thomas Puttick** (Supportive): Their work in sustainable fashion aligns with Aly’s environmental advocacy, reinforcing her progressive credentials.\n",
      "- **Barack & Michelle Obama** (Supportive but Indirect): Their past engagement with Aly enhances her credibility, though they do not actively shape her policies.\n",
      "- **Edith Cowan’s Legacy** (Symbolic Influence): As the first female politician in Australia, her legacy reinforces Aly’s role as a political pioneer, particularly in representing the seat named after Cowan.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Factors That Could Shift Stakeholder Stances**\n",
      "- **Public Controversies**: If Aly’s policies or statements on minority rights become controversial, **Islamophobia Register Australia** may either increase their support or distance themselves to maintain neutrality.\n",
      "- **Political Climate**: If sustainability becomes a more prominent political issue, **Leila Naja Hibri and Thomas Puttick** may take a more active role in supporting Aly’s initiatives.\n",
      "- **Media Narratives**: If Aly’s engagement with cultural figures like **Mohamed Ramadan** is framed negatively in the media, it could impact her public perception and require strategic messaging adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "By strategically managing these relationships, Aly can enhance her political credibility, strengthen advocacy efforts, and connect with a broader audience while mitigating potential risks.\n",
