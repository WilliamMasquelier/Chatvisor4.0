Western Australia's Labor Treasurer has warned of the risks of further unionisation in the Pilbara amid complaints 
about rising union activity at mine sites across the state following the -Albanese government's industrial relations 
changes.
And the WA Greens have revealed that they will expect WA Labor to come to the party on major climate and 
environmental reforms in the event they secure the balance of power in the upper house at next month's election, 
including a potential multi-billion-dollar levy on the state's gas industry.
Speaking at a business breakfast in Perth, Treasurer Rita Saffioti said WA's resources sector was fundamental to 
the national economy and had a positive record of continually advancing conditions for workers in the Pilbara and 
across the state.
"We want to make sure that what has been a very, very good relationship throughout the resource sector continues 
and we want to continue to support West Australian resource projects, make sure that they continue to be profitable 
and work well for the national economy," she said.
"It's one of those issues that as a state we want to make sure that we continually raise with the federal government, 
that WA and our resources sector have very, very good track records in most instances, and continue to make sure 
that we can get that balance right." Ms Saffioti noted that workers in WA's mining industry had been able to secure 
major improvements to rosters and conditions in the years leading up to the Albanese government's changes.
"The federal government has its agenda, and we very much -always want to put forward the WA nuances, the fact 
that WA has been getting the balance right when it comes to -industrial relations and also, in particular, the 
environment," she said.
WA Labor has already been at loggerheads with the Albanese government over its proposed -nature positive laws, 
with Premier Roger Cook having twice -directly and successfully lobbied the Prime Minister to abandon the reforms.

week blamed Canberra for a shortage of GPs that has in turn increased the pressure on WA's embattled health 
system.
WA's iron ore industry is the biggest in the world. The sector underpins the state's economy and pumps more than 
$9bn a year of royalties into Treasury coffers.
Despite Ms Saffioti's note of caution, Mr Cook downplayed the risks to the mining sector from the IR changes. "I 
know that our resources companies in the Pilbara work very closely with their workforce and their workforce 
representatives," he said. "We want people, the unions, to work with the companies to make sure that they get 
great outcome for their members and great outcomes for their industry." Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA 
chief executive Peter Cock told The Australian that the federal government's collective bargaining changes had 
allowed the unions to gain a foothold in the Pilbara "for the first time in 30 years".
"There are already some worrying signs that the unions are beginning to flex their muscles in Western Australia's 
mining heartland," he said.
"Based on what we're hearing from our members, right-of-entry requests for union access to mine sites in the 
Pilbara have exploded since these laws came into effect." He said workers had been negotiating directly with their 
employers without union interference for decades, and had become some of the safest and best-paid mine workers 
in the world. Federal Workplace Relations Minister Murray Watt said: "Helping WA mine workers earn more also 
helps the WA economy. The Albanese government supports the rights of workers and employers to negotiate pay 
and conditions, and works productively with the WA government to deliver this."

The Western Australian government has taken aim at "nerdy little bureaucrats in Canberra" after federal 
Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek again delayed her decision on an extension of the North West Shelf LNG 
project.
Ms Plibersek has requested another 30 days to make her call on the Woodside Energy-led project, which has 
become a target for climate activists as well as some in her own party over its emissions footprint.
That means she is now not required to make a decision until late March, giving rise to concerns a decision may be 
delayed until after the next federal election. With polls pointing to a likely hung parliament, there is growing 
speculation the North West Shelf extension could be used as a bargaining chip by the Greens or teals in any future 
deal with Labor.
The WA Labor government has been a strong advocate for the state's gas industry and has already approved the 
extension.
Responding to claims that a lack of documentation from WA had forced the deferral of Ms Plibersek's decision, 
state Energy Minister Reece Whitby on Thursday said WA had responded swiftly to a request for more detail from 
the federal department.
"There was a request on the 29th of January for additional more information. On the fifth of February, which is five 
days later excluding the weekend, we had sought that information, gathered it up, made sure it was accurate, and 
passed it back to Canberra. Five days. I mean, seriously. That is an efficient, acceptable turnaround," Mr Whitby 
said.
"I suspect that there's a nerdy little bureaucrat in an agency in Canberra somewhere who's trying to cover his butt. 
That's my suspicion."
The WA government was also a thorn in the side of Ms Plibersek's proposed Nature Positive laws, which were 
killed off not once but twice after strong pushback from WA Premier Roger Cook.

Mr Cook on Thursday said he believed his government had given all the relevant details to Ms Plibersek's 
department.
"This is the same department, don't forget, that said that we should have 40km/h zones on Pilbara highways," he 
said.
"So lord knows what's going on there, but I'm very confident that we provided all the information when it was 
requested."
The North West Shelf decision is the latest point of tension between the Albanese and Cook governments, following 
Nature Positive, industrial relations laws, the federal government's ban on live sheep exports, and its efforts to 
ensure adequate numbers of GPs in the west.
Mr Cook said he would always stand up for WA.
"I always do what is right for WA and make sure that Western Australians' interests are always represented in 
Canberra, making sure they understand we are the engine room of the nation's economy," he said.
"You hurt Western Australian industry, you hurt the national economy. And so we'll continue to stand up whenever 
it's required to make sure that we continue to advocate for WA."
While Mr Albanese has been a frequent visitor to WA during his time as Prime Minister, he has not yet visited Perth 
during the official state election campaign.
Mr Cook confirmed that Mr Albanese would not be in Perth for Labor's official campaign launch this weekend, but 
said he expected to see the Prime Minister visit the state before the March 8 election.

Teal independent Kate Chaney has walked back her position on Woodside Energy's North West Shelf project, 
saying she would now be open to the project going ahead if it was subject to certain conditions.
Days after stating that locking in the North West Shelf to 2070 as proposed by Woodside Energy was 
"unacceptable", exacerbating growing industry fears about the risks to the sector from a potential minority 
government relying on the support of the Greens or the teals, Ms Chaney on Thursday issued a statement saying 
she was "not opposed" to the project going ahead.
She said she would support the development subject to several conditions, including "the full social and 
environmental cost of carbon" being factored in. She also said environmental and Aboriginal heritage impacts must 
be properly addressed. 
"This is not about politics - it's about making good, long-term decisions. We owe it to future generations to ensure 
that any approvals are based on facts, science and a vision for WA's economic future - not scare campaigns," Ms 
Chaney said.
She had previously labelled the WA government's approval of the North West Shelf as a "terrible" decision and 
urged federal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek to "knock it back".
Less than a fortnight ago, Ms Chaney joined a delegation from advocacy groups opposed to the North West Shelf 
extension, including Save Our Songlines, Friends of Australian Rock Art and the Australian Conservation 
Foundation, at Parliament House in Canberra. At a press conference held alongside the delegation, Ms Chaney 
described how the proposed extension was putting the rock art of the surrounding Burrup Peninsula "at risk". 
In Thursday's statement, Ms Chaney said she would not use the North West Shelf in any future negotiations over 
minority government.

"The idea that I would hold the country to ransom over a single gas project is absolute nonsense. It's a desperate 
attempt to create fear and distract from the real conversation we need to have about our energy future," Ms Chaney 
said.
"I want to be really clear - I won't be using a single project, or industry or issue as a bargaining chip if I find myself 
being part of any minority government discussions."
Ms Chaney's shift came less than a day after polling in Ms Chaney's seat of Curtin commissioned by the oil and gas 
sector showed Liberal candidate Tom White holding a commanding lead in the traditionally blue-ribbon seat.
The polling also found strong support for the gas industry in the electorate. That support extended to Ms Chaney's 
own declared supporters, with 48 per cent of those saying they were supportive of the industry and only 27 per cent 
saying they opposed it. 
Ms Chaney said she did not support shutting down the gas industry, but believed WA "needs to be more ambitious 
in planning for what comes next".
"We have a history of taking on big challenges with vision - just like in the 1960s when long-term planning unlocked 
WA's gas industry. Now, we need the same level of ambition to ensure WA isn't left behind in the global energy 
shift," she said
"The choice isn't between gas and nothing. The real question is whether we're thinking ahead and setting WA up for 
future success - or just clinging to the past out of fear."
Mr White told The Australian he was "surprised and confused" by Ms Chaney's changing positions on the project. 
"This indecision and obstruction simply highlights the risk that the teals' radical agenda poses to our economy," he 
said. 
"Let's not forget that the state government has spent six years reviewing this project and they've approved it. The 
teals are all over the place, and pose a huge risk to local jobs and living standards."
Samantha McCulloch, the chief executive of oil and gas peak body Australian Energy Producers, said an 
"overwhelming majority" of WA voters wanted their MP to support the gas industry. 
"For years Kate Chaney has aligned herself with the Greens in calling for no new gas projects, and as recently as 
December she was calling on the federal government to 'knock back' the North West Shelf approval," Ms 
McCulloch said. 
"Western Australians would be right to be confused about where she stands after her comments."
Federal Resources Minister Madeleine King said the North West Shelf had been important for the WA economy "on 
any objective measure". 
"Approvals on this project will be made on the basis of law and proper process," Ms King said.  "Good process is 
the opposite of dysfunction."
