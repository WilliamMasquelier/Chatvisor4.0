The extraordinarily lopsided nature of politics in \nWestern Australia since Mark McGowan's record-breaking 2021 win means we enter the formal four-week state \nelection campaign with little doubt - or no doubt - about the outcome of this contest.\nWhile modern politics has taught us all to be wary of unequivocally declaring likely outcomes too early, the \nmagnitude of the challenge facing the WA Liberals and their leader, Libby Mettam, is simply so large it is difficult to \nforesee a scenario that does not see Labor return for a third term after March 8.\nEven if the Liberals were to secure a 10 per cent swing - the sort of move that would typically prove decisive in most \nelections - they would not even be halfway towards the more than 23 per cent swing they need to claim \ngovernment.\nIt seems at this stage that the only two people who, at least based on their public comments, are not certain about \nthe likely outcome next month are the two main combatants: Premier Roger Cook and Mettam.\nMettam deserves credit for her continued efforts to try to make a fist of the election, something she has had to do \nwith only a handful of parliamentary colleagues, a meagre staff, and an alliance partner in the Nationals with whom \nher party has not exactly enjoyed a rosy relationship.\nCook's branding of his opponents on Wednesday as the \"laziest Liberals in the country\" seemed particularly unfair \non Mettam, who for all her limitations is at least continuing to throw herself into what looks to be a hopeless task.\nShe continues to insist the election is there to be won, a stance necessitated by voter response when Zak Kirkup \nconceded the 2021 election weeks before polling day.\nCook, meanwhile, knows that one of the big risks to his job is the hubris that can creep into governments seeking a \nthird term. Labor came to power in 2017 after successfully painting Colin Barnett and his government as arrogant; \nfor months, Cook has been drilling into his MPs the need to not take anything for granted, especially the election \noutcome.\nPage 2 of 2\nDespite leaders' pep talks, there's no doubt where this is headed\nArguably the most interesting dimension of this race is what, if anything, it will say about the standing of Anthony \nAlbanese and federal Labor. The government's flirtations with nature-positive laws and the live sheep export bans \ncaused angst in the west. Just as Albanese leveraged off McGowan's popularity in the west in 2022, so too can \nMettam et al leverage off Albanese's unpopularity in 2025.\nLoad-Date: February 5, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Cook \nled the fight against those reforms, amid fears it would curtail WA's world-leading mining industry, and has already \ntwice compelled Albanese to back-pedal on those plans. Just last month, he was taking aim at Labor backbenchers \npushing for Nature Positive as east coast latte-sippers.\nCook was far less effective in his advocacy for the state's sheep farmers against the Albanese government's live \nexports ban, although the comparatively small scale of that industry should limit the electoral damage.\nThe Prime Minister has made nearly 30 visits to WA since his election, but it is unlikely state Labor would be \nencouraging any more trips -before election day on March 8. Certainly you are far more likely to find Albanese's \nface on Liberal campaigning mat-erial than that of Labor.\nAs for WA Liberals, it says a lot about their dismal position that there will be some in the party breathing a sigh of \nrelief at these Newspoll numbers.\nPage 2 of 2\nNumbers prompt Premier to distance himself\nThe 56-44 two-party--preferred result could cause the head of an opposition leader to roll in most other states, but \nin WA it shows that the party has clawed back some ground since the Covid wipe-out of 2021. Many in the party \nwould grab right now any result that delivers them 10 or more lower-house seats, given the fear among some that \nthe party will still be in an unelectable position in 2029.\nLoad-Date: February 6, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Supporters of Mr Zempilas late \nlast year attempted to roll Ms Mettam for the prominent \"Perthonality\", but it was all smiles between the pair as Mr \nZempilas spoke glowingly of the \"remarkable\" job his leader was doing.\nLabor's targeting of him, he said, was an attempt to distract from its own shortcomings.\n\"If you hear the Premier or a minister mention my name, they are doing that because they want you to take your \neye off their chronic un-delivery,\" he said. \"They have botched health, the cost of living is through the roof. They use \nmy name as a diversionary tactic to take people's eye away from the ball, and they do that by playing the man and \nnot the ball.\" Mr Zempilas is the red-hot favourite to claim the seat of Churchlands in Perth's wealthy western \nsuburbs, one of a host of once blue-ribbon seats lost in the extraordinary 2021 loss to Mark McGowan.\nWhile Ms Mettam hit out at the \"cowards in the shadows\" in the aftermath of last year's failed leadership coup, she \nsaid Mr Zempilas was an important part of the Liberals' election push.\n\"He's an asset to our team and Roger Cook will do anything to distract from his own failings and appalling record in \ngovernment,\" she said. \"Let's not forget as either health minister or Premier, Roger Cook is responsible for breaking \nPage 2 of 2\nLabor turns state election spotlight on 'polarising' Liberal mayor Zempilas\nour state's health system.\" Mr Zempilas' defence of his leader came after Mr Cook on Saturday attacked the \nLiberals as the \"laziest opposition\" in WA history.\nThe Premier was highly critical of Ms Mettam's decision not to appear before the main press pack on Saturday, \nchoosing to campaign in WA's southwest, including her own seat of Vasse. On Sunday he said the \"lazy\" slur was \nnot directed at Ms Mettam personally.\nMr Zempilas said Mr Cook should be \"embarrassed\" by his criticism of Ms Mettam. \"Libby Mettam has been \noutnumbered with a massive shortage of resources through no fault of her own, and the extraordinary job she has \ndone to lead the Liberal Party with a lack of resources and a lack of team members is nothing short of inspiring for \nall of the Liberal candidates,\" he said. Both parties announced health policies on Sunday: Labor promising $104m \nfor a new emergency department at the ageing Royal Perth Hospital, the Liberals unveiling a plan to reduce \nambulance ramping by covering the cost of diverting non-urgent cases to urgent care clinics.\nLoad-Date: February 9, 2025\nEnd of Document",

The sector underpins the state's economy and pumps more than \n$9bn a year of royalties into Treasury coffers.\nDespite Ms Saffioti's note of caution, Mr Cook downplayed the risks to the mining sector from the IR changes. \"I \nknow that our resources companies in the Pilbara work very closely with their workforce and their workforce \nrepresentatives,\" he said. \"We want people, the unions, to work with the companies to make sure that they get \ngreat outcome for their members and great outcomes for their industry.\" Chamber of Commerce and Industry WA \nchief executive Peter Cock told The Australian that the federal government's collective bargaining changes had \nallowed the unions to gain a foothold in the Pilbara \"for the first time in 30 years\".\n\"There are already some worrying signs that the unions are beginning to flex their muscles in Western Australia's \nmining heartland,\" he said.\n\"Based on what we're hearing from our members, right-of-entry requests for union access to mine sites in the \nPilbara have exploded since these laws came into effect.\" He said workers had been negotiating directly with their \nemployers without union interference for decades, and had become some of the safest and best-paid mine workers \nin the world. Federal Workplace Relations Minister Murray Watt said: \"Helping WA mine workers earn more also \nhelps the WA economy. The Albanese government supports the rights of workers and employers to negotiate pay \nand conditions, and works productively with the WA government to deliver this.\"\nLoad-Date: February 13, 2025\nEnd of Document",

The three violent offenders - including one convicted murderer - will be given 30-\nyear visas, accommodation and working rights.\nThe announcement has triggered concern among immigration lawyers, with the legality of the agreement \nconsidered -almost certain to be challenged all the way to the High Court.\nIt could also have implications for the numerous cases of con-victed foreign offenders seeking to have the \nrevocation of their Australian visas overturned through the Administrative Review Tribunal. Immigration lawyer \nAlison Battisson told The Australian that \"significant and perhaps determinative weight\" should now be placed on \nthe prospect of individuals being removed to Nauru when the ART weighs up whether to -reinstate the cancelled \nvisas of foreign offenders.\n\"It actually goes towards weight for a decision that the person should be allowed to remain in Australia, because of \nthe adverse impacts on people who have forced migration to Nauru,\" she said. \"There's all sorts of reports on the \nterrible mental and physical health of forced migration to Nauru.\" But she noted that while the Nauru deal might help \nthose currently fighting in the ART, the -immigration minister would still have the ultimate power to overturn any \nART visa decision if they saw fit.\nMs Battisson said the removals to Nauru were likely to be challenged on the constitutionality of the legislation, and \nwhether the power under that legislation had been exercised reasonably. She also noted that the removals could \nhave ramifications in Nauru, with Australia effectively treating the nation \"as a penal colony\".\nPage 2 of 2\nNauru deal 'a gift for foreign criminals'\nNauru is only 21sq km in size and is home to fewer than 13,000 people. Adjusted for population size, the \nintroduction of three foreign violent offenders into Nauru is the equivalent of 6000 such -offenders arriving in \nAustralia.\nGreg Barns SC from the Australian Lawyers Alliance agreed that lawyers would be \"examining the possibility\" of \nusing the Nauru removals to support the case for foreign criminals to have their visas reinstated. He said the deal \ncould also pose a risk to social -cohesion inside Nauru.\n\"We're talking about a country that's impoverished and which has become a dumping ground for Australia,\" he said.\n\"People don't generally -migrate to Nauru voluntarily, because there's nothing there for them. It's a failed state.\" \nAsylum Seeker Resource Centre deputy chief executive Jana Favero said the government's -announcement set a \ndangerous precedent.\n\"There has to be consideration of the lawfulness of banishing people offshore, when they've been living as part of \nour community - it's a complete disregard of people's human rights,\" she said.\n\"To send people to Nauru is a life sentence and we are considering all options, including legal challenges, and will \ncontinue to fight for people's rights.\" While the government believes that the legislation underpinning the Nauru deal \nis robust, Mr Burke on Sunday acknowledged that the government would probably end up having to defend it in \ncourt. \"A little fun fact, there are more legal cases against the immigration minister than any other minister in the \nAustralian government. -Always has been, always will be,\" Mr Burke said.\n\"I simply, whenever I make any decision, presume that there'll be a contest in the courts. And we will go in there in \na very strong position as a commonwealth dealing exactly with the legislation that the parliament passed to be able \nto send people to third countries.\" The cost of the Nauru arrangement to Australian taxpayers is not being disclosed \nby the -government.\nLoad-Date: February 17, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Ms Pearce died as a result of her injuries and the Uber driver is in intensive care \nwith two broken legs and a broken arm.\nDr Bellinge is a high-profile obstetrician and the son Bruce Bellinge, who himself is a prominent doctor who owns \nConcept Fertility.\nBruce Bellinge is married to Megan Wynne, providing her with early-stage funding to build and expand her disability \nemployment group, APM Human Services International, that would float on the Australian Securities Exchange and \nmake the couple billionaires.\nThe company was acquired by private equity shortly after it suffered a collapse in value last year. At its peak the \ncouple were worth more than $1bn.\nDr Bellinge's lawyer, Tony Hager, said Bruce Bellinge had been by his son's side in hospital since the incident.\nRhys Bellinge was allegedly driving at 130km/h and had a blood-alcohol content of almost four times the legal limit \ndriving from his wife's Nedlands home to his parents' palatial home on Jutland Pde through the suburb of Dalkeith \non Saturday night. He has been charged with manslaughter and dangerous driving.\nDashcam footage from the vehicle captured Dr Bellinge screaming and shouting about his estranged wife in the \nmoments leading up to the accident. His lawyer, Mr Hager, on Tuesday told the court the language used by his \nclient about his wife was \"unflattering\" and \"disgraceful\".\nMr Hager said Dr Bellinge and his family were willing to put up a $1m surety to secure bail. He proposed the bail be \nconditional on Dr Bellinge being confined to his father's home and abstaining from alcohol.\nPage 2 of 2\nTycoon's doctor son makes $1m bid for freedom days after deadly crash\nHe denied his client was a flight risk, citing his lack of prior convictions, the fact his two daughters go to school in \nPerth, and the injuries he suffered in the accident. He said Dr Bellinge had suffered a fracture to his L3 vertebrae.\nPolice prosecutors opposed bail, telling the court Dr Bellinge had attempted to minimise his actions in the \nimmediate aftermath of the crash.\nBody-worn camera footage allegedly shows him saying the other vehicle had \"cleaned me up\". About 40 minutes \nafter the crash, Dr Bellinge was filmed denying responsibility for it.\nThe prosecutor said the footage captured Dr Bellinge saying, \"wait a minute, wait a minute, they came out of \nnowhere. Why the f..k am I the bad guy here, I only had two beers\", and describing his driving as \"routine\".\nThe prosecutor said the crash had occurred as a result of Dr Bellinge \"not being able to control his behaviour\".\nMagistrate Clare Cullen said she was concerned about the \"disproportionate emotional upset\" Dr Bellinge had \ndisplayed since the breakdown of his marriage.\n\"I remain concerned about what is going on in the background,\" she said. \"Separations happen every day, this \nbehaviour does not.\" Ms Cullen will hand down her decision on Dr Bellinge's bail application on Wednesday Mr \nHager told the court Dr Bellinge's marriage had broken down on January 11, and the obstetrician left the family \nhome at that time. The pair had undergone marriage counselling between February 3 and 14.\nThe prosecutor said police had been attempting to talk to Dr Bellinge's wife but she had so far not wanted to speak \nto police.\nMs Pearce was the daughter of a geophysicist and nurse who was just metres from her family home when the car \nshe was in was hit.\nHer family issued a statement describing their heartbreak over Ms Pearce's death. \"Our world is shattered. Our \nbeautiful, bright girl brought sunshine to our lives and we are now in darkness,\" they said.\nLoad-Date: February 18, 2025\nEnd of Document",

The \nNationals are in the unusual position of being the official opposition party in WA after the Liberals could secure only \ntwo of 59 lower house seats in the historic 2021 election rout.\nThis election has also given rise to the odd situation of incumbent Nationals and Liberals MPs fighting for one seat. \nOpposition Leader Shane Love is battling his former Nationals colleague Merome Beard for the new seat of Mid-\nWest, after large parts of Mr Love's seat of Moore were merged with parts of Ms Beard's now-abolished North West \nCentral. Ms Beard defected from the Nationals to the Liberals shortly before the abolition of North West Central was \nconfirmed.\nLabor's decision to preference the Liberals over the Nationals in Mid-West could prove critical if Labor finishes third, \nalthough Mr Love told The Australian that he was confident that the fight for the seat would come down to a battle \nbetween him and Labor.\n\"I think it'll be a National-Labor contest, the same as it's been for the last two or three terms,\" he said.\nThe Nationals have been critical of gun reforms introduced by the Cook government and supported by the Liberals, \nand Mr Love said he was now used to seeing Labor doing as much as it could to hurt the Nationals' prospects.\nPage 2 of 2\nPreference deals spell trouble for teal, headaches for Nats\n\"They have actually taken a pretty strategic view in recent years to try not to help us in any way, because I think \nthey find that once a National holds a seat it becomes a bit harder to pry it away,\" he said.\nThe Nationals and Liberals have had an uneasy relationship during the last term of parliament, with the parties at \nodds over how to carve up the already limited resources of opposition. That partnership has been further frayed due \nto Ms Beard's defection and the Nationals' targeting of city seats. In Fremantle, meanwhile, the Liberals have \ndecided to preference incumbent Labor MP and Water Minister Simone McGurk over the Greens and Climate 200-\nbacked independent Kate Hulett.\nMs McGurk has come under pressure in Fremantle from voters eager to see more action from the Cook \ngovernment on climate.\nWhile the Liberals put Labor second-last in Fremantle in 2021, the party has now put Ms McGurk ahead of the \nLegalise Cannabis, Animal Justice and Greens parties as well as Ms Hulett. Liberal preferences are particularly \nrelevant in Fremantle given the party's third-place finish at the most recent election. It is understood the Liberals \nmade the decision based on principle, with the benefit of seeing Ms McGurk lose in Fremantle offset by the \nprospect of a vocal anti-gas MP taking her spot. Ms Hulett -accused Labor and the Liberals of a \"dirty deal\" to save \nMs McGurk.\nLoad-Date: February 18, 2025\nEnd of Document",

With polls pointing to a likely hung parliament, there is growing \nspeculation the North West Shelf extension could be used as a bargaining chip by the Greens or teals in any future \ndeal with Labor.\nThe WA Labor government has been a strong advocate for the state's gas industry and has already approved the \nextension.\nResponding to claims that a lack of documentation from WA had forced the deferral of Ms Plibersek's decision, \nstate Energy Minister Reece Whitby on Thursday said WA had responded swiftly to a request for more detail from \nthe federal department.\n\"There was a request on the 29th of January for additional more information. On the fifth of February, which is five \ndays later excluding the weekend, we had sought that information, gathered it up, made sure it was accurate, and \npassed it back to Canberra. Five days.

She also said environmental and Aboriginal heritage impacts must \nbe properly addressed. \n\"This is not about politics - it's about making good, long-term decisions. We owe it to future generations to ensure \nthat any approvals are based on facts, science and a vision for WA's economic future - not scare campaigns,\" Ms \nChaney said.\nShe had previously labelled the WA government's approval of the North West Shelf as a \"terrible\" decision and \nurged federal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek to \"knock it back\".\nLess than a fortnight ago, Ms Chaney joined a delegation from advocacy groups opposed to the North West Shelf \nextension, including Save Our Songlines, Friends of Australian Rock Art and the Australian Conservation \nFoundation, at Parliament House in Canberra. At a press conference held alongside the delegation, Ms Chaney \ndescribed how the proposed extension was putting the rock art of the surrounding Burrup Peninsula \"at risk\". \nIn Thursday's statement, Ms Chaney said she would not use the North West Shelf in any future negotiations over \nminority government.\nPage 2 of 3\nChaney backflips on gas opposition\n\"The idea that I would hold the country to ransom over a single gas project is absolute nonsense. It's a desperate \nattempt to create fear and distract from the real conversation we need to have about our energy future,\" Ms Chaney \nsaid.\n\"I want to be really clear - I won't be using a single project, or industry or issue as a bargaining chip if I find myself \nbeing part of any minority government discussions.\"\nMs Chaney's shift came less than a day after polling in Ms Chaney's seat of Curtin commissioned by the oil and gas \nsector showed Liberal candidate Tom White holding a commanding lead in the traditionally blue-ribbon seat.\nThe polling also found strong support for the gas industry in the electorate. That support extended to Ms Chaney's \nown declared supporters, with 48 per cent of those saying they were supportive of the industry and only 27 per cent \nsaying they opposed it. \nMs Chaney said she did not support shutting down the gas industry, but believed WA \"needs to be more ambitious \nin planning for what comes next\".\n\"We have a history of taking on big challenges with vision - just like in the 1960s when long-term planning unlocked \nWA's gas industry. Now, we need the same level of ambition to ensure WA isn't left behind in the global energy \nshift,\" she said\n\"The choice isn't between gas and nothing. The real question is whether we're thinking ahead and setting WA up for \nfuture success - or just clinging to the past out of fear.\"\nMr White told The Australian he was \"surprised and confused\" by Ms Chaney's changing positions on the project. \n\"This indecision and obstruction simply highlights the risk that the teals' radical agenda poses to our economy,\" he \nsaid. \n\"Let's not forget that the state government has spent six years reviewing this project and they've approved it. The \nteals are all over the place, and pose a huge risk to local jobs and living standards.\"\nSamantha McCulloch, the chief executive of oil and gas peak body Australian Energy Producers, said an \n\"overwhelming majority\" of WA voters wanted their MP to support the gas industry. \n\"For years Kate Chaney has aligned herself with the Greens in calling for no new gas projects, and as recently as \nDecember she was calling on the federal government to 'knock back' the North West Shelf approval,\" Ms \nMcCulloch said. \n\"Western Australians would be right to be confused about where she stands after her comments.\"\nFederal Resources Minister Madeleine King said the North West Shelf had been important for the WA economy \"on \nany objective measure\". \n\"Approvals on this project will be made on the basis of law and proper process,\" Ms King said.  \"Good process is \nthe opposite of dysfunction.\"\nNotes\nDocument links may not lead to an active page.

They will then head to Queensland for ceremonies in Brisbane on Sunday and Toowoomba on Tuesday. \nA massive ceremony was held at Sydney Olympic Park last Friday.\nThe Coalition has accused Labor of using the ceremonies to sign up new voters who will be favourable to the \ngovernment for having granted them citizenship.\nAs Mr Burke told the audience of new citizens that they would \"make Australia even better\", Labor's MP for \nHasluck, Tania Lawrence, used her address to \u00adremind the crowd of the new boundaries in her electorate. \nMeanwhile, purple vest-clad Australian Electoral Commission officials immediately outside the auditorium were kept \nbusy by newly sworn-in Australians wanting to enrol to vote. \nAnthony Albanese is due to call a federal poll within weeks. \nThose sworn in on Thursday came from 60 different countries and ranged in age from two to 93. As he had done in \nceremonies on the east coast, Mr Burke led the swearing-in process.\n\"In a few minutes time, Australia's going to be an even better country than it is right now, and that's because of \nyou,\" the Home Affairs Minister told the audience.\nPage 2 of 2\nTony's tour: Minister for New Voters takes Labor's citizenship spree national\n\"In a few minute's time, your history, your heritage, your customs, your skills and your dreams for the future, they're \nall going to become part of Australia's story.\"\nEach of the federal MPs at Thursday's event had an opportunity to address the new citizens.\nSam Lim, whose electorate of Tangney is the most marginal Labor-held seat in the state, recounted to the audience \nhis own story of growing up in Malaysia with a mud floor, kerosene lighting and no toilet, before moving to Australia \nbecoming a police officer and ultimately an MP.\nMr Goodenough faces an uphill task to be re-elected in the seat of Moore, but his preferences could well end up \nsending the electorate to Labor if he can secure enough of the primary vote. He too recounted his migration story, \nwhich saw him move to Perth from Singapore and succeed in business before entering politics.\nLabor's strong result in the west at the 2022 federal election and the recent defection of Mr Goodenough mean \nthere are no Liberal MPs in the Perth metropolitan area. Labor's ability to hold on to those gains in the west will go a \nlong way to determining if the party can remain in government.\nA Home Affairs spokesman said the Perth ceremony was one of 25 between February 17 and March 4. \"The \nobjective is to provide as many approved applicants as possible the opportunity to attend a ceremony and become \nan Australian citizen,\" he said.\nNotes\nDocument links may not lead to an active page.
