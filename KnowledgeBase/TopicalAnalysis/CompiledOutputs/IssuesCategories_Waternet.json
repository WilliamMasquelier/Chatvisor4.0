            "- **Financial, Cybersecurity, and IT Problems:** Waternet is facing significant financial problems, cybersecurity issues, and IT problems affecting the collection of water board taxes and drinkwater bills.

Only 8% of 2022 tax assessments had been issued by the end of that year. The water board has resorted to short-term loans to cover the shortfall, incurring millions in additional interest payments.

Lex van Drooge, CDA candidate for the water board elections, criticizes Waternet's handling of the situation, describing it as a \"mess\" and calling for accountability. The article also mentions Waternet's increased debt due to borrowing to cover expenses, and the organization being placed under stricter supervision by the Inspection for the Living Environment and Transport. Concerns are raised about insufficient oversight and a lack of responsibility within the organization.

(De Telegraaf, February 15, 2023)",

            "- **Inaccurate Billing and Tariff Calculation Errors:** Het Parool reports that Waternet's method of calculating drinking water tariffs is riddled with errors, leading to overcharging of large consumers. The Authority for Consumers & Markets (ACM) identified deficiencies in six out of thirteen assessments and recommended increased scrutiny of Waternet's practices.  The article notes that this follows similar issues found the previous year, indicating a persistent problem. (Het Parool, August 14, 2023)",
            "- **Failed Remote Bridge Control Project and Financial Mismanagement:** Waternet's \u20ac30.3 million project to remotely control bridges and locks has failed due to safety and cybersecurity issues, including incidents with a cyclist and a catamaran. The system is offline, bridges are manually operated, and Waternet has spent an additional \u20ac70,000 renting back bridge houses previously converted to hotel rooms, plus millions more on temporary control rooms and extra staff. The total cost now exceeds \u20ac40 million. The project is criticized for prioritizing cost-cutting over safety and fostering a \"culture of social insecurity\" among staff.

            "- **Waternet's bridge house rentals questioned amid concerns of rising costs for users:**  The SP is demanding an explanation from the city council regarding Waternet's spending on temporary bridge control facilities after a failed automation project.  Waternet spent \u20ac70,000 in 2021 and 2022 renting back bridge houses previously leased to a hotel chain.  The SP is concerned these costs will be passed on to users through increased water board taxes. SP council member Erik Bobeldijk states, \"Keer op keer is het problematisch bij Waternet\" (\"Time and again, it's problematic at Waternet\"), highlighting a pattern of issues within the organization.

The article notes the irony of dissolving an organization created to streamline these very tasks. While acknowledging Waternet's role in preventing a flood, the article emphasizes the severity of the ongoing issues. The collaboration within Waternet is described as \"kwetsbaar\" (vulnerable).

            "- **\"Failing\" Waternet to be dismantled after years of mismanagement:** Het Parool reports Waternet's dismantling after years of financial setbacks, tax and bill collection problems, and management issues.  The article highlights an \u20ac80 million shortfall in water tax collection, chaotic drinking water bill collection, maintenance backlogs, and a series of temporary management changes linked to dissatisfaction with the organization's performance.  Concerns are raised about the potential cost of the \"untangling\" process, estimated to be significantly higher than the allocated \u20ac2 million, and the water board's already negative equity of \u20ac16.1 million. The works council expresses skepticism about the effectiveness of the dissolution. (Het Parool, May 31, 2024)",
            "- Despite initial promises of \u20ac8 million annual savings and reliable drinking water, water prices rose by 8% a year after Waternet's inception.  The organization developed significant IT problems, hindering invoice collection. After director Kruize's 2022 departure, interim directors lacked confidence in Waternet's future. City council members neglected the increasingly crucial issue of water management amid climate change. (Het Parool, June 1, 2024)",
            "- **City Council Scrutiny over High Salaries and Potential Conflicts of Interest:** The Amsterdam City Council is demanding an explanation for the high interim management salaries at Waternet.  Council members express concern over the \"torenhoge salarissen\" (exorbitant salaries) and potential \"belangenverstrengeling\" (conflict of interest) due to interim financial director Kosman's connection with the Boer & Croon consultancy firm.

Hertzberger points out the irony of the public's positive perception of the \"fish doorbell\" as an example of advanced water management while the core infrastructure crumbles. The failed implementation of a new digital tax collection system is also mentioned, resulting in millions of euros in lost revenue. (NRC, August 5, 2023)",
            "- **Slow Emergency Response and Understaffing:** Waternet's emergency response to water leaks is criticized for being slow and inadequate, potentially worsening damage. The \"golden hour\" target of arriving on-site within an hour is often missed, especially at night, due to the elimination of the night shift and staff shortages. The Dijksgracht incident, where it took almost three hours to stop a major leak causing significant damage, exemplifies this issue.

The removal of wood is a point of contention, as it depletes nutrients vital for forest rejuvenation. Waternet's planting of non-native shrubs and use of fences are also criticized for hindering natural forest growth and negatively impacting local wildlife, including birds like the Eurasian Woodcock. The article highlights concerns that Waternet's actions violate a 2017 city council mandate requiring actions in the dunes to prioritize nature preservation.  The authors also accuse Waternet of misrepresenting the work as \"ongoing management\" to avoid needing permits and bypass scrutiny. (Het Parool, January 24, 2023)",

            "- **Poor Record-Keeping and Repeated Inspections:** Due to poor record-keeping, Waternet staff often repeated inspections of infrastructure because previous reports were lost.

A project leader ranked 9th on a scorecard was hired, while candidates ranked higher were not even interviewed. This candidate was recommended by a consultancy firm with the same owner as Boer & Croon.

            "- A letter to the editor expresses concern over the added VAT charges on Waternet's drinking water services, which will impact Weesp residents who get their water from PWN and thus pay for a service they don't receive.
