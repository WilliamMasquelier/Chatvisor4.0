Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1579 words\nHighlight: Parents face a 'triple whammy' with a sick child in daycare, missing work, paying fees, and then facing \nthe risk of getting sick themselves.\nBody\nWhen Fiona Maine drops one-year-old Freddy at his daycare centre, it annoys her if she notices another child \nlooking sickly.\n\"I have heard of many parents, if their kids are sick, they'll give them Panadol or Nurofen and send them off, \nknowing they'll have to go pick them up once it wears off. Just so they can have half a day of daycare, they can \nwork and get paid for it,\" she says.\nFreddy has been attending daycare in Sydney five days a week since he was four months old. The 31-year-old \npregnant mother of four cannot work in her tech support role while he is home.\n\"I can't take phone calls while looking after a baby. Honestly, he gets sick once every couple of weeks. [I feel] a bit \nrotted because we still have to pay for it.\"\nIt's a common complaint heard around the nation from parents with children in daycare who get sent home sick. Jay \nWeatherill, the former premier of South Australia, now leads early education campaign Thrive by Five and says \nparents with young children are stuck in an impossible position.\n\"Parents are doing it really tough right now through the spiralling cost-of-living, but it's a triple whammy for parents \nwhen their children are sick,\" he says.\n\"Not only are they caring for a sick child, which is stressful enough on its own, they are also grappling with the out-\nof-pocket costs for a day of childcare and the lost earnings or leave due to being unable to attend work.\"\nMelanie Allen is a Pilates instructor and works for herself while her children Henry, 3, and Edie, 10 months, attend \ndaycare in Adelaide.\n\"Money-wise, it's hard. And the daycare fee being so high makes it harder,\" Allen says.\n\"I never factored in how much it would cost in daycare to have them both in. And then I was like, why? Why, when \nschool is free? Why isn't daycare subsidised to the point that it's free as well?\nPage 2 of 4\n'Gastro seven times': How childcare hits parents with a triple whammy\n\"What burns is paying for them not to be there, staying home, and not getting paid. So, say I make $250 in a day; I \ndon't make that money, and then I also have to pay another $170.\n\"And then, knowing that might go through my second kid, and then also through me and then to my husband, \nbecause if one of us is sick, the other one's going to have to take off work so they can look after the kids. So it's just \na cycle, a vicious cycle.\"\nWeatherill says the early childhood education and care workforce is in crisis because of low pay, poor conditions \nand staff shortages as well as providers with ongoing overheads that they can't turn off when a child enrolled at \ntheir service is ill.\n\"What all this adds up to is a system in need of complete reform. Providers need certainty, early childhood \neducators need proper pay and conditions, parents need financial support and children need access to the \nenormous benefits that arise from participation in high quality early learning.\"\nGeorgie Dent, chief executive of The Parenthood, a campaign partner of Thrive by Five, says Australia needs to \nmove to a system that is more affordable for families and closer to the school experience.\n\"This would mean it's not a system where families are spending hundreds of dollars out of pocket on a day. And so \nit then would become less of an issue if your child was sick or not sick,\" she says.\nShayne Kuyper and his partner enrolled their two-year-old daughter, Poppy, in daycare when she was 13 months \nold. She had never been sick before daycare.\n\"She hasn't had a single week without coming home with something since,\" Kuyper says. \"She's had gastro seven \ntimes this year.\"\nThey navigate Poppy's sick days at their home in Melbourne by splitting the day in half.\n\"[My partner] will take her for the morning, and I'll take her for the afternoon. Which means that we've each missed \nhalf a day of work.\n\"It's painful that you still have to pay for these sick days. And you're allocated [52] days a year - beyond that, you \nlose your government subsidy. So, if we have more absent days, we pay the full rate. It's unavoidable; they'll get \nsick at daycare, but we're punished for it.\"\nNesha Hutchinson, vice-president of the Australian Childcare Alliance, says rostering staff for a position in a \nchildcare centre means it's impossible to avoid charging fees if a child is away sick.\n\"If there are 10 children in the preschool room, or five in the toddler's room, we have to pay for that staff member \nwhether or not the child turns up,\" Hutchinson says.\n\"If two children are sick on a day, does the staff member get paid 80 per cent of their wages because the children \nare off? That's important to consider, given that wages are the highest cost for a childcare centre. And we can't \noverbook like they do on planes, hotels or restaurants as it's illegal.\"\nHutchinson says \"educators get very sick, particularly in their first year in early education\", contributing to a high \nstaff turnover within the first year of employment.\nEmily Holmes, 25, is a childcare educator working in South East Melbourne. She says most of her fellow educators \nhave used their sick leave entitlements.\n\"We get sick quite a lot in general, but it is the same in every centre I've ever worked at,\" she says.\nFederal Early Childhood Education Minister Anne Aly said the childcare subsidy will continue to be paid for 52 \nabsences a year, after it was increased from 42 a year due to the pandemic.Page 3 of 4\n'Gastro seven times': How childcare hits parents with a triple whammy\n\"Supporting and growing the early childhood education and care workforce is critical to delivering our landmark \ncheaper childcare reforms - which is why we have a plan to deliver a stronger and sustainable early childhood \neducation workforce,\" she said in a statement.\nLink to Image\nJames Brickwood\n\"We're increasing the number of university spots, bringing forward fee-free TAFE places, changing the Fair Work \nAct to allow multi-employer bargaining and taking action to close the gender pay gap - all of which will benefit the \nearly childhood education sector.\"\nThe government has committed to a Productivity Commission review into the early childhood education and care \nsector, looking into how to improve affordability and access for families, including considering a universal 90 per \ncent Child Care Subsidy rate.\nElke Bremner has two sons in daycare in Sydney's West Killara. Her husband, Seth, is often overseas for work, \nleaving her in a tough spot when they're ill and he's away.\n\"Your work doesn't stop just because your kids are sick,\" she says. \"So, I was having to still make up the time. \nWhen my child was sleeping; or at night, I was working after the kids were in bed each night just trying to catch up \non everything.\n\"I don't know of many families that can afford to be living in Sydney at the moment and not have both parents \nworking.\"\nTo fill the daycare gap, Sharon Mitchell wakes up at 3am, goes for a run on the treadmill and gets ready to answer \nher phone at 4am. Mitchell runs Mayday Mummy, an emergency nanny service on the north shore of Sydney.\n\"The phone absolutely does ring and early in the morning. It's ad-hoc, emergency, last minute. We're not a \npermanent nanny solution. I would only have anyone on the Mayday Mummy team that I would feel comfortable in \nmy own home, looking after my own family,\" she says.\nThe rate is $65 an hour. Mitchell acknowledges most parents may not earn enough to cover the minimum three-\nhour callout fee, but they are available if something goes pear-shaped and parents need somebody to step in. She \nadds that there is more than enough work for her company and welcomes competition.\n\"If there are other people out there that can support families in these difficult situations, I say: Absolutely, you know. \nPlease help, because there's so much need out there.\" \nMitchell backs up Fiona Maine's revelation about parents doing the \"Panadol drop and run\".\n\"They know that when a phone call comes in, at midday, the Panadol is worn off,\" she said.\n\"I was speaking to a daycare centre, it was a while ago, and they actually stopped parents providing the babies' \nbottles made up because they found that some parents were actually putting Panadol and Nurofen into the baby's \nbottle, knowing that they would then have an extra dose of Panadol and Nurofen at lunchtime in their bottle.\"\nDr Lachlan Macarthur, a GP at Mona Vale Medical Centre, says one of the benefits of having children spend time \naround lots of different children is that they become exposed to a wide variety of common viruses. The immune \nsystem is then able to create a response, allowing immunity to increase for a period of time.\n\"Like a great many other families with whom I have worked, my daughter had a number of illnesses this year, \nincluding COVID-19 in February and Influenza A in June,\" he says.\nMacarthur says the frustration or concern with shifting around work roles pales in the face of a seriously unwell \nchild.Page 4 of 4\n'Gastro seven times': How childcare hits parents with a triple whammy\n\"I understand that it can be difficult to adapt pre-planned schedules and work commitments when one's child is \nunwell. I am lucky to work in a profession that allows, perhaps, a greater level of flexibility when it comes to taking \ncarer's leave.\"\nBut for Maine, who has been taking her children to daycare for the past five years, the battle will continue.\n\"So I just kind of put up with it and pay the fee instead of fighting it,\" she says.\n\"Even a discount would be appreciated.\"\nMake the most of your health, relationships, fitness and nutrition with our Live Well newsletter.

I'm Alicia Payne, the Federal Member for Canberra \nand it's my great pleasure this morning to be here at MOCCA in Manuka with the Prime Minister, Anthony \nAlbanese, the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, and the Minister for Early Childhood, Anne Aly. And I want to \nsay a huge thank you to Kara and the team here at MOCCA for welcoming us again to their beautiful centre, and to \nthe children who we had such a lovely play with Lego this morning. I'm so proud that our government is a \ngovernment that values early childhood education and care. And from 1 July this year, over one million families will \nbenefit from our Cheaper Child Care policy. This is good for families, and you'll have more young children gain \naccess to the great benefits of early childhood education and care. And that more parents can better balance work \nand parenting - particularly women. Because for too long the high costs of child care have put a brake on their \neconomic participation. I know this is a huge issue for families in Canberra where we have some of the highest child \ncare costs in the country. So I'm really pleased to hand over to the Prime Minister now to talk further.\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Alicia. And it's great to be back here at one of the \ncentres where we came in opposition, to talk about what a difference a change of government would make in taking \nchild care seriously and in promoting early learning. Early learning is good for young ones, it's also good for \nfamilies, it's also good for our economy. Because if we support women to be able to participate fully in the \nworkforce there will be productivity benefits. It benefits them and their family budgets, but it also benefits \nbusinesses who employ women, because they're able to have greater continuity in their career. They retire with \nhigher savings than they would otherwise, and it changes the dynamic in our workplaces. This was the first major \nPage 2 of 5\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\ncommitment that I gave in my first budget reply, in the days when opposition leaders had policies and that made \nannouncements in budget replies. We campaigned for three years with this as the largest on-budget investment \nthat we are making during this term, and it's the largest on-budget investment because there is nothing that is more \nimportant than giving the best chance in life for our youngest Australians, some of whom we've met here today. \nLearning that social interaction that's so important, as well as learning skills that will give them a good run up to \nwhen they start school. But also it's so important for our national economy. It's one of the themes as well of the \nJobs and Skills Summit, and I'm very pleased that we put in place the mechanisms last year, in our first term we \ncarried the legislation for cheaper child care that will benefit 1.2 million Australian families from July 1, but we're not \nresting there. We also committed to do a Productivity Commission Inquiry into the universal provision of early \nlearning. Just as Labor is the party of universal Medicare, of universal superannuation, we also want to be the party \nthat delivers universal, affordable child care - very important going forward. And that's why today we're announcing \nthe Productivity Commission Inquiry with Professor Deborah Brennan as the person to undertake that enquiry. \nThere's no one more qualified than Professor Brennan to undertake this work. It will be a comprehensive inquiry \nthat will report back to the government on the next steps that we will make. I lead an orderly government. A \ngovernment that indicates what we are going to do and then gets on and does it. Making a difference as we have in \nour first eight months, this will make a difference and it's my great pleasure to ask the Professor to make some \ncomments.\nPROFESSOR DEBORAH BRENNAN: Thanks, Prime Minister. I'm Deb Brennan, I'm from the University of New \nSouth Wales and I've been around the early childhood education and care policy world for a very long time. So I'm \nabsolutely thrilled to have this opportunity to participate in a co-leadership role in the Productivity Commission \nInquiry. We've got the foundations of a fantastic early childhood learning and care system in Australia. But \neverybody knows there's work to do. We've got challenges around affordability, access, workforce, many areas, so \nwe're going to have a really good look at the sector and come up with some suggestions for advancing the system \nso that every child in Australia gets access to high quality learning and care.\nJASON CLARE, MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: This is really important. The first five years of your life are \neverything. Everything you see, everything you hear, every book you read, and every person you meet shapes the \nperson that you become. What happens in places like this shape the person you become. Early education is good \nfor kids, it's good for parents, and it's good for the economy. We promised to do three things in the election; first, to \ncut the cost of child care, and that starts on the first of July. The legislation we passed last year will cut the cost of \nchild care for more than a million Australian families. We also promised an ACCC inquiry into the driving costs \nbehind child care. That work is now underway and they will provide their interim report in June and their final report \nin December. And thirdly, we promised a big and broad, far-reaching inquiry into our early education system to set \nus up for the next decade and beyond done by the Productivity Commission. And I've got to say, I am so glad that \nDeborah, you have agreed to do this work for us. Last night I picked up the phone and spoke to leaders in the \nsector to tell them that Professor Deborah Brennan would be doing this work. And I've got to tell you, the response \nwas overwhelming. If you talk to the same people I spoke to last night, you will hear the same thing. Because \nhonestly, there is no one more experienced and no one more respected by the early education sector to do this \nwork. Deborah, I know this has been your life's work and I thank you so much for helping us to write the next \nchapter.\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: This Productivity Commission Review that's \ngoing to be led by Professor Brennan, who brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to this review is just one \npart of the Albanese Government's reforms in early childhood education and care. We've started that with making \nearly childhood education and care more affordable for 1.2 million families right across Australia. As Jason \nmentioned, and as the Prime Minister mentioned, those first five years are critical, and we have the capacity \nthrough early childhood education and care to change the trajectory of a child's life. No child born into any form of \ndisadvantage, no matter who they are, no matter where they live, no matter what background they come from. \nEvery single child has the capacity to grow and develop if we focus, if we get it right in those first five years. And \nthis Productivity Commission Review led by Professor Brennan is going to be a huge part of our reforms in early \nchildhood education and care, carrying on the Labor government's legacy in this area. It was a Labor government \nthat first introduced the National Quality Framework when we were last in government, and we will continue that Page 3 of 5\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\nlegacy because we know just how important those first five years are in a child's life. But also how important good \nquality, affordable early childhood education and care are for the economy, for parents, for allowing women who are \npredominantly primary caregivers to get out there, to work, to choose to continue their education and develop \nthemselves if they so wish. So like Jason, and like the Prime Minister, and Alicia Payne, I'm really, really excited to \nwelcome Professor Brennan to the Productivity Commission Review. Thank you.\nPRIME MINISTER: As you can see, we're very excited about Professor Brennan's appointment here this morning. \nHappy to take questions.\nJOURNALIST: On housing affordability, there's new legislation being introduced today. Obviously, that's a long term \nplan, but will there be any relief for renters in the May Budget?\nPRIME MINISTER: We'll have the May Budget in May, but we're already taking significant action when it comes to \nhousing, including the introduction of the legislation that we'll have today for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \nThat's important legislation, to boost the supply of housing but particularly social and community housing. In \naddition to that, we've said that of those 30,000 additional social housing units that will be created, 4,000 of them \nwill be set aside for women and children escaping domestic violence. In addition to that, we have our Emergency \nHousing Fund, a $100 million increase. In addition to that, we have our National Housing Accord with the Master \nBuilders Association, with state and territory governments, with the private sector, working together with the private \nsector to boost housing supply. In addition to that, we're creating our Housing Supply and Affordability Council \nagain. Working with state and territory governments, as well as local government about freeing up land, about \ncreating more support there in the housing sector. In addition to that, there was over half a billion dollars just sitting \nthere not being used for housing that we have tapped into to provide that support. So we have a comprehensive \nplan when it comes to housing, you'll see more roll out, in an orderly way, just like we're rolling out today's \nannouncement in an orderly way.\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the first Australian shipment of coal has arrived in China, do you know how many \nmore are expected to arrive in the near future, and are you confident that the shipments can increase with Don \nFarrell visiting in the near future as well?\nPRIME MINISTER: What I'm confident of is that the dynamic between Australia and China has changed, from one \nwhere there wasn't dialogue between ministers, to one where there is. And that dialogue is always a good idea. I've \nsaid with regards to the relationship with China, that we will cooperate where we can, we will disagree where we \nmust, and we'll engage in our national interest. And when I met with President Xi, I indicated to him publicly, but \nalso of course, privately, that it quite clearly was in Australia's interests to export more to China. China currently \nreceives more exports by value than the next three major trading partners combined. So that relationship is \nimportant for Australian jobs, for our national economy, but there's another thing it's good for too. It's good for China \nto receive those goods, because we have not just resources, but we have wine, meat, barley, seafood - the best in \nthe world. And it is in China's interest for any impediments to be removed. I'm very pleased that Don Farrell had a \nconstructive meeting this week with his counterpart in China. I'm pleased that Penny Wong visited Beijing on \nDecember 21st to mark the 50th anniversary of relations between Australia and the People's Republic of China. \nAnd I look forward to both of our countries going forward in a constructive, cooperative way. These reports haven't \nbeen confirmed yet. We are cautious about making announcements before they're confirmed. But quite clearly, I \nthink if Australian business and Australian industry, what they tell me, including last night with business people I've \nmet with, is that they are very pleased with the constructive direction of the relationship.\nJOURNALIST: Further on China, US officials say that Chinese spy balloons are part of an effort to assess the \nmilitary capabilities around the world. Does that concern you and does this incident in the US, do you see that as a \nsetback in the engagement that was seen between Washington and Beijing and Canada?\nPRIME MINISTER: We support the sovereignty of nations, including the United States, our great friends in the \nUnited States. We consider all of the matters relating to national security and respond in an appropriate way and \nwill continue to do so.Page 4 of 5\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\nJOURNALIST: Disability workers and age care workers got big pay rises recently. The Childcare Workers Union \nhas called for a 25% pay rise. We know pay is a huge factor in this industry. Would you back a pay rise like that for \nchild care workers?\nPRIME MINISTER: The government doesn't determine the level of wages for everybody in the sector.\nJOURNALIST: But do you support their push?\nPRIME MINISTER: What I support is people being paid fairly, and I won't comment on specifics because that's the \njob of the Fair Work Commission to consider these matters independently of government and come to decisions. \nWhat I would say though, and what I've said publicly a number of times, including yesterday at the UN International \nWomen's Day event that was held yesterday morning, is that if you look at the sectors where people are underpaid, \nthey have something in common, two things: One, they are the very sectors that got us through the pandemic. Our \ncleaners, our aged care workers, our childcare workers. There's something else they've got in common as well. \nThey are largely feminised industries, and that's why, when we made changes to industrial regulations, I announced \nat our campaign launch in Perth last year that we would very specially have measures that allowed the gender pay \ngap to be considered. We had legislation yesterday as well about transparency, so that the gender pay gap can be \nidentified for larger companies as well. So I will conclude with this by saying, early learning educators do a fantastic \njob. They're valued by parents, they're valued by children who grow to love them and have a relationship with them. \nThis isn't just a normal job, as much as I love all the journalists here, our relationship is different. Between the \neducators and the children who they look after. And I have every respect for the educators and the work that they \ndo.\nJOURNALIST: One on the Referendum Machinery Act please if I could. Yesterday, Katy Gallagher said that you \nwould go ahead with the information pamphlet. In December, Don Farrell and Mark Dreyfus said \"there's no longer \nany need for taxpayers to pay for a pamphlet to be sent to every household. The Referendum Act does not reflect \nmodern delivery and communications methods.\" Do you still agree with that? Has your view changed or is this \nbringing back the pamphlet a concession to just get it through the Parliament?\nPRIME MINISTER: Both things are right. The truth is, I don't know about you Josh, when was the last letter you \nsent?\nJOURNALIST: I think it was around Christmas.\nPRIME MINISTER: Apart from Christmas Cards, when was the last letter you sent?\nJOURNALIST: You're testing my memory, it's not my press conference.\nPRIME MINISTER: Has anyone here sent a letter this year?\nJOURNALIST: Last week, to the US Consulate.\nPRIME MINISTER: That's not a letter, that's an application. The world has changed how we communicate. But I \ncould have said, we will engage constructively. One of the Senators approached, we made this decision a week \nago, one of the Senators approached and said, this will make a big difference for our approach. I don't know how \nmany times I can say this at press conferences, we will do what we need to do to broaden support for this. The \nreferendum that will be held later this year is about two things, recognition and consultation. Recognising Aboriginal \nand Torres Strait Islander People in our Constitution and consulting them on matters that affect them, that's what it's \nabout. Now we want to maximise support for that. So if anyone has, as I said, I await any member of the House of \nRepresentatives or the Senate to examine the question and the draft changes that I put forward at Garma last year. \nNow, I'll give you the exclusive, just for you, so if everyone else can not listen, if there's a constructive suggestion, \nthat's backed in by lawyers, we'll change that. If there's a suggestion, there hasn't been one, there hasn't been one. \nI want this to succeed. I'm not being dogmatic about this. This is not our proposal, this is a proposal that came from \nthe bottom up. And you need to think of the counterfactual of what happens if this referendum succeeds. If this \nreferendum succeeds, Indigenous Australians will be shown the respect that they deserve. Australians will all know Page 5 of 5\nPRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023\nthat we've acknowledged the great privilege that we have of sharing this continent with the oldest continuous \nculture on earth. And the world will see that Australia's a mature country, a mature country that can be honest \nabout our history and can celebrate that history. That's what this is about. It's not about party politics. And that's \nwhat every state Premier and Chief Minister understands. And I just say to my colleagues on the Hill, this isn't the \nopportunity to look for division. This is the opportunity to look for national unity, to embrace the opportunity which is \nthere. So, if someone has a suggestion, by all means put it forward. I'm up for it, in terms of, whether a pamphlet \ngoes out, it doesn't hurt, a pamphlet going out. People are going to put things in letterboxes anyway during the \nreferendum. If people want taxpayers to pay for it, there's a judgement call there, fine. Taxpayers shouldn't be \nfunding the campaigns of Yes and No. That should be up to people to fund. There should be equal funding and \nthere will be under the under the proposal that we have. I also welcome Simon Birmingham's comments this \nmorning. Simon Birmingham has said very clearly that there shouldn't be funding of the Yes and No case. I \nwelcome the comments of Simon Birmingham. I welcome anyone who wants to join this journey on the path to \nreconciliation.\nJOURNALIST: There are strong indications that Vladimir Putin signed off on the supply of weapons used to shoot \ndown MH17. If you could look at him in the eye today, what would you say to Vladimir Putin?\nPRIME MINISTER: I'd say that you are reprehensible. That Vladimir Putin, clearly, the shooting down of MH17 was \nan act of terrorism that had an impact here in Australia, but on many countries as well. And we will continue to \npursue these issues with every avenue at our disposal.\nJOURNALIST: So how do you feel about the suspension of the criminal investigation into the downing of MH17?\nPRIME MINISTER: I think I just answered how I feel about it. The issue, of course, of the Russian invasion of \nUkraine, this is a guy who runs an authoritarian regime that doesn't care about human rights, that doesn't care \nabout devastation of communities, whether it be in Ukraine, whether it be the oppression of its own citizens, or \nwhether the acts outside of Russia of which we've seen a number. The travesty of MH17 is an issue in which he \nshould be held to account and Australia will continue to pursue all of these issues with every avenue at our \ndisposal.\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, this morning the Deputy PM has indicated he wants to get rid of Chinese linked \nsurveillance cameras from government buildings. We spoke about the relationship with China earlier, the last time \nthe Australian government tried to ban or exclude a Chinese company from communications in any form in \nAustralia, it was detrimental to our relationship with China. Are you concerned about how Beijing will react to the \nremoval of those devices?\nPRIME MINISTER: No, we act in accordance with Australia's national interest. We do so transparently and that's \nwhat we'll continue to do. Thanks very much.\nLoad-Date: February 9, 2023\nEnd of Document",

She has never held an Egyptian passport but might be \ncaught by the strict interpretation of foreign citizenship - and its renunciation - applied by the High Court.\nIn May 2018, the High Court disqualified ACT Labor senator Katy Gallagher because she was a \"citizen of a foreign \npower at the time of her nomination for election to the Senate on May 31, 2016, and was for that reason incapable \nof being chosen as a senator at the double-dissolution election\". The court applied a rigid test, holding that it is not \nsufficient for a candidate to take \"all reasonable steps\" if the foreign state itself has not legally adopted the \nrenunciation.\nFollowing that court decision Dr Aly produced a document from the Egyptian embassy stating   she relinquished her \ncitizenship on May 6, 2016. \nThe statement said: \"Dr Anne Aly renounced Egyptian citizenship on May 6, 2016, having completed all the steps \nrequired and, as of that date, had completely renounced her Egyptian citizenship.\"\nHowever, Professor Gans, a criminal law specialist, said   while the document \"looks good on its face\", Egypt's \nNationality Law did not provide for voluntary renunciation of citizenship. Rather, its approach is to permit - but not \nPage 2 of 2\nLabor MP at risk of eligibility challenge\nrequire - the government to strip citizens of citizenship in some circumstances. That would require a decree by the \nEgyptian   Minister of Interior, he said.\nDr Aly had not provided a copy of any decree, and the letter she cited from the embassy made no mention of one. It \nwas unlikely Dr Aly could have obtained such a decree by   May 6, 2016 - a month before the close of nominations \nfor the 2016 election, when she was first elected - because she \u00adapplied only two days before, \u00adProfessor Gans \nsays.\nThe issue would arise only if her eligibility were challenged after the election or she was referred to the court by the \nHouse of Representatives at some point.\nProfessor Gans argues the law is counter-productive and needs to be reformed, a move that would require a \nreferendum to amend s.44 of the Constitution.\n\"It's outrageous. It's perverse. It exposes MPs to foreign influence. It's a real barrier to a diverse parliament,\" he \nsaid.\nProfessor Gans says he would be shocked if any Australian court ruled that Dr Aly was ineligible because \"the \nracism of the High Court of Australia's sneering at MPs not doing their homework would be too obvious\". \"But I still \ndon't think we can discount the chance of a challenge to Aly and similarly difficult cases, if the election is close \nenough that a challenge could potentially make a difference. And that will produce quite some chaos.\"\nDr Aly declined to comment on the claims or to reveal whether she had received any decree from the Egyptian \nMinister of Interior. \nIndependent candidate Jo Dyer announced she had confirmation she was eligible to run for the South Australian \nseat of Boothby after concerns she had not renounced her UK citizenship in time.\nNotes\nDocument links may not lead to an active page.

And it's also about gender equality.\n\"I don't want to squander this platform, this opportunity, to make meaningful change.\"\nStarting from July next year, the government will increase the maximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families \nearning up to $80,000 and a sliding scale in subsidy rates for every family earning less than $530,000. It also plans \nto extend the increased subsidy to outside-school-hours care.\nDr Aly, who has represented the West Australian seat of Cowan since 2016, was the first Muslim woman elected to \nfederal parliament.\nShe will bring her complicated, and often traumatic, background to her role, which includes a second portfolio as \nminister for youth.\n\u2018Pathway to a better life'\nHer family migrated from Egypt when she was two, and settled in western Sydney. Her professionally qualified \nparents worked in factories and as a bus driver while she attended the Anglican girls school Meriden in Strathfield.\nPage 2 of 2\n\u2018Lived experience' will direct Aly's policy choices\nShe took herself back to Egypt for undergraduate studies in English and acting before returning to Australia, where \nshe and her first husband lived in Perth.\nThe marriage was violent. She left with her two sons and no money, discovering the brutal reality of a dole queue \nand little hope. But she managed to scrape enough together to put herself through a master's degree and PhD \nbefore becoming a lecturer and international expert on counterterrorism.\n\"For me, access to childcare meant I was able to lift myself out of poverty and chart a pathway to a better life for \nmyself, and particularly for my children,\" Dr Aly said.\n\"That meant I was able to secure the financial freedom that enabled me to have choices in life. If you understand \nthose things from a lived experience it gives you insight into what we do - not just about policy, legislation and \neconomics, but how it actually has a real impact on people's lives.\n\"You never really lose that part of yourself who used to cry every night because you didn't know where you were \ngoing to find the money to put food on the table the next day.\"\nRepresenting young people, she will design a youth engagement strategy that works across the whole of \ngovernment to address the pressing issues facing the younger demographic, including access to intergenerational \nwealth transfer, access to housing, cost of living and educational expenses.\n\"Australia is one of the most expensive places in the world to study, not just in terms of how much it costs for a \nuniversity degree or TAFE, but the cost of living while you are studying,\" Dr Aly said.\n\"There was no minister for youth in the previous government. To say that Labor inherited a policy void is an \nunderstatement. That certainly presents challenges, but also enormous opportunities.\"\nLoad-Date: June 11, 2022\nEnd of Document",

The children who have been killed, the \nfamilies torn apart. There is widespread suffering, no question about that,\u201d Albanese said.\nVamvakinou on Thursday said the federal government should take on a more \u201cactive role\u201d in bringing peace to the \nPalestine and Israel conflict. \n\u201cThe blockade has to end, the actual incursion into Gaza shouldn\u2019t happen and another way forward would be \ncalling for parties to come to some dialogue to try and avert this humanitarian disaster,\u201d Vamvakinou said.\nFellow frontbencher Anne Aly had earlier stood by Husic\u2019s comments, saying it was \u201cdifficult to argue\u201d that \nPalestinians, including hundreds of children who had been killed , were not being \u201ccollectively punished\u201d.\nThe calls echo those made recently by the Greens, with the leader, Adam Bandt, supporting Husic and Aly\u2019s \ncomments.\nBandt said the ministers were sharing \u201cthe reality of what is happening on the ground\u201d and that it was time for the \nLabor government to \u201ccatch up\u201d and call for the invasion to end.\n\u201cWhat the ministers are saying is right, and that must lead the Labor government to shift its position and now call for \nan immediate ceasefire and for the invasion to end,\u201d Bandt said.\n\u201cBecause otherwise, that collective punishment, and the deaths and starvation and dehydration of civilians, is going \nto continue.\u201d\nEarlier this week, the Labor senator Fatima Payman and MP Julian Hill also spoke out by condemning the killing of \ninnocent civilians in Israel and Palestine.\nHusic said there was \u201can obligation on governments, particularly the Israeli government to \u2026 follow the rules of \ninternational law and to observe, in particular, that innocents should be protected\u201d.\n\u201cI am very mindful of the words of our prime minister in saying that protecting innocent lives is not a sign of \nweakness.\nIt is a sign of strength. That is a really important thing that needs to be considered. I genuinely believe there needs \nto be a de-escalation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Israel\u2019s interest, long-term, to engage in the occupation of Gaza. \u201d\nCollective punishment is prohibited by international law , including article 33 of the Geneva conventions. Wilful \nkilling of civilians and extensive destruction of property beyond what is necessary are war crimes.\nIn a speech to the house on Tuesday, Vamvakinou said collective punishment was not within the rules of war, and \nthat the people of Gaza should not be seen as \u201ccollateral damage\u201d.\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: \u2018not within the rules of war\u2019 is doublespeak for \u2018illegal\u2019, doublespeak for \u2018crime\u2019.

It's part of a push to make the online environment safer, coming \nalongside new legislation to outlaw the malicious release of personal information, known as doxing. Alexandra \nHumphries reports.\nAlexandra Humphries: Australians are becoming increasingly worried about misinformation and disinformation on \nsocial media. An issue highlighted in the wake of the Bondi stabbing tragedy, when disinformation about who was \nresponsible for the attack circulated rapidly online. Today, the Government's unveiling plans to address those \nconcerns.\nMichelle Rowland: Having seen the impacts of misinformation in real life situations here in Australia and indeed \naround the world, I think as a Parliament we should recognise we need to do something.\nAlexandra Humphries: Michelle Rowland is the Communications Minister.\nMichelle Rowland: We know that some 75% of Australians are concerned about the harmful impacts of mis and \ndisinformation. This really goes to not only protecting Australians but protecting our democratic way of life.\nAlexandra Humphries: The Government wants Australia's media watchdog, the Australian Communications and \nMedia Authority, to be able to force digital platforms to keep records about incidents of misinformation that can then \nbe turned over to authorities. Social media platforms, news aggregators and even podcasts will be affected. And if \nthey break the law, they could face penalties of up to 5% of their global revenue. Terry Flew is a Professor of Digital \nCommunication at the University of Sydney.\nPage 2 of 2\nFederal Government's online safety crackdown\nTerry Flew: I think what will be important here is that there are clear definitions of what constitutes misinformation \nbecause if the ACMA is to be delegating that responsibility to platforms, they need very clear guidance that \nminimises the extent to which discretion applies around these matters.\nAlexandra Humphries: Around 3,000 public submissions were made on the draft legislation. Many worried about \nimpacts on free speech, including Australia's Human Rights Commission. The Federal Government's also \nintroducing laws to criminalise doxing, or the malicious release of personal information. The new offence covers the \npublication of information like names, addresses and numbers with the intent of causing harm. Those convicted \ncould face up to seven years in jail. The bill follows the publication of information from a WhatsApp group involving \nhundreds of Jewish Australians in February. Minister Anne Aly says the laws tackle a rising threat to public safety.\nAnne Aly: It's become an issue that threatens the safety of Australian citizens. I don't think it's justifiable to ever \nrelease the personal information of a private citizen in order to incite or to give out information to encourage or so \nthat people can utilise that information to attack them or threaten their safety and security.\nAlexandra Humphries: Josh Roose is a Political Sociologist and Associate Professor of Politics at Deakin \nUniversity. He's glad to see the Government moving to address online safety.\nJosh Roose: I think we're certainly in a space with our online environment where an entire raft of legislation is \nneeded to address not only misinformation, disinformation, but hate speech, doxing and I think this goes some way \nto at least starting that process.\nRachel Mealey: Political Sociologist Josh Roose ending that report from Alexandra Humphries.\nLoad-Date: September 12, 2024\nEnd of Document",

people but to me, it would mean the world.\n\"In the 1960s, kids like Audrey were hidden in institutions; now they're just hidden at home.\"\n'Huge' barriers to accessing childcare\nEveryone has a legal right to access childcare under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.\nIn reality, very few facilities have the staff or equipment to cater for high-needs children and they don't have to make \nchanges that would cause \"unjustifiable hardship\".\nMonique Power started her company Ripple Ability to help parents navigate the National Disability Insurance \nScheme (NDIS) after her own experience advocating for her daughter left her frustrated.\nShe and her colleagues realised the extent of the problem when a funeral for one of their young clients was \nattended by many children, all of whom couldn't be put in childcare.\nTheir research has since exposed the barriers to accessing childcare for kids with disabilities.\n\"We know that childcare centres are discriminating against [these] children,\" Ms Power said.\nRipple Ability has rung dozens of childcare centres in Western Australia trying to find care for clients.\n\"We were met with a resounding no \u2026 the ones that we didn't get an explicit no from said we'll call you back \n[and] we never heard from them again,\" she said.\nNeed for purpose-built centres\nMs Power believes the answer is a new model, involving purpose-built centres with flexible hours, equipment and \nmedically trained staff and therapists.\n\"Parents would know [their child] is in a safe space and could walk away feeling confident about that,\" she said.\n\"Kids with complex needs don't miraculously become better.\n\"But they would have an opportunity to make friends and build social networks with people that look like them and \nhave lives like theirs, which makes a huge difference on mental health in the long run.\"\nMs Power believes having access to such a centre would also be life-changing for parents.\n\"It will provide people with the opportunity to pursue higher education [or] hold down a meaningful career,\" she said.\n\"But in addition to that, a centre like this would provide women with the opportunity to go to a gynaecology \nappointment alone or go out for coffee with a friend that they haven't seen for three years.\"\nThere are significant barriers to opening such a centre, however, including the current childcare subsidy offered to \nparents.\n\"We could open a model like this tomorrow but there's no way that [families] can afford it and that's the biggest \nproblem,\" Ms Power said.\n\"We need a new subsidy through Services Australia that has these children in mind to cater for the skills necessary \nto provide that level of care.Page 3 of 4\nCalls for purpose-built childcare centres for children with a disability amid 'discrimination'\n\"You're going to have to pay a paediatric nurse $75 an hour \u2026 so the subsidy needs to offer these families the sort \nof rebate that every other family enjoys under the current childcare legislation.\"\n'Game-changing' childcare centre on the cards\nDespite the barriers, some childcare centres are still working hard to be inclusive.\nLake Joondalup Early Learning Program has been running for 12 years and welcomes children of all abilities and \nneeds.\nCo-founders Debra Gibson and Jodie Jones are hoping to build a second facility on the same site that caters to \nchildren with more complex clinical needs.\n\"I think it's going to be huge \u2014 a game changer,\" Ms Jones said.\n\"All those children that have fallen through the gaps through the years \u2014 to finally have something they can access \nis actually really exciting.\"\nLike Ripple Ability, they've identified inadequate childcare subsidies as a barrier to the plan.\n\"Right now we fund extra support so these children can receive one-to-one care but that's coming at a cost to our \nservice,\" Ms Gibson said.\n\"One of our concerns is that we're going to be dipping into the current service here to actually fund the new service \nout the back \u2014 obviously that's not viable for the long term.\"\nThe centre is in talks with the Federal Minister for Early Childhood Education Anne Aly to become a pilot facility for \na new childcare subsidy model.\n\"We're not sure what it will look like because we're waiting to hear back but we're pretty excited about it,\" Ms Jones \nsaid.\nBarriers under review\nAside from the issue of subsidies, advocates also spent years campaigning for legislative change.\nChildcare providers aren't currently covered under the Disability Standards for Education Act 2005.\nThree government reviews have flagged this as a problem, with the most recent in 2020 recommending that draft \namendments be prepared to extend the law to childcare centres.\nThe Federal Minister for Early Childhood Education Anne Aly said that work is happening.\nThere are also two separate inquires underway into early childhood education and care.\nThe Productivity Commission is due to release its draft report in November, while the ACCC will hand down its final \nreport on supply of childcare services in December.\n\"I don't want to pre-empt anything that comes out of the Productivity Commission review or the ACCC review, but I \nknow a lot of the consultation that's gone out has had \u2026 input from parents of children with disability \u2026 and the \nthings that they have said will be taken into account,\" Ms Aly said.\n\"I see a huge opportunity here for us to really come together as a government across those different portfolios, as \nwe have done with the Early Years Strategy.\"\nAdvocates sceptical reviews will lead to changePage 4 of 4\nCalls for purpose-built childcare centres for children with a disability amid 'discrimination'\nMonique Power will launch a petition this week calling for better access to childcare.\n\"I am an optimist \u2026 but I am incredibly pessimistic that [any] changes will [reflect] the cohort of kids that we're \ndealing with,\" she said.\n\"Am I optimistic that the government is going to address the most critical and vulnerable [kids] in our society with \nthese reforms?\n\"I'm not confident at all.\"\nRipple Ability has made submissions to the inquires but is struggling to get meetings with relevant ministers, \nincluding Ms Aly.\n\"We want an audience with them to have a conversation about the extensive body of work that we have done and \nthe solutions that we have put together \u2026 to start the ball rolling towards some meaningful change,\" Ms Power \nsaid.\n\"We're real people and we need real solutions.\"\nLoad-Date: September 11, 2023\nEnd of Document",

All Rights Reserved\nSection: AUSTRALIA NEWS; Version:1\nLength: 781 words\nByline: Paul Karp, Amy Remeikis and Sarah Basford Canales\nHighlight: Ed Husic backed by fellow Labor frontbencher Anne Aly who says Israel \u2018could be investigated\u2019 for \nalleged war crimesFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updatesGet our morning and afternoon news \nemails, free app or daily news podcast\nBody\nPalestinians are being \u201ccollectively punished for Hamas\u2019s barbarism\u201d, senior federal minister Ed Husic has said, in \nthe strongest condemnation yet of Israel\u2019s reprisals in Gaza by a member of the Australian government.\nFellow Labor frontbencher Anne Aly immediately backed Husic saying it was \u201cdifficult to argue\u201d that Palestinians, \nincluding 1,000 children who had been killed , were not being \u201ccollectively punished\u201d. Aly, the early childhood \neducation minister, suggested Israel could be investigated over whether it had committed war crimes.\nThe comments from the first two Muslim ministers in an Australian federal government  go further than the foreign \nminister, Penny Wong, who has urged all sides to show \u201crestraint\u201d in protecting civilian life.\nThis week Labor senator Fatima Payman and MP Julian Hill also spoke out by condemning the killing of innocent \ncivilians in Israel and Palestine.\nThe opposition has sought to weaponise Labor\u2019s position, arguing it is unfair to urge restraint on Israel, given its \ncitizens were the victims of the Hamas attacks.\nHusic, the industry and science minister, noted that about 3,000 Palestinians were dead , including approximately \n1,000 children, according to the Gaza health ministry.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got homes, schools, medical centres destroyed,\u201d he told ABC radio on Thursday.\nPage 2 of 3\nAustralian ministers say Palestinians are being \u2018collectively punished\u2019 for Hamas barbarism\n\u201cThat\u2019s before we even contemplate how they\u2019ll get rebuilt. No food, fuel, medicines, water. I feel very strongly that \nPalestinians are being collectively punished here for Hamas\u2019s barbarism.\u201d\nHusic said there was \u201can obligation on governments, particularly the Israeli government to \u2026 follow the rules of \ninternational law and to observe in particular, that innocents should be protected\u201d.\n\u201cI am very mindful of the words of our prime minister in saying that protecting innocent lives is not a sign of \nweakness.\n\u201cIt is a sign of strength. That is a really important thing that needs to be considered. I genuinely believe there needs \nto be a de-escalation. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in Israel\u2019s interest long term to engage in the occupation of Gaza.\u201d\nAly said it was \u201centirely appropriate\u201d that parliament had passed a motion  condemning the Hamas attacks.\n\u201cBut with the escalation of violence, and that was something that I feared from the very beginning \u2013 that the \nescalation of violence would mean there would be more Palestinian lives lost and that has come to pass, and it will \ncontinue,\u201d she said.\nAly urged Israel to abide by the rules of law developed by the international community to protect the human rights of \ncivilians during conflict.\nAsked if Israel had committed war crimes, Aly replied that: \u201cThat is something that possibly could be investigated. I \nthink that anyone, any state or any group that commits war crimes, should be investigated and should be held \naccountable.\u201d\nThe prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has recognised Israel\u2019s right to defend itself but also urged the Netanyahu \ngovernment to \u201c operate by the rules of war  \u201d amid increasing expectations of an imminent ground operation in \nGaza.\nOn Monday, Hill told parliament that Israel\u2019s right to defend itself did not extend to the \u201cindiscriminate mass killing of \ninnocent Palestinians\u201d.\nHill said he had heard an \u201coverwhelming message\u201d from his community \u201cthat the mass punishment of 2 million \npeople in Gaza is not a proportionate response and this is a trap that Israel must not fall into \u2013 it is what Hamas is \ntrying to provoke\u201d.\nPayman told the Senate that Australia \u201cmust condemn\u201d civilian deaths as \u201cIsraeli missiles strike residential \ndwellings, civilians, multi-story apartments, health facilities as well as places of worship, indiscriminately killing men, \nwomen and children\u201d.\n\u201cThe price tag of Israel\u2019s right to defend itself cannot be the destruction of Palestine. Israel\u2019s right to defend its \ncivilians cannot equate to the annihilation of Palestinian civilians.\u201d\nOn Thursday, the home affairs minister, Clare O\u2019Neil, said she was \u201cnot going to get into\u201d who was responsible  for \nthe Al-Ahli Arab hospital strike because it was an \u201cunfolding\u201d situation.\n\u201cWhat we do know about this is that hundreds of innocent people, who were at a hospital evidently already \nincredibly unwell and vulnerable, have lost their lives,\u201d she said.\n\u201chis was set off by these violent and inhumane, barbaric attacks by Hamas.\u201d\n\u201cWhat we now see is loss of innocent lives, of men, women and children in Gaza, and I want Australians to know \nthat, for any innocent loss of life, we stand with Australian communities who experience this pain very deeply, \nwhether they are Jewish Australians who are mourning the loss of life in the Middle East, or whether they are \nPalestinian or Muslim Australians who are mourning the loss there.\u201dPage 3 of 3\nAustralian ministers say Palestinians are being \u2018collectively punished\u2019 for Hamas barbarism\nLoad-Date: October 19, 2023\nEnd of Document",

Princess Diana donned a red blazer and purple skirt when she sat alone outside the Taj Mahal in 1992 \nas her marriage crumbled. Her daughter-in-law, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, recreated the look for one of her final \nofficial duties as a working royal in 2019. And in 2022, clutching a pink Qur'an, Anne Aly wore a red Acler skirt and \npurple blouse to Government House where she was sworn in as Australia's first Muslim female minister.\nAly's appointment comes on the heels of a significant changing of the guard in Australian politics. For the first time \nin our political history, there will be a record number of Carla Zampatti dresses, as opposed to the once prevalent \nMJ Bale suits, in both houses of parliament. The federal election was a win, not just for the Greens and the teal \nwave, but also for a new world order of sorts.\nThere is a new guard looming. One that is all about difference, diversity and diverging from a place of \"that's just the \nway it is\" to a new chapter in Canberra that champions equality. Climate change was front of mind for many voters, \nwho backed independents including Allegra Spender - daughter of the late Zampatti - in the seat of Wentworth and \nKate Chaney in Curtin, to speak up for the environment. \nThis is in keeping with what ANU climate scientist Jo\u00eblle Gergis so aptly sums up in her new book, Humanity's \nMoment: A Climate Scientist's Case for Hope, on sale this month: \"What an extraordinary time to be alive; we are \npart of the generation that will help heal the world.\" The age of societal sustainability is upon us.\nThe 47th parliament will be one of the most representative we've had, thanks to a new government and a collection \nof MPs who accurately represent modern Australia. A record number of women will take their seats in the House of \nRepresentatives. Many are not aligned to the traditional parties and make up the super-sized crossbench. Women \ncount for 51 per cent of the Australian population and now comprise 38 per cent of the chamber in the new \nparliament - the highest ever proportion on record - after 58 women were elected to the lower house, including 19 \ndebutante MPs. The Senate reached and exceeded 50 per cent gender parity in the last parliament, and maintains \nthis in the new parliament.\nPage 2 of 3\nOur new government's force for change\nWe've come a long way since Edith Cowan, our first female politician, was elected to the Western Australian \nparliament in 1921. Her colleagues were so opposed to her being there, she had to make several attempts at \npresenting her first speech, because the men kept interjecting as she spoke of wanting equal access to education \nfor young Australian women.\nStill, in 2003, the then newly minted cabinet minister Julie Bishop was infamously told how to dress by her male \npeers. \"When I was first appointed to the ministry, I was asked to be the Minister for Ageing. And one of the prime \nminister's senior advisors rang me and said 'Julie, take this the right way, but forget the Armani suits and forget the \ncorporate look. You're the minister for the ageing, you're going into aged- care homes, you've got to dress \nappropriately,\" Bishop has shared. \"I said 'What? You mean like cardigans?' And he said, 'Yeah more prints, more \ncolour. Just not corporate.'\"\nNot too long after this sermon from a \"faceless man\", Bishop went on to become Minister for Foreign Affairs and a \nthree-time deputy leader of the Liberal party. And she did it all in good shoes and some of the best of Australian \nfashion, including Rachel Gilbert, Rebecca Vallance and Dion Lee, and coined the phrase \"fashion diplomacy\" by \nexclusively wearing homegrown Australian labels when on official visits.\nHer work, putting fashion on the agenda, also helped put the wheels in motion for the Australian Fashion Council to \nsecure a federal grant to establish an Australian Fashion trademark in 2021. The world-first campaign hopes to \npromote the industry and create more local jobs. \"The Australian Fashion trademark will be a driving force in \nbuilding the industry's growth trajectory to deliver substantial economic, social and environmental gains over the \nnext 10 years,\" CEO of Australian Fashion Council Leila Naja Hibri said in a statement. \n\"We can show the world how prioritising people and the planet together with profit can lead to a legacy of thriving \nprosperity.\"\nWe've also come a long way since the ministerial wing was trodden, pretty much exclusively, by men in R.M. \nWilliams boots in the first part of this century. R.M. Williams was, during those days, owned by luxury conglomerate \nLVMH. But in 2020 the brand was brought home when it was acquired by Perth billionaire Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest \nand his wife Nicola. \nSince Australia's richest man has taken over the bootmaker, vegan materials have been introduced and demand is \nskyrocketing. And Prime Minister Anthony Albanese seems keen to tread new paths. One that is more female-\nfocused, family-friendly and awake to the Australia we want to become.\nNow, almost 10 per cent of the Senate identifies as Indigenous after the record number of Aboriginal and Torres \nStrait Islander representatives elected, including four new Indigenous MPs, three of whom are women. Indigenous \nAffairs Minister Linda Burney was bestowed her new job on election night. Burney, a proud Wiradjuri woman, knows \nthe power that culture, and more specifically fashion, can have in politics. Since serving in federal politics from \n2016, she has regularly been spotted on the shadow front bench in the odd Albus Lumen piece and Anna Quan \nskirt.\nAnother fashion force has also joined the Albanese government's inner sanctum. The aforementioned Anne Aly, \nMinister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth is as passionate about her portfolio as she is about \nfashion, the statements style can make and where that style is made.\nDr Aly is Australia's first Muslim woman elected to parliament and is also the first Muslim woman MP who will sit in \nthe outer ministry. Serendipitously, she represents the seat of Cowan - named after Edith Cowan - in Perth's outer \nsuburbs. Born in Egypt, Aly's family moved to Sydney's southwest when she was two. She is a survivor of domestic \nviolence and an academic specialising in counter terrorism. She's still considered a global authority into why \nchildren are lured into extremism. She also achieved all this after spending her 20s working for the minimum wage \nas a single mother of two boys.\nAly has a deep love and appreciation of fashion and since being elected in 2016 has regularly worn local labels that \nhave a strong sustainable ethos including KitX and Flannel to parliament and official functions. In 2017 she made Page 3 of 3\nOur new government's force for change\nher catwalk debut for then 23-year-old designer Thomas Puttick, a designer who was showing sustainable clothes \nbefore it went mainstream and cast 'muses' such as Aly instead of models for his runway show.\n\"It's in my nature to disrupt because it is more often the case that I just end up being somewhere where I am not \nexpected to be - like parliament or the catwalk of Australian Fashion Week,\" Dr Aly tells Vogue. Fashion is in her \nblood. \"My dad studied textiles engineering. But when my family migrated to Australia, he couldn't find work in his \nfield so he drove buses,\" Aly shares. \"A story typical of so many who choose to make Australia home. Dad would \nspend hours at the sewing machine making our school uniforms. He never lost his passion for design. My mum tells \nme I've inherited his passion.\"\nShe says that it was only after she was first elected that she realised what her career and success represented \nwhen a constituent in Perth said she had told her young daughter that Dr Aly's victory was proof girls, Muslim girls \nespecially, in Australia could achieve anything. \n\"The significance of it to other people, to the people watching really struck me at that point,\" she continues. \"I made \na very conscious decision that, coming in here, I would do everything I could to not just open the door but break \ndown the wall. I feel so heartened by the fact that I may have been the first, but I'm certainly not going to be the \nlast.\"\nThis article appears in the August issue of Vogue Australia, on sale now.\nNotes\nDocument links may not lead to an active page.

It is also incredibly dangerous.\n\"Jewish Australians are no more responsible for Israel's conduct of this war than Palestinian Australians are \nresponsible for Hamas' terrorist attack that prompted it.\"\nPage 2 of 3\n'Mob rule': Senator warns attacks on minorities are shredding social fabric\nSharma described the attacks in Australia as \"mob rule\" and intimidation and said Australian leaders had \"muted \ntheir voices\" on the issue, while institutions had neglected their duty to protect the social compact.\n\"Today it might be Jewish Australians, but tomorrow it will be another group or another minority against which the \nforces of the populist mob are unleashed,\" he said. \"Down that road lies civil turmoil and national disunity. Staying \nquiet, sitting on the sidelines, and hoping it will all go away is a complete failure of leadership.\"\nThe Islamophobia Register Australia has warned of a surge in Islamophobia in the wake of the conflict between \nIsrael and Hamas, while the Executive Council of Australian Jewry said there had been a 738 per cent increase in \nantisemitism.\nProtests in support of the Palestinian people have also heightened concerns in Parliament House about threats to \npoliticians and the disruption of public events.\nEarly Childhood Minister Anne Aly, who was born and raised in Egypt and is one of Australia's first Muslim \nministers, was berated by pro-Palestinian protesters at a \"meet and greet\" with her community on the weekend but \nshe said it would not change her conduct.\nLink to Image\nAlex Ellinghausen\n\"I will continue to take every opportunity to talk with people from my local community about the issues that matter to \nthem.

Workers and \nsmall businesses have lost.\n\"Australia now has one of the most concentrated economies in the developed world.\"\nOn housing costs, Sharma said the biggest solution was a focus on increasing supply and that this meant Australia \nhad to find a way to build more homes, more quickly.\n\"Until we are able to accelerate our pace of home building, we need to reduce our immigration intake, or else we \nwill simply place further pressure on our housing market,\" he said.\nCut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.

Which \nis just as well because so far, things aren't going according to plan.\nWe had arranged to meet at Zeytin Turkish Cuisine on the foreshore of Lake Burley Griffin. But when I show up at \nnoon sharp, not a sign of life.\nI'm busily texting Aly's people when, luckily, we run into each other - Canberra is a small place - so we amble a few \nmetres along until we come to a cafe on the corner that seems, well, convenient.\nWe grab a table outside and Aly immediately launches into a monologue about how to make a lemon chicken \ntagine, which involves soaking the tagine pot in a bath for 24 hours, rubbing it with oil and then cooking the Middle-\nEastern deliciousness for another 24 hours in a very low oven.\nWe are scanning the menu and Aly announces she \"doesn't do rice\", which is a staple of Middle Eastern cuisine \nand which makes her some sort of pariah at family events. She opts for the grilled fennel chicken (no butter please) \nand a very hot almond milk cappuccino. I choose the zucchini fritters and a bean-a-colada, which disappointingly \nhas neither beans nor booze.\nAly, let it be said, is prone to the odd swear word, as am I, and over the next 60 minutes our conversation is \npeppered with F-bombs.\nPage 2 of 4\n'I'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN\nThe thrice-married Aly had already lived a complex and somewhat haphazard life before she decided rather \nspontaneously to run as the Labor candidate for the West Australian seat Cowan in 2016. She managed to turf out \nthe Liberal incumbent Luke Simpkins by the finest of margins. \"It took 10 days to count the vote,\" she says.\nIn 2019, she increased her margin and by 2022 she harnessed 46.9 per cent of the vote, adding more than 9 per \ncent to her 2019 numbers.\nOf that first campaign, she remembers standing at a train station with a picture of herself while waving at cars. A \nyear ago to the day, she had been invited to speak at the White House at a counterterrorism conference. \"All I could \nthink was from the White House to Greenwood station. What have I done?\"\nAly was born Azza Mahmoud Fawzi Hosseini Ali el Serougi in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1967, the daughter of a nurse \nand a textiles engineer who migrated to Australia in 1969. They were among the last migrants to be received at the \nBonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre in Albury-Wodonga - which, having made the world's headlines \ntwo decades earlier over the death from malnutrition of 13 children, had improved conditions considerably.\nThe family moved first to Marrickville in Sydney's inner west and then, just on the cusp of shifting to Texas, they \nrelocated to Brisbane, where Aly's dad got a job at the Jennings factory, which made corsets and women's \nunderwear.\nThey bought their first house in the very un-chi chi suburb of West End.\n\"And then in 1974 came the flood. My parents came from a desert country, they had never seen anything like this,\" \nAly says.\n\"But it was a defining feature of our Australian story because what we found was a community. It was almost like \nthey became Australian through the tragedy.\"\nMoments like that, she says, stand in stark contrast to other moments of division and rancour that have \ncharacterised the same-sex marriage plebiscite, the Voice referendum and the uncontained racism that followed the \n9/11 attacks in New York.\nThe current situation in Gaza is confronting, she says. Aly joined Ed Husic last month to warn Gaza's 2.3 million \nresidents were being \"collectively punished\" for the crimes of terrorists.\nAs the Israel-Hamas war becomes more divisive, Aly says she is trying to demonstrate how \"important it is that we \nrecognise each other's humanity and show compassion to each other, even when we are hurting the most\".\nAs the minister for early childhood education, and also the minister for youth, Aly has a lot on her plate as she \nmarshals through two reviews of the childcare and early learning sectors.\nThe government is moving, slowly, towards adopting a model of universal access. In July, it increased the \nmaximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning up to $80,000, and a sliding scale in subsidies for families \nearning less than $530,000.\n\"The fact is Australia is one of the most expensive places for early childhood education and care,\" says Aly.\n\"We have a quality system that is world-class, and a quality framework that has been in place for 10 years. The \nissue is the cost and the fact that the market isn't behaving the way you would expect. It doesn't go to where the \ndemand is, it goes to where the money is.\"\nThe delivery of the Productivity Commission report this week and the Australian Competition and Consumer \nCommission's investigation will ensure childcare remains one of the hot button issues for the Albanese government \nin coming months.Page 3 of 4\n'I'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN\nAly will be familiar to most people, even if they haven't connected the name to the face. She is the petite dark-\nhaired, dark-eyed woman in colourful clothing who sits behind Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during question \ntime. Aly is an active listener. She nods. She laughs. She scowls and boos. She never drifts off or checks her \nphone.\nAlways impeccably well-dressed, Aly's choice of clothing has taken a twist in the past couple of years as she took \nup crochet and knitting as a form of meditation and mindfulness as she takes endless flights between Canberra and \nPerth.\nThe white jumper she wears to lunch is handcrafted (and has a matching skirt), as was the crochet long dress she \nwore to this year's Mid-Winter Ball. She is already working on next year's dress, which will feature crocheted \nflowers, each unique, representing every woman who died from domestic violence during the year.\nAly has her own story of domestic violence, one that is told in her 2018 autobiography Finding My Place: From \nCairo to Canberra - the Irresistible Story of an Irrepressible Woman.\nShe had married young, at the age of 20, while living back in Egypt, where she was studying English literature, with \na minor in acting. The marriage wasn't arranged, as was common for girls like her. Rather, it was a way of escaping \nthe strictures of being a single woman in a Muslim country.\n\"The marriage gave me a freedom that I didn't have living under my parents' roof. It gave me the freedom to be a \nrespectable married woman in Egypt. It meant I could go camping with friends, I could go to parties, I could come \nhome when I wanted to.\"\nThere were red flags which she ignored - or didn't know any better.\nBut after moving to Perth, the violence and contemptuous behaviour escalated.\n\"There was a bit of martyrdom on my behalf. But there are a lot of stereotypes around women who are survivors, a \nlot of us are high achievers. The feelings of responsibility and humiliation; we expect more of ourselves,\" she says.\n\"I remember driving away once and saying out loud to myself: 'You must be just the kind of woman that men hit.' I'd \nresigned myself to it.\n\"I describe domestic violence as this crack in a bone somewhere in your body that you carry with you through your \nlife.\n\"It's hard to imagine myself as the person I was. I'm much more like me now than I was back then.\"\nShe finally kicked him out of the family home after six long years and began the next chapter as a broke single mum \nof two young sons, Karim and Adam. They only found out about the history of abuse when they read the \nautobiography.\nKeeping hearth and home together with a string of unskilled jobs, she retreated to her safe space: education. In all, \nshe has four degrees, including a masters in education and a PhD on counterterrorism and security.\nWhich, to circle back, might help explain the inappropriate ADHD comment, having completed the two-year masters \nin nine months and the PhD in two years - it typically take four to seven years.\n\"I'd put the boys to bed, study until 3 or 4am, and then get up at 7am.\"\nThat led to another chapter, as a world-renowned researcher and professor specialising in countering online violent \nextremism. It also got her invited to Oxford University and the White House to speak.\nHer political spark was ignited after the rise of anti-Muslim sentiment across the world, witnessing one-too-many \ninstances of casual racism in suburban Perth, and becoming a target of death threats because of her profile as a \nresearcher in anti-terrorism.Page 4 of 4\n'I'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN\nThe university moved her team to unidentified offices twice during the course of a year with strict instruction not to \nreveal the location.\nI have set aside 90 minutes for lunch, but after an hour a staffer taps Aly on the shoulder and says we have five \nminutes to wrap it up.\nHeavens, we haven't even got on to husband number two, or heaven forbid Dave Allen, who is husband number \nthree. (He is a Canadian-born former ice-hockey player, policeman and intelligence officer who she met while \nworking in the WA public service and married in 2012).\nWe need to talk more about childcare, whether the big for-profit corporates are price gouging, why the market is \nfailing (and what to do about it).\nTen minutes later, there is another tap on the shoulder. She really must go, her next appointment is unmovable.\nI feel a bit cheated.

Chants of \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" broke out as Dr Aly was ushered away.\nThe interaction began harmlessly, with a man introducing himself as a student studying early childhood education. \nBut Dr Aly quickly became visibly uncomfortable as the man began talking about the impact of Australia's decision \nto pause funding to the United Nations agency in Gaza, UNRWA. \nAt one point Dr Aly moved to push away a picture of a starving Palestinian boy. Later, she had to be held back by \nher husband Dave Allen and a staff member from re-engaging with the activists.\nDr Aly was born in Egypt before migrating to Australia as a child. Her ancestry and her Muslim faith has made her \na target for pro-Palestine activists who believe she and her government are not doing enough to protect people in \nGaza.\nDuring the confrontation, Dr Aly referred to how her father had fought for Egypt against Israel during the Six Day \nWar of 1967.\n\"My father fought in the war. And what have you done?\" she asked one of the protesters.\nPage 2 of 3\nLabor minister in heated clash with Palestine activists\nShe said those wanting to see a resolution to the conflict had to give up on the \"dream\" that Israel would \nspontaneously lay down its weapons without a negotiated truce.\n\"I would love a ceasefire to happen. We would all agree on that, correct? What has become increasingly clear is the \nonly way a ceasefire is going to happen is through a negotiation led by Egypt and Qatar,\" she said.\nDr Aly told the activists that Israel was losing the broader international support that they had previously enjoyed.\nDemocratic Senate majority chief Chuck Schumer, the highest-ranking elected Jewish American official in history, \nlast week called for Israel to hold new elections after labelling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu one of the \"major \nobstacles\" to peace. \nDr Aly told the activists that Mr Netanyahu's agenda had become \"very clear\".\n\"He has ruled the far right section of the Israeli government who have voiced openly their desire for the annihilation \nand annexation of Gaza,\" Dr Aly told the activists.\n\"It is a concern to the Egyptians, it is a concern to the region, and it is a concern to me as it is a concern to you.\"\nIn a statement to The Australian, Dr Aly said: \"I will continue to take every opportunity to talk with people from my \nlocal community about the issues that matter to them.\" \nDr Aly's community meetings had been flagged by Friends of Palestine WA, which - in a message posted to the \norganisation's Facebook group - urged its followers to use the events to \"tell federal Labor member Anne Aly what \nyou think about her government's appalling record of support for Israel's genocide over the past five months\".\nPro-Palestine and anti-Israel activism has increased dramatically around Australia since Hamas' October 7 \nattacks.\nThe Australian late last year revealed how some radical anti-Israel groups have been circulating guides advising on \nhow to sabotage and vandalise property, track Jewish shipping interests and evade police.\nThe co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Alex Ryvchin, told The Australian that while he \ndidn't agree with some of Dr Aly's statements, he admired her for responding to the harassment with \"dignity and \nstrength\".\n\"The incident demonstrates once again that anti-Israel protesters aren't interested in constructive engagement. \nThey believe only in slogans that make them feel morally superior and deceive the public into thinking they support \npeace,\" he said. \n\"In reality, they adhere to a fanatical worldview in which Israel is the supreme evil and anything done to its people is \njustified, even if it results in more defeat and more suffering for the Palestinians they claim to support. It is critical \nthat leaders understand this perverse mindset and never yield to this hatred or allow it to influence their policies and \npublic statements.\"\nForeign Affairs Minister Penny Wong on Friday announced that Australian funding of UNRWA would resume after \nthe government received assurances that the agency itself was not a terrorist organisation. \nNotes\nDocument links may not lead to an active page.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 680 words\nByline: Katina Curtis\nHighlight: Labor's childcare policy promises bigger subsidies for more than a million families, but new minister \nAnne Aly says it's unlikely the changes can start earlier than planned.\nBody\nMore than a million families are expected to benefit from Labor's proposed multibillion-dollar changes to childcare \nsubsidies, saving about $1200 on average, but they'll have to wait another year to see that relief.\nEarly Childhood Education Minister Anne Aly says the government will likely have to stick to its timetable of starting \nin July next year, as advocates say parents need cost-of-living pressures including childcare fees eased as soon as \npossible.\n\"It's not just a matter of going right, from tomorrow, the childcare subsidy has increased to 90 per cent for families \nearning $80,000 or less. There is a lot more to it,\" Aly said.\n\"Obviously, any opportunity to deliver our commitments earlier than expected will be good.\n\"So we're just playing it by ear at the moment, working towards that and I don't want to pre-empt any kind of \nchanges to that.\"\nPrevious overhauls of the subsidy system have required months of implementation time so the government and \nchildcare centres and providers can upgrade their IT systems.\nThe Parenthood executive director Georgie Dent said early learning was a huge cost pressure on families, \nespecially when combined with high inflation and interest rate rises.\n\"If it is feasible to bring it forwards, potentially to January, then that would absolutely be worthwhile,\" she said.\nThe existing system subsidises between 85 per cent and 20 per cent of fees, depending on a family's income.\nThe highest subsidies go to families earning below about $70,000 a year. The rate steps down so families earning \nbetween $175,000 and $254,300 receive a 50 per cent subsidy and then steps further so those earning between \n$344,300 and $354,300 get a 20 per cent subsidy. Above this income threshold, there is no subsidy.\nChanges that started in March increased the subsidy rate for second and subsequent children where families have \nmore than one child under the age of 5 in care, by 30 percentage points, up to a maximum of 95 per cent.\nPage 2 of 2\nParents set to save hundreds on childcare fees - but not until next year\nLabor's proposal will lift the subsidy rate for all families, smooth out the taper rate so it doesn't abruptly step down, \nand gives subsidies to families earning up to $530,000. It will also keep the higher subsidies for younger siblings.\nAly will task the Productivity Commission before year's end with examining the entire sector, with an aim of a \nuniversal subsidy of 90 per cent. She'll also ask the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to design a \nprice regulation mechanism to make sure higher subsidies don't translate into higher fees.\nWhile the Coalition attacked Labor's plan for paying the fees of wealthy families, those at the top end of the income \nscale get the lowest subsidies - about 7 per cent for a household income of $500,000.\nAn analysis of the proposal by ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods associate professor Ben Phillips finds \nthat while the largest benefits in dollar terms would go to parents in the top 20 per cent of incomes, that is because \nthey get either no subsidy or a lower level under the existing scheme.\nThose earning up to $86,000 will be an average $358 better off a year.\nOut of the almost 1.2 million families using childcare each year, all but about 14,300 would be better off than they \nare now.\nDent said it was also important the government dealt with existing workforce shortages before adding extra demand \nfor childcare.\nShe's been hearing from parents whose childcare centres are having to restrict the number of places on offer or \neven close rooms because they can't get enough staff.\n\"The situation with the workforce is a crisis and it's only increasing,\" she said.\nAly says addressing the workforce shortage has to be a cross-portfolio effort. She doesn't want to take anything off \nthe table, including migration and improving pay and conditions.\nBut she's confident the transitional approach - with the sliding scale of subsidies first - will allow the sector to meet \nthe increased demand.\nCut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis from Jacqueline Maley. \nSubscribers can sign up to our weekly Inside Politics newsletter here.\nLoad-Date: June 12, 2022\nEnd of Document",

I'm Mary Doyle, I'm the Labor Candidate for \nthe Aston by-election. It's really exciting to be here at Swinburne TAFE with the Prime Minister and Ministers \nO'Connor and Aly. And thanks to everyone including the wonderful students for showing us around this morning. \nTAFE is something I'm hugely passionate about, having been a TAFE student myself many years ago. And I can \ntell you, when I talk to people about the Albanese Government's plans for fee-free TAFE in critical sectors, they \noverwhelmingly tell me it's a great idea. This is a Government that I want to be a part of. One that looks at the \npressures facing families in the outer-eastern suburbs and then goes about making a practical difference to address \nthose challenges. Whether it's cheaper child care, which will benefit 5,700 families here in Aston. Whether it's \ncheaper medicines, already saving Aston locals more than $250,000 since that came in. Whether it's fee-free TAFE \nfor 55,000 Victorians. I want to be a part of the team that delivers for the outer-east. If I'm elected to be part of the \nAlbanese Government as the next Member for Aston, I promise you this I will always fight for TAFE, I will always \nfight for cheaper child care, and I will always fight for locals. And I'm thrilled to welcome the PM back to Wantirna.\nANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Well, thanks very much, Mary. And I do want to thank the staff and the \nstudents at Swinburne TAFE here for the very warm welcome that I've received here this morning, along with my \nMinister for Skills and Training, Brendan O'Connor, and my Minister who looks after Early Childhood Learning, \nAnne Aly. We're here to talk to students. We're here also to hear firsthand from them the difference that fee-free \nTAFE is making to their lives. We, arising out of the Jobs and Skills Summit last year, and a commitment we made \nat the election to 180,000 fee-free TAFE places are happening right now. And what we heard from this morning is \nstudents who not only are benefiting from that fee-free TAFE, but they're also working and earning an income while \nPage 2 of 6\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\nthat is happening. We've learned from them firsthand that this was part of the incentive for them to enter an area \nwhich has skill shortages. So, it's good for students, but it's good for the economy as well. And it's good for this \nregion, because we also heard that the early learning centres which they are partaking in now, in terms of their work \nexperience, are all local. And Mary Doyle understands that. That's why I want Mary Doyle, next Saturday, to \nbecome the Member for Aston. Because this community needs a voice in government. A Labor Government. A \nLabor Government that cares about people in the outer suburbs. A Labor Government that's committed to making a \ndifference with fee-free TAFE, to making a difference with the cheaper pharmaceuticals, but making a difference as \nwell in child care costs for families. One of the things that is happening here from the students we spoke to, not only \nare they benefiting from free-free TAFE, they're benefiting from working, because there are skills shortages, but \nthey're also having the bonus of our cheaper child care plan, that comes in on July 1, will mean that more women in \nparticular can join the workforce. This isn't a welfare policy. This is a productivity enhancing economic policy. This is \nabout improving women's workforce participation, it's about boosting productivity and also about boosting the \npopulation. The three Ps of economic growth are all ticked by this policy. Mary Doyle understands this. She hasn't \nshopped around for a seat. Mary Doyle ran for this seat last year, and she's been committed to her community, \nwhere she has lived for a long period of time, here in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. And that's why I want \nsomeone who actually understands this community, who's committed to this community, and who will represent this \ncommunity in the by-election on April 1. People do have an opportunity to send a message to the Opposition that \nthey need to do better than have Peter Dutton as their Leader. Peter Dutton, who has spent year after year in \ngovernment deriding Victorians, condemning the sacrifices that they were making during the pandemic, and \nsomeone who said that people weren't safe to go out in Melbourne. Like, he just doesn't get this city and he doesn't \nget this state of Victoria. Mary Doyle does. She'll be a fantastic representative, and I look forward to her joining our \nteam after April 1 and having input into the Budget that we'll be putting together in May, which will take further \npressure off working families in communities like this. I'll get Brendan to say something, Anne, and then we're \nhappy to take questions.\nBRENDAN O'CONNOR, MINISTER FOR SKILLS AND TRAINING: Thanks, Prime Minister. It's great to be with the \nPrime Minister and, of course, with Mary and Anne, here today at this fantastic dual sector provider at Swinburne. \nIt's fair to say that when we were elected, we comprehended the challenge we had in supplying the skills to the \nlabour market. There were skill shortages across the economy. Wherever you looked, whatever professional trade, \nthere were shortages. It was for that reason the Prime Minister convened the Jobs and Skills Summit, bringing \ntogether industry, bringing together state and territory governments, and finding solutions to the problems that we \ninherited. And I'm happy to say that the 180,000 fee-free TAFE places decision that was made at that summit was \nan absolutely critical part of the response by the Albanese Government to the skill shortages. And we're seeing it \nhere today, as a result of that decision and as a result of decisions by the Albanese Government with eight separate \ngovernments, eight state and territory governments, to have agreements in each jurisdiction, we can focus on the \neconomies of each state and territory. And that's what we've done. 55,000 fee-free places in Victoria, and then a \nlarge proportion of those, for example, in early childhood education, where there's a massive demand. 40 per cent \nof the advertisements for those jobs are in Victoria. That's why we've dedicated 3,800 places to this state, and that's \nwhy the students we've met today are able to enrol in those courses, knowing that they can afford it, knowing that \nthey can cope with the cost of living pressures because the courses are fee-free, which also means, because \nenrolments are going up, the supply of skilled workers to this really critical sector of our economy, looking after and \nteaching our children, preschool children is absolutely vital, we'll be able to provide that pipeline. So, as a result of \nthose agreements with state and territory governments, the fee-free component, which is ensuring that enrolments \nare increasing, we are responding to the skill shortages across the economy, not just in that area, but today we are \nfocussing on that area. And I believe that, certainly in talking with Mary, she fully understands the pressure that \nparents are under in terms of costs, the pressure that students are under, and that's why we're providing fee-free \nplaces and understands, too, that we need to be ensuring that we can supply the skilled workforce to an economy \nthat is certainly in need of such a supply. It's because of these decisions we are seeing the benefits that are \nhappening. And that's why in talking to the students today, it was quite obvious that it was a lot easier for them to \nenter into these courses, acquire these much needed skills, because of the announcement and the decision of the \nAlbanese Government, working with state and territory governments, providing fee-free options for them.Page 3 of 6\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\nANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: Thanks, Brendan. It's great to be here this \nmorning, of course, with the Prime Minister, with Brendan O'Connor, and our wonderful candidate for Aston, Mary \nDoyle. Mary is a local and she gets it. She gets what families here are going through and she understands the \nimportance of early childhood education and care. And, in fact, Mary was saying that her own daughter went locally \nhere, accessed early childhood education and care locally here, and still recognises her early childhood education \nteacher at the shopping centre. That's because she's a local. She knows this area, and she understands and values \nearly childhood education and care. Now, in just under 100 days, families right across Australia are going to reap \nthe benefits of our reforms that are making early childhood education and care more affordable. And we know that \nin order for that to be successful, we need a sustainable workforce. That is why the fee-free TAFE that the \nAlbanese Labor Government has introduced is so important. And today, we had the pleasure of meeting students \nlike Tiana and Connor who are using that fee-free TAFE. They are saving thousands of dollars and they are the \nfuture workforce of early childhood education and care, but they're also the current workforce of early childhood \neducation and care. Because, as the Prime Minister said, they are working as they are getting their degree in areas \nof skill shortages. We know that our early childhood education and care reforms that make it much more affordable \nfor families right across Australia are important, but we're also getting on with the job of ensuring that we have that \nsustainable workforce. And I'm proud to be a part of a Labor Government, I look forward to welcoming Mary Doyle \nas a Member for Aston after the election next week. I know she will make an extremely valuable contribution to the \nLabor Caucus. And I look forward to seeing more students like Tiana and Connor taking advantage of that fee-free \nTAFE, graduating with an Early Childhood Education and Care Certificate, and becoming part of our valuable \nworkforce in early childhood education and care.\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there's a lot of mortgage stress in the Aston area, what can your Government do to \nalleviate some of that?\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, what we're doing is having a comprehensive housing policy. There is legislation before the \nParliament, before the Senate next week, the Housing Australia Future Fund. That has a number of components to \nit. One is an increased investment in social and community housing, which will create 30,000 additional units over \nthe next five years. But it also has within it as well, additional funding for emergency housing, some $100 million, \nand it has, as part of that as well, funding specifically for veterans housing, as well as for women and children \nescaping family and domestic violence. That's one element. The other thing we're doing is a housing accord, \nworking with the private sector, with organisations like the Master Builders and the Housing Industry Association \nand others, having an accord with state and territory governments to increase the supply of housing. Prices, of \ncourse, are a product of demand and supply. So, what we want to do is to increase the supply of housing. We also \nhave our Housing Supply and Affordability Council is part of the legislation for the Housing Australia Future Fund. \nWhat that's aimed at doing is working with each level of government to make sure that approvals and land release \nand those issues are dealt with in our outer suburbs in a way that assists people. We recognise that people are \ndoing it tough. We are taking action on that. That's the other reason why we're making sure that we put downward \npressure on inflation. The Reserve Bank Governor, in the statement that he made at the beginning of this month, \nhas said that he hoped that inflation had peaked in the December quarter. Of course, the highest inflation rate \ngrowth of any quarter this century was the March 2022 quarter last year. So, the last full quarter in which the \nCoalition were in office was the highest inflation of any quarter in Australia this century. And that's why, as well, we \nwill produce a responsible Budget. That's why we returned 99 per cent of the revenue gains to the Budget in \nOctober last year. So there's no easy fix here. But we want to work with the Andrews Government to make sure that \nwe deal with the housing stress, which is a national phenomenon. That's why we're working with all state and \nterritory governments and the private sector. And that's why I'd urge the Senate next week to pass this legislation \nthat will make a difference.\nJOURNALIST: Do you expect the Premier to join you on the campaign trail in the last week here in Aston?\nPRIME MINISTER: I'll be in Parliament next week.\nJOURNALIST: Over the weekend maybe?Page 4 of 6\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\nPRIME MINISTER: Well I won't be here over the weekend. There's a couple of elections on, this by-election. This \nafternoon I'll be in Penrith, so a bit of notice for the media, I'll be in Penrith and I'll be in Riverstone this afternoon \nand I'll be in a range of seats tomorrow in my home state of New South Wales, as you would expect.\nJOURNALIST: Are you confident Chris Minns will get the job done?\nPRIME MINISTER: Chris Minns, I think, will make an outstanding Premier of New South Wales. That's a decision \nfor the people of New South Wales. I think, can I say this? I think that Dominic Perrottet and Chris Minns are both \nvery good people. They're good human beings. I have a good relationship with both of them and I like both of them. \nThe problem is that Dominic Perrottet's Government is a shambles. The Liberals are too busy fighting each other \nand fighting the Nationals, and the Nationals fighting each other, to fight for the people of New South Wales. And \nthat's why Chris Minns deserves and his team deserves to be elected to government tomorrow. I'll work with \nwhoever is elected it, as I do constructively. I've had liaison with Premier Rockliff this morning. My Government \nactually works for solutions. We look for unity. We don't look for division. The problem with the modern Liberal Party \nis that it is so divided on itself. On itself. I mean, they can't make a decision on constitutional recognition for \nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in 2023. If they oppose it, they've got to say. When will that occur? How \nlong? Is 122 years not long enough to wait to recognise that our history didn't begin in 1788? The Victorian Liberal \nParty here are a shambles. We've seen them fighting each other. And the Caucus can't make a decision in \nCanberra, in Peter Dutton. That's why we need to send a message to them that they need to do better. They need \nto get their act together. That's why Mary Doyle deserves to be elected as the Member for Aston. If she joins our \nCaucus, she'll join a united, coherent team. A united, coherent team that has plans for our economic growth, that \nhas plans for social equity, that has plans for gender equality, that has plans for dealing with the challenge of \nclimate change, that supports multiculturalism, that doesn't have to think about these things because it's in our core. \nIt's our instinct. And that is what Mary Doyle, that's the team that she will join if she's elected.\nJOURNALIST: Do you agree with Linda Burney that Peter Dutton is just looking for excuses to reject the Voice? \nAnd secondly, will you release the Solicitor-General's advice on the wording?\nPRIME MINISTER: Well the two things are connected, because Peter Dutton knows that he sat in a Cabinet for \nnine years and didn't release any advice to the Cabinet. It's not the way it works. And he knows that. He knows that. \nSo what we saw from Peter Dutton, over a long period of time, was first in the lead-up to my speech at Garma, he \nsaid, 'We don't know what the question is.' So, I released draft words. We received not a suggestion in between \nJuly last year and yesterday when I released what will be in the legislation to go to Parliament next week. Not one \nsuggestion from him or Julian Leeser, the Shadow Attorney-General, of any change. Not a word. And Julian Leeser, \nwe know, has been involved with the wording since a decade ago. A decade ago. He was one of the people who \nwere involved in that process, as Noel Pearson outlined in The Australian some weeks ago. So, Peter Dutton needs \nto get real about this. This isn't about him, and it's not about me. This is about whether we are a better country \ngoing forward. It's whether we can recognise Indigenous Australians in our nation's birth certificate. And then it's \nonly about one other thing, which is will we get better outcomes if we consult the people who are impacted by those \ndecisions? That's what this is about. It's a simple proposition before the Australian people, and I'm confident that \nthe Australian people will vote yes. And the idea whenever any detail is given, and yesterday we released eight of \nthe principles that will go towards the legislation in shaping the Voice. And the Voice can't be clearer, the words that \nwill go forward include, the third point, 'The Parliament shall, subject to this constitution, have power to make laws \nwith respect to matters relating to', which is a legal term, 'Relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, \nincluding its composition, functions, powers and procedures'. Peter Dutton will be a part of the Parliament and \nfuture members will be a part of future Parliaments, that will determine the function of the Voice. And he knows that \nthat's the case. And we know from the Republic playbook that occurred last century, that it is nothing more than a \ntactic, and it lacks genuineness to just continue to say 'We don't have the detail'. No matter how much detail is put \nout, Peter Dutton will say, 'What about more detail?' That's the game that's being played here. And he should make \na decision of where he stands on this issue, because this is an issue that isn't the creation of a Labor Government. \nThis has arisen from the bottom up. And yesterday I had Ken Wyatt, who flew overnight to Canberra, the \nIndigenous Affairs Minister in the Morrison Government, to stand next to me and with his fellow Aboriginal and \nTorres Strait Islander people who've been a part of the Referendum Working Group, who've come to a unanimous \nposition. And I'd say that this should be above politics as the 1967 referendum was.Page 5 of 6\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what economic benefits do you see from the Voice, and do you intend to sit down \nwith Mr Dutton before next Thursday to discuss his concerns?\nPRIME MINISTER: I sat down with him yesterday. I sat down with him before we did the press conference. Let's be \nvery clear, that's the seventh time I have sat down with Peter Dutton. Peter Dutton has met with the Referendum \nWorking Group twice. You know what? At those meetings we haven't had questions raised. He's had every \nopportunity. There have been, I think it was Thomas Mayor yesterday, outlined the number of inquiries, details, \ncommittees that have looked into this over more than a decade. The Uluru Statement from the Heart was in 2017. It \ngrew out of a First Nations Constitutional Convention. It grew out of a five-year process from 2012 that began back \nat the end of the last century. John Howard was Prime Minister when he said there needed to be constitutional \nrecognition. Scott Morrison went to the election in 2019 and said there should be constitutional recognition. It was \nthe Morrison Government that established the committee that Tom Calma and Marcia Langton presided over, with \npeople like Chris Kenny and Frank Brennan and a range of people who participated and produced a report that is \nhundreds of pages long. It went to the Cabinet of the Morrison Government, not my Government, not once, but \ntwice. The detail is out there. The detail is out there. We need to know, as well, know this, that the programs that \nhave been successful, that make a difference for Indigenous people, are ones in which they have been involved. \nJustice reinvestment by the Coalition Government in New South Wales in places like Moree and Bourke, the \nIndigenous Rangers Program, community health programs. Where people are involved, you get better outcomes. \nAnd that is something that is just a fact, and that is why we had this coming together. Aboriginal and Torres Strait \nIslander people are no less homogeneous than any other group that you want to pick. But what you had yesterday \nwas people from different parts of Australia, from different parts of the country, coming together. And, you know, \nthe great Galarrwuy Yunupingu, watching it there on Yolngu country in Arnhem Land, watching it, a product of his \nlife's work. These people, their patience, their modesty, their humbleness, is inspirational. And they deserve, they \ndeserve nothing less than for people to put politics aside and to get this done. And we will give the Australian \npeople the opportunity to enlarge our country later this year. And we can be enlarged, or we can shrink. Shrink into \nplaying old politics. And that's what people need to consider who are in positions of political leadership on this \nissue.\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you worried the wording leaves the door open for High Court challenges? Or are \nyou confident that it's as watertight as you say it is?\nPRIME MINISTER: I'm absolutely confident. But I'm confident on the basis of people like the former head of the \nHigh Court, Justice French. He might know something about the Constitution. The leading academic in Australia \non constitutional law, Professor Anne Twomey, might know something about the Constitution. This hasn't arisen in \na vacuum. There's been all of this work done by the advisory group to the Referendum Working Group. It's very \nclear that this is a straightforward proposition. People can read it themselves. I just read out the third clause that \nmakes it clear that the Parliament is primary. The primacy of the Parliament is there, including its composition, \nfunctions, powers and procedures. A key word, including. So, all matters, and it says, to matters relating to, matters \nis often used as a legal term as well. And we took proper advice, and I'm very confident you will have an \nopportunity. If you get ten lawyers in a room, you'll often get someone who gets a run in. That's what they're paid to \ndo. That's why on different sides, to put this in perspective, that's why on different sides in courts, you have lawyers \non one side and lawyers on the other side. They're paid to advocate. That's an honourable profession to do. But \nyou shouldn't use that fact to say that there's someone out there who disagrees. Someone, I'm sure I can find you a \nlawyer who can tell you that that jacket you're wearing is orange or pink. I can find that for you. Pay them enough, \nthat'll happen.\nJOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just back to Aston. Do you think what's happening internally in the Liberal Party in \nVictoria could actually work in Mary Doyle's favour in regards to Moira Deeming?\nPRIME MINISTER: Well, I think the Liberal Party is dysfunctional here. We saw that in the lead-up to the state \nelection. We saw that in the way that the Federal Liberal Party people here operate as well. Michael Sukkar was \npretty desperate to stop the candidate being preselected here for Aston. He didn't have confidence that someone \nfrom outside the area would be appropriate. I mean, we're a long way from the Melbourne City Council. And I think \nthat that's just a fact, that it's a dysfunctional branch. They need to be given time to get their act together. In the Page 6 of 6\nDOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023\nmeantime, we've got a fantastic candidate who secured the unanimous support of everyone, who ran last time, who \nhasn't shopped around for a seat. Who wants to represent this seat, this time after next Saturday. Thanks very \nmuch.\nLoad-Date: March 24, 2023\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 704 words\nHighlight: Anne Aly said the confrontation with pro-Palestinian activists in a park last weekend was not the first, \nbut was the most intense clash she had experienced.\nBody\nEarly Education Minister Anne Aly has warned that heightened tensions in the community over the war in Gaza \nhave forced some politicians to retreat from public events, following a heated exchange she had with pro-\nPalestinian demonstrators in Perth last Saturday.\nFootage emerged on Tuesday of Aly - who is one of two Muslim frontbenchers - confronted by pro-Palestine \nactivists in her inner-north Perth electorate the previous weekend, demanding she label Israel's retaliatory strikes \nagainst Gaza since the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack as genocide.\nLink to Image\nAlex Ellinghausen\nWhile the protesters raised their voices aggressively, Aly was not physically attacked.\nAly told ABC Radio National on Friday she often holds an open office in the park on weekends for people in her \nelectorate who cannot visit her office during working hours. She said the conflict with protesters - organised by \nFriends of Palestine WA - was not the first but was the most intense clash she had experienced.\n\"Many of my colleagues have faced similar or worse to the point that many of them have had to stop doing open air \noffices, which I think you know, is a real shame for those members of the community who need to have open \naccess to their federal members,\" Aly said.\nSince the October 7 attack, multiple ministers including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Defence Minister Richard \nMarles, NDIS Minister Bill Shorten as well as Labor backbencher Peter Khalil had their electorate offices defaced \nwith graffiti, signs and fake dead bodies, which Aly believed had a chilling effect on politicians being able to do their \nwork.\n\"When I go out into my community there are a variety of issues that people want to talk to me about,\" she said.\n\"The situation in Gaza is also one of those issues that people want me to advocate on and want me to speak up \nabout, and so I want to be able to speak up about them.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nConfrontations over Gaza make politicians feel unsafe, says minister\nThe US on Friday (AEDT) announced that it planned to put a resolution calling for an immediate truce in Gaza to a \nvote of the UN Security Council, intensifying pressure on Israel.\nWashington, which traditionally has shielded Israel at the UN, has incrementally applied more pressure to its \nlongtime ally, and the draft Security Council resolution marked a further toughening.\nThe shift has coincided with rising global condemnation of the five-month-old war, Palestinian civilian deaths, and \nthe prospect of a man-made famine in Gaza.\nHamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1200 people and taking more than 200 hostages, according to Israeli \ntallies. Israel's offensive since then has killed almost 32,000 Palestinians, according to Hamas-run Gaza health \nauthorities.\nAustralia has since December supported the UN's call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the restoration of \naid to people trapped in the war zone, but has not explicitly condemned Israel.\nBoth Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong have said several times that Israel has a right to defend itself.\nOn October 19, Aly backed senior federal minister Ed Husic, a fellow Muslim, when he said Palestinians were being \n\"collectively punished for Hamas' barbarism\".\nAly said there were greater expectations placed on herself and other Muslim MPs.\n\"I've actually had Muslim leaders sending me messages of support and one of them yesterday said, 'you know, to \nbe honest, it is because you're a Muslim woman, you're copping more than anyone else',\" she said.\n\"I wouldn't want to say it's just because of that, but I do think that there are certain expectations on me.\"\nAggressive and violent incidents involving federal MPs have been under the spotlight previously, when in 2019 a \nbipartisan group of parliamentarians warned that Australia's increasingly toxic political debate could lead to tragic \nconsequences.\nEarlier this week, Liberal senator and former ambassador to Israel Dave Sharma warned of lasting damage to \nsociety from a rise in threats to Jewish Australians and other minorities, declaring that everyone would lose if \nnothing was done to stop mob attacks.\nFriends of Palestine Western Australia have been contacted for comment.\nCut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.

The swearing in was briefly interrupted when a phone rang as MP Kristy \nMcBain was shaking Governor General David Hurley's hand, playing the riff of the 1987 INXS hit 'Need You \nTonight'. The Prime Minister joked: \"Can ministers not bring soundtracks, please\".\nMr Albanese said during the election campaign he intended to maintain the same team as in shadow ministry \nduring the Morrison government's tenure, which has largely remained true.\nThe new ministry was sworn in before Mr Albanese flies to Indonesia on Sunday.\nMr Albanese on Tuesday addressed Labor senators and MPs at the first federal caucus since the party won the \nfederal election.\"I want to remind you that you shouldn't waste a day in government. We don't intend to,\" he said.\nAfter posing for a variety of family photos on the steps of Government House, the new ministers will head into \nbriefings this afternoon followed by a Cabinet meeting tonight.\nFull list of portfolios:\nPage 2 of 3\nLabor's historic frontbench sworn in\nJim Chalmers - Treasurer\nPenny Wong - Senate Leader and Foreign Minister\nRichard Marles - Deputy PM and Defence\nTanya Plibersek - Environment and Water\nJason Clare - Education\nKaty Gallagher - Finance, Public Service and Women\nMark Dreyfus - Attorney-General and Cabinet Secretary\nTony Burke - Leader of the House, Employment and Workplace Relations and Arts\nDon Farrell - Tourism and Travel and Special Minister of State\nClare O'Neil - Home Affairs\nAmanda Rishworth - Social Services\nBill Shorten - NDIS and Government Services\nMark Butler - Health and Aged Care\nChris Bowen - Climate Change and Energy\nCatherine King - Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government\nMadeleine King - Resources and Northern Australia\nBrendan O'Connor - Skills and Training\nMurray Watt - Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Emergency Management\nLinda Burney - Indigenous Australians\nJulie Collins - Housing, Homelessness and Small Business\nMichelle Rowland - Communications\nEd Husic - Industry and Science\nStephen Jones - Assistant Treasurer and Financial Services\nAnne Aly - Early Childhood Education and Youth\nKristy McBain - Regional Development, Local Government and Territories\nAndrew Giles - Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs\nMatt Keogh - Veterans Affairs and Defence Personnel\nPat Conroy - Defence Industry and International Development and the Pacific\nAnika Wells - Sport and Aged CarePage 3 of 3\nLabor's historic frontbench sworn in\nNotes\nDocument links may not lead to an active page.

And then came politics\nAFR Online\nNovember 24, 2023 Friday 12:02 AM UTC\nCopyright 2023 Fairfax Media Publications Pty. Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1889 words\nHighlight: If there is such a thing as a traditional path into parliament, Australia's first Muslim federal female \npolitician did not take it.\nBody\nWithin minutes of sitting down for lunch with Anne Aly, she has invited me to join her for lemon chicken tagine at \nher house next time I am in Perth.\nAnd just moments later I seem to have crossed some unspoken social convention by asking her if she has ADHD. \nShe hasn't.\nOne thing is for sure, there will not be too many barriers standing in the way of a free-ranging conversation. Which \nis just as well because so far, things aren't going according to plan.\nLink to Image\nTracey Nearmy\nWe had arranged to meet at Zeytin Turkish Cuisine on the foreshore of Lake Burley Griffin. \nBut when I show up at noon sharp, not a sign of life.\nI'm busily texting Aly's people when, luckily, we run into each other - Canberra is a small place - so we amble a few \nmetres along until we come to a cafe on the corner that seems, well, convenient.\nWe grab a table outside and Aly immediately launches into a monologue about how to make a lemon chicken \ntagine which involves soaking the tagine pot in a bath for 24 hours, rubbing it with oil and then cooking the middle-\neastern deliciousness for another 24 hours in a very low oven.\nWe are scanning the menu and Aly announces she \"doesn't do rice\" which is a staple of middle eastern cuisine and \nwhich make her some sort of pariah at family events. She opts for the grilled fennel chicken (no butter please) and a \nvery hot almond milk cappuccino. I choose the zucchini fritters and a bean-a-colada, which, disappointingly has \nneither booze nor beans.\nAly, let it be said, is prone to the odd swear word, as am I, and over the next 60 minutes our conversation is \npeppered with F-bombs.\nPage 2 of 5\nAnne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics\nThe thrice-married Aly had already lived a complex and somewhat haphazard life before she decided rather \nspontaneously to run as the Labor candidate for the West Australian seat Cowan in 2016. She managed to turf out \nthe Liberal incumbent Luke Simpkins by the finest of margins.\n\"It took 10 days to count the vote,\" she says.\nIn 2019, she increased her margin and by 2022 she harnessed 46.9 per cent of the vote adding more than 9 per \ncent to her 2019 numbers.\nOf that first campaign, she remembers standing at a train station with a picture of herself while waving at cars. A \nyear ago to the day, she had been invited to speak at the White House at a countering terrorism conference.\n\"All I could think was from the White House to Greenwood station. What have I done?\"\nThe migrant experience\nAly was born Azza Mahmoud Fawzi Hosseini Ali el Serougi in Alexandria, Egypt in 1967. The daughter of a nurse \nand a textiles engineer who immigrated to Australia in 1969. They were among the last migrants to be received at \nthe Bonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre in Albury Wodonga - which, having made the world's \nheadlines two decades earlier over the death from malnutrition of 13 children, had improved conditions \nconsiderably.\nThe family moved first to Marrickville in Sydney's inner west and then, just on the cusp of shifting to Texas, they \nrelocated to Brisbane where Aly's dad got a job with the Jennings factory, which produced corsets and women's \nunderwear.\nThey bought their first house in the very un-chi chi West End.\n\"And then in 1974 came the flood. My parents came from a desert country, they had never seen anything like this,\" \nAly says.\n\"But it was a defining feature of our Australian story because what we found was a community. It was almost like \nthey became Australian through the tragedy.\"\nThe 'rational, calming voice'\nMoments like that, she says, stand in stark contrast to other moments of division and rancour that have \ncharacterised the same-sex marriage plebiscite, the Voice referendum and uncontained racism following the 9/11 \nattacks in New York.\nThe current situation in Gaza is confronting, she says. Aly joined Ed Husic last month to warn Gaza's 2.3 million \nresidents were being \"collectively punished\" for the crimes of terrorists.\nAs the Israel-Gaza war becomes more divisive, Aly says she is trying to demonstrate how \"important it is that we \nrecognise each other's humanity and show compassion to each other even when we are hurting the most\".\n\" I've spoken and met with the Muslim community and members of the Jewish community. And what I say is to \ncommunities here, who have intergenerational trauma, and accumulative trauma and who are hurting, is that \nsometimes the hardest thing to do is to be the rational, calming voice in a room of people who are hurting so much \nthat the only thing that they can do is shout,\" she says.\nThe problem with early childhood\nAs the minister for early childhood education, and also the minister for youth, Aly has a lot on her plate as she \nmarshalls through two reviews of the childcare and early learning sectors.Page 3 of 5\nAnne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics\nThe government is moving, slowly, towards adopting a model of universal access. In July, it increased the \nmaximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning up to $80,000 and a sliding scale in subsidies for every \nfamily earning less than $530,000.\n\"The fact is Australia is one of the most expensive places for early childhood education and care,\" says Aly.\n\"We have a quality system that is world-class, and a quality framework that has been in place for 10 years. The \nissue is the cost and the fact that the market isn't behaving the way you would expect. It doesn't go to where the \ndemand is, it goes to where the money is.\"\nThe delivery of the Productivity Commission report this week and the Australian Competition and Consumer \nCommission's investigation will ensure childcare remains one of the hot button issues for the Albanese government \nin coming months.\nOne of the problems the government has commissioned the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to \naddress is price gouging, which could see the benefits of more generous subsidies to parents whittled away to zero \nby higher fees.\n\"We're going to be watching. People who are making a lot of money out of early childhood education and care at \nthe expense of it being affordable and accessible for parents need to know we are watching,\" Aly says.\nShe says the complexity of the system ranging from ASX-listed corporations to mum-and-dad small businesses, \nmake it difficult to navigate but that her goal is to find a system \"that works for everyone\".\n\"That could mean different kinds of service delivery in different areas and even different kinds of services. But it's \nwhere parents are confident of the quality and safety for their children.\"\nA face you'll know\nAly will be familiar to most people, even if they haven't connected the name to the face. She is the petite dark-\nhaired, dark-eyed woman in colourful clothing who sits behind Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during question \ntime. Aly is an active listener. She nods. She laughs. She scowls and boos. She never drifts off or checks her \nphone.\nAlways impeccably well-dressed, Aly's choice of clothing has taken a twist in the past couple of years as she took \nup crochet and knitting as a form of meditation and mindfulness as she takes endless flights between Canberra and \nPerth.\nThe white jumper she wears to lunch is handcrafted (and has a matching skirt) as was the crochet long dress to this \nyear's Mid-Winter Ball. She is already working on next year's which will feature a crocheted flower, each unique, \nrepresenting every woman who died from domestic violence during the year.\nInstagram link\n\"Then I will auction it off for a domestic violence charity,\" she says.\nAly has her own story of domestic violence, one that is told in her 2018 autobiography Finding My Place: From \nCairo to Canberra - the irresistible story of an irrepressible woman.\nShe had married young, at the age of 20, while living back in Egypt where she was studying English literature, with \na minor in acting. The marriage wasn't arranged, as was common for girls like her. Rather, it was a way of escaping \nthe strictures of being a single woman in a Muslim country.\n\"The marriage gave me a freedom that I didn't have living under my parents' roof. It gave me the freedom to be a \nrespectable married woman in Egypt. It meant I could go camping with friends, I could go to parties, I could come \nhome when I wanted to.\"Page 4 of 5\nAnne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics\nThere were red flags which she ignored - or didn't know any better.\nBut after moving to Perth, the violence and contemptuous behaviour escalated.\n\"There was a bit of martyrdom on my behalf. But there are a lot of stereotypes around women who are survivors, a \nlot of us are high achievers. The feelings of responsibility and humiliation; we expect more of ourselves,\" she says.\n\"I remember driving away once and saying out loud to myself: 'you must be just the kind of woman that men hit'. I'd \nresigned myself to it.\n\"I describe domestic violence as this crack in a bone somewhere in your body that you carry with you through your \nlife.\n\"It's hard to imagine myself as the person I was. I'm much more like me now than I was back then.\"\nShe finally kicked him out of the family home after six long years and began the next chapter as a broke single mum \nof two young sons, Karim and Adam. They only found out about the history of abuse when they read the \nautobiography.\nKeeping hearth and home together with a string of unskilled jobs, she retreated to her safe space: education. In all, \nshe has four degrees, including a masters in education and a PhD on counter-terrorism and security.\nWhich, to circle back, might help explain the inappropriate ADHD comment, having completed the two-year masters \nin nine months and the PhD in two years - which typically take four to seven years.\n\"I'd put the boys to bed, study until 3 or 4 am and then get up at 7am.\"\nThat led to another chapter, as a world-renowned researcher and eventually professor specialising in countering \nonline violent extremism. It also got her invited to Oxford University and the White House to speak.\nHer political spark was ignited after the rise of anti-Muslim sentiment across the world, witnessing one-too-many \ninstances of casual racism in suburban Perth, and becoming a target of death threats because of her profile as a \nresearcher in anti-terrorism.\n\"Some days I felt broken and beaten by it all - by the death threats and the calls to 'hang [her] from a tree', 'drown \nher in pig's blood' and 'put a bullet in the bag',\" she writes in her autobiography.\nThe university moved her team to unidentified offices twice during the course of a year with strict instruction not to \nreveal the location.\nA lot left unsaid\nI have set aside 90 minutes for lunch, but after an hour a staffer taps Aly on the shoulder and says we have five \nminutes to wrap it up.\nHeavens, we haven't even got on to husband number two, or heaven forbid Dave Allen, who is husband number \nthree. (He is a Canadian-born former ice-hockey player, policeman and intelligence officer who she met while \nworking in the WA public service and married in 2012).\nWe need to talk more about childcare, whether the big for-profit corporates are price gouging, why the market is \nfailing (and what to do about it).\nWe need to talk about the experience of working as a woman in Parliament House and whether she has witnessed \nor been subjected to misogynistic or sexist behaviour (she has).\nTen minutes later, there is another tap on the shoulder. She really must go, her next appointment is unmovable.Page 5 of 5\nAnne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics\nI feel a bit cheated. It's been a rollicking fun lunch. I will be knocking on her door for lemon chicken tagine next time \nI'm in Perth.\nGraphic\n \nFrom broke single mum, to world-renowned terrorism researcher and Australia's first Muslim federal female \npolitician, Anne Aly has a complex CV.\nLoad-Date: November 26, 2023\nEnd of Document",

Both groups share a sense of betrayal by Labor, over \nseveral years, economically and now via the conflict in Gaza,\" Mr Samaras said.\nHe told ABC News female participants were, qualitatively, angrier than their male counterparts in their attitudes \naround the government's response to the conflict.\nHe said the women in the group described consistent and long-term experiences of racism, such as stares and \ncomments in public about \"how you dress\" or family members being knocked back on job applications because of \nthe perception of their ethnicity and religion.\nThe men, by contrast, were far more comfortable that racism was improving in Melbourne, and none described \nexperiencing any systemic discrimination.\nMr Samaras said the women see a long-term abandonment of their local communities \u2014 not just their religious \ncommunity \u2014 by all governments, of all persuasions.\n\"The simmering rage from these experiences/perceptions now finds a lightning rod in the Gaza conflict \u2014 it \nbecomes totemic of both the discrimination they face and the perceived neglect of 'people like them' by \ngovernments,\" he said.\nBut incumbency is still a factor and local member Ms Vamvakinou \u2014 herself an immigrant from Greece \u2014 was \nsingled out by participants as someone who respects them and their culture.\n\"Numerous participants, unprompted, also made it clear that they would find it hard voting against Labor whilst she \nwas there. Their references to the local MP were more profound as many participants constantly listed examples of \nhow Labor tends to only have MPs from non-diverse backgrounds,\" Mr Samaras said.\nMs Vamvakinou told the ABC that seats like hers have shown, over the past few elections, \"a willingness to send all \npoliticians a clear message\" that they should not be taken for granted.\n\"Hence why I work tirelessly to ensure that all parts of my electorate are represented \u2014 and that this representation \nextends to not just local issues,\" she said.\n\"I have a long history in working for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and will continue to do so. I'm heartened \nthat parts of my community are aware of this work. However, it's clear that voters in electorates like mine from \ndiverse communities are far more politically alert as to who represents them than ever before.\"\nMr Samaras said that as the federal election looms and the war in Gaza continues to disrupt the political scene, \nparticularly in seats where constituents have strong links to the Middle East, Labor must be cautious about \npotentially parachuting in outsiders who don't have diverse backgrounds and links with the community.\nFiery confrontation in Perth\nThe focus group results came as video emerged of Labor frontbencher and Muslim woman Dr Anne Aly being \nharassed by protesters, demanding she call what is happening in Gaza a genocide.Page 3 of 3\nLabor minister Anne Aly clashes with pro- Palestinian protesters as polling shows Gaza pressure building on \nLabor\nIn the video of the clash, which occurred on Saturday at a reserve in the Perth suburb of Stirling, Dr Aly was \napproached by pro-Palestinian protesters who asked about malnutrition in Gaza and Labor's decision to cut \nUNWRA funding, which the government had overturned the day before.\nThe conversation became heated, with both sides talking over each other, switching between English and Arabic.\nPlain-clothes police officers interrupted and escorted Dr Aly and her team away, as protesters chanted \"will you call \nit genocide?\" and \"ceasefire now\".\nDr Aly told the ABC she will not be stopped despite the activism she faces at community events.\n\"I hold these events so that people in my community can have an opportunity to come and speak with me. I'll \ncontinue to do that.

\nbillion dollars of public money\nABC Premium News (Australia)\nNovember 25, 2024 Monday\nCopyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1380 words\nByline: By the Specialist Reporting Team's Mary Lloyd and national disability affairs reporter Nas Campanella\nHighlight: A childcare operator was given the power to allocate more than half a billion dollars in federal funding \nset aside for children with disabilities, without any public record of how the money was spent.\nBody\nA childcare operator was given the power to allocate more than half a billion dollars in federal funding set aside \nfrom 2016 to 2023 for children with disabilities, without any public record of how the money was spent.\nA 7.30 investigation uncovered the arrangement between the Department of Education and KU Children's Services \nafter families and childcare centres raised concerns about being denied funding.\nThe investigation also identified potential conflicts of interest resulting from one childcare service approving \npayments to its competitors, as well as other services it had commercial arrangements with.\nEstablished in 2016, the Inclusion Support Program (ISP) helps children with additional needs access early \nchildhood education by funding additional educators, providing specialist equipment and training staff.\nThe program currently supports more than 23,000 children who would otherwise have a hard time accessing early \neducation.\nThe Department of Education oversees the ISP, but for the past eight years has contracted private operators to run \nit.\nOne of the core functions of the program is to help childcare centres hire additional educators to support children \nwith disability.\nTo do this, the government made more than $562 million available to subsidise the salaries of childcare workers.\nPage 2 of 4\nGovernment allowed private organisation to hand out more than half a billion dollars of public money\nKU Children's Services (KU) is a not-for-profit organisation which in 2016 won the government tender to manage \nthat particular fund.\uffff\nGovernment contracts, like those with KU, are signed with private operators after they have won a bidding process \nto provide the most competitive offering.\nGovernment grants, like those paid to the daycare services, offer financial assistance to entities with the intention of \nachieving policy outcomes.\nGreens senator Barbara Pocock was recently part of a Senate inquiry into consultancy firms, which examined how \ngovernment outsourced work to private enterprise.\nShe said programs like the ISP were an important function of government and that contracting out their \nadministration was \"not the right thing to do\".\n\"It is government business to allocate and manage its big programs like this one,\" Senator Pocock said.\n\"Those services need to be provided, but they need to be provided in ways where taxpayers can be confident that \nwe're getting value for money.\"\nIn a statement, KU CEO Chris Legg said the organisation processed funding applications within the designated \nguidelines, and was one of several reputable early childhood organisations facilitating the program.\n\"KU has a strong commitment to the inclusion of all children in early childhood education,\" she said.\nLack of transparency\nDetails of how the $562 million grant was disbursed have never been made publicly available, but were instead \nreported by the department as a single grant to KU.\nDirector of the Centre for Public Integrity Geoffrey Watson said it was \"disgraceful\" there was no transparency over \nhow the money was spent.\n\"The point is we need to know why and how this money is being allocated,\" Mr Watson said.\nCommonwealth legislation requires all government grants and variations to those grants be reported on government \nsite, GrantConnect.\nThe site shows the grant was first approved in May 2016 for $93.6 million and had ballooned to $562.8 million by \n2023.\nThe department told 7.30 the grant grew in value to meet increasing demand for inclusion support from early \nchildhood education services. \nWhen asked in Senate Estimates this month whether payments from the fund had been reported anywhere, \nDepartment of Education assistant secretary Anne Twyman said KU held the detail \"for accountability purposes\".\nIn its 2022-23 annual report, the Department of Education acknowledged that the handling of the grant was a matter \nof \"significant non-compliance\" and said \"appropriate processes\" had since been put in place.  \nThe department also told 7.30 KU did not directly receive any of the funding because payments went directly to \nchildcare services.\nAccording to the statement, \"the IT system used to administer the [subsidy] requires the subsidy to be linked to KU \nChildren's Services and is a system reporting mechanism\".Page 3 of 4\nGovernment allowed private organisation to hand out more than half a billion dollars of public money\nKU and the department initially told 7.30 that in KU's capacity as fund manager, it did not approve applications from \nchildcare operators seeking to subsidise more support staff.\nA government spokesperson also told 7.30 applications were assessed by KU as the fund manager and then \napproved by the department.\nHowever, the department has since confirmed that from May 2016 until August 2023, KU was contracted to \napprove grants on behalf of the government.\nThe department raised the issue in its 2022-23 annual report, noting \"grant agreements were entered into by a third \nparty under a contractual arrangement, but without appropriate delegations in place.\"\nKU was told to stop making grant decisions in August 2023. Education Minister Jason Clare and Minister for Early \nChildhood Education Anne Aly\uffffwere notified of the problem the following month.\nBoth the department and KU have confirmed the childcare operator is no longer approving grants.\nPotential conflicts of interest\nAs well as approving grants from 2016 to 2023, KU operated childcare services that could apply for that funding.\nMr Watson said the possibility that it could approve grants to its own services posed one conflict of interest, and that \nit could assess applications from its commercial competitors posed another.\n\"This is public money. The public is entitled to know that it's been properly spent and when these sorts of conflicts \nemerge, you avoid them,\" he said.\nIn a statement, KU told 7.30 \"clear conflict of interest protocols and policies are in place to ensure quality, \nconsistency and fairness for all service providers\".\nThe Department of Education said that to mitigate conflicts of interest, KU's funding applications were processed by \na third party, not-for-profit childcare operator Big Fat Smile.\n7.30 can reveal that during that time, KU had a commercial arrangement with a division of Big Fat Smile to run part \nof the ISP in NSW and the ACT.\n7.30 can also reveal Big Fat Smile was contracted directly to KU to approve funding applications from KU-run \nchildcare centres.\nMr Watson said that was ridiculous.\n\"It's a complex of conflicts of interest,\" he said.\n\"That's just wrong.\"\nHe said the program was not functional in its current form, and wanted it referred to the National Office of the \nAuditor General.\nSenator Pocock agreed the program needed to be scrutinised.\n\"It is vital [the services] be provided with proper review and evaluation and knowing that the right money is going to \nthe right places with the best outcome for our kids,\" she said.\nValue for money\nWhile investigating the program, 7.30 also found the contracts to run the program had not been put out for retender \nduring the eight years it had been operating.Page 4 of 4\nGovernment allowed private organisation to hand out more than half a billion dollars of public money\nThe government initially agreed to pay KU $8.3 million to run the fund, but as the program was extended that \ncontract was amended 12 times until it was eventually worth $32.3 million.\uffff\nLikewise, contracts with other services to run parts of the program in each state and territory were amended six \ntimes.\uffff\nAccording to the Auditor General, in the decade between 2010 and 2022, only 17 per cent of government contracts \nwere amended at least once, and only three per cent of those more than five times.\uffff\nMr Watson said government contracts should be regularly reviewed to see if other providers could offer better value \nfor money.\n\"The most effective test for efficiency \u2026 is to see whether somebody else will provide the same services more \ncheaply,\" he said.\nThe Department of Education said continuation of existing contracts, rather than reopening tenders, \"ensured \nongoing inclusion support for children attending [early childhood education centres].\"\nIn a statement, Minister for Early Childhood Education Anne Aly said she received briefings from the department \nthat assured her the department was acting in accordance with Commonwealth Procurement rules including \nconsidering whether the amendments ensured value for money.\nKU's CEO Chris Legg said the organisation had never approached the department for a variation of its contract as \nfund manager.\nShe said the department had offered KU variations to the initial contracts, which it accepted.\n[Contact SRT]\nLoad-Date: November 25, 2024\nEnd of Document",

He was prominent in campus politics during his time at the \nUniversity of Sydney, which culminated in his presidency of NSW Young Labor and later as a rising political staffer.\nSimon Birmingham, leader of the opposition in the Senate, was president of the Adelaide University Liberal Club in \n1993, and was a key member of Young Liberals in South Australia for most of the 1990s. He later became an \nelectorate officer for Senator Robert Hill.\nIt goes to show that the path from student politics to staffer to MP is well-trodden.\nThere are countless politicians who cut their teeth in student politics. Opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was chair of \nthe Bayside Young Liberals in 1990. As a student, Tony Burke, minister for industrial relations, was the president of \nAustralian Young Labor.

Bill Shorten, Michelle Rowland, Julian Leeser, Anika Wells, Zoe McKenzie, Angus \nTaylor, Adam Bandt and Andrew Gee are just a few of the current crop of politicians with double degrees.\nThere is a range of majors under the broader umbrella of arts.\nSenator Katy Gallagher studied in political science and sociology. Labor frontbencher Anne Aly majored in English \nliterature, with a minor in acting. Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather and transport minister Catherine King studied \nhistory and social work respectively.\nOnly 20 politicians (or 9 per cent of parliament) are qualified in science or engineering. Seven studied medicine, \nincluding independents Monique Ryan and Sophie Scamps. One - Emma McBride - did pharmacy. Greens MP \nElizabeth Watson-Brown is an architect.\nSavage says arts degrees, in particular law, politics, and other humanities, \"lend themselves very well to producing \nthe kinds of knowledge and skill sets which would prove useful for a politician\".\n\"These degrees would also expose students to theories into social dynamics that are of direct relevance to the \npolitical and policy process,\" he says.\nStrangio says that the lack of politicians with expertise and backgrounds in STEM \"may be a disadvantage for some \nworkings of parliament in terms of committee work, where politicians really need to get into the nitty-gritty of policy\".\n\"However, fundamentally, it's a highly educated cohort. They probably have the skill sets in terms of research \ncapacities and written communication skills,\" he says.\nGavin Moodie, adjunct professor at the University of Toronto's Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, says public \npolicy would be better served if it was \"more informed by technology, science and engineering, because our current \nand future challenges will be scientific and technological: climate change, health, and technological change.\"\nAnd only five politicians have studied education. This includes Sue Lines, president of the Senate, as well as Labor \nMP Ged Kearney.\nWho are our most educated politicians?\nProportionally, the Greens are the most formally educated party overall, with three out of 15 party members - 20 per \ncent - holding PhDs.\nAdam Bandt completed his PhD in political science at Monash while working part-time at law firm Slater & Gordon. \nHis thesis was \"Work to Rule: Rethinking Pashukanis, Marx and Law.\"\nThere are seven Labor politicians with PhDs - or 6.8 per cent of the party.

The federal government has announced a 15% wage increase to be \nrolled out over 12 months from this December. Advocates say the bump in pay is also a major step forward for \ngender equity, as Kathleen Ferguson reports.\nAnthony Albanese: What do you think about my drawing, Ned? Do you think it's good?\nKathleen Ferguson: The Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, has a crack at some of the crafts which help nurture \nthe country's young.\nAnthony Albanese: Hey, what do you reckon?\nOpinion: That looks weird. Can I have a look? Can I have a look, Tom?\nKathleen Ferguson: He visited the Sydney Early Childcare Centre after announcing a 15% pay increase for the \nsector's workers.\nAnthony Albanese: They deserve more than our thanks. They deserve decent wages and conditions.\nKathleen Ferguson: Under the deal, workers will get 10% by this Christmas and a further 5% by December next \nyear. It equates to around an extra $100 a week and will cost $3.6 billion. Karen Moran is a long-time educator.\nKaren Moran: This decision today will change people's lives. It means that early childhood educators who've been \nrelying on Food Bank to feed their own families won't have to do that anymore. And those that work two and three \njobs just to make ends meet will be able to spend more time with their families.\nPage 2 of 2\nBig pay increase for early childcare workers\nKathleen Ferguson: But the deal is conditional. In order to receive the pay bump, childcare centres will have to \nlimit their fee increases to 4.4% during the next 12 months. The Minister for Early Childcare, Education and Youth, \nDr Anne Aly, says the sector's role in society is critical.\nDr Anne Aly: We know that brain development is... 90% of brain development occurs in those first five years. This \nis not babysitting, this is not wiping bums and noses. This is education. We see you, we hear you, we acknowledge \nyou. We know the vital and professional work that you do.\nKathleen Ferguson: The early childcare sector says it's been a long and hard-fought battle. Georgie Dent is the \nCEO of advocacy group The Parenthood.\nGeorgie Dent: This is a long overdue recognition of the incredible contribution that early childhood educators make \nto our children, to our communities, to families. It is such a fantastic achievement.\nKathleen Ferguson: Georgie Dent says this pay increase is desperately needed to combat a worker shortage in \nthe sector, which is mostly made up of women.\nGeorgie Dent: The sector is overjoyed. This has been a long-realised dream. We have known that early childhood \neducators have been chronically underpaid and undervalued. We have seen in recent years the accelerating exit of \nearly educators from the sector, which has put incredible pressure on services.\nKathleen Ferguson: This is an interim measure which will be in place for two years while the federal government \nreviews the sector. The federal education minister, Jason Clare, says it will be up to childcare centres and providers \nto sign on to the scheme. And he says if centres don't sign up, they should be prepared to lose staff to competitors.\nJason Clare: This is a cost-of-living win-win. It's good for workers and it's good for parents. And at its heart, this is \ngood for education, for the next generation, setting our kids up for success.\nKathleen Ferguson: Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor supports higher wages but says bringing down inflation is \nthe best way to increase pay.\nAngus Taylor: Well, we want to see higher real wages, which means lower prices for everything, for all Australians, \nPK. And we'll look at the detail of this proposal that Labor's putting forward. If it can raise real wages for Australians, \nof course we're going to support it. That's our position.\nKathleen Ferguson: The United Workers Union says the increase sends a strong message to women. Jo \nSchofield is the union's national president.\nJo Schofield: Just this week, we did a survey that showed 60% of educators wanted to leave within three years. \n97% of centres have seen educators walk out in the last year, and the single factor in that is the low pay.\nKathleen Ferguson: She says while the union will continue advocating for better pay and conditions, this is a good \nstart.\nStephanie Smail: Kathleen Ferguson reporting.\nLoad-Date: August 8, 2024\nEnd of Document",

What could be more important \nthan that?\" the minister for early childhood education said.\nThe government is holding an early years summit on Friday, bringing together experts in the field to discuss current \nissues and what the government should do to overhaul its approach to children broadly, and early childhood \neducation more specifically.\nUNICEF Australia's chief advocate for children, Nicole Breeze, said removing or radically adjusting the activity test, \nwhich requires a family seeking a subsidised early childhood care place to show they have a certain amount of work \nor study, would be an easy way to quickly boost the number of children getting care.\n\"We need bold and ambitious reforms if we are to shift the dial and ensure all Australian children have a fair start in \nlife,\" she said.\nThe government's childcare subsidy, which will kick in from July 1 and cost $5.4 billion over four years, will boost \nthe base rate of the government share of the cost from 85 per cent to 90 per cent and reduce the extent to which \nsubsidy is withdrawn as family incomes rise.\nAt last year's job's summit, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews pointed to childcare reform as \"perhaps the biggest \nlever that we can pull, the biggest contribution that we can make to economic prosperity\".\nPage 2 of 3\n'What could be more important?': Government flags major childcare reforms to give kids best start\nThe Productivity Commission will soon start examining reform options in its wide-ranging investigation into the \nsector, which will also look at barriers to access, learning outcomes and how it contributes to economic growth and \nproductivity.\nLink to Image\nRhett Wyman \nLaunching the review, Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Education Minister Jason Clare said reforms to the sector \nwould follow the tradition of Labor's introduction of universal Medicare and universal superannuation.\n\"The government is committed to identifying solutions that will chart the course for universal, affordable early \nchildhood education and care,\" they said at the time.\nAly said there was \"no way\" the early childhood education sector could continue under current policy settings.\n\"If it was just left, it would mean increased fees for parents, it would mean more workers leaving the sector and \nfewer workers coming into the sector, and it would mean collapse of the sector,\" she said.\n\"So we have to look at some form of reform. What that looks like, that's what I'm relying on the Productivity \nCommission to come up with.\"\nResearch by UNICEF found Australia ranked 32nd out of 38 OECD countries on child wellbeing. The latest figures \nfrom the Australian early childhood development census - show one in five children (22 per cent) were \ndevelopmentally vulnerable.\nBreeze said a lack of equal access to early childhood education and care was a critical factor in those results, \nlargely affected by the cost of care.\nAbout nine million Australians (about 35 per cent of the population) live in so-called childcare deserts, according to \nresearch from Victoria University's Mitchell Institute. Those deserts are areas where there are more than three \nchildren for every early childhood education place.\nOpposition early childhood education spokeswoman Angie Bell said the government's $4.7 billion early childhood \neducation package will not help more families get places in centres.\n\"If you live in a thin market or child care desert - where there is next to no access to early learning - this extra \nsubsidy will not help,\" she said.\n\"We call on the government to do more to ensure all families have access to early childhood education, not just \nthose living in our major cities.\"\nProfessor Leslie Loble, co-chair of the Centre for Policy Development's early childhood development initiative, said \nthe terms of reference for the Productivity Commission review signalled the government was willing to look at \noverhauling the way the sector is run and funded.\n\"As important as increasing that subsidy rate was, this to me sets the frame for a very fundamental recognition that \nthe market isn't working as effectively as we'd like.\"\nCut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis from Jacqueline Maley. \nSubscribers can sign up to our weekly Inside Politics newsletter here.\nGraphic\n Page 3 of 3\n'What could be more important?': Government flags major childcare reforms to give kids best start\nMinister for Early Childhood Education Anne Aly said reform will be guided by the Productivity Commission's \nfindings.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese during a visit to Manuka Childcare Centre in Canberra.\nLoad-Date: February 16, 2023\nEnd of Document",

I can understand how they feel because there \nis trust between colleagues as well. What I would say is our expectation is that the senator abide by decisions of the \ncaucus.

Some argued it was time to \"rip the Band-Aid \noff\" and expel Payman before this happened, but others said the MP needed to be kept in the fold and should not \nface further sanction.\nHer decision to cross the floor is the first time a Labor MP has done so since 2005.\nTuesday's vote came in the ninth month of Israel's military campaign in Gaza.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 671 words\nHighlight: An anti-Israel petition for politicians secured only 215 signatures, mostly minor figures, demonstrating \nsupport for the Jewish state in political circles.\nBody\nEven Anne Aly didn't sign.\nA petition for politicians organised by the Palestinian lobby obtained a mere 215 signatures: not one of the \nsignatories, apart from Greens leader Adam Bandt, exercise significant power. Almost half are or were councillors.\nNot one of the teal independents and only three federal Labor MPs were prepared to put their name to the 14-point \ndocument, which went public on Tuesday and supports the Palestinian narrative of Israeli colonialism. Or, in the \nwords of the conflict, Jewish apartheid.\nLink to Image\nAlex Ellinghausen\n\"It is beyond dispute that Israel is committed to policies designed to entrench the domination of one people over \nanother,\" the petition says. \"Attempts to deny this, or smear those who allege it, are an attempt to defy truth and \nreality.\"\nAbove probably anyone else in the federal government, Aly, the Minister for Early Childhood Education and Youth, \nhas the moral authority to pull Labor away from Israel's orbit. Aly is the first Muslim woman, first Arab, and first \nEgyptian-born person elected to the House of Representatives.\nYet, the co-organiser of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network couldn't secure her endorsement, let alone a \nsignature. Reached on Tuesday morning, Aly said: \"As a member of the executive I am unable to sign petitions. \nThis does not mean that I am not passionate about the plight of the Palestinian people and committed to peace in \nthe region that I am culturally and linguistically connected to.\"\nAly is probably referring to cabinet solidarity principles, whereby ministers are expected to toe the party line, or \nresign if they feel compelled to break from the government's position on contentious issues.\nSanctions demands\nPage 2 of 2\nThe political establishment isn't backing the Palestinians\nThe lack of Labor signatories looks like a sign of institutional support for Israel in the upper political echelons, even \nas western Sydney ministers such as Tony Burke, Ed Husic and Chris Bowen signal to Muslim constituents anger \nover death and devastation in Gaza.\nAustralian Palestinians do not help themselves with extreme demands. They haven't excused the murderous \nHamas rampage of October 7 - an event the petition acknowledged - but their expectations aren't within the bounds \nof diplomatic reality for a Western democracy either. They include the imposition of sanctions on Israeli political, \nmilitary and media figures to punish the \"genocidal regime\".\nAs for the Jewish lobby - a term its members resist for historical reasons - it seemed pleased with the petition's thin \nresponse. Does anyone remember Brian Howe or Ian Macphee? Who cares about the positions of four assistant \nministers in the NSW Labor government when the Premier, Chris Minns, promises to prosecute young men who \nchant \"gas the Jews\"?\n\"I thought the outcome might be worse,\" said one Jewish leader, who didn't want to go on the record because he \nthought it would give the petition more publicity.\nIn PR terms, it was effective, though. The Sydney Morning Herald, given a copy, published it on Tuesday's front \npage despite the limited sign-up. Another pro-Palestinian petition, for journalists, obtained 334 signatures, including \nsome from The Australian Financial Review, and sparked an industry debate about how to cover people and \ngovernments we dislike.\nWhich side?\nAustralians are split. Forty per cent want the Israeli army to withdraw from Gaza immediately; 33 per cent don't, \naccording to a Roy Morgan poll last month.\nAt the same time, about half say Australia shouldn't take sides, which might help explain why the Labor \ngovernment is simultaneously supporting Israel while criticising it.\nLast week, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese issued a statement with his Canadian and New Zealand counterparts \non the war. They didn't call for an unconditional ceasefire, which would allow Hamas to strengthen its defences. \nThe Israeli lobby was pleased.\nA few hours later, Australia voted for an \"immediate humanitarian ceasefire\" in the United Nations General \nAssembly, which delighted the Palestinians.\nWork that out. Many can't. Which may be the objective.\nGraphic\n \nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese and Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth Anne Aly in \nparliament on November 29. \nLoad-Date: December 22, 2023\nEnd of Document",

Asked whether the government was willing to be party to those wage deals, Aly said it was a \nmatter for the industrial umpire.\nThe government is also being pressed to urgently fund an interim, 10 per cent pay rise to stop workers leaving the \nsector - which is suffering more than 7000 vacancies a month - ahead of its cheaper childcare reforms that will add \nto staffing pressures by increasing demand.\nAly said retention issues couldn't be fixed with Band-Aid or short-term solutions but there were \"low-hanging fruit\" \nstop-gaps, such as skilled migration, that could address the shortfall immediately.\n\"We're working with the sector to look at what we can do in the short-, medium- and long-term,\" she said. \"It's \nsomething this government has put as a priority.\"\nIn welcoming the Fair Work decision to award aged-care workers an interim 15 per cent pay rise on Saturday, \nAlbanese said wages had been held back in feminised industries because of the lack of bargaining power.\n\"It's an important decision, it's just a couple more stages to go, but it's a sign that the Fair Work Commission \nunderstands how important it is,\" he said.\nThe government has promised to fund the wage rise for aged-care workers. Asked how much it would cost during a \npress conference, the Prime Minister replied there were further stages to the Fair Work process.\n\"I can say that we allowed for a contingency in the budget that was handed down on Tuesday night two weeks ago \nbecause we anticipated a wage increase coming through,\" he said, adding the government didn't declare the \namount.\nGraphic\n \nMinister for Early Childhood Education Dr Anne Aly empowering childcare workers to strike is crucial.\nLoad-Date: November 6, 2022\nEnd of Document",

professional development \nis key to retaining highly skilled educators and teachers in the sector, but also key to improving capacity and \ncapability of early childhood education services.\"\nEarlier CHILDCARE educators say the Federal Budget has made no real effort to address workforce shortages, \ncalling a lack of wage growth a \"slap in the face\".\nFederal Treasurer Jim Chalmers announced a raft of measures designed to make childcare more affordable for \nparents and provide better support for educators' professional development on Tuesday night, but did not address \nthe 25 per cent pay increase unions have strongly campaigned for.\nKaruah Preschool director Karen Baloch said she can't take more enrolments because she doesn't have the staff \nand has had to ask employees to work extra hours to support families.\nPage 2 of 3\nMinister stands by training package for early childhood educators\n\"There are so many people leaving the sector because not only are we thoroughly under-appreciated and under-\nvalued but that's made blatantly obvious every week when we get paid,\" she said.\n\"It's an absolute slap in the face, they make no effort to address educator shortages unless they address wages.\n\"Everything they do is completely tokenistic and as a workforce we know that.\"\nThe budget committed an extra $9 billion to the sector, bringing the total spend on childcare to $55.3 billion in the \nnext four years.\nIt also included $724 million across five years to support training for educators and the care sector with more than \n80,000 early childhood educators expected to benefit.\nAlong with educators, the budget focused on making childcare more accessible and affordable for families, with \nabout 1.2 million to benefit from July.\nSt Nicholas executive director David Healy said he welcomed the increased training measures but said more \nneeded to be done to retain the workforce.\n\"To be frank it's a national-level issue and this is chicken feed being thrown at it, it looks attractive but realistically \nit's going to take years for those shortages to resolve themselves,\" he said.\nMr Healy said their centres operate up to 50 weeks a year and the concern is that the sector is losing skilled, \nqualified workers to teaching which offers longer breaks, shorter hours and better pay.\nHe said he can't run his centres at full capacity because of staffing shortages, and said that although it was great to \nsee subsidies for parents to assist them with childcare the issue is having enough staff to offer them a place.\n\"It's hard to say what's not attracting people to the sector, certainly having further support to drive and encourage \nopportunities for people in the educator workforce who want to upskill will ultimately increase the number of degree-\nqualified early childhood teachers and that is welcome,\" he said.\n\"On a national level the funding appears attractive on the face of it, but if you break it down to the shortages being \nexperienced I'm not confident it does go far enough.\"\nUnited Workers Union early education director Helen Gibbons said educators are passionate about providing \nquality learning to children and professional development that supports their practice is a \"must\".\n\"Better access to training and development will improve centres' ability to attract and retain educators, but it's not \nenough alone,\" she said.\n\"To properly response to the massive workforce crisis in early learning, the federal government must follow through \nand play its role in improving wages.\n\"The only way to keep educators from leaving the sector at current crisis levels is by paying them a wage that \nrespects their vital contribution to our society.\"\nThe union is calling on the federal government to fund a 25 per cent pay rise for every educator in the sector.\nThe Newcastle Herald has contacted federal Minister for Early Childhood Education Anne Aly for comment.\nIN THE NEWS:\nJohn Cleese headed to Newcastle Unemployed and grappling with bills, Jannine wishes she went to doctor earlier \nBudget 'sigh of relief': Hunter leaders share their views Appeal in search for missing teen Knights star ready to \nresume goal-kicking duties To see more stories and read today's paper download the Newcastle Herald news app \nhere.Page 3 of 3\nMinister stands by training package for early childhood educators\nLoad-Date: May 11, 2023\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 706 words\nHighlight: Anne Aly has seized on a column Liberal candidate Roshena Campbell wrote for The Age that \nquestioned \"throw[ing] taxpayer money at childcare\".\nBody\nChildcare will be a key battleground in the fight for the  marginal seat of Aston, as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese \nformally launches the campaign for Labor candidate Mary Doyle this weekend.\nLabor has seized on a column Liberal candidate Roshena Campbell wrote for The Age that questioned \"throw[ing] \ntaxpayer money at childcare\".\nThere are nearly 6000 families in the seat, held with a 2.8 per cent margin after a swing against retiring member \nAlan Tudge, who use childcare and could apply for subsidies that will be introduced by the Albanese government \nfrom July 1.\nWhile the Coalition ultimately backed Labor's subsidies, in June last year Campbell questioned the $4.7 billion \noutlay, which will increase the subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning up to $80,000 and create a sliding \nscale in discounts for those earning less than $530,000.\n\"What is so extraordinary about this essentially bipartisan rush to throw taxpayer money at childcare is it has taken \nplace without any real debate about whether it is a good idea to get mothers back into the workforce so quickly,\" \nCampbell wrote.\n\"If we are serious about giving working women choices, governments need to also be willing to support them in the \nchoice of staying at home in the early years.\"\n\"Yet instead we subsidise childcare centres to replace parents for almost all our children's waking hours. In doing \nso, we send a strong message to mothers that they cannot afford to be out of the workforce for too long.\"\nThe minister responsible for childcare, Anne Aly, who will hold a press conference with Labor candidate Mary \nDoyle on Friday, said Campbell's arguments proved she wanted to \"make the cost of living pressures in the outer-\neast worse, not better\".\n\"I hope Peter Dutton and his handpicked candidate travel to the outer-eastern suburbs to explain to local families \nwhy they don't deserve cost-of-living relief. We know quality early childhood education provides lifelong benefits - \nfrom improved education and health outcomes all the way to higher paying jobs,\" she said.\nPage 2 of 2\nLabor minister slams Aston Liberal candidate over childcare column\nBut Campbell affirmed her position and said she understood the pressures of raising a young family as a barrister \nand councillor.\n\"An article I wrote last year put forward one suggestion, that as well as subsidising child care, a portion of the \ngovernment's assistance could support women who re-enter the workforce after taking extended parental leave,\" \nshe said. \"I believe policy debate is healthy and put forward that suggestion with a view to supporting more working \nparents.\"\nDutton has travelled to Aston three times since the April 1 byelection date was called last month, including on \nThursday when he played table tennis with Chinese Australians, who make up nearly 15 per cent of the electorate. \nThe Coalition has been working on rebuilding trust with the Chinese diaspora after the community shifted support \naway from the Morrison government.\nThe opposition's campaign in Aston has focussed on blaming Labor for the high cost of living and interest rate rises \nand holding the government to account for cutting key road projects in the seat.\nThe childcare plan is regarded by Labor sources who were not cleared to speak on the record as an underrated \nfactor in the party's strong election win in May.\nTreasury modelling suggests the childcare change will free up 37,000 workers in the policy's first year.\nLabor candidate Mary Doyle, a former unionist and finance sector worker, said she experienced the large burden of \nchildcare costs when she raised the two kids.\n\"Whenever I talk to parents in our community they're telling me the same thing, and they are thrilled when I tell them \nrelief is on the way,\" she said.\nDutton has pitched the Liberal Party as the underdog in Aston, but it is expected to retain the seat because \nbyelections usually produce swings against sitting governments. Labor figures privately believe it would be a \npositive result if it avoided a swing against it and held the current margin of 2.8 per cent, which was down from 10.1 \nper cent in a swing against now-retiring member Alan Tudge.\nCut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis from Jacqueline Maley. \nSubscribers can sign up to our weekly Inside Politics newsletter here.\nLoad-Date: March 2, 2023\nEnd of Document",

The political \nrhetoric that followed those years fed into Islamophobia and division.\n\u201cI hope that we are now witnessing a new era \u2013 an era where Australia is truly inclusive and where that inclusivity \nis reflected in our political institutions.\u201d\nAly was also the first Muslim woman elected to parliament, winning her seat of Cowan in Western Australia in 2016 \nand increasing her margin by 9% this year.\nPage 2 of 2\nAustralia\u2019s first Muslim federal ministers Anne Aly and Ed Husic hope appointments mark \u2018new era\u2019 of inclusivity\nShe said she was keenly aware of the significance of her appointment, beyond the responsibility it entails, reflecting \non how her younger self would see this moment.\n\u201cGrowing up, I often struggled with finding a sense of belonging. I think young Anne would be looking on this \nmoment and I hope that it would give her some reassurance that she does belong.\n\u201cAs a Muslim woman I realise that the significance of my appointment extends beyond my own feelings and has an \nimpact for young women who can see themselves reflected in the leadership of this nation.\n\u201cI hope that it sends them a message that there is a place for them and that they do belong.\u201d\nA counter-terrorism expert before becoming a politician, Aly said it was a \u201cgreat honour\u201d to be appointed to the \nfrontbench, adding that it was \u201cheartening\u201d to be part of the most diverse cabinet in history.\n\u201cI have always said that our parliament should be a reflection of the people we serve, not just in terms of diversity of \ngender or ethnic background but also in professional and life experience.\n\u201cWhen I was first elected to parliament in 2016, it was a very different place to the parliament of 2022. Seeing the \nbreadth of diversity among my colleagues in the Albanese Labor government is a significant moment both \npersonally and in the history of our nation.\u201d\nIt comes after Islamophobia Register Australia (IRA) reported  a fourfold increase in reports of in-person incidents \nof anti-Muslim hate, and a spike in online Islamophobia, in particular after the Christchurch massacre.\nThe third Islamophobia in Australia report, released earlier this year, also showed an increase in the instances of \nMuslims being associated with being terrorists.\nHusic, who was appointed minister for industry, told the ABC he was nervous waiting for the ceremony to begin.\n\u201cI felt the moment, the weight of that moment.\u201d\nHusic, who represents Chifley in Sydney\u2019s west, is the son of Bosnian migrants and had previously served as \nparliamentary secretary to the former prime minister Kevin Rudd.\nAt the time he was also sworn in while holding a Quran and faced a fierce backlash online, but said he felt things \nhave changed in the intervening years.\n\u201cI think things have changed quite a bit and the country is a lot more understanding and accepting,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere are a lot of Muslim Australians that still cop a lot of hate speech and have to contend with a lot of things that \nmany other Australians aren\u2019t forced to.\u201d\nLoad-Date: June 7, 2023\nEnd of Document",

Husic also suggested the government had only paid lip service to a two-state solution and Aly called \nfor an investigation into potential Israeli war crimes.\nLink to Image\nAlex Ellinghausen\nTheir intervention highlights internal tensions in Labor over a domestic response to the war that has involved \nmonuments lit up in Israeli flags and political condemnation of pro-Palestinian protests. Labor has stood by Israel \nsince Hamas launched its assault on Israeli civilians on October 7 and Israel retaliated, leading to a conflict that has \nkilled more than 1300 Israelis and 3000 Palestinians.\nHusic, a senior cabinet minister and the first Muslim elected to parliament, made a passionate plea for Australia to \nstep up support for Palestinians as they faced what he described as a \"humanitarian catastrophe\" with 1000 \nchildren dead, civilian infrastructure destroyed and a blockade on food, fuel, medicine and water.\n\"I feel very strongly that Palestinians are being collectively punished here for Hamas' barbarism,\" he said in an \ninterview on ABC Radio National.\n\"I think it's really important ... that we contribute to international voices speaking up for Palestinians ... to say that \nthere has got to be a more strategic and precise way to hold Hamas to account but not affect innocent Palestinian \nfamilies.\"\nHe also sought to explain strong reactions from advocates in Australia, who have rallied on behalf of Palestinians. \n\"Let me put it in a way that might be difficult for some to hear,\" Husic said.\nPage 2 of 3\nPalestinians in Gaza are being collectively punished, two Labor ministers say\n\"Israel has described what happened on October 7 [as] Israel's equivalent of 9/11. The number of Palestinians that \nhave been killed so far equates to the number of people who lost their lives in 9/11.

But it goes to the heart of what \nPalestinians and those who care for them in Australia [think], which is that Palestinian lives are considered lesser \nthan.\"\nAly, a counter-terrorism expert who was born in Egypt, backed Husic's comments.\n\"I feel the pain of Australian Palestinians, Muslim and Christian. I feel the pain of Australian Muslims, and I know \nthat Palestinians have for a long time felt that they have not been seen and have not been heard, that they have \nbeen forgotten by the international community, and I want to acknowledge that to them.\"\nParliament has been divided this week over its response to the unfolding war. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has \nurged the protection of civilian lives while asserting Israel's right to self-defence, while Opposition Leader Peter \nDutton said Israel should show no restraint in retaliating to Hamas' attacks.\nThe Greens this week voted in parliament to condemn Israel of war crimes in motions that were voted down in both \nhouses.\nYoutube link\nLabor senator Fatima Payman, who was born in Afghanistan, spoke out in the Senate on Tuesday when she said \nIsrael's right to defend itself could not equate to the annihilation of Palestinian civilians.\n\"Yet today, the world watches, the state of Israel deprives an entire population - men, women and children - of the \nbasic necessities of life: food, water, electricity, gas and medicines. We must condemn it,\" she said.\nAly on Thursday said it was \"hard to argue that this is not a form of collective punishment\".\n\"The idea of war crimes is something that needs to be investigated,\" she said. \"I would be loath to claim war crimes \nwithout a full investigation, that is how international law operates. But I would say and I would urge Israel to abide \nby international laws on the rules of engagement.\"\nHusic said there had been strong and dehumanising language used about Palestinians - referring to them as \nanimals or collateral damage - which affected wider communities and could shape government decisions.\nRegarding Israel's actions, he said: \"Governments are different to terrorist organisations. [With] governments, there \nis a higher expectation that there will be a protection of innocent lives.\"\nHe also said he strongly felt there had been no practical commitment to a two-state solution, which is Labor policy.\n\"Speaking completely frankly, I think there was an important point in time when we sort of started saying: 'It's \nimportant that there is a two-state solution that we fight for that',\" he said.\n\"What I'm genuinely concerned about now, is that this is spoken more as a way in which we can just comfort \nourselves at these points. And then when the situation and the tension subside, nothing practically happens.\"\nHome Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil said she was proud to sit with Husic in cabinet, when asked about his \ncomments.
