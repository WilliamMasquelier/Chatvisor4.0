Highlight: Parents face a 'triple whammy' with a sick child in daycare, missing work, paying fees, and then facing 
the risk of getting sick themselves.
Body
When Fiona Maine drops one-year-old Freddy at his daycare centre, it annoys her if she notices another child 
looking sickly.
"I have heard of many parents, if their kids are sick, they'll give them Panadol or Nurofen and send them off, 
knowing they'll have to go pick them up once it wears off. Just so they can have half a day of daycare, they can 
work and get paid for it," she says.
Freddy has been attending daycare in Sydney five days a week since he was four months old. The 31-year-old 
pregnant mother of four cannot work in her tech support role while he is home.
"I can't take phone calls while looking after a baby. Honestly, he gets sick once every couple of weeks. [I feel] a bit 
rotted because we still have to pay for it."
It's a common complaint heard around the nation from parents with children in daycare who get sent home sick. Jay 
Weatherill, the former premier of South Australia, now leads early education campaign Thrive by Five and says 
parents with young children are stuck in an impossible position.
"Parents are doing it really tough right now through the spiralling cost-of-living, but it's a triple whammy for parents 
when their children are sick," he says.
"Not only are they caring for a sick child, which is stressful enough on its own, they are also grappling with the out-
of-pocket costs for a day of childcare and the lost earnings or leave due to being unable to attend work."
Melanie Allen is a Pilates instructor and works for herself while her children Henry, 3, and Edie, 10 months, attend 
daycare in Adelaide.
"Money-wise, it's hard. And the daycare fee being so high makes it harder," Allen says.
"I never factored in how much it would cost in daycare to have them both in. And then I was like, why? Why, when 
school is free? Why isn't daycare subsidised to the point that it's free as well?

'Gastro seven times': How childcare hits parents with a triple whammy
"What burns is paying for them not to be there, staying home, and not getting paid. So, say I make $250 in a day; I 
don't make that money, and then I also have to pay another $170.
"And then, knowing that might go through my second kid, and then also through me and then to my husband, 
because if one of us is sick, the other one's going to have to take off work so they can look after the kids. So it's just 
a cycle, a vicious cycle."
Weatherill says the early childhood education and care workforce is in crisis because of low pay, poor conditions 
and staff shortages as well as providers with ongoing overheads that they can't turn off when a child enrolled at 
their service is ill.
"What all this adds up to is a system in need of complete reform. Providers need certainty, early childhood 
educators need proper pay and conditions, parents need financial support and children need access to the 
enormous benefits that arise from participation in high quality early learning."
Georgie Dent, chief executive of The Parenthood, a campaign partner of Thrive by Five, says Australia needs to 
move to a system that is more affordable for families and closer to the school experience.
"This would mean it's not a system where families are spending hundreds of dollars out of pocket on a day. And so 
it then would become less of an issue if your child was sick or not sick," she says.
Shayne Kuyper and his partner enrolled their two-year-old daughter, Poppy, in daycare when she was 13 months 
old. She had never been sick before daycare.
"She hasn't had a single week without coming home with something since," Kuyper says. "She's had gastro seven 
times this year."
They navigate Poppy's sick days at their home in Melbourne by splitting the day in half.
"[My partner] will take her for the morning, and I'll take her for the afternoon. Which means that we've each missed 
half a day of work.
"It's painful that you still have to pay for these sick days. And you're allocated [52] days a year - beyond that, you 
lose your government subsidy. So, if we have more absent days, we pay the full rate. It's unavoidable; they'll get 
sick at daycare, but we're punished for it."
Nesha Hutchinson, vice-president of the Australian Childcare Alliance, says rostering staff for a position in a 
childcare centre means it's impossible to avoid charging fees if a child is away sick.
"If there are 10 children in the preschool room, or five in the toddler's room, we have to pay for that staff member 
whether or not the child turns up," Hutchinson says.
"If two children are sick on a day, does the staff member get paid 80 per cent of their wages because the children 
are off? That's important to consider, given that wages are the highest cost for a childcare centre. And we can't 
overbook like they do on planes, hotels or restaurants as it's illegal."
Hutchinson says "educators get very sick, particularly in their first year in early education", contributing to a high 
staff turnover within the first year of employment.
Emily Holmes, 25, is a childcare educator working in South East Melbourne. She says most of her fellow educators 
have used their sick leave entitlements.
"We get sick quite a lot in general, but it is the same in every centre I've ever worked at," she says.
Federal Early Childhood Education Minister Anne Aly said the childcare subsidy will continue to be paid for 52 
absences a year, after it was increased from 42 a year due to the pandemic.Page 3 of 4

"Supporting and growing the early childhood education and care workforce is critical to delivering our landmark 
cheaper childcare reforms - which is why we have a plan to deliver a stronger and sustainable early childhood 
education workforce," she said in a statement.

"We're increasing the number of university spots, bringing forward fee-free TAFE places, changing the Fair Work 
Act to allow multi-employer bargaining and taking action to close the gender pay gap - all of which will benefit the 
early childhood education sector."
The government has committed to a Productivity Commission review into the early childhood education and care 
sector, looking into how to improve affordability and access for families, including considering a universal 90 per 
cent Child Care Subsidy rate.
Elke Bremner has two sons in daycare in Sydney's West Killara. Her husband, Seth, is often overseas for work, 
leaving her in a tough spot when they're ill and he's away.
"Your work doesn't stop just because your kids are sick," she says. "So, I was having to still make up the time. 
When my child was sleeping; or at night, I was working after the kids were in bed each night just trying to catch up 
on everything.
"I don't know of many families that can afford to be living in Sydney at the moment and not have both parents 
working."
To fill the daycare gap, Sharon Mitchell wakes up at 3am, goes for a run on the treadmill and gets ready to answer 
her phone at 4am. Mitchell runs Mayday Mummy, an emergency nanny service on the north shore of Sydney.
"The phone absolutely does ring and early in the morning. It's ad-hoc, emergency, last minute. We're not a 
permanent nanny solution. I would only have anyone on the Mayday Mummy team that I would feel comfortable in 
my own home, looking after my own family," she says.
The rate is $65 an hour. Mitchell acknowledges most parents may not earn enough to cover the minimum three-
hour callout fee, but they are available if something goes pear-shaped and parents need somebody to step in. She 
adds that there is more than enough work for her company and welcomes competition.
"If there are other people out there that can support families in these difficult situations, I say: Absolutely, you know. 
Please help, because there's so much need out there." 
Mitchell backs up Fiona Maine's revelation about parents doing the "Panadol drop and run".
"They know that when a phone call comes in, at midday, the Panadol is worn off," she said.
"I was speaking to a daycare centre, it was a while ago, and they actually stopped parents providing the babies' 
bottles made up because they found that some parents were actually putting Panadol and Nurofen into the baby's 
bottle, knowing that they would then have an extra dose of Panadol and Nurofen at lunchtime in their bottle."
Dr Lachlan Macarthur, a GP at Mona Vale Medical Centre, says one of the benefits of having children spend time 
around lots of different children is that they become exposed to a wide variety of common viruses. The immune 
system is then able to create a response, allowing immunity to increase for a period of time.
"Like a great many other families with whom I have worked, my daughter had a number of illnesses this year, 
including COVID-19 in February and Influenza A in June," he says.
Macarthur says the frustration or concern with shifting around work roles pales in the face of a seriously unwell 
child.Page 4 of 4
'Gastro seven times': How childcare hits parents with a triple whammy
"I understand that it can be difficult to adapt pre-planned schedules and work commitments when one's child is 
unwell. I am lucky to work in a profession that allows, perhaps, a greater level of flexibility when it comes to taking 
carer's leave."
But for Maine, who has been taking her children to daycare for the past five years, the battle will continue.
"So I just kind of put up with it and pay the fee instead of fighting it," she says.
"Even a discount would be appreciated."

After this article was published, a preschool sports program depicted in a photograph contacted this masthead to 
say it offers makeup classes for classes missed due to illness.

The following information was released by the office of the Prime Minister of Australia:
Prime Minister, Minister for Education, Minister for Early Childhood Education, Member for Canberra
Cheaper Child Care; Productivity Commission Inquiry; Housing affordability; May Budget; Australian shipment of

ALICIA PAYNE, MEMBER FOR CANBERRA: Good morning. I'm Alicia Payne, the Federal Member for Canberra 
and it's my great pleasure this morning to be here at MOCCA in Manuka with the Prime Minister, Anthony 
Albanese, the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, and the Minister for Early Childhood, Anne Aly. And I want to 
say a huge thank you to Kara and the team here at MOCCA for welcoming us again to their beautiful centre, and to 
the children who we had such a lovely play with Lego this morning. I'm so proud that our government is a 
government that values early childhood education and care. And from 1 July this year, over one million families will 
benefit from our Cheaper Child Care policy. This is good for families, and you'll have more young children gain 
access to the great benefits of early childhood education and care. And that more parents can better balance work 
and parenting - particularly women. Because for too long the high costs of child care have put a brake on their 
economic participation. I know this is a huge issue for families in Canberra where we have some of the highest child 
care costs in the country. So I'm really pleased to hand over to the Prime Minister now to talk further.
ANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Alicia. And it's great to be back here at one of the 
centres where we came in opposition, to talk about what a difference a change of government would make in taking 
child care seriously and in promoting early learning. Early learning is good for young ones, it's also good for 
families, it's also good for our economy. Because if we support women to be able to participate fully in the 
workforce there will be productivity benefits. It benefits them and their family budgets, but it also benefits 
businesses who employ women, because they're able to have greater continuity in their career. They retire with 
higher savings than they would otherwise, and it changes the dynamic in our workplaces. This was the first major 
Page 2 of 5
PRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023
commitment that I gave in my first budget reply, in the days when opposition leaders had policies and that made 
announcements in budget replies. We campaigned for three years with this as the largest on-budget investment 
that we are making during this term, and it's the largest on-budget investment because there is nothing that is more 
important than giving the best chance in life for our youngest Australians, some of whom we've met here today. 
Learning that social interaction that's so important, as well as learning skills that will give them a good run up to 
when they start school. But also it's so important for our national economy. It's one of the themes as well of the 
Jobs and Skills Summit, and I'm very pleased that we put in place the mechanisms last year, in our first term we 
carried the legislation for cheaper child care that will benefit 1.2 million Australian families from July 1, but we're not 
resting there. We also committed to do a Productivity Commission Inquiry into the universal provision of early 
learning. Just as Labor is the party of universal Medicare, of universal superannuation, we also want to be the party 
that delivers universal, affordable child care - very important going forward. And that's why today we're announcing 
the Productivity Commission Inquiry with Professor Deborah Brennan as the person to undertake that enquiry. 
There's no one more qualified than Professor Brennan to undertake this work. It will be a comprehensive inquiry 
that will report back to the government on the next steps that we will make. I lead an orderly government. A 
government that indicates what we are going to do and then gets on and does it. Making a difference as we have in 
our first eight months, this will make a difference and it's my great pleasure to ask the Professor to make some 
comments.
PROFESSOR DEBORAH BRENNAN: Thanks, Prime Minister. I'm Deb Brennan, I'm from the University of New 
South Wales and I've been around the early childhood education and care policy world for a very long time. So I'm 
absolutely thrilled to have this opportunity to participate in a co-leadership role in the Productivity Commission 
Inquiry. We've got the foundations of a fantastic early childhood learning and care system in Australia. But 
everybody knows there's work to do. We've got challenges around affordability, access, workforce, many areas, so 
we're going to have a really good look at the sector and come up with some suggestions for advancing the system 
so that every child in Australia gets access to high quality learning and care.
JASON CLARE, MINISTER FOR EDUCATION: This is really important. The first five years of your life are 
everything. Everything you see, everything you hear, every book you read, and every person you meet shapes the 
person that you become. What happens in places like this shape the person you become. Early education is good 
for kids, it's good for parents, and it's good for the economy. We promised to do three things in the election; first, to 
cut the cost of child care, and that starts on the first of July. The legislation we passed last year will cut the cost of 
child care for more than a million Australian families. We also promised an ACCC inquiry into the driving costs 
behind child care. That work is now underway and they will provide their interim report in June and their final report 
in December. And thirdly, we promised a big and broad, far-reaching inquiry into our early education system to set 
us up for the next decade and beyond done by the Productivity Commission. And I've got to say, I am so glad that 
Deborah, you have agreed to do this work for us. Last night I picked up the phone and spoke to leaders in the 
sector to tell them that Professor Deborah Brennan would be doing this work. And I've got to tell you, the response 
was overwhelming. If you talk to the same people I spoke to last night, you will hear the same thing. Because 
honestly, there is no one more experienced and no one more respected by the early education sector to do this 
work. Deborah, I know this has been your life's work and I thank you so much for helping us to write the next 
chapter.
ANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: This Productivity Commission Review that's 
going to be led by Professor Brennan, who brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to this review is just one 
part of the Albanese Government's reforms in early childhood education and care. We've started that with making 
early childhood education and care more affordable for 1.2 million families right across Australia. As Jason 
mentioned, and as the Prime Minister mentioned, those first five years are critical, and we have the capacity 
through early childhood education and care to change the trajectory of a child's life. No child born into any form of 
disadvantage, no matter who they are, no matter where they live, no matter what background they come from. 
Every single child has the capacity to grow and develop if we focus, if we get it right in those first five years. And 
this Productivity Commission Review led by Professor Brennan is going to be a huge part of our reforms in early 
childhood education and care, carrying on the Labor government's legacy in this area. It was a Labor government 
that first introduced the National Quality Framework when we were last in government, and we will continue that Page 3 of 5
PRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023
legacy because we know just how important those first five years are in a child's life. But also how important good 
quality, affordable early childhood education and care are for the economy, for parents, for allowing women who are 
predominantly primary caregivers to get out there, to work, to choose to continue their education and develop 
themselves if they so wish. So like Jason, and like the Prime Minister, and Alicia Payne, I'm really, really excited to 
welcome Professor Brennan to the Productivity Commission Review. Thank you.
PRIME MINISTER: As you can see, we're very excited about Professor Brennan's appointment here this morning. 
Happy to take questions.
JOURNALIST: On housing affordability, there's new legislation being introduced today. Obviously, that's a long term 
plan, but will there be any relief for renters in the May Budget?
PRIME MINISTER: We'll have the May Budget in May, but we're already taking significant action when it comes to 
housing, including the introduction of the legislation that we'll have today for the Housing Australia Future Fund. 
That's important legislation, to boost the supply of housing but particularly social and community housing. In 
addition to that, we've said that of those 30,000 additional social housing units that will be created, 4,000 of them 
will be set aside for women and children escaping domestic violence. In addition to that, we have our Emergency 
Housing Fund, a $100 million increase. In addition to that, we have our National Housing Accord with the Master 
Builders Association, with state and territory governments, with the private sector, working together with the private 
sector to boost housing supply. In addition to that, we're creating our Housing Supply and Affordability Council 
again. Working with state and territory governments, as well as local government about freeing up land, about 
creating more support there in the housing sector. In addition to that, there was over half a billion dollars just sitting 
there not being used for housing that we have tapped into to provide that support. So we have a comprehensive 
plan when it comes to housing, you'll see more roll out, in an orderly way, just like we're rolling out today's 
announcement in an orderly way.
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, the first Australian shipment of coal has arrived in China, do you know how many 
more are expected to arrive in the near future, and are you confident that the shipments can increase with Don 
Farrell visiting in the near future as well?
PRIME MINISTER: What I'm confident of is that the dynamic between Australia and China has changed, from one 
where there wasn't dialogue between ministers, to one where there is. And that dialogue is always a good idea. I've 
said with regards to the relationship with China, that we will cooperate where we can, we will disagree where we 
must, and we'll engage in our national interest. And when I met with President Xi, I indicated to him publicly, but 
also of course, privately, that it quite clearly was in Australia's interests to export more to China. China currently 
receives more exports by value than the next three major trading partners combined. So that relationship is 
important for Australian jobs, for our national economy, but there's another thing it's good for too. It's good for China 
to receive those goods, because we have not just resources, but we have wine, meat, barley, seafood - the best in 
the world. And it is in China's interest for any impediments to be removed. I'm very pleased that Don Farrell had a 
constructive meeting this week with his counterpart in China. I'm pleased that Penny Wong visited Beijing on 
December 21st to mark the 50th anniversary of relations between Australia and the People's Republic of China. 
And I look forward to both of our countries going forward in a constructive, cooperative way. These reports haven't 
been confirmed yet. We are cautious about making announcements before they're confirmed. But quite clearly, I 
think if Australian business and Australian industry, what they tell me, including last night with business people I've 
met with, is that they are very pleased with the constructive direction of the relationship.
JOURNALIST: Further on China, US officials say that Chinese spy balloons are part of an effort to assess the 
military capabilities around the world. Does that concern you and does this incident in the US, do you see that as a 
setback in the engagement that was seen between Washington and Beijing and Canada?
PRIME MINISTER: We support the sovereignty of nations, including the United States, our great friends in the 
United States. We consider all of the matters relating to national security and respond in an appropriate way and 
will continue to do so.Page 4 of 5
PRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023
JOURNALIST: Disability workers and age care workers got big pay rises recently. The Childcare Workers Union 
has called for a 25% pay rise. We know pay is a huge factor in this industry. Would you back a pay rise like that for 
child care workers?
PRIME MINISTER: The government doesn't determine the level of wages for everybody in the sector.
JOURNALIST: But do you support their push?
PRIME MINISTER: What I support is people being paid fairly, and I won't comment on specifics because that's the 
job of the Fair Work Commission to consider these matters independently of government and come to decisions. 
What I would say though, and what I've said publicly a number of times, including yesterday at the UN International 
Women's Day event that was held yesterday morning, is that if you look at the sectors where people are underpaid, 
they have something in common, two things: One, they are the very sectors that got us through the pandemic. Our 
cleaners, our aged care workers, our childcare workers. There's something else they've got in common as well. 
They are largely feminised industries, and that's why, when we made changes to industrial regulations, I announced 
at our campaign launch in Perth last year that we would very specially have measures that allowed the gender pay 
gap to be considered. We had legislation yesterday as well about transparency, so that the gender pay gap can be 
identified for larger companies as well. So I will conclude with this by saying, early learning educators do a fantastic 
job. They're valued by parents, they're valued by children who grow to love them and have a relationship with them. 
This isn't just a normal job, as much as I love all the journalists here, our relationship is different. Between the 
educators and the children who they look after. And I have every respect for the educators and the work that they 
do.
JOURNALIST: One on the Referendum Machinery Act please if I could. Yesterday, Katy Gallagher said that you 
would go ahead with the information pamphlet. In December, Don Farrell and Mark Dreyfus said "there's no longer 
any need for taxpayers to pay for a pamphlet to be sent to every household. The Referendum Act does not reflect 
modern delivery and communications methods." Do you still agree with that? Has your view changed or is this 
bringing back the pamphlet a concession to just get it through the Parliament?
PRIME MINISTER: Both things are right. The truth is, I don't know about you Josh, when was the last letter you 
sent?
JOURNALIST: I think it was around Christmas.
PRIME MINISTER: Apart from Christmas Cards, when was the last letter you sent?
JOURNALIST: You're testing my memory, it's not my press conference.
PRIME MINISTER: Has anyone here sent a letter this year?
JOURNALIST: Last week, to the US Consulate.
PRIME MINISTER: That's not a letter, that's an application. The world has changed how we communicate. But I 
could have said, we will engage constructively. One of the Senators approached, we made this decision a week 
ago, one of the Senators approached and said, this will make a big difference for our approach. I don't know how 
many times I can say this at press conferences, we will do what we need to do to broaden support for this. The 
referendum that will be held later this year is about two things, recognition and consultation. Recognising Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander People in our Constitution and consulting them on matters that affect them, that's what it's 
about. Now we want to maximise support for that. So if anyone has, as I said, I await any member of the House of 
Representatives or the Senate to examine the question and the draft changes that I put forward at Garma last year. 
Now, I'll give you the exclusive, just for you, so if everyone else can not listen, if there's a constructive suggestion, 
that's backed in by lawyers, we'll change that. If there's a suggestion, there hasn't been one, there hasn't been one. 
I want this to succeed. I'm not being dogmatic about this. This is not our proposal, this is a proposal that came from 
the bottom up. And you need to think of the counterfactual of what happens if this referendum succeeds. If this 
referendum succeeds, Indigenous Australians will be shown the respect that they deserve. Australians will all know Page 5 of 5
PRESS CONFERENCE - MOCCA CHILDCARE CENTRE, CANBERRA TRANSCRIPT 09 FEB 2023
that we've acknowledged the great privilege that we have of sharing this continent with the oldest continuous 
culture on earth. And the world will see that Australia's a mature country, a mature country that can be honest 
about our history and can celebrate that history. That's what this is about. It's not about party politics. And that's 
what every state Premier and Chief Minister understands. And I just say to my colleagues on the Hill, this isn't the 
opportunity to look for division. This is the opportunity to look for national unity, to embrace the opportunity which is 
there. So, if someone has a suggestion, by all means put it forward. I'm up for it, in terms of, whether a pamphlet 
goes out, it doesn't hurt, a pamphlet going out. People are going to put things in letterboxes anyway during the 
referendum. If people want taxpayers to pay for it, there's a judgement call there, fine. Taxpayers shouldn't be 
funding the campaigns of Yes and No. That should be up to people to fund. There should be equal funding and 
there will be under the under the proposal that we have. I also welcome Simon Birmingham's comments this 
morning. Simon Birmingham has said very clearly that there shouldn't be funding of the Yes and No case. I 
welcome the comments of Simon Birmingham. I welcome anyone who wants to join this journey on the path to 
reconciliation.
JOURNALIST: There are strong indications that Vladimir Putin signed off on the supply of weapons used to shoot 
down MH17. If you could look at him in the eye today, what would you say to Vladimir Putin?
PRIME MINISTER: I'd say that you are reprehensible. That Vladimir Putin, clearly, the shooting down of MH17 was 
an act of terrorism that had an impact here in Australia, but on many countries as well. And we will continue to 
pursue these issues with every avenue at our disposal.
JOURNALIST: So how do you feel about the suspension of the criminal investigation into the downing of MH17?
PRIME MINISTER: I think I just answered how I feel about it. The issue, of course, of the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine, this is a guy who runs an authoritarian regime that doesn't care about human rights, that doesn't care 
about devastation of communities, whether it be in Ukraine, whether it be the oppression of its own citizens, or 
whether the acts outside of Russia of which we've seen a number. The travesty of MH17 is an issue in which he 
should be held to account and Australia will continue to pursue all of these issues with every avenue at our 
disposal.
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, this morning the Deputy PM has indicated he wants to get rid of Chinese linked 
surveillance cameras from government buildings. We spoke about the relationship with China earlier, the last time 
the Australian government tried to ban or exclude a Chinese company from communications in any form in 
Australia, it was detrimental to our relationship with China. Are you concerned about how Beijing will react to the 
removal of those devices?
PRIME MINISTER: No, we act in accordance with Australia's national interest. We do so transparently and that's 
what we'll continue to do. Thanks very much.

Labor MP Anne Aly may be ruled ineligible to stand for election ­because of ongoing doubts she has effectively 
renounced her dual Australian-Egyptian citizenship, according to lawyers who question whether the steps she took 
would meet the strict standards laid down by the High Court.
Dr Aly, who holds the West Australian seat of Cowan on a margin of just 0.9 per cent, faces a potential problem 
over her citizenship under s. 44 of the Constitution, according to Melbourne Law School professor Jeremy Gans.
"I don't think we can discount the chance of a challenge to Aly and similarly difficult cases, if the election is close 
enough that a challenge could potentially make a difference," Professor Gans wrote in a social media post.
"Anne Aly has a potential - ­albeit complex and contestable - s. 44 problem," he said.
Dr Aly was born in Egypt and moved to Australia as a child. She has never held an Egyptian passport but might be 
caught by the strict interpretation of foreign citizenship - and its renunciation - applied by the High Court.
In May 2018, the High Court disqualified ACT Labor senator Katy Gallagher because she was a "citizen of a foreign 
power at the time of her nomination for election to the Senate on May 31, 2016, and was for that reason incapable 
of being chosen as a senator at the double-dissolution election". The court applied a rigid test, holding that it is not 
sufficient for a candidate to take "all reasonable steps" if the foreign state itself has not legally adopted the 
renunciation.
Following that court decision Dr Aly produced a document from the Egyptian embassy stating   she relinquished her 
citizenship on May 6, 2016. 
The statement said: "Dr Anne Aly renounced Egyptian citizenship on May 6, 2016, having completed all the steps 
required and, as of that date, had completely renounced her Egyptian citizenship."
However, Professor Gans, a criminal law specialist, said   while the document "looks good on its face", Egypt's 
Nationality Law did not provide for voluntary renunciation of citizenship. Rather, its approach is to permit - but not

require - the government to strip citizens of citizenship in some circumstances. That would require a decree by the 
Egyptian   Minister of Interior, he said.
Dr Aly had not provided a copy of any decree, and the letter she cited from the embassy made no mention of one. It 
was unlikely Dr Aly could have obtained such a decree by   May 6, 2016 - a month before the close of nominations 
for the 2016 election, when she was first elected - because she ­applied only two days before, ­Professor Gans 
says.
The issue would arise only if her eligibility were challenged after the election or she was referred to the court by the 
House of Representatives at some point.
Professor Gans argues the law is counter-productive and needs to be reformed, a move that would require a 
referendum to amend s.44 of the Constitution.
"It's outrageous. It's perverse. It exposes MPs to foreign influence. It's a real barrier to a diverse parliament," he 
said.
Professor Gans says he would be shocked if any Australian court ruled that Dr Aly was ineligible because "the 
racism of the High Court of Australia's sneering at MPs not doing their homework would be too obvious". "But I still 
don't think we can discount the chance of a challenge to Aly and similarly difficult cases, if the election is close 
enough that a challenge could potentially make a difference. And that will produce quite some chaos."
Dr Aly declined to comment on the claims or to reveal whether she had received any decree from the Egyptian 
Minister of Interior. 
Independent candidate Jo Dyer announced she had confirmation she was eligible to run for the South Australian 
seat of Boothby after concerns she had not renounced her UK citizenship in time.

Highlight: New minister Anne Aly knows what it's like to be in the dole queue with no money and two kids in tow. 
She is adamant she won't ‘squander' the platform she now has to make positive change.
Body
The Productivity Commission will be handed the terms of reference for a review of universal childcare within the first 
100 days of the Labor government.
Early childhood education and childcare is central to the Albanese government's long-term vision for economic 
growth and stability for generations to come, says Anne Aly, the newly appointed minister for early childhood 
education.
"Universal childcare is an investment in our children, our youth and our future," Dr Aly told The Australian Financial 
Review.
"It's also about delivering immediate economic benefits through increased productivity and increased workforce 
participation for caregivers, who are predominately women. And it's also about gender equality.
"I don't want to squander this platform, this opportunity, to make meaningful change."
Starting from July next year, the government will increase the maximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families 
earning up to $80,000 and a sliding scale in subsidy rates for every family earning less than $530,000. It also plans 
to extend the increased subsidy to outside-school-hours care.
Dr Aly, who has represented the West Australian seat of Cowan since 2016, was the first Muslim woman elected to 
federal parliament.
She will bring her complicated, and often traumatic, background to her role, which includes a second portfolio as 
minister for youth.
‘Pathway to a better life'
Her family migrated from Egypt when she was two, and settled in western Sydney. Her professionally qualified 
parents worked in factories and as a bus driver while she attended the Anglican girls school Meriden in Strathfield.
Page 2 of 2
‘Lived experience' will direct Aly's policy choices
She took herself back to Egypt for undergraduate studies in English and acting before returning to Australia, where 
she and her first husband lived in Perth.
The marriage was violent. She left with her two sons and no money, discovering the brutal reality of a dole queue 
and little hope. But she managed to scrape enough together to put herself through a master's degree and PhD 
before becoming a lecturer and international expert on counterterrorism.
"For me, access to childcare meant I was able to lift myself out of poverty and chart a pathway to a better life for 
myself, and particularly for my children," Dr Aly said.
"That meant I was able to secure the financial freedom that enabled me to have choices in life. If you understand 
those things from a lived experience it gives you insight into what we do - not just about policy, legislation and 
economics, but how it actually has a real impact on people's lives.
"You never really lose that part of yourself who used to cry every night because you didn't know where you were 
going to find the money to put food on the table the next day."
Representing young people, she will design a youth engagement strategy that works across the whole of 
government to address the pressing issues facing the younger demographic, including access to intergenerational 
wealth transfer, access to housing, cost of living and educational expenses.
"Australia is one of the most expensive places in the world to study, not just in terms of how much it costs for a 
university degree or TAFE, but the cost of living while you are studying," Dr Aly said.
"There was no minister for youth in the previous government. To say that Labor inherited a policy void is an 
understatement. That certainly presents challenges, but also enormous opportunities."

'This is not a secure area': Prime Minister has no plans to visit Israel despite unrest
'This is not a secure area': Prime Minister has no plans to visit Israel despite 
unrest

Anthony Albanese has confirmed he has no plans to visit Israel following pressure from the opposition to make a 
stop in the Middle East en route to the US.
Opposition foreign affairs spokesman Simon Birmingham on Friday echoed Opposition Leader Peter Dutton's calls 
for the Prime Minister to travel to Tel Aviv on his way to Washington, telling Sky News the move "would be a very 
important signal of Australia's support for Israel".
It comes after world leaders, including US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, made recent 
visits to the country.
Mr Albanese said the leaders who visited were from nations that were permanent members of the Security Council. 
He also cited security concerns.
"The United States has a particular role in that, as does the United Kingdom, as does the other people who have 
visited there," he said.
"President Biden's visit produced outcomes of negotiating through with different states, but also was accompanied 
by a considerable security effort for President Biden. This is not a secure area.
"Our priority has been to engage and I've engaged, I've met personally with the Israeli ambassador. I had him to my 
residence and had a discussion."
The Canberra Times has contacted the Israeli embassy for comment.
Mr Albanese also sought to brush off claims his party was divided on its stance on Israel after Labor frontbenchers 
Ed Husic and Anne Aly raised concerns the Israeli government was collectively punishing Palestinians in Gaza for 
Hamas' atrocities.

'This is not a secure area': Prime Minister has no plans to visit Israel despite unrest
"Ed Husic, Anne Aly and my entire team voted for a resolution in the Parliament and indeed Ed and Anne spoke 
about it. That resolution was really important, it unequivocally condemned Hamas for the atrocities that it committed 
as a terrorist organisation, with its invasion of Israel," Mr Albanese said.
"We also acknowledged in that resolution, importantly, that the lives of innocent civilians needed to be protected."
On Friday morning, deputy Liberal leader Sussan Ley told Sunrise Mr Husic "stepped right out of line".
"He's got a chance today to correct those remarks, otherwise I think he should seriously consider his position," she 
said.
But she wasn't able to draw Education Minister Jason Clare, also on Sunrise, on whether he agreed with Mr Husic's 
term of "collective punishment".
"You know, the point to make here is that Israel, like any country like Australia, has got to comply with international 
law and that means doing everything that they can to make sure that innocent people aren't killed," he said.

"If I wanted to, I could pull out the statements that you made when you were the chair of the Friends of Palestine 
that are in stark contrast with Peter Dutton, I'm not going to do that on live TV because I don't think it is in the 
national interest," he said.
The previous day, Ms Ley said Mr Husic's comments exposed "deep division" within Labor and "raised serious 
questions" about the government's official position on Israel.
On Friday, Labor Party president Wayne Swan also rejected the notion the party was divided over its stance on 
Israel in an interview with Channel Nine.
"I have had a look at the statements the minister has made and they don't depart in any way from the government's 
position," he said.

condemn Israel’s blockade on GazaFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updatesGet our morning and

Body
Sussan Ley has accused the Albanese government of “deep division” and “confusion” over its official stance toward 
the conflict between Israel and Hamas.
The science minister, Ed Husic, said on Thursday morning he was concerned Palestinians were being “ collectively 
punished for Hamas’s barbarism  ” in the besieged Gaza Strip, with the death toll rising to more than 3,000.
The foreign minister, Penny Wong, has so far acknowledged Israel’s right to defend itself and urged all sides to 
show “restraint” in protecting civilian life.
But other Labor members have broken ranks to condemn Israel’s blockade on Gaza and its subsequent retaliatory 
attacks, which were prompted by a surprise assault from Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israeli citizens earlier 
this month.
The Labor backbencher Maria Vamvakinou on Thursday urged the federal government to call on Israel to back 
down from its planned ground invasion of north Gaza.
Ley said the Albanese government needed to make clear what its official stance was amid the “confusion”.
The deputy opposition leader also accused Husic of “freelancing on foreign policy” after he delivered the strongest 
condemnation  yet of Israel’s reprisals in Gaza by a member of Labor’s cabinet.

Albanese government accused of ‘deep division’ and ‘confusion’ over Israel -Hamas conflict stance
Ley warned there were “longstanding consequences” for ministers speaking out on an official position.
“Ed Husic’s claims this morning have exposed Labor’s deep division on the question of Israel and raised serious 
questions about whether these comments reflect a new official position of the Albanese government,” Ley said.
“Anthony Albanese must immediately clear up the confusion and explain whether he agrees with his cabinet 
minister or not.”
The prime minister referred back to Monday’s motion in question time on Thursday, which condemned Hamas and 
urged the Israeli Netanyahu government to “operate by the rules of war”.
“We mourn every single life that is lost, whether Israeli or Palestinian. The children who have been killed, the 
families torn apart. There is widespread suffering, no question about that,” Albanese said.
Vamvakinou on Thursday said the federal government should take on a more “active role” in bringing peace to the 
Palestine and Israel conflict. 
“The blockade has to end, the actual incursion into Gaza shouldn’t happen and another way forward would be 
calling for parties to come to some dialogue to try and avert this humanitarian disaster,” Vamvakinou said.
Fellow frontbencher Anne Aly had earlier stood by Husic’s comments, saying it was “difficult to argue” that 
Palestinians, including hundreds of children who had been killed , were not being “collectively punished”.
The calls echo those made recently by the Greens, with the leader, Adam Bandt, supporting Husic and Aly’s 
comments.
Bandt said the ministers were sharing “the reality of what is happening on the ground” and that it was time for the 
Labor government to “catch up” and call for the invasion to end.
“What the ministers are saying is right, and that must lead the Labor government to shift its position and now call for 
an immediate ceasefire and for the invasion to end,” Bandt said.
“Because otherwise, that collective punishment, and the deaths and starvation and dehydration of civilians, is going 
to continue.”
Earlier this week, the Labor senator Fatima Payman and MP Julian Hill also spoke out by condemning the killing of 
innocent civilians in Israel and Palestine.
Husic said there was “an obligation on governments, particularly the Israeli government to … follow the rules of 
international law and to observe, in particular, that innocents should be protected”.
“I am very mindful of the words of our prime minister in saying that protecting innocent lives is not a sign of 
weakness.
It is a sign of strength. That is a really important thing that needs to be considered. I genuinely believe there needs 
to be a de-escalation. I don’t think it’s in Israel’s interest, long-term, to engage in the occupation of Gaza. ”
Collective punishment is prohibited by international law , including article 33 of the Geneva conventions. Wilful 
killing of civilians and extensive destruction of property beyond what is necessary are war crimes.
In a speech to the house on Tuesday, Vamvakinou said collective punishment was not within the rules of war, and 
that the people of Gaza should not be seen as “collateral damage”.
“Let’s be clear: ‘not within the rules of war’ is doublespeak for ‘illegal’, doublespeak for ‘crime’. The indiscriminate 
targeting of an unarmed civilian population, 40% of whom are under 15 years old, is not within the rules of war,” she 
said.Page 3 of 3

“The occupation of Palestine, the longest ongoing military occupation in modern history, and the siege and 
blockade of Gaza is illegal.”

Federal Government's online safety crackdown

Body
Rachel Mealey: Tech companies are in the Federal Government's sights, with new laws being introduced to crack 
down on misinformation and disinformation online. It's part of a push to make the online environment safer, coming 
alongside new legislation to outlaw the malicious release of personal information, known as doxing. Alexandra 
Humphries reports.
Alexandra Humphries: Australians are becoming increasingly worried about misinformation and disinformation on 
social media. An issue highlighted in the wake of the Bondi stabbing tragedy, when disinformation about who was 
responsible for the attack circulated rapidly online. Today, the Government's unveiling plans to address those 
concerns.
Michelle Rowland: Having seen the impacts of misinformation in real life situations here in Australia and indeed 
around the world, I think as a Parliament we should recognise we need to do something.
Alexandra Humphries: Michelle Rowland is the Communications Minister.
Michelle Rowland: We know that some 75% of Australians are concerned about the harmful impacts of mis and 
disinformation. This really goes to not only protecting Australians but protecting our democratic way of life.
Alexandra Humphries: The Government wants Australia's media watchdog, the Australian Communications and 
Media Authority, to be able to force digital platforms to keep records about incidents of misinformation that can then 
be turned over to authorities. Social media platforms, news aggregators and even podcasts will be affected. And if 
they break the law, they could face penalties of up to 5% of their global revenue. Terry Flew is a Professor of Digital 
Communication at the University of Sydney.
Page 2 of 2
Federal Government's online safety crackdown
Terry Flew: I think what will be important here is that there are clear definitions of what constitutes misinformation 
because if the ACMA is to be delegating that responsibility to platforms, they need very clear guidance that 
minimises the extent to which discretion applies around these matters.
Alexandra Humphries: Around 3,000 public submissions were made on the draft legislation. Many worried about 
impacts on free speech, including Australia's Human Rights Commission. The Federal Government's also 
introducing laws to criminalise doxing, or the malicious release of personal information. The new offence covers the 
publication of information like names, addresses and numbers with the intent of causing harm. Those convicted 
could face up to seven years in jail. The bill follows the publication of information from a WhatsApp group involving 
hundreds of Jewish Australians in February. Minister Anne Aly says the laws tackle a rising threat to public safety.
Anne Aly: It's become an issue that threatens the safety of Australian citizens. I don't think it's justifiable to ever 
release the personal information of a private citizen in order to incite or to give out information to encourage or so 
that people can utilise that information to attack them or threaten their safety and security.
Alexandra Humphries: Josh Roose is a Political Sociologist and Associate Professor of Politics at Deakin 
University. He's glad to see the Government moving to address online safety.
Josh Roose: I think we're certainly in a space with our online environment where an entire raft of legislation is 
needed to address not only misinformation, disinformation, but hate speech, doxing and I think this goes some way 
to at least starting that process.
Rachel Mealey: Political Sociologist Josh Roose ending that report from Alexandra Humphries.

Calls for purpose-built childcare centres for children with a disability amid 'discrimination'
Calls for purpose-built childcare centres for children with a disability amid 
'discrimination'
ABC Premium News (Australia)
September 11, 2023 Monday

Length: 1220 words
Highlight: Everyone has a legal right to access childcare, but very few facilities have the staff or equipment to cater 
to children with a disability. That may soon be about to change. 
Body
Felicity Thompson bought just one thing for her unborn daughter — a tiny outfit to bury her in.
The Perth nurse had been told her baby would probably die.
Then, when she was 30 weeks pregnant, doctors said the baby would live and diagnosed her with Russell-Silver 
Syndrome.
Audrey, who is now two-and-a-half, was born with proportional dwarfism.
That means she struggles to gain weight, needs a feeding tube, is immuno-compromised and has gross motor 
delays.
Felicity tried to return to work, but the local childcare centre refused to take Audrey. 
"I've always worked full-time, even when I've had my other four children.
"I've always valued that part of my life but I can't leave her [and] she got really sick when I started trying to go back 
to work, so it's a full-time job."
Housebound for over two years
Watching Felicity cradle Audrey in her arms, it's obvious how much she adores her little girl.
But 24/7 care-giving has taken a toll and Felicity desperately needs a break.
Page 2 of 4
Calls for purpose-built childcare centres for children with a disability amid 'discrimination'
"I haven't been out of the house without her for two-and-a-half years," she said.
"Just to be able to go out, spend time with my friends and have a normal five minutes to myself.
"It doesn't sound like much to many people but to me, it would mean the world.
"In the 1960s, kids like Audrey were hidden in institutions; now they're just hidden at home."
'Huge' barriers to accessing childcare
Everyone has a legal right to access childcare under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.
In reality, very few facilities have the staff or equipment to cater for high-needs children and they don't have to make 
changes that would cause "unjustifiable hardship".
Monique Power started her company Ripple Ability to help parents navigate the National Disability Insurance 
Scheme (NDIS) after her own experience advocating for her daughter left her frustrated.
She and her colleagues realised the extent of the problem when a funeral for one of their young clients was 
attended by many children, all of whom couldn't be put in childcare.
Their research has since exposed the barriers to accessing childcare for kids with disabilities.
"We know that childcare centres are discriminating against [these] children," Ms Power said.
Ripple Ability has rung dozens of childcare centres in Western Australia trying to find care for clients.
"We were met with a resounding no … the ones that we didn't get an explicit no from said we'll call you back 
[and] we never heard from them again," she said.
Need for purpose-built centres
Ms Power believes the answer is a new model, involving purpose-built centres with flexible hours, equipment and 
medically trained staff and therapists.
"Parents would know [their child] is in a safe space and could walk away feeling confident about that," she said.
"Kids with complex needs don't miraculously become better.
"But they would have an opportunity to make friends and build social networks with people that look like them and 
have lives like theirs, which makes a huge difference on mental health in the long run."
Ms Power believes having access to such a centre would also be life-changing for parents.
"It will provide people with the opportunity to pursue higher education [or] hold down a meaningful career," she said.
"But in addition to that, a centre like this would provide women with the opportunity to go to a gynaecology 
appointment alone or go out for coffee with a friend that they haven't seen for three years."
There are significant barriers to opening such a centre, however, including the current childcare subsidy offered to 
parents.
"We could open a model like this tomorrow but there's no way that [families] can afford it and that's the biggest 
problem," Ms Power said.
"We need a new subsidy through Services Australia that has these children in mind to cater for the skills necessary 
to provide that level of care.Page 3 of 4
Calls for purpose-built childcare centres for children with a disability amid 'discrimination'
"You're going to have to pay a paediatric nurse $75 an hour … so the subsidy needs to offer these families the sort 
of rebate that every other family enjoys under the current childcare legislation."
'Game-changing' childcare centre on the cards
Despite the barriers, some childcare centres are still working hard to be inclusive.
Lake Joondalup Early Learning Program has been running for 12 years and welcomes children of all abilities and 
needs.
Co-founders Debra Gibson and Jodie Jones are hoping to build a second facility on the same site that caters to 
children with more complex clinical needs.
"I think it's going to be huge — a game changer," Ms Jones said.
"All those children that have fallen through the gaps through the years — to finally have something they can access 
is actually really exciting."
Like Ripple Ability, they've identified inadequate childcare subsidies as a barrier to the plan.
"Right now we fund extra support so these children can receive one-to-one care but that's coming at a cost to our 
service," Ms Gibson said.
"One of our concerns is that we're going to be dipping into the current service here to actually fund the new service 
out the back — obviously that's not viable for the long term."
The centre is in talks with the Federal Minister for Early Childhood Education Anne Aly to become a pilot facility for 
a new childcare subsidy model.
"We're not sure what it will look like because we're waiting to hear back but we're pretty excited about it," Ms Jones 
said.
Barriers under review
Aside from the issue of subsidies, advocates also spent years campaigning for legislative change.
Childcare providers aren't currently covered under the Disability Standards for Education Act 2005.
Three government reviews have flagged this as a problem, with the most recent in 2020 recommending that draft 
amendments be prepared to extend the law to childcare centres.
The Federal Minister for Early Childhood Education Anne Aly said that work is happening.
There are also two separate inquires underway into early childhood education and care.
The Productivity Commission is due to release its draft report in November, while the ACCC will hand down its final 
report on supply of childcare services in December.
"I don't want to pre-empt anything that comes out of the Productivity Commission review or the ACCC review, but I 
know a lot of the consultation that's gone out has had … input from parents of children with disability … and the 
things that they have said will be taken into account," Ms Aly said.
"I see a huge opportunity here for us to really come together as a government across those different portfolios, as 
we have done with the Early Years Strategy."
Advocates sceptical reviews will lead to changePage 4 of 4
Calls for purpose-built childcare centres for children with a disability amid 'discrimination'
Monique Power will launch a petition this week calling for better access to childcare.
"I am an optimist … but I am incredibly pessimistic that [any] changes will [reflect] the cohort of kids that we're 
dealing with," she said.
"Am I optimistic that the government is going to address the most critical and vulnerable [kids] in our society with 
these reforms?
"I'm not confident at all."
Ripple Ability has made submissions to the inquires but is struggling to get meetings with relevant ministers, 
including Ms Aly.
"We want an audience with them to have a conversation about the extensive body of work that we have done and 
the solutions that we have put together … to start the ball rolling towards some meaningful change," Ms Power 
said.
"We're real people and we need real solutions."

alleged war crimesFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updatesGet our morning and afternoon news

Body
Palestinians are being “collectively punished for Hamas’s barbarism”, senior federal minister Ed Husic has said, in 
the strongest condemnation yet of Israel’s reprisals in Gaza by a member of the Australian government.
Fellow Labor frontbencher Anne Aly immediately backed Husic saying it was “difficult to argue” that Palestinians, 
including 1,000 children who had been killed , were not being “collectively punished”. Aly, the early childhood 
education minister, suggested Israel could be investigated over whether it had committed war crimes.
The comments from the first two Muslim ministers in an Australian federal government  go further than the foreign 
minister, Penny Wong, who has urged all sides to show “restraint” in protecting civilian life.
This week Labor senator Fatima Payman and MP Julian Hill also spoke out by condemning the killing of innocent 
civilians in Israel and Palestine.
The opposition has sought to weaponise Labor’s position, arguing it is unfair to urge restraint on Israel, given its 
citizens were the victims of the Hamas attacks.
Husic, the industry and science minister, noted that about 3,000 Palestinians were dead , including approximately 
1,000 children, according to the Gaza health ministry.
“You’ve got homes, schools, medical centres destroyed,” he told ABC radio on Thursday.

Australian ministers say Palestinians are being ‘collectively punished’ for Hamas barbarism
“That’s before we even contemplate how they’ll get rebuilt. No food, fuel, medicines, water. I feel very strongly that 
Palestinians are being collectively punished here for Hamas’s barbarism.”
Husic said there was “an obligation on governments, particularly the Israeli government to … follow the rules of 
international law and to observe in particular, that innocents should be protected”.
“I am very mindful of the words of our prime minister in saying that protecting innocent lives is not a sign of 
weakness.
“It is a sign of strength. That is a really important thing that needs to be considered. I genuinely believe there needs 
to be a de-escalation. I don’t think it’s in Israel’s interest long term to engage in the occupation of Gaza.”
Aly said it was “entirely appropriate” that parliament had passed a motion  condemning the Hamas attacks.
“But with the escalation of violence, and that was something that I feared from the very beginning – that the 
escalation of violence would mean there would be more Palestinian lives lost and that has come to pass, and it will 
continue,” she said.
Aly urged Israel to abide by the rules of law developed by the international community to protect the human rights of 
civilians during conflict.
Asked if Israel had committed war crimes, Aly replied that: “That is something that possibly could be investigated. I 
think that anyone, any state or any group that commits war crimes, should be investigated and should be held 
accountable.”
The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has recognised Israel’s right to defend itself but also urged the Netanyahu 
government to “ operate by the rules of war  ” amid increasing expectations of an imminent ground operation in 
Gaza.
On Monday, Hill told parliament that Israel’s right to defend itself did not extend to the “indiscriminate mass killing of 
innocent Palestinians”.
Hill said he had heard an “overwhelming message” from his community “that the mass punishment of 2 million 
people in Gaza is not a proportionate response and this is a trap that Israel must not fall into – it is what Hamas is 
trying to provoke”.
Payman told the Senate that Australia “must condemn” civilian deaths as “Israeli missiles strike residential 
dwellings, civilians, multi-story apartments, health facilities as well as places of worship, indiscriminately killing men, 
women and children”.
“The price tag of Israel’s right to defend itself cannot be the destruction of Palestine. Israel’s right to defend its 
civilians cannot equate to the annihilation of Palestinian civilians.”
On Thursday, the home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, said she was “not going to get into” who was responsible  for 
the Al-Ahli Arab hospital strike because it was an “unfolding” situation.
“What we do know about this is that hundreds of innocent people, who were at a hospital evidently already 
incredibly unwell and vulnerable, have lost their lives,” she said.
“his was set off by these violent and inhumane, barbaric attacks by Hamas.”
“What we now see is loss of innocent lives, of men, women and children in Gaza, and I want Australians to know 
that, for any innocent loss of life, we stand with Australian communities who experience this pain very deeply, 
whether they are Jewish Australians who are mourning the loss of life in the Middle East, or whether they are 
Palestinian or Muslim Australians who are mourning the loss there.”Page 3 of 3

Our new government's force for change

In fashion history, a red and purple outfit has only been pulled out to send some poignant, albeit pointed, 
messages. Princess Diana donned a red blazer and purple skirt when she sat alone outside the Taj Mahal in 1992 
as her marriage crumbled. Her daughter-in-law, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, recreated the look for one of her final 
official duties as a working royal in 2019. And in 2022, clutching a pink Qur'an, Anne Aly wore a red Acler skirt and 
purple blouse to Government House where she was sworn in as Australia's first Muslim female minister.
Aly's appointment comes on the heels of a significant changing of the guard in Australian politics. For the first time 
in our political history, there will be a record number of Carla Zampatti dresses, as opposed to the once prevalent 
MJ Bale suits, in both houses of parliament. The federal election was a win, not just for the Greens and the teal 
wave, but also for a new world order of sorts.
There is a new guard looming. One that is all about difference, diversity and diverging from a place of "that's just the 
way it is" to a new chapter in Canberra that champions equality. Climate change was front of mind for many voters, 
who backed independents including Allegra Spender - daughter of the late Zampatti - in the seat of Wentworth and 
Kate Chaney in Curtin, to speak up for the environment. 
This is in keeping with what ANU climate scientist Joëlle Gergis so aptly sums up in her new book, Humanity's 
Moment: A Climate Scientist's Case for Hope, on sale this month: "What an extraordinary time to be alive; we are 
part of the generation that will help heal the world." The age of societal sustainability is upon us.
The 47th parliament will be one of the most representative we've had, thanks to a new government and a collection 
of MPs who accurately represent modern Australia. A record number of women will take their seats in the House of 
Representatives. Many are not aligned to the traditional parties and make up the super-sized crossbench. Women 
count for 51 per cent of the Australian population and now comprise 38 per cent of the chamber in the new 
parliament - the highest ever proportion on record - after 58 women were elected to the lower house, including 19 
debutante MPs. The Senate reached and exceeded 50 per cent gender parity in the last parliament, and maintains 
this in the new parliament.
Page 2 of 3
Our new government's force for change
We've come a long way since Edith Cowan, our first female politician, was elected to the Western Australian 
parliament in 1921. Her colleagues were so opposed to her being there, she had to make several attempts at 
presenting her first speech, because the men kept interjecting as she spoke of wanting equal access to education 
for young Australian women.
Still, in 2003, the then newly minted cabinet minister Julie Bishop was infamously told how to dress by her male 
peers. "When I was first appointed to the ministry, I was asked to be the Minister for Ageing. And one of the prime 
minister's senior advisors rang me and said 'Julie, take this the right way, but forget the Armani suits and forget the 
corporate look. You're the minister for the ageing, you're going into aged- care homes, you've got to dress 
appropriately," Bishop has shared. "I said 'What? You mean like cardigans?' And he said, 'Yeah more prints, more 
colour. Just not corporate.'"
Not too long after this sermon from a "faceless man", Bishop went on to become Minister for Foreign Affairs and a 
three-time deputy leader of the Liberal party. And she did it all in good shoes and some of the best of Australian 
fashion, including Rachel Gilbert, Rebecca Vallance and Dion Lee, and coined the phrase "fashion diplomacy" by 
exclusively wearing homegrown Australian labels when on official visits.
Her work, putting fashion on the agenda, also helped put the wheels in motion for the Australian Fashion Council to 
secure a federal grant to establish an Australian Fashion trademark in 2021. The world-first campaign hopes to 
promote the industry and create more local jobs. "The Australian Fashion trademark will be a driving force in 
building the industry's growth trajectory to deliver substantial economic, social and environmental gains over the 
next 10 years," CEO of Australian Fashion Council Leila Naja Hibri said in a statement. 
"We can show the world how prioritising people and the planet together with profit can lead to a legacy of thriving 
prosperity."
We've also come a long way since the ministerial wing was trodden, pretty much exclusively, by men in R.M. 
Williams boots in the first part of this century. R.M. Williams was, during those days, owned by luxury conglomerate 
LVMH. But in 2020 the brand was brought home when it was acquired by Perth billionaire Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest 
and his wife Nicola. 
Since Australia's richest man has taken over the bootmaker, vegan materials have been introduced and demand is 
skyrocketing. And Prime Minister Anthony Albanese seems keen to tread new paths. One that is more female-
focused, family-friendly and awake to the Australia we want to become.
Now, almost 10 per cent of the Senate identifies as Indigenous after the record number of Aboriginal and Torres 
Strait Islander representatives elected, including four new Indigenous MPs, three of whom are women. Indigenous 
Affairs Minister Linda Burney was bestowed her new job on election night. Burney, a proud Wiradjuri woman, knows 
the power that culture, and more specifically fashion, can have in politics. Since serving in federal politics from 
2016, she has regularly been spotted on the shadow front bench in the odd Albus Lumen piece and Anna Quan 
skirt.
Another fashion force has also joined the Albanese government's inner sanctum. The aforementioned Anne Aly, 
Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth is as passionate about her portfolio as she is about 
fashion, the statements style can make and where that style is made.
Dr Aly is Australia's first Muslim woman elected to parliament and is also the first Muslim woman MP who will sit in 
the outer ministry. Serendipitously, she represents the seat of Cowan - named after Edith Cowan - in Perth's outer 
suburbs. Born in Egypt, Aly's family moved to Sydney's southwest when she was two. She is a survivor of domestic 
violence and an academic specialising in counter terrorism. She's still considered a global authority into why 
children are lured into extremism. She also achieved all this after spending her 20s working for the minimum wage 
as a single mother of two boys.
Aly has a deep love and appreciation of fashion and since being elected in 2016 has regularly worn local labels that 
have a strong sustainable ethos including KitX and Flannel to parliament and official functions. In 2017 she made Page 3 of 3
Our new government's force for change
her catwalk debut for then 23-year-old designer Thomas Puttick, a designer who was showing sustainable clothes 
before it went mainstream and cast 'muses' such as Aly instead of models for his runway show.
"It's in my nature to disrupt because it is more often the case that I just end up being somewhere where I am not 
expected to be - like parliament or the catwalk of Australian Fashion Week," Dr Aly tells Vogue. Fashion is in her 
blood. "My dad studied textiles engineering. But when my family migrated to Australia, he couldn't find work in his 
field so he drove buses," Aly shares. "A story typical of so many who choose to make Australia home. Dad would 
spend hours at the sewing machine making our school uniforms. He never lost his passion for design. My mum tells 
me I've inherited his passion."
She says that it was only after she was first elected that she realised what her career and success represented 
when a constituent in Perth said she had told her young daughter that Dr Aly's victory was proof girls, Muslim girls 
especially, in Australia could achieve anything. 
"The significance of it to other people, to the people watching really struck me at that point," she continues. "I made 
a very conscious decision that, coming in here, I would do everything I could to not just open the door but break 
down the wall. I feel so heartened by the fact that I may have been the first, but I'm certainly not going to be the 
last."

Highlight: Liberal senator Dave Sharma says Australia risks lasting damage to society from a rise in threats to 
Jewish Australians and other minorities.
Body
Liberal senator Dave Sharma has warned of lasting damage to Australian society from a rise in threats to Jewish 
Australians, declaring that everyone will lose if nothing is done to stop mob attacks on a minority.
Sharma described the attacks as "incredibly dangerous" because of the threat to the nation's social fabric and the 
risk that other minorities could one day suffer the same intimidation and vilification.

Alex Ellinghausen
The warning comes as Jewish and Islamic groups report a rise in attacks founded on racial or religious intolerance.
The federal government has vowed to proceed with stronger laws against hate speech.
Sharma, who entered the Senate at the end of last year after having served in the lower house and as ambassador 
to Israel, said Australia had avoided sectarian violence because it had a shared sense of civic values, but the 
country could not take this for granted.
"Discrimination, vilification, harassment and intimidation against the Jewish community in Australia has reached 
unprecedented levels," he said, in his first speech to the Senate.
"I understand that people in Australia feel strongly, and differ in their views widely, about the rights and wrongs of 
the current conflict in the Middle East, and the terrible human suffering and tragedy that has accompanied it.
"What we have seen in recent months has clearly crossed the Rubicon, and resulted in one community - and one 
community alone, the Australian Jewish community - being made to feel unwelcome in their own country, fearful in 
their own neighbourhoods, and anxious about the future they face here.
"This is utterly unacceptable. It is also incredibly dangerous.
"Jewish Australians are no more responsible for Israel's conduct of this war than Palestinian Australians are 
responsible for Hamas' terrorist attack that prompted it."
Page 2 of 3
'Mob rule': Senator warns attacks on minorities are shredding social fabric
Sharma described the attacks in Australia as "mob rule" and intimidation and said Australian leaders had "muted 
their voices" on the issue, while institutions had neglected their duty to protect the social compact.
"Today it might be Jewish Australians, but tomorrow it will be another group or another minority against which the 
forces of the populist mob are unleashed," he said. "Down that road lies civil turmoil and national disunity. Staying 
quiet, sitting on the sidelines, and hoping it will all go away is a complete failure of leadership."
The Islamophobia Register Australia has warned of a surge in Islamophobia in the wake of the conflict between 
Israel and Hamas, while the Executive Council of Australian Jewry said there had been a 738 per cent increase in 
antisemitism.
Protests in support of the Palestinian people have also heightened concerns in Parliament House about threats to 
politicians and the disruption of public events.
Early Childhood Minister Anne Aly, who was born and raised in Egypt and is one of Australia's first Muslim 
ministers, was berated by pro-Palestinian protesters at a "meet and greet" with her community on the weekend but 
she said it would not change her conduct.

Alex Ellinghausen
"I will continue to take every opportunity to talk with people from my local community about the issues that matter to 
them. This kind of behaviour won't stop me," she said.
Sharma told this masthead he was appalled at the aggression towards Aly.
The Liberal senator's first speech to the upper house also called for stronger federal reform to boost competition 
among big companies.
"What we have witnessed is a rapid redistribution of national income," he said. "Big business has won. Workers and 
small businesses have lost.
"Australia now has one of the most concentrated economies in the developed world."
On housing costs, Sharma said the biggest solution was a focus on increasing supply and that this meant Australia 
had to find a way to build more homes, more quickly.
"Until we are able to accelerate our pace of home building, we need to reduce our immigration intake, or else we 
will simply place further pressure on our housing market," he said.

Body
If there is such a thing as a traditional path to parliament, the Egyptian-born, Australian-raised Minister for Early 
Childhood Education did not take it, writes Julie Hare.
Within minutes of sitting down for lunch with Anne Aly, she has invited me to join her for lemon chicken tagine at 
her house next time I am in Perth.
And just moments later I seem to have crossed some unspoken social convention by asking her if she has ADHD. 
She doesn't.
One thing is for sure, there will not be too many barriers standing in the way of a free-ranging conversation. Which 
is just as well because so far, things aren't going according to plan.
We had arranged to meet at Zeytin Turkish Cuisine on the foreshore of Lake Burley Griffin. But when I show up at 
noon sharp, not a sign of life.
I'm busily texting Aly's people when, luckily, we run into each other - Canberra is a small place - so we amble a few 
metres along until we come to a cafe on the corner that seems, well, convenient.
We grab a table outside and Aly immediately launches into a monologue about how to make a lemon chicken 
tagine, which involves soaking the tagine pot in a bath for 24 hours, rubbing it with oil and then cooking the Middle-
Eastern deliciousness for another 24 hours in a very low oven.
We are scanning the menu and Aly announces she "doesn't do rice", which is a staple of Middle Eastern cuisine 
and which makes her some sort of pariah at family events. She opts for the grilled fennel chicken (no butter please) 
and a very hot almond milk cappuccino. I choose the zucchini fritters and a bean-a-colada, which disappointingly 
has neither beans nor booze.
Aly, let it be said, is prone to the odd swear word, as am I, and over the next 60 minutes our conversation is 
peppered with F-bombs.
Page 2 of 4
'I'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN
The thrice-married Aly had already lived a complex and somewhat haphazard life before she decided rather 
spontaneously to run as the Labor candidate for the West Australian seat Cowan in 2016. She managed to turf out 
the Liberal incumbent Luke Simpkins by the finest of margins. "It took 10 days to count the vote," she says.
In 2019, she increased her margin and by 2022 she harnessed 46.9 per cent of the vote, adding more than 9 per 
cent to her 2019 numbers.
Of that first campaign, she remembers standing at a train station with a picture of herself while waving at cars. A 
year ago to the day, she had been invited to speak at the White House at a counterterrorism conference. "All I could 
think was from the White House to Greenwood station. What have I done?"
Aly was born Azza Mahmoud Fawzi Hosseini Ali el Serougi in Alexandria, Egypt, in 1967, the daughter of a nurse 
and a textiles engineer who migrated to Australia in 1969. They were among the last migrants to be received at the 
Bonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre in Albury-Wodonga - which, having made the world's headlines 
two decades earlier over the death from malnutrition of 13 children, had improved conditions considerably.
The family moved first to Marrickville in Sydney's inner west and then, just on the cusp of shifting to Texas, they 
relocated to Brisbane, where Aly's dad got a job at the Jennings factory, which made corsets and women's 
underwear.
They bought their first house in the very un-chi chi suburb of West End.
"And then in 1974 came the flood. My parents came from a desert country, they had never seen anything like this," 
Aly says.
"But it was a defining feature of our Australian story because what we found was a community. It was almost like 
they became Australian through the tragedy."
Moments like that, she says, stand in stark contrast to other moments of division and rancour that have 
characterised the same-sex marriage plebiscite, the Voice referendum and the uncontained racism that followed the 
9/11 attacks in New York.
The current situation in Gaza is confronting, she says. Aly joined Ed Husic last month to warn Gaza's 2.3 million 
residents were being "collectively punished" for the crimes of terrorists.
As the Israel-Hamas war becomes more divisive, Aly says she is trying to demonstrate how "important it is that we 
recognise each other's humanity and show compassion to each other, even when we are hurting the most".
As the minister for early childhood education, and also the minister for youth, Aly has a lot on her plate as she 
marshals through two reviews of the childcare and early learning sectors.
The government is moving, slowly, towards adopting a model of universal access. In July, it increased the 
maximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning up to $80,000, and a sliding scale in subsidies for families 
earning less than $530,000.
"The fact is Australia is one of the most expensive places for early childhood education and care," says Aly.
"We have a quality system that is world-class, and a quality framework that has been in place for 10 years. The 
issue is the cost and the fact that the market isn't behaving the way you would expect. It doesn't go to where the 
demand is, it goes to where the money is."
The delivery of the Productivity Commission report this week and the Australian Competition and Consumer 
Commission's investigation will ensure childcare remains one of the hot button issues for the Albanese government 
in coming months.Page 3 of 4
'I'M MUCH MORE LIKE ME NOW THAN I WAS' ANNE ALY | POLITICIAN
Aly will be familiar to most people, even if they haven't connected the name to the face. She is the petite dark-
haired, dark-eyed woman in colourful clothing who sits behind Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during question 
time. Aly is an active listener. She nods. She laughs. She scowls and boos. She never drifts off or checks her 
phone.
Always impeccably well-dressed, Aly's choice of clothing has taken a twist in the past couple of years as she took 
up crochet and knitting as a form of meditation and mindfulness as she takes endless flights between Canberra and 
Perth.
The white jumper she wears to lunch is handcrafted (and has a matching skirt), as was the crochet long dress she 
wore to this year's Mid-Winter Ball. She is already working on next year's dress, which will feature crocheted 
flowers, each unique, representing every woman who died from domestic violence during the year.
Aly has her own story of domestic violence, one that is told in her 2018 autobiography Finding My Place: From 
Cairo to Canberra - the Irresistible Story of an Irrepressible Woman.
She had married young, at the age of 20, while living back in Egypt, where she was studying English literature, with 
a minor in acting. The marriage wasn't arranged, as was common for girls like her. Rather, it was a way of escaping 
the strictures of being a single woman in a Muslim country.
"The marriage gave me a freedom that I didn't have living under my parents' roof. It gave me the freedom to be a 
respectable married woman in Egypt. It meant I could go camping with friends, I could go to parties, I could come 
home when I wanted to."
There were red flags which she ignored - or didn't know any better.
But after moving to Perth, the violence and contemptuous behaviour escalated.
"There was a bit of martyrdom on my behalf. But there are a lot of stereotypes around women who are survivors, a 
lot of us are high achievers. The feelings of responsibility and humiliation; we expect more of ourselves," she says.
"I remember driving away once and saying out loud to myself: 'You must be just the kind of woman that men hit.' I'd 
resigned myself to it.
"I describe domestic violence as this crack in a bone somewhere in your body that you carry with you through your 
life.
"It's hard to imagine myself as the person I was. I'm much more like me now than I was back then."
She finally kicked him out of the family home after six long years and began the next chapter as a broke single mum 
of two young sons, Karim and Adam. They only found out about the history of abuse when they read the 
autobiography.
Keeping hearth and home together with a string of unskilled jobs, she retreated to her safe space: education. In all, 
she has four degrees, including a masters in education and a PhD on counterterrorism and security.
Which, to circle back, might help explain the inappropriate ADHD comment, having completed the two-year masters 
in nine months and the PhD in two years - it typically take four to seven years.
"I'd put the boys to bed, study until 3 or 4am, and then get up at 7am."
That led to another chapter, as a world-renowned researcher and professor specialising in countering online violent 
extremism. It also got her invited to Oxford University and the White House to speak.
Her political spark was ignited after the rise of anti-Muslim sentiment across the world, witnessing one-too-many 
instances of casual racism in suburban Perth, and becoming a target of death threats because of her profile as a 
researcher in anti-terrorism.Page 4 of 4

I have set aside 90 minutes for lunch, but after an hour a staffer taps Aly on the shoulder and says we have five 
minutes to wrap it up.
Heavens, we haven't even got on to husband number two, or heaven forbid Dave Allen, who is husband number 
three. (He is a Canadian-born former ice-hockey player, policeman and intelligence officer who she met while 
working in the WA public service and married in 2012).
We need to talk more about childcare, whether the big for-profit corporates are price gouging, why the market is 
failing (and what to do about it).
Ten minutes later, there is another tap on the shoulder. She really must go, her next appointment is unmovable.
I feel a bit cheated. It's been a rollicking fun lunch.
I will be knocking on her door for lemon chicken tagine next time I'm in Perth.W

The Albanese government's most senior Muslim woman has been verbally attacked by pro-Palestinian activists, 
amid a sustained campaign to target Labor politicians over the Gaza-Israel war.
Early Childhood Education Minister Anne Aly - the nation's first female Muslim minister - was involved in a heated 
confrontation with pro-Palestine activists during a "meet your member" event at a suburban Perth park on the 
weekend.
Plain-clothed Australian Federal Police officers had to intervene to shut down the event as tensions between Dr Aly 
and the activists rose.
As Dr Aly left the scene, activists could be heard calling her a "coward" and one woman shouted "don't call yourself 
a Muslim". Chants of "from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free" broke out as Dr Aly was ushered away.
The interaction began harmlessly, with a man introducing himself as a student studying early childhood education. 
But Dr Aly quickly became visibly uncomfortable as the man began talking about the impact of Australia's decision 
to pause funding to the United Nations agency in Gaza, UNRWA. 
At one point Dr Aly moved to push away a picture of a starving Palestinian boy. Later, she had to be held back by 
her husband Dave Allen and a staff member from re-engaging with the activists.
Dr Aly was born in Egypt before migrating to Australia as a child. Her ancestry and her Muslim faith has made her 
a target for pro-Palestine activists who believe she and her government are not doing enough to protect people in 
Gaza.
During the confrontation, Dr Aly referred to how her father had fought for Egypt against Israel during the Six Day 
War of 1967.
"My father fought in the war. And what have you done?" she asked one of the protesters.

She said those wanting to see a resolution to the conflict had to give up on the "dream" that Israel would 
spontaneously lay down its weapons without a negotiated truce.
"I would love a ceasefire to happen. We would all agree on that, correct? What has become increasingly clear is the 
only way a ceasefire is going to happen is through a negotiation led by Egypt and Qatar," she said.
Dr Aly told the activists that Israel was losing the broader international support that they had previously enjoyed.
Democratic Senate majority chief Chuck Schumer, the highest-ranking elected Jewish American official in history, 
last week called for Israel to hold new elections after labelling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu one of the "major 
obstacles" to peace. 
Dr Aly told the activists that Mr Netanyahu's agenda had become "very clear".
"He has ruled the far right section of the Israeli government who have voiced openly their desire for the annihilation 
and annexation of Gaza," Dr Aly told the activists.
"It is a concern to the Egyptians, it is a concern to the region, and it is a concern to me as it is a concern to you."
In a statement to The Australian, Dr Aly said: "I will continue to take every opportunity to talk with people from my 
local community about the issues that matter to them." 
Dr Aly's community meetings had been flagged by Friends of Palestine WA, which - in a message posted to the 
organisation's Facebook group - urged its followers to use the events to "tell federal Labor member Anne Aly what 
you think about her government's appalling record of support for Israel's genocide over the past five months".
Pro-Palestine and anti-Israel activism has increased dramatically around Australia since Hamas' October 7 
attacks.
The Australian late last year revealed how some radical anti-Israel groups have been circulating guides advising on 
how to sabotage and vandalise property, track Jewish shipping interests and evade police.
The co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Alex Ryvchin, told The Australian that while he 
didn't agree with some of Dr Aly's statements, he admired her for responding to the harassment with "dignity and 
strength".
"The incident demonstrates once again that anti-Israel protesters aren't interested in constructive engagement. 
They believe only in slogans that make them feel morally superior and deceive the public into thinking they support 
peace," he said. 
"In reality, they adhere to a fanatical worldview in which Israel is the supreme evil and anything done to its people is 
justified, even if it results in more defeat and more suffering for the Palestinians they claim to support. It is critical 
that leaders understand this perverse mindset and never yield to this hatred or allow it to influence their policies and 
public statements."
Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong on Friday announced that Australian funding of UNRWA would resume after 
the government received assurances that the agency itself was not a terrorist organisation.

Parents set to save hundreds on childcare fees - but not until next year
Parents set to save hundreds on childcare fees - but not until next year

Highlight: Labor's childcare policy promises bigger subsidies for more than a million families, but new minister 
Anne Aly says it's unlikely the changes can start earlier than planned.
Body
More than a million families are expected to benefit from Labor's proposed multibillion-dollar changes to childcare 
subsidies, saving about $1200 on average, but they'll have to wait another year to see that relief.
Early Childhood Education Minister Anne Aly says the government will likely have to stick to its timetable of starting 
in July next year, as advocates say parents need cost-of-living pressures including childcare fees eased as soon as 
possible.
"It's not just a matter of going right, from tomorrow, the childcare subsidy has increased to 90 per cent for families 
earning $80,000 or less. There is a lot more to it," Aly said.
"Obviously, any opportunity to deliver our commitments earlier than expected will be good.
"So we're just playing it by ear at the moment, working towards that and I don't want to pre-empt any kind of 
changes to that."
Previous overhauls of the subsidy system have required months of implementation time so the government and 
childcare centres and providers can upgrade their IT systems.
The Parenthood executive director Georgie Dent said early learning was a huge cost pressure on families, 
especially when combined with high inflation and interest rate rises.
"If it is feasible to bring it forwards, potentially to January, then that would absolutely be worthwhile," she said.
The existing system subsidises between 85 per cent and 20 per cent of fees, depending on a family's income.
The highest subsidies go to families earning below about $70,000 a year. The rate steps down so families earning 
between $175,000 and $254,300 receive a 50 per cent subsidy and then steps further so those earning between 
$344,300 and $354,300 get a 20 per cent subsidy. Above this income threshold, there is no subsidy.
Changes that started in March increased the subsidy rate for second and subsequent children where families have 
more than one child under the age of 5 in care, by 30 percentage points, up to a maximum of 95 per cent.

Parents set to save hundreds on childcare fees - but not until next year
Labor's proposal will lift the subsidy rate for all families, smooth out the taper rate so it doesn't abruptly step down, 
and gives subsidies to families earning up to $530,000. It will also keep the higher subsidies for younger siblings.
Aly will task the Productivity Commission before year's end with examining the entire sector, with an aim of a 
universal subsidy of 90 per cent. She'll also ask the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to design a 
price regulation mechanism to make sure higher subsidies don't translate into higher fees.
While the Coalition attacked Labor's plan for paying the fees of wealthy families, those at the top end of the income 
scale get the lowest subsidies - about 7 per cent for a household income of $500,000.
An analysis of the proposal by ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods associate professor Ben Phillips finds 
that while the largest benefits in dollar terms would go to parents in the top 20 per cent of incomes, that is because 
they get either no subsidy or a lower level under the existing scheme.
Those earning up to $86,000 will be an average $358 better off a year.
Out of the almost 1.2 million families using childcare each year, all but about 14,300 would be better off than they 
are now.
Dent said it was also important the government dealt with existing workforce shortages before adding extra demand 
for childcare.
She's been hearing from parents whose childcare centres are having to restrict the number of places on offer or 
even close rooms because they can't get enough staff.
"The situation with the workforce is a crisis and it's only increasing," she said.
Aly says addressing the workforce shortage has to be a cross-portfolio effort. She doesn't want to take anything off 
the table, including migration and improving pay and conditions.
But she's confident the transitional approach - with the sliding scale of subsidies first - will allow the sector to meet 
the increased demand.

MARY DOYLE, LABOR CANDIDATE FOR ASTON: Hello, everyone. I'm Mary Doyle, I'm the Labor Candidate for 
the Aston by-election. It's really exciting to be here at Swinburne TAFE with the Prime Minister and Ministers 
O'Connor and Aly. And thanks to everyone including the wonderful students for showing us around this morning. 
TAFE is something I'm hugely passionate about, having been a TAFE student myself many years ago. And I can 
tell you, when I talk to people about the Albanese Government's plans for fee-free TAFE in critical sectors, they 
overwhelmingly tell me it's a great idea. This is a Government that I want to be a part of. One that looks at the 
pressures facing families in the outer-eastern suburbs and then goes about making a practical difference to address 
those challenges. Whether it's cheaper child care, which will benefit 5,700 families here in Aston. Whether it's 
cheaper medicines, already saving Aston locals more than $250,000 since that came in. Whether it's fee-free TAFE 
for 55,000 Victorians. I want to be a part of the team that delivers for the outer-east. If I'm elected to be part of the 
Albanese Government as the next Member for Aston, I promise you this I will always fight for TAFE, I will always 
fight for cheaper child care, and I will always fight for locals. And I'm thrilled to welcome the PM back to Wantirna.
ANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER: Well, thanks very much, Mary. And I do want to thank the staff and the 
students at Swinburne TAFE here for the very warm welcome that I've received here this morning, along with my 
Minister for Skills and Training, Brendan O'Connor, and my Minister who looks after Early Childhood Learning, 
Anne Aly. We're here to talk to students. We're here also to hear firsthand from them the difference that fee-free 
TAFE is making to their lives. We, arising out of the Jobs and Skills Summit last year, and a commitment we made 
at the election to 180,000 fee-free TAFE places are happening right now. And what we heard from this morning is 
students who not only are benefiting from that fee-free TAFE, but they're also working and earning an income while 
Page 2 of 6
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023
that is happening. We've learned from them firsthand that this was part of the incentive for them to enter an area 
which has skill shortages. So, it's good for students, but it's good for the economy as well. And it's good for this 
region, because we also heard that the early learning centres which they are partaking in now, in terms of their work 
experience, are all local. And Mary Doyle understands that. That's why I want Mary Doyle, next Saturday, to 
become the Member for Aston. Because this community needs a voice in government. A Labor Government. A 
Labor Government that cares about people in the outer suburbs. A Labor Government that's committed to making a 
difference with fee-free TAFE, to making a difference with the cheaper pharmaceuticals, but making a difference as 
well in child care costs for families. One of the things that is happening here from the students we spoke to, not only 
are they benefiting from free-free TAFE, they're benefiting from working, because there are skills shortages, but 
they're also having the bonus of our cheaper child care plan, that comes in on July 1, will mean that more women in 
particular can join the workforce. This isn't a welfare policy. This is a productivity enhancing economic policy. This is 
about improving women's workforce participation, it's about boosting productivity and also about boosting the 
population. The three Ps of economic growth are all ticked by this policy. Mary Doyle understands this. She hasn't 
shopped around for a seat. Mary Doyle ran for this seat last year, and she's been committed to her community, 
where she has lived for a long period of time, here in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. And that's why I want 
someone who actually understands this community, who's committed to this community, and who will represent this 
community in the by-election on April 1. People do have an opportunity to send a message to the Opposition that 
they need to do better than have Peter Dutton as their Leader. Peter Dutton, who has spent year after year in 
government deriding Victorians, condemning the sacrifices that they were making during the pandemic, and 
someone who said that people weren't safe to go out in Melbourne. Like, he just doesn't get this city and he doesn't 
get this state of Victoria. Mary Doyle does. She'll be a fantastic representative, and I look forward to her joining our 
team after April 1 and having input into the Budget that we'll be putting together in May, which will take further 
pressure off working families in communities like this. I'll get Brendan to say something, Anne, and then we're 
happy to take questions.
BRENDAN O'CONNOR, MINISTER FOR SKILLS AND TRAINING: Thanks, Prime Minister. It's great to be with the 
Prime Minister and, of course, with Mary and Anne, here today at this fantastic dual sector provider at Swinburne. 
It's fair to say that when we were elected, we comprehended the challenge we had in supplying the skills to the 
labour market. There were skill shortages across the economy. Wherever you looked, whatever professional trade, 
there were shortages. It was for that reason the Prime Minister convened the Jobs and Skills Summit, bringing 
together industry, bringing together state and territory governments, and finding solutions to the problems that we 
inherited. And I'm happy to say that the 180,000 fee-free TAFE places decision that was made at that summit was 
an absolutely critical part of the response by the Albanese Government to the skill shortages. And we're seeing it 
here today, as a result of that decision and as a result of decisions by the Albanese Government with eight separate 
governments, eight state and territory governments, to have agreements in each jurisdiction, we can focus on the 
economies of each state and territory. And that's what we've done. 55,000 fee-free places in Victoria, and then a 
large proportion of those, for example, in early childhood education, where there's a massive demand. 40 per cent 
of the advertisements for those jobs are in Victoria. That's why we've dedicated 3,800 places to this state, and that's 
why the students we've met today are able to enrol in those courses, knowing that they can afford it, knowing that 
they can cope with the cost of living pressures because the courses are fee-free, which also means, because 
enrolments are going up, the supply of skilled workers to this really critical sector of our economy, looking after and 
teaching our children, preschool children is absolutely vital, we'll be able to provide that pipeline. So, as a result of 
those agreements with state and territory governments, the fee-free component, which is ensuring that enrolments 
are increasing, we are responding to the skill shortages across the economy, not just in that area, but today we are 
focussing on that area. And I believe that, certainly in talking with Mary, she fully understands the pressure that 
parents are under in terms of costs, the pressure that students are under, and that's why we're providing fee-free 
places and understands, too, that we need to be ensuring that we can supply the skilled workforce to an economy 
that is certainly in need of such a supply. It's because of these decisions we are seeing the benefits that are 
happening. And that's why in talking to the students today, it was quite obvious that it was a lot easier for them to 
enter into these courses, acquire these much needed skills, because of the announcement and the decision of the 
Albanese Government, working with state and territory governments, providing fee-free options for them.Page 3 of 6
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023
ANNE ALY, MINISTER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: Thanks, Brendan. It's great to be here this 
morning, of course, with the Prime Minister, with Brendan O'Connor, and our wonderful candidate for Aston, Mary 
Doyle. Mary is a local and she gets it. She gets what families here are going through and she understands the 
importance of early childhood education and care. And, in fact, Mary was saying that her own daughter went locally 
here, accessed early childhood education and care locally here, and still recognises her early childhood education 
teacher at the shopping centre. That's because she's a local. She knows this area, and she understands and values 
early childhood education and care. Now, in just under 100 days, families right across Australia are going to reap 
the benefits of our reforms that are making early childhood education and care more affordable. And we know that 
in order for that to be successful, we need a sustainable workforce. That is why the fee-free TAFE that the 
Albanese Labor Government has introduced is so important. And today, we had the pleasure of meeting students 
like Tiana and Connor who are using that fee-free TAFE. They are saving thousands of dollars and they are the 
future workforce of early childhood education and care, but they're also the current workforce of early childhood 
education and care. Because, as the Prime Minister said, they are working as they are getting their degree in areas 
of skill shortages. We know that our early childhood education and care reforms that make it much more affordable 
for families right across Australia are important, but we're also getting on with the job of ensuring that we have that 
sustainable workforce. And I'm proud to be a part of a Labor Government, I look forward to welcoming Mary Doyle 
as a Member for Aston after the election next week. I know she will make an extremely valuable contribution to the 
Labor Caucus. And I look forward to seeing more students like Tiana and Connor taking advantage of that fee-free 
TAFE, graduating with an Early Childhood Education and Care Certificate, and becoming part of our valuable 
workforce in early childhood education and care.
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, there's a lot of mortgage stress in the Aston area, what can your Government do to 
alleviate some of that?
PRIME MINISTER: Well, what we're doing is having a comprehensive housing policy. There is legislation before the 
Parliament, before the Senate next week, the Housing Australia Future Fund. That has a number of components to 
it. One is an increased investment in social and community housing, which will create 30,000 additional units over 
the next five years. But it also has within it as well, additional funding for emergency housing, some $100 million, 
and it has, as part of that as well, funding specifically for veterans housing, as well as for women and children 
escaping family and domestic violence. That's one element. The other thing we're doing is a housing accord, 
working with the private sector, with organisations like the Master Builders and the Housing Industry Association 
and others, having an accord with state and territory governments to increase the supply of housing. Prices, of 
course, are a product of demand and supply. So, what we want to do is to increase the supply of housing. We also 
have our Housing Supply and Affordability Council is part of the legislation for the Housing Australia Future Fund. 
What that's aimed at doing is working with each level of government to make sure that approvals and land release 
and those issues are dealt with in our outer suburbs in a way that assists people. We recognise that people are 
doing it tough. We are taking action on that. That's the other reason why we're making sure that we put downward 
pressure on inflation. The Reserve Bank Governor, in the statement that he made at the beginning of this month, 
has said that he hoped that inflation had peaked in the December quarter. Of course, the highest inflation rate 
growth of any quarter this century was the March 2022 quarter last year. So, the last full quarter in which the 
Coalition were in office was the highest inflation of any quarter in Australia this century. And that's why, as well, we 
will produce a responsible Budget. That's why we returned 99 per cent of the revenue gains to the Budget in 
October last year. So there's no easy fix here. But we want to work with the Andrews Government to make sure that 
we deal with the housing stress, which is a national phenomenon. That's why we're working with all state and 
territory governments and the private sector. And that's why I'd urge the Senate next week to pass this legislation 
that will make a difference.
JOURNALIST: Do you expect the Premier to join you on the campaign trail in the last week here in Aston?
PRIME MINISTER: I'll be in Parliament next week.
JOURNALIST: Over the weekend maybe?Page 4 of 6
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023
PRIME MINISTER: Well I won't be here over the weekend. There's a couple of elections on, this by-election. This 
afternoon I'll be in Penrith, so a bit of notice for the media, I'll be in Penrith and I'll be in Riverstone this afternoon 
and I'll be in a range of seats tomorrow in my home state of New South Wales, as you would expect.
JOURNALIST: Are you confident Chris Minns will get the job done?
PRIME MINISTER: Chris Minns, I think, will make an outstanding Premier of New South Wales. That's a decision 
for the people of New South Wales. I think, can I say this? I think that Dominic Perrottet and Chris Minns are both 
very good people. They're good human beings. I have a good relationship with both of them and I like both of them. 
The problem is that Dominic Perrottet's Government is a shambles. The Liberals are too busy fighting each other 
and fighting the Nationals, and the Nationals fighting each other, to fight for the people of New South Wales. And 
that's why Chris Minns deserves and his team deserves to be elected to government tomorrow. I'll work with 
whoever is elected it, as I do constructively. I've had liaison with Premier Rockliff this morning. My Government 
actually works for solutions. We look for unity. We don't look for division. The problem with the modern Liberal Party 
is that it is so divided on itself. On itself. I mean, they can't make a decision on constitutional recognition for 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in 2023. If they oppose it, they've got to say. When will that occur? How 
long? Is 122 years not long enough to wait to recognise that our history didn't begin in 1788? The Victorian Liberal 
Party here are a shambles. We've seen them fighting each other. And the Caucus can't make a decision in 
Canberra, in Peter Dutton. That's why we need to send a message to them that they need to do better. They need 
to get their act together. That's why Mary Doyle deserves to be elected as the Member for Aston. If she joins our 
Caucus, she'll join a united, coherent team. A united, coherent team that has plans for our economic growth, that 
has plans for social equity, that has plans for gender equality, that has plans for dealing with the challenge of 
climate change, that supports multiculturalism, that doesn't have to think about these things because it's in our core. 
It's our instinct. And that is what Mary Doyle, that's the team that she will join if she's elected.
JOURNALIST: Do you agree with Linda Burney that Peter Dutton is just looking for excuses to reject the Voice? 
And secondly, will you release the Solicitor-General's advice on the wording?
PRIME MINISTER: Well the two things are connected, because Peter Dutton knows that he sat in a Cabinet for 
nine years and didn't release any advice to the Cabinet. It's not the way it works. And he knows that. He knows that. 
So what we saw from Peter Dutton, over a long period of time, was first in the lead-up to my speech at Garma, he 
said, 'We don't know what the question is.' So, I released draft words. We received not a suggestion in between 
July last year and yesterday when I released what will be in the legislation to go to Parliament next week. Not one 
suggestion from him or Julian Leeser, the Shadow Attorney-General, of any change. Not a word. And Julian Leeser, 
we know, has been involved with the wording since a decade ago. A decade ago. He was one of the people who 
were involved in that process, as Noel Pearson outlined in The Australian some weeks ago. So, Peter Dutton needs 
to get real about this. This isn't about him, and it's not about me. This is about whether we are a better country 
going forward. It's whether we can recognise Indigenous Australians in our nation's birth certificate. And then it's 
only about one other thing, which is will we get better outcomes if we consult the people who are impacted by those 
decisions? That's what this is about. It's a simple proposition before the Australian people, and I'm confident that 
the Australian people will vote yes. And the idea whenever any detail is given, and yesterday we released eight of 
the principles that will go towards the legislation in shaping the Voice. And the Voice can't be clearer, the words that 
will go forward include, the third point, 'The Parliament shall, subject to this constitution, have power to make laws 
with respect to matters relating to', which is a legal term, 'Relating to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice, 
including its composition, functions, powers and procedures'. Peter Dutton will be a part of the Parliament and 
future members will be a part of future Parliaments, that will determine the function of the Voice. And he knows that 
that's the case. And we know from the Republic playbook that occurred last century, that it is nothing more than a 
tactic, and it lacks genuineness to just continue to say 'We don't have the detail'. No matter how much detail is put 
out, Peter Dutton will say, 'What about more detail?' That's the game that's being played here. And he should make 
a decision of where he stands on this issue, because this is an issue that isn't the creation of a Labor Government. 
This has arisen from the bottom up. And yesterday I had Ken Wyatt, who flew overnight to Canberra, the 
Indigenous Affairs Minister in the Morrison Government, to stand next to me and with his fellow Aboriginal and 
Torres Strait Islander people who've been a part of the Referendum Working Group, who've come to a unanimous 
position. And I'd say that this should be above politics as the 1967 referendum was.Page 5 of 6

JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, what economic benefits do you see from the Voice, and do you intend to sit down 
with Mr Dutton before next Thursday to discuss his concerns?
PRIME MINISTER: I sat down with him yesterday. I sat down with him before we did the press conference. Let's be 
very clear, that's the seventh time I have sat down with Peter Dutton. Peter Dutton has met with the Referendum 
Working Group twice. You know what? At those meetings we haven't had questions raised. He's had every 
opportunity. There have been, I think it was Thomas Mayor yesterday, outlined the number of inquiries, details, 
committees that have looked into this over more than a decade. The Uluru Statement from the Heart was in 2017. It 
grew out of a First Nations Constitutional Convention. It grew out of a five-year process from 2012 that began back 
at the end of the last century. John Howard was Prime Minister when he said there needed to be constitutional 
recognition. Scott Morrison went to the election in 2019 and said there should be constitutional recognition. It was 
the Morrison Government that established the committee that Tom Calma and Marcia Langton presided over, with 
people like Chris Kenny and Frank Brennan and a range of people who participated and produced a report that is 
hundreds of pages long. It went to the Cabinet of the Morrison Government, not my Government, not once, but 
twice. The detail is out there. The detail is out there. We need to know, as well, know this, that the programs that 
have been successful, that make a difference for Indigenous people, are ones in which they have been involved. 
Justice reinvestment by the Coalition Government in New South Wales in places like Moree and Bourke, the 
Indigenous Rangers Program, community health programs. Where people are involved, you get better outcomes. 
And that is something that is just a fact, and that is why we had this coming together. Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander people are no less homogeneous than any other group that you want to pick. But what you had yesterday 
was people from different parts of Australia, from different parts of the country, coming together. And, you know, 
the great Galarrwuy Yunupingu, watching it there on Yolngu country in Arnhem Land, watching it, a product of his 
life's work. These people, their patience, their modesty, their humbleness, is inspirational. And they deserve, they 
deserve nothing less than for people to put politics aside and to get this done. And we will give the Australian 
people the opportunity to enlarge our country later this year. And we can be enlarged, or we can shrink. Shrink into 
playing old politics. And that's what people need to consider who are in positions of political leadership on this 
issue.
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, are you worried the wording leaves the door open for High Court challenges? Or are 
you confident that it's as watertight as you say it is?
PRIME MINISTER: I'm absolutely confident. But I'm confident on the basis of people like the former head of the 
High Court, Justice French. He might know something about the Constitution. The leading academic in Australia 
on constitutional law, Professor Anne Twomey, might know something about the Constitution. This hasn't arisen in 
a vacuum. There's been all of this work done by the advisory group to the Referendum Working Group. It's very 
clear that this is a straightforward proposition. People can read it themselves. I just read out the third clause that 
makes it clear that the Parliament is primary. The primacy of the Parliament is there, including its composition, 
functions, powers and procedures. A key word, including. So, all matters, and it says, to matters relating to, matters 
is often used as a legal term as well. And we took proper advice, and I'm very confident you will have an 
opportunity. If you get ten lawyers in a room, you'll often get someone who gets a run in. That's what they're paid to 
do. That's why on different sides, to put this in perspective, that's why on different sides in courts, you have lawyers 
on one side and lawyers on the other side. They're paid to advocate. That's an honourable profession to do. But 
you shouldn't use that fact to say that there's someone out there who disagrees. Someone, I'm sure I can find you a 
lawyer who can tell you that that jacket you're wearing is orange or pink. I can find that for you. Pay them enough, 
that'll happen.
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, just back to Aston. Do you think what's happening internally in the Liberal Party in 
Victoria could actually work in Mary Doyle's favour in regards to Moira Deeming?
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I think the Liberal Party is dysfunctional here. We saw that in the lead-up to the state 
election. We saw that in the way that the Federal Liberal Party people here operate as well. Michael Sukkar was 
pretty desperate to stop the candidate being preselected here for Aston. He didn't have confidence that someone 
from outside the area would be appropriate. I mean, we're a long way from the Melbourne City Council. And I think 
that that's just a fact, that it's a dysfunctional branch. They need to be given time to get their act together. In the Page 6 of 6
DOORSTOP INTERVIEW - MELBOURNE TRANSCRIPT 24 MAR 2023
meantime, we've got a fantastic candidate who secured the unanimous support of everyone, who ran last time, who 
hasn't shopped around for a seat. Who wants to represent this seat, this time after next Saturday. Thanks very 
much.

Confrontations over Gaza make politicians feel unsafe, says minister

Highlight: Anne Aly said the confrontation with pro-Palestinian activists in a park last weekend was not the first, 
but was the most intense clash she had experienced.
Body
Early Education Minister Anne Aly has warned that heightened tensions in the community over the war in Gaza 
have forced some politicians to retreat from public events, following a heated exchange she had with pro-
Palestinian demonstrators in Perth last Saturday.
Footage emerged on Tuesday of Aly - who is one of two Muslim frontbenchers - confronted by pro-Palestine 
activists in her inner-north Perth electorate the previous weekend, demanding she label Israel's retaliatory strikes 
against Gaza since the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack as genocide.

While the protesters raised their voices aggressively, Aly was not physically attacked.
Aly told ABC Radio National on Friday she often holds an open office in the park on weekends for people in her 
electorate who cannot visit her office during working hours. She said the conflict with protesters - organised by 
Friends of Palestine WA - was not the first but was the most intense clash she had experienced.
"Many of my colleagues have faced similar or worse to the point that many of them have had to stop doing open air 
offices, which I think you know, is a real shame for those members of the community who need to have open 
access to their federal members," Aly said.
Since the October 7 attack, multiple ministers including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Defence Minister Richard 
Marles, NDIS Minister Bill Shorten as well as Labor backbencher Peter Khalil had their electorate offices defaced 
with graffiti, signs and fake dead bodies, which Aly believed had a chilling effect on politicians being able to do their 
work.
"When I go out into my community there are a variety of issues that people want to talk to me about," she said.
"The situation in Gaza is also one of those issues that people want me to advocate on and want me to speak up 
about, and so I want to be able to speak up about them."

Confrontations over Gaza make politicians feel unsafe, says minister
The US on Friday (AEDT) announced that it planned to put a resolution calling for an immediate truce in Gaza to a 
vote of the UN Security Council, intensifying pressure on Israel.
Washington, which traditionally has shielded Israel at the UN, has incrementally applied more pressure to its 
longtime ally, and the draft Security Council resolution marked a further toughening.
The shift has coincided with rising global condemnation of the five-month-old war, Palestinian civilian deaths, and 
the prospect of a man-made famine in Gaza.
Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1200 people and taking more than 200 hostages, according to Israeli 
tallies. Israel's offensive since then has killed almost 32,000 Palestinians, according to Hamas-run Gaza health 
authorities.
Australia has since December supported the UN's call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the restoration of 
aid to people trapped in the war zone, but has not explicitly condemned Israel.
Both Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong have said several times that Israel has a right to defend itself.
On October 19, Aly backed senior federal minister Ed Husic, a fellow Muslim, when he said Palestinians were being 
"collectively punished for Hamas' barbarism".
Aly said there were greater expectations placed on herself and other Muslim MPs.
"I've actually had Muslim leaders sending me messages of support and one of them yesterday said, 'you know, to 
be honest, it is because you're a Muslim woman, you're copping more than anyone else'," she said.
"I wouldn't want to say it's just because of that, but I do think that there are certain expectations on me."
Aggressive and violent incidents involving federal MPs have been under the spotlight previously, when in 2019 a 
bipartisan group of parliamentarians warned that Australia's increasingly toxic political debate could lead to tragic 
consequences.
Earlier this week, Liberal senator and former ambassador to Israel Dave Sharma warned of lasting damage to 
society from a rise in threats to Jewish Australians and other minorities, declaring that everyone would lose if 
nothing was done to stop mob attacks.
Friends of Palestine Western Australia have been contacted for comment.

Senior Labor MPs have been sworn into the new cabinet at Government House in Canberra on Wednesday 
morning, touted by Anthony Albanese as the most experienced frontbench line-up since federation.A record 10 
women have been sworn into cabinet, and a total of 13 female ministers have been appointed to the ministry 
overall.
There is also a record number of MPs from ethnic backgrounds in the new ministry, including Anne Aly and Ed 
Husic who are the first Muslim-Australians in a ministry.Linda Burney is also the first Indigenous female to hold the 
Indigenous portfolio, with Malarndirri McCarthy as assistant Minister and Pat Dodson given a role as special envoy 
for the Uluru Statement from the Heart.Tanya Plibersek has been sworn into the environment and water portfolios. 
A former leadership rival to Anthony Albanese, the Prime Minister has denied the move is a demotion.
The ceremony comes after Labor secured a majority government on Tuesday, claiming the 77 out of 151 seats 
allowing it to govern in its own right. The swearing in was briefly interrupted when a phone rang as MP Kristy 
McBain was shaking Governor General David Hurley's hand, playing the riff of the 1987 INXS hit 'Need You 
Tonight'. The Prime Minister joked: "Can ministers not bring soundtracks, please".
Mr Albanese said during the election campaign he intended to maintain the same team as in shadow ministry 
during the Morrison government's tenure, which has largely remained true.
The new ministry was sworn in before Mr Albanese flies to Indonesia on Sunday.
Mr Albanese on Tuesday addressed Labor senators and MPs at the first federal caucus since the party won the 
federal election."I want to remind you that you shouldn't waste a day in government. We don't intend to," he said.
After posing for a variety of family photos on the steps of Government House, the new ministers will head into 
briefings this afternoon followed by a Cabinet meeting tonight.

Highlight: If there is such a thing as a traditional path into parliament, Australia's first Muslim federal female 
politician did not take it.
Body
Within minutes of sitting down for lunch with Anne Aly, she has invited me to join her for lemon chicken tagine at 
her house next time I am in Perth.
And just moments later I seem to have crossed some unspoken social convention by asking her if she has ADHD. 
She hasn't.
One thing is for sure, there will not be too many barriers standing in the way of a free-ranging conversation. Which 
is just as well because so far, things aren't going according to plan.

Tracey Nearmy
We had arranged to meet at Zeytin Turkish Cuisine on the foreshore of Lake Burley Griffin. 
But when I show up at noon sharp, not a sign of life.
I'm busily texting Aly's people when, luckily, we run into each other - Canberra is a small place - so we amble a few 
metres along until we come to a cafe on the corner that seems, well, convenient.
We grab a table outside and Aly immediately launches into a monologue about how to make a lemon chicken 
tagine which involves soaking the tagine pot in a bath for 24 hours, rubbing it with oil and then cooking the middle-
eastern deliciousness for another 24 hours in a very low oven.
We are scanning the menu and Aly announces she "doesn't do rice" which is a staple of middle eastern cuisine and 
which make her some sort of pariah at family events. She opts for the grilled fennel chicken (no butter please) and a 
very hot almond milk cappuccino. I choose the zucchini fritters and a bean-a-colada, which, disappointingly has 
neither booze nor beans.
Aly, let it be said, is prone to the odd swear word, as am I, and over the next 60 minutes our conversation is 
peppered with F-bombs.
Page 2 of 5
Anne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics
The thrice-married Aly had already lived a complex and somewhat haphazard life before she decided rather 
spontaneously to run as the Labor candidate for the West Australian seat Cowan in 2016. She managed to turf out 
the Liberal incumbent Luke Simpkins by the finest of margins.
"It took 10 days to count the vote," she says.
In 2019, she increased her margin and by 2022 she harnessed 46.9 per cent of the vote adding more than 9 per 
cent to her 2019 numbers.
Of that first campaign, she remembers standing at a train station with a picture of herself while waving at cars. A 
year ago to the day, she had been invited to speak at the White House at a countering terrorism conference.
"All I could think was from the White House to Greenwood station. What have I done?"
The migrant experience
Aly was born Azza Mahmoud Fawzi Hosseini Ali el Serougi in Alexandria, Egypt in 1967. The daughter of a nurse 
and a textiles engineer who immigrated to Australia in 1969. They were among the last migrants to be received at 
the Bonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre in Albury Wodonga - which, having made the world's 
headlines two decades earlier over the death from malnutrition of 13 children, had improved conditions 
considerably.
The family moved first to Marrickville in Sydney's inner west and then, just on the cusp of shifting to Texas, they 
relocated to Brisbane where Aly's dad got a job with the Jennings factory, which produced corsets and women's 
underwear.
They bought their first house in the very un-chi chi West End.
"And then in 1974 came the flood. My parents came from a desert country, they had never seen anything like this," 
Aly says.
"But it was a defining feature of our Australian story because what we found was a community. It was almost like 
they became Australian through the tragedy."
The 'rational, calming voice'
Moments like that, she says, stand in stark contrast to other moments of division and rancour that have 
characterised the same-sex marriage plebiscite, the Voice referendum and uncontained racism following the 9/11 
attacks in New York.
The current situation in Gaza is confronting, she says. Aly joined Ed Husic last month to warn Gaza's 2.3 million 
residents were being "collectively punished" for the crimes of terrorists.
As the Israel-Gaza war becomes more divisive, Aly says she is trying to demonstrate how "important it is that we 
recognise each other's humanity and show compassion to each other even when we are hurting the most".
" I've spoken and met with the Muslim community and members of the Jewish community. And what I say is to 
communities here, who have intergenerational trauma, and accumulative trauma and who are hurting, is that 
sometimes the hardest thing to do is to be the rational, calming voice in a room of people who are hurting so much 
that the only thing that they can do is shout," she says.
The problem with early childhood
As the minister for early childhood education, and also the minister for youth, Aly has a lot on her plate as she 
marshalls through two reviews of the childcare and early learning sectors.Page 3 of 5
Anne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics
The government is moving, slowly, towards adopting a model of universal access. In July, it increased the 
maximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning up to $80,000 and a sliding scale in subsidies for every 
family earning less than $530,000.
"The fact is Australia is one of the most expensive places for early childhood education and care," says Aly.
"We have a quality system that is world-class, and a quality framework that has been in place for 10 years. The 
issue is the cost and the fact that the market isn't behaving the way you would expect. It doesn't go to where the 
demand is, it goes to where the money is."
The delivery of the Productivity Commission report this week and the Australian Competition and Consumer 
Commission's investigation will ensure childcare remains one of the hot button issues for the Albanese government 
in coming months.
One of the problems the government has commissioned the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to 
address is price gouging, which could see the benefits of more generous subsidies to parents whittled away to zero 
by higher fees.
"We're going to be watching. People who are making a lot of money out of early childhood education and care at 
the expense of it being affordable and accessible for parents need to know we are watching," Aly says.
She says the complexity of the system ranging from ASX-listed corporations to mum-and-dad small businesses, 
make it difficult to navigate but that her goal is to find a system "that works for everyone".
"That could mean different kinds of service delivery in different areas and even different kinds of services. But it's 
where parents are confident of the quality and safety for their children."
A face you'll know
Aly will be familiar to most people, even if they haven't connected the name to the face. She is the petite dark-
haired, dark-eyed woman in colourful clothing who sits behind Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during question 
time. Aly is an active listener. She nods. She laughs. She scowls and boos. She never drifts off or checks her 
phone.
Always impeccably well-dressed, Aly's choice of clothing has taken a twist in the past couple of years as she took 
up crochet and knitting as a form of meditation and mindfulness as she takes endless flights between Canberra and 
Perth.
The white jumper she wears to lunch is handcrafted (and has a matching skirt) as was the crochet long dress to this 
year's Mid-Winter Ball. She is already working on next year's which will feature a crocheted flower, each unique, 
representing every woman who died from domestic violence during the year.

"Then I will auction it off for a domestic violence charity," she says.
Aly has her own story of domestic violence, one that is told in her 2018 autobiography Finding My Place: From 
Cairo to Canberra - the irresistible story of an irrepressible woman.
She had married young, at the age of 20, while living back in Egypt where she was studying English literature, with 
a minor in acting. The marriage wasn't arranged, as was common for girls like her. Rather, it was a way of escaping 
the strictures of being a single woman in a Muslim country.
"The marriage gave me a freedom that I didn't have living under my parents' roof. It gave me the freedom to be a 
respectable married woman in Egypt. It meant I could go camping with friends, I could go to parties, I could come 
home when I wanted to."Page 4 of 5
Anne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics
There were red flags which she ignored - or didn't know any better.
But after moving to Perth, the violence and contemptuous behaviour escalated.
"There was a bit of martyrdom on my behalf. But there are a lot of stereotypes around women who are survivors, a 
lot of us are high achievers. The feelings of responsibility and humiliation; we expect more of ourselves," she says.
"I remember driving away once and saying out loud to myself: 'you must be just the kind of woman that men hit'. I'd 
resigned myself to it.
"I describe domestic violence as this crack in a bone somewhere in your body that you carry with you through your 
life.
"It's hard to imagine myself as the person I was. I'm much more like me now than I was back then."
She finally kicked him out of the family home after six long years and began the next chapter as a broke single mum 
of two young sons, Karim and Adam. They only found out about the history of abuse when they read the 
autobiography.
Keeping hearth and home together with a string of unskilled jobs, she retreated to her safe space: education. In all, 
she has four degrees, including a masters in education and a PhD on counter-terrorism and security.
Which, to circle back, might help explain the inappropriate ADHD comment, having completed the two-year masters 
in nine months and the PhD in two years - which typically take four to seven years.
"I'd put the boys to bed, study until 3 or 4 am and then get up at 7am."
That led to another chapter, as a world-renowned researcher and eventually professor specialising in countering 
online violent extremism. It also got her invited to Oxford University and the White House to speak.
Her political spark was ignited after the rise of anti-Muslim sentiment across the world, witnessing one-too-many 
instances of casual racism in suburban Perth, and becoming a target of death threats because of her profile as a 
researcher in anti-terrorism.
"Some days I felt broken and beaten by it all - by the death threats and the calls to 'hang [her] from a tree', 'drown 
her in pig's blood' and 'put a bullet in the bag'," she writes in her autobiography.
The university moved her team to unidentified offices twice during the course of a year with strict instruction not to 
reveal the location.
A lot left unsaid
I have set aside 90 minutes for lunch, but after an hour a staffer taps Aly on the shoulder and says we have five 
minutes to wrap it up.
Heavens, we haven't even got on to husband number two, or heaven forbid Dave Allen, who is husband number 
three. (He is a Canadian-born former ice-hockey player, policeman and intelligence officer who she met while 
working in the WA public service and married in 2012).
We need to talk more about childcare, whether the big for-profit corporates are price gouging, why the market is 
failing (and what to do about it).
We need to talk about the experience of working as a woman in Parliament House and whether she has witnessed 
or been subjected to misogynistic or sexist behaviour (she has).
Ten minutes later, there is another tap on the shoulder. She really must go, her next appointment is unmovable.Page 5 of 5
Anne Aly reinvented herself many times. And then came politics
I feel a bit cheated. It's been a rollicking fun lunch. I will be knocking on her door for lemon chicken tagine next time 
I'm in Perth.

Highlight: Pressure is building on the Labor government over its stance on Gaza, with Labor minister Anne Aly 
confronted by pro-Palestinian activists who attended a constituent meeting on the weekend and new polling 
showing the extent of community anger.
Body
Muslim voters are turning against the Labor government over its stance on the war in Gaza, new polling has 
revealed, as a video released on social media shows Labor frontbencher Anne Aly being harassed by pro-
Palestinian activists.
Five months into the conflict, polling group Redbridge ran two focus groups with 18 people from the Arabic and 
Turkish communities in the Labor heartland seat of Calwell in Melbourne and found they were ready to swing hard 
against the government. 
It comes as footage of a heated clash between Labor MP Anne Aly and pro-Palestinian activists who attended a 
meet and greet she held with constituents in Perth on the weekend was posted to Facebook.
The footage reveals how the conflict has boiled over into Australian communities, with MPs getting extra federal 
police resources to ensure they can do their jobs.
'A sense of betrayal'
At the 2021 census, 813,392 people identified as Muslim and they are an increasingly important voting bloc in 
Australia, particularly in some seats.
Kos Samaras, who used to run campaigns for Labor and is now a director of Redbridge, said the anger among 
voters in the focus groups was intense, with many saying they could no longer support the Labor Party.
Page 2 of 3

Labor
He added, however, that participants held greater disdain for the Liberal Party and said they would prefer to vote 
independent.
In Calwell, 13 per cent of the electorate has Middle Eastern ancestry and local member Maria Vamvakinou's margin 
has already been slashed by 8 percentage points in the past few elections.
"For both female and male participants, the Labor government's response to the conflict in Gaza is a reminder of 
why they, as a community, have decided to stop voting Labor. Both groups share a sense of betrayal by Labor, over 
several years, economically and now via the conflict in Gaza," Mr Samaras said.
He told ABC News female participants were, qualitatively, angrier than their male counterparts in their attitudes 
around the government's response to the conflict.
He said the women in the group described consistent and long-term experiences of racism, such as stares and 
comments in public about "how you dress" or family members being knocked back on job applications because of 
the perception of their ethnicity and religion.
The men, by contrast, were far more comfortable that racism was improving in Melbourne, and none described 
experiencing any systemic discrimination.
Mr Samaras said the women see a long-term abandonment of their local communities — not just their religious 
community — by all governments, of all persuasions.
"The simmering rage from these experiences/perceptions now finds a lightning rod in the Gaza conflict — it 
becomes totemic of both the discrimination they face and the perceived neglect of 'people like them' by 
governments," he said.
But incumbency is still a factor and local member Ms Vamvakinou — herself an immigrant from Greece — was 
singled out by participants as someone who respects them and their culture.
"Numerous participants, unprompted, also made it clear that they would find it hard voting against Labor whilst she 
was there. Their references to the local MP were more profound as many participants constantly listed examples of 
how Labor tends to only have MPs from non-diverse backgrounds," Mr Samaras said.
Ms Vamvakinou told the ABC that seats like hers have shown, over the past few elections, "a willingness to send all 
politicians a clear message" that they should not be taken for granted.
"Hence why I work tirelessly to ensure that all parts of my electorate are represented — and that this representation 
extends to not just local issues," she said.
"I have a long history in working for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and will continue to do so. I'm heartened 
that parts of my community are aware of this work. However, it's clear that voters in electorates like mine from 
diverse communities are far more politically alert as to who represents them than ever before."
Mr Samaras said that as the federal election looms and the war in Gaza continues to disrupt the political scene, 
particularly in seats where constituents have strong links to the Middle East, Labor must be cautious about 
potentially parachuting in outsiders who don't have diverse backgrounds and links with the community.
Fiery confrontation in Perth
The focus group results came as video emerged of Labor frontbencher and Muslim woman Dr Anne Aly being 
harassed by protesters, demanding she call what is happening in Gaza a genocide.Page 3 of 3

In the video of the clash, which occurred on Saturday at a reserve in the Perth suburb of Stirling, Dr Aly was 
approached by pro-Palestinian protesters who asked about malnutrition in Gaza and Labor's decision to cut 
UNWRA funding, which the government had overturned the day before.
The conversation became heated, with both sides talking over each other, switching between English and Arabic.
Plain-clothes police officers interrupted and escorted Dr Aly and her team away, as protesters chanted "will you call 
it genocide?" and "ceasefire now".
Dr Aly told the ABC she will not be stopped despite the activism she faces at community events.
"I hold these events so that people in my community can have an opportunity to come and speak with me. I'll 
continue to do that. This kind of behaviour won't stop me," she said. 
Patricia Karvelas is the presenter of Q+A, which returns tonight at 9.35pm on ABC TV, RN Breakfast and 
co-host of the Party Room podcast.

Highlight: A childcare operator was given the power to allocate more than half a billion dollars in federal funding 
set aside for children with disabilities, without any public record of how the money was spent.
Body
A childcare operator was given the power to allocate more than half a billion dollars in federal funding set aside 
from 2016 to 2023 for children with disabilities, without any public record of how the money was spent.
A 7.30 investigation uncovered the arrangement between the Department of Education and KU Children's Services 
after families and childcare centres raised concerns about being denied funding.
The investigation also identified potential conflicts of interest resulting from one childcare service approving 
payments to its competitors, as well as other services it had commercial arrangements with.
Established in 2016, the Inclusion Support Program (ISP) helps children with additional needs access early 
childhood education by funding additional educators, providing specialist equipment and training staff.
The program currently supports more than 23,000 children who would otherwise have a hard time accessing early 
education.
The Department of Education oversees the ISP, but for the past eight years has contracted private operators to run 
it.
One of the core functions of the program is to help childcare centres hire additional educators to support children 
with disability.
To do this, the government made more than $562 million available to subsidise the salaries of childcare workers.

Government allowed private organisation to hand out more than half a billion dollars of public money
KU Children's Services (KU) is a not-for-profit organisation which in 2016 won the government tender to manage 
that particular fund.￿
Government contracts, like those with KU, are signed with private operators after they have won a bidding process 
to provide the most competitive offering.
Government grants, like those paid to the daycare services, offer financial assistance to entities with the intention of 
achieving policy outcomes.
Greens senator Barbara Pocock was recently part of a Senate inquiry into consultancy firms, which examined how 
government outsourced work to private enterprise.
She said programs like the ISP were an important function of government and that contracting out their 
administration was "not the right thing to do".
"It is government business to allocate and manage its big programs like this one," Senator Pocock said.
"Those services need to be provided, but they need to be provided in ways where taxpayers can be confident that 
we're getting value for money."
In a statement, KU CEO Chris Legg said the organisation processed funding applications within the designated 
guidelines, and was one of several reputable early childhood organisations facilitating the program.
"KU has a strong commitment to the inclusion of all children in early childhood education," she said.
Lack of transparency
Details of how the $562 million grant was disbursed have never been made publicly available, but were instead 
reported by the department as a single grant to KU.
Director of the Centre for Public Integrity Geoffrey Watson said it was "disgraceful" there was no transparency over 
how the money was spent.
"The point is we need to know why and how this money is being allocated," Mr Watson said.
Commonwealth legislation requires all government grants and variations to those grants be reported on government 
site, GrantConnect.
The site shows the grant was first approved in May 2016 for $93.6 million and had ballooned to $562.8 million by 
2023.
The department told 7.30 the grant grew in value to meet increasing demand for inclusion support from early 
childhood education services. 
When asked in Senate Estimates this month whether payments from the fund had been reported anywhere, 
Department of Education assistant secretary Anne Twyman said KU held the detail "for accountability purposes".
In its 2022-23 annual report, the Department of Education acknowledged that the handling of the grant was a matter 
of "significant non-compliance" and said "appropriate processes" had since been put in place.  
The department also told 7.30 KU did not directly receive any of the funding because payments went directly to 
childcare services.
According to the statement, "the IT system used to administer the [subsidy] requires the subsidy to be linked to KU 
Children's Services and is a system reporting mechanism".Page 3 of 4
Government allowed private organisation to hand out more than half a billion dollars of public money
KU and the department initially told 7.30 that in KU's capacity as fund manager, it did not approve applications from 
childcare operators seeking to subsidise more support staff.
A government spokesperson also told 7.30 applications were assessed by KU as the fund manager and then 
approved by the department.
However, the department has since confirmed that from May 2016 until August 2023, KU was contracted to 
approve grants on behalf of the government.
The department raised the issue in its 2022-23 annual report, noting "grant agreements were entered into by a third 
party under a contractual arrangement, but without appropriate delegations in place."
KU was told to stop making grant decisions in August 2023. Education Minister Jason Clare and Minister for Early 
Childhood Education Anne Aly￿were notified of the problem the following month.
Both the department and KU have confirmed the childcare operator is no longer approving grants.
Potential conflicts of interest
As well as approving grants from 2016 to 2023, KU operated childcare services that could apply for that funding.
Mr Watson said the possibility that it could approve grants to its own services posed one conflict of interest, and that 
it could assess applications from its commercial competitors posed another.
"This is public money. The public is entitled to know that it's been properly spent and when these sorts of conflicts 
emerge, you avoid them," he said.
In a statement, KU told 7.30 "clear conflict of interest protocols and policies are in place to ensure quality, 
consistency and fairness for all service providers".
The Department of Education said that to mitigate conflicts of interest, KU's funding applications were processed by 
a third party, not-for-profit childcare operator Big Fat Smile.
7.30 can reveal that during that time, KU had a commercial arrangement with a division of Big Fat Smile to run part 
of the ISP in NSW and the ACT.
7.30 can also reveal Big Fat Smile was contracted directly to KU to approve funding applications from KU-run 
childcare centres.
Mr Watson said that was ridiculous.
"It's a complex of conflicts of interest," he said.
"That's just wrong."
He said the program was not functional in its current form, and wanted it referred to the National Office of the 
Auditor General.
Senator Pocock agreed the program needed to be scrutinised.
"It is vital [the services] be provided with proper review and evaluation and knowing that the right money is going to 
the right places with the best outcome for our kids," she said.
Value for money
While investigating the program, 7.30 also found the contracts to run the program had not been put out for retender 
during the eight years it had been operating.Page 4 of 4
Government allowed private organisation to hand out more than half a billion dollars of public money
The government initially agreed to pay KU $8.3 million to run the fund, but as the program was extended that 
contract was amended 12 times until it was eventually worth $32.3 million.￿
Likewise, contracts with other services to run parts of the program in each state and territory were amended six 
times.￿
According to the Auditor General, in the decade between 2010 and 2022, only 17 per cent of government contracts 
were amended at least once, and only three per cent of those more than five times.￿
Mr Watson said government contracts should be regularly reviewed to see if other providers could offer better value 
for money.
"The most effective test for efficiency … is to see whether somebody else will provide the same services more 
cheaply," he said.
The Department of Education said continuation of existing contracts, rather than reopening tenders, "ensured 
ongoing inclusion support for children attending [early childhood education centres]."
In a statement, Minister for Early Childhood Education Anne Aly said she received briefings from the department 
that assured her the department was acting in accordance with Commonwealth Procurement rules including 
considering whether the amendments ensured value for money.
KU's CEO Chris Legg said the organisation had never approached the department for a variation of its contract as 
fund manager.
She said the department had offered KU variations to the initial contracts, which it accepted.

Highlight: We analysed the educational backgrounds of all 226 federal politicians in Australia - and found they 
aren't particularly representative of the broader population.
Body
Just how educated are our federal politicians? The Greens, for example, have the highest proportion of PhDs 
among those who represent us at Parliament House.
The Coalition, on the other hand, has the highest proportion of members who went to a private school. But unlike 
the privately schooled population, who are more likely to go to university than those who go to government schools, 
only a small proportion of Coalition members went on to gain a degree.

TheAustralian Financial Review has analysed the educational backgrounds of all 226 federal politicians in 
Australia, which encompasses the 151 MPs and 75 senators currently in office. Are they representative of the 
broader population? This is what we found.
How many of our politicians attended university?
Our politicians are overall a highly educated cohort - 77 per cent have a bachelor's degree or higher.
This figure is significantly greater than the national average, with Australian Bureau of Statistics data showing just 
32 per cent of all Australians have graduated from university.
So why is there a remarkably high percentage of university graduates in parliament?
Is it because people with an interest in politics or policy are more likely to go to university or is it that they get 
politicised while there? John Howard, when prime minister, certainly thought it was the latter, when in 2005 he 
banned students from automatically becoming members of the student unions because he saw it as a breeding 
ground for hot-headed lefties and socialists.
John Hawkins, a political historian from the University of Canberra, says the opposite is most likely the case.
"I suspect it's the other way around; that people who are interested in political ideas and policy are more likely to 
want to go to university," Hawkins says.
Page 2 of 4
Our most and least educated politicians, in six charts
Our analysis reveals that 83.5 per cent of Labor politicians have at least one degree compared to 68.6 per cent of 
Coalition members.
Paul Strangio, emeritus professor of politics at Monash University, said the prevalence of politicians with degrees in 
history, politics, sociology and law makes sense.
"There's a certain synchronicity. These degrees teach people analytical skills, as well as strong written and verbal 
communication skills. Arguably, there's a good match-up with the role of a politician," he says.
Certainly, universities are where many politicians get their first taste of politics and activism.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is one such example. He was prominent in campus politics during his time at the 
University of Sydney, which culminated in his presidency of NSW Young Labor and later as a rising political staffer.
Simon Birmingham, leader of the opposition in the Senate, was president of the Adelaide University Liberal Club in 
1993, and was a key member of Young Liberals in South Australia for most of the 1990s. He later became an 
electorate officer for Senator Robert Hill.
It goes to show that the path from student politics to staffer to MP is well-trodden.
There are countless politicians who cut their teeth in student politics. Opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was chair of 
the Bayside Young Liberals in 1990. As a student, Tony Burke, minister for industrial relations, was the president of 
Australian Young Labor. Foreign affairs minister Penny Wong was heavily involved in the Labor Club at Adelaide 
University and served on the national executive of the National Union of Students.
And that's just for starters.
Which universities produce the most politicians?
The institution that has produced the most of our federal politicians is the University of Sydney, closely followed by 
the universities of Melbourne and Queensland.
Universities in the Group of Eight (Go8) dominate the ranking, taking up eight out of 10 spots on the list.
John Hawkins makes the simple point: "These are the main universities in the states with the biggest populations."
But he adds they are also the institutions most likely to offer degrees in law, economics, history and philosophy, and 
also the most likely to offer double-degrees, which are a popular choice among the political classes.
For some, however, the prevalence of degrees from Group of Eight universities is emblematic of entrenched elitism 
and social division in the broader population.
Glenn Savage, associate professor of education policy at the University of Melbourne, has compared Australia's 
"highly inequitable" education system to an "ecosystem" with flow-on effects that influence an individual's tertiary 
study and, ultimately, employment.
"It's natural that young people who have more advantageous circumstances will end up in more advantageous 
positions," he says.
What are our politicians most likely to study?
Although parliament largely consists of highly educated politicians, it's a bit more monochrome when it comes to 
what they studied - mostly arts and humanities.
About 40 per cent of federal politicians studied arts at university, which was by a long shot the most popular degree. 
A double arts-law degree was also common, with 27 politicians, or 12 per cent, graduating with that particular 
combination.Page 3 of 4
Our most and least educated politicians, in six charts
Clare O'Neil, Brendan O'Connor. Bill Shorten, Michelle Rowland, Julian Leeser, Anika Wells, Zoe McKenzie, Angus 
Taylor, Adam Bandt and Andrew Gee are just a few of the current crop of politicians with double degrees.
There is a range of majors under the broader umbrella of arts.
Senator Katy Gallagher studied in political science and sociology. Labor frontbencher Anne Aly majored in English 
literature, with a minor in acting. Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather and transport minister Catherine King studied 
history and social work respectively.
Only 20 politicians (or 9 per cent of parliament) are qualified in science or engineering. Seven studied medicine, 
including independents Monique Ryan and Sophie Scamps. One - Emma McBride - did pharmacy. Greens MP 
Elizabeth Watson-Brown is an architect.
Savage says arts degrees, in particular law, politics, and other humanities, "lend themselves very well to producing 
the kinds of knowledge and skill sets which would prove useful for a politician".
"These degrees would also expose students to theories into social dynamics that are of direct relevance to the 
political and policy process," he says.
Strangio says that the lack of politicians with expertise and backgrounds in STEM "may be a disadvantage for some 
workings of parliament in terms of committee work, where politicians really need to get into the nitty-gritty of policy".
"However, fundamentally, it's a highly educated cohort. They probably have the skill sets in terms of research 
capacities and written communication skills," he says.
Gavin Moodie, adjunct professor at the University of Toronto's Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, says public 
policy would be better served if it was "more informed by technology, science and engineering, because our current 
and future challenges will be scientific and technological: climate change, health, and technological change."
And only five politicians have studied education. This includes Sue Lines, president of the Senate, as well as Labor 
MP Ged Kearney.
Who are our most educated politicians?
Proportionally, the Greens are the most formally educated party overall, with three out of 15 party members - 20 per 
cent - holding PhDs.
Adam Bandt completed his PhD in political science at Monash while working part-time at law firm Slater & Gordon. 
His thesis was "Work to Rule: Rethinking Pashukanis, Marx and Law."
There are seven Labor politicians with PhDs - or 6.8 per cent of the party. Treasurer Jim Chalmers wrote his thesis 
on former prime minister Paul Keating, titled "Brawler statesman: Paul Keating and prime ministerial leadership in 
Australia."
Others Labor PhD holders include Anne Aly, Andrew Charlton, Andrew Leigh and Daniel Mulino.
Independent Helen Haines and Nationals MP Anne Webster also hold PhDs.
In total, the percentage of federal politicians with a PhD is 5.4 per cent - much higher than the 0.7 per cent of the 
Australian population (185,000 people) with PhDs.
Strangio says that having highly educated politicians is a good thing.
"Legislation is complex. The issues they are dealing with are complex, and higher education can be an advantage."
Who are our least educated politicians?Page 4 of 4
Our most and least educated politicians, in six charts
It turns out that higher education is not the only way to become a politician, with a sizeable chunk of politicians 
choosing an alternate pathway to Parliament House.
Almost one in four politicians (23 per cent) did not graduate from university, while 3 per cent never finished high 
school.
The least formally educated politicians come from the Coalition, with some entering the workforce as teenagers. 
This is despite the majority of them attending private schools.
Warren Entsch, left school at age 14, following his father into the Queensland railway department as a junior porter. 
Entsch was originally tasked with being the chief toilet cleaner of the Mareeba railway station.
West Australian senator Dorinda Cox joined the WA police force as a cadet at age 17. She was an Aboriginal police 
liaison officer working on the frontlines, specialising in family violence and sexual assault.
David Pocock became a professional footballer at age 17, Rob Mitchell left after year 10 to do a shoe-making 
apprenticeship, and Luke Howarth has a certificate III in pest management and a diploma in business.
Dr Sally Patfield, a lecturer at the University of Newcastle's School of Education, says having a range of educational 
backgrounds in parliament is beneficial.
"Politicians bring a diverse range of perspectives and opinions both in terms of their own background, and the 
people they represent in Australia. It's important to have these experiences being represented, as it is more 
reflective of the Australian population," she says.
Hawkins, however, says it is reassuring to have a political cohort who is more educated than the general 
population. "You would want them to be smarter than the general public. Ideally, you'd want them to be more 
honest and trustworthy as well," Hawkins says.
Where did our politicians go to school?
Almost three in five politicians (57 per cent) were educated at private schools. In comparison, ABS data shows that 
36 per cent of all students across Australia are enrolled in independent or private schools.
Just one politician - Greens senator Jordon Steele-John - was homeschooled.
Are there any conclusions to be drawn from this? Hawkins says it shows how old-fashioned notions of the make-up 
of political parties no longer hold true.
"Labor has traditionally been seen as the party of blue-collar workers, while the Liberals were seen as posh private 
school kids. That's increasingly not the case."

Big pay increase for early childcare workers
Big pay increase for early childcare workers

Length: 721 words
Highlight: Childcare workers will get a huge bump to their pay packets by Christmas, with the federal government 
agreeing to fund a 15 per cent pay increase for workers, but it's conditional.
Body
Stephanie Smail: Childcare workers have welcomed a significant pay increase, saying it will help address the staff 
shortages that have been plaguing the sector. The federal government has announced a 15% wage increase to be 
rolled out over 12 months from this December. Advocates say the bump in pay is also a major step forward for 
gender equity, as Kathleen Ferguson reports.
Anthony Albanese: What do you think about my drawing, Ned? Do you think it's good?
Kathleen Ferguson: The Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, has a crack at some of the crafts which help nurture 
the country's young.
Anthony Albanese: Hey, what do you reckon?
Opinion: That looks weird. Can I have a look? Can I have a look, Tom?
Kathleen Ferguson: He visited the Sydney Early Childcare Centre after announcing a 15% pay increase for the 
sector's workers.
Anthony Albanese: They deserve more than our thanks. They deserve decent wages and conditions.
Kathleen Ferguson: Under the deal, workers will get 10% by this Christmas and a further 5% by December next 
year. It equates to around an extra $100 a week and will cost $3.6 billion. Karen Moran is a long-time educator.
Karen Moran: This decision today will change people's lives. It means that early childhood educators who've been 
relying on Food Bank to feed their own families won't have to do that anymore. And those that work two and three 
jobs just to make ends meet will be able to spend more time with their families.

Big pay increase for early childcare workers
Kathleen Ferguson: But the deal is conditional. In order to receive the pay bump, childcare centres will have to 
limit their fee increases to 4.4% during the next 12 months. The Minister for Early Childcare, Education and Youth, 
Dr Anne Aly, says the sector's role in society is critical.
Dr Anne Aly: We know that brain development is... 90% of brain development occurs in those first five years. This 
is not babysitting, this is not wiping bums and noses. This is education. We see you, we hear you, we acknowledge 
you. We know the vital and professional work that you do.
Kathleen Ferguson: The early childcare sector says it's been a long and hard-fought battle. Georgie Dent is the 
CEO of advocacy group The Parenthood.
Georgie Dent: This is a long overdue recognition of the incredible contribution that early childhood educators make 
to our children, to our communities, to families. It is such a fantastic achievement.
Kathleen Ferguson: Georgie Dent says this pay increase is desperately needed to combat a worker shortage in 
the sector, which is mostly made up of women.
Georgie Dent: The sector is overjoyed. This has been a long-realised dream. We have known that early childhood 
educators have been chronically underpaid and undervalued. We have seen in recent years the accelerating exit of 
early educators from the sector, which has put incredible pressure on services.
Kathleen Ferguson: This is an interim measure which will be in place for two years while the federal government 
reviews the sector. The federal education minister, Jason Clare, says it will be up to childcare centres and providers 
to sign on to the scheme. And he says if centres don't sign up, they should be prepared to lose staff to competitors.
Jason Clare: This is a cost-of-living win-win. It's good for workers and it's good for parents. And at its heart, this is 
good for education, for the next generation, setting our kids up for success.
Kathleen Ferguson: Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor supports higher wages but says bringing down inflation is 
the best way to increase pay.
Angus Taylor: Well, we want to see higher real wages, which means lower prices for everything, for all Australians, 
PK. And we'll look at the detail of this proposal that Labor's putting forward. If it can raise real wages for Australians, 
of course we're going to support it. That's our position.
Kathleen Ferguson: The United Workers Union says the increase sends a strong message to women. Jo 
Schofield is the union's national president.
Jo Schofield: Just this week, we did a survey that showed 60% of educators wanted to leave within three years. 
97% of centres have seen educators walk out in the last year, and the single factor in that is the low pay.
Kathleen Ferguson: She says while the union will continue advocating for better pay and conditions, this is a good 
start.

Body
The groundwork for a complete overhaul of the childcare system will be mapped out on Friday to set Australian 
children on a better path for life.
In a sign the government is preparing to tackle barriers to childcare affordability and accessibility, the responsible 
minister Anne Aly said the entire system has to change.

"It's incredibly exciting because you think about the ability to change a child's life. What could be more important 
than that?" the minister for early childhood education said.
The government is holding an early years summit on Friday, bringing together experts in the field to discuss current 
issues and what the government should do to overhaul its approach to children broadly, and early childhood 
education more specifically.
UNICEF Australia's chief advocate for children, Nicole Breeze, said removing or radically adjusting the activity test, 
which requires a family seeking a subsidised early childhood care place to show they have a certain amount of work 
or study, would be an easy way to quickly boost the number of children getting care.
"We need bold and ambitious reforms if we are to shift the dial and ensure all Australian children have a fair start in 
life," she said.
The government's childcare subsidy, which will kick in from July 1 and cost $5.4 billion over four years, will boost 
the base rate of the government share of the cost from 85 per cent to 90 per cent and reduce the extent to which 
subsidy is withdrawn as family incomes rise.
At last year's job's summit, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews pointed to childcare reform as "perhaps the biggest 
lever that we can pull, the biggest contribution that we can make to economic prosperity".

'What could be more important?': Government flags major childcare reforms to give kids best start
The Productivity Commission will soon start examining reform options in its wide-ranging investigation into the 
sector, which will also look at barriers to access, learning outcomes and how it contributes to economic growth and 
productivity.

Launching the review, Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Education Minister Jason Clare said reforms to the sector 
would follow the tradition of Labor's introduction of universal Medicare and universal superannuation.
"The government is committed to identifying solutions that will chart the course for universal, affordable early 
childhood education and care," they said at the time.
Aly said there was "no way" the early childhood education sector could continue under current policy settings.
"If it was just left, it would mean increased fees for parents, it would mean more workers leaving the sector and 
fewer workers coming into the sector, and it would mean collapse of the sector," she said.
"So we have to look at some form of reform. What that looks like, that's what I'm relying on the Productivity 
Commission to come up with."
Research by UNICEF found Australia ranked 32nd out of 38 OECD countries on child wellbeing. The latest figures 
from the Australian early childhood development census - show one in five children (22 per cent) were 
developmentally vulnerable.
Breeze said a lack of equal access to early childhood education and care was a critical factor in those results, 
largely affected by the cost of care.
About nine million Australians (about 35 per cent of the population) live in so-called childcare deserts, according to 
research from Victoria University's Mitchell Institute. Those deserts are areas where there are more than three 
children for every early childhood education place.
Opposition early childhood education spokeswoman Angie Bell said the government's $4.7 billion early childhood 
education package will not help more families get places in centres.
"If you live in a thin market or child care desert - where there is next to no access to early learning - this extra 
subsidy will not help," she said.
"We call on the government to do more to ensure all families have access to early childhood education, not just 
those living in our major cities."
Professor Leslie Loble, co-chair of the Centre for Policy Development's early childhood development initiative, said 
the terms of reference for the Productivity Commission review signalled the government was willing to look at 
overhauling the way the sector is run and funded.
"As important as increasing that subsidy rate was, this to me sets the frame for a very fundamental recognition that 
the market isn't working as effectively as we'd like."

Body
Penny Wong has slapped down first-term Labor senator Fatima Payman for crossing the floor, with the foreign 
minister pointing out she had had to vote against same-sex marriage before Labor changed its position.
In a thinly veiled warning to Payman, who this week voted with the Greens on a motion to recognise Palestinian 
statehood, Wong said she understood why her Labor colleagues were upset and that Prime Minister Anthony 
Albanese had shown "great restraint" by only suspending Payman from one caucus meeting.
Wong, who this year married her long-term partner Sophie Allouache, voted against the Greens' attempt to legalise 
same-sex marriage in 2008 and in 2010 argued publicly against legalising same-sex marriage, which was the 
party's official position at the time.

At the same time, she worked behind the scenes for years to successfully help secure the historic shift in Labor's 
official position.
Labor MPs are bound by a formal pledge to support the collective decisions of their caucus and risk expulsion from 
the party if they break that commitment.
Asked on Sky News about being forced to vote in line with the party's position, Wong said she did so "because I 
believed in the power of the collective".
"I can understand why colleagues are upset [about Payman's action]. I can understand how they feel because there 
is trust between colleagues as well. What I would say is our expectation is that the senator abide by decisions of the 
caucus. On this occasion, the prime minister has shown restraint," she said.
"We understand the importance of caucus solidarity. It is very rare for a Labor person not to respect that. It's a 
principle which has served us well."

Wong on Payman: she should vote with us, like I had to on gay marriage
Early Childhood Education Minister Anne Aly, who has previously spoken out on the Israel-Hamas conflict and 
who, like Payman, is Muslim, also questioned the West Australian senator's decision to cross the floor, saying her 
vote on Tuesday night was "inconsequential to the people of Gaza".
"The world woke on Wednesday morning and children were still being starved, the conflict was still happening - 
nothing has changed. My approach to this is that we do things that make a material difference on the ground," she 
told the ABC.

There is a growing expectation among Labor MPs that the Greens will test Payman - and Labor solidarity - again 
when parliament returns next week by moving another motion in support of Palestine.
Payman declined to answer questions from this masthead about whether she would cross the floor again but 
several of her colleagues said they were preparing for her to do so. Some argued it was time to "rip the Band-Aid 
off" and expel Payman before this happened, but others said the MP needed to be kept in the fold and should not 
face further sanction.
Her decision to cross the floor is the first time a Labor MP has done so since 2005.
Tuesday's vote came in the ninth month of Israel's military campaign in Gaza. On October 7, Hamas fighters 
crossed into Israel, killing 1200 people and taking more than 200 hostages, according to the Israel Defence Force. 
Gazan health authorities report more than 37,000 people have died during the subsequent invasion.

Highlight: An anti-Israel petition for politicians secured only 215 signatures, mostly minor figures, demonstrating 
support for the Jewish state in political circles.
Body
Even Anne Aly didn't sign.
A petition for politicians organised by the Palestinian lobby obtained a mere 215 signatures: not one of the 
signatories, apart from Greens leader Adam Bandt, exercise significant power. Almost half are or were councillors.
Not one of the teal independents and only three federal Labor MPs were prepared to put their name to the 14-point 
document, which went public on Tuesday and supports the Palestinian narrative of Israeli colonialism. Or, in the 
words of the conflict, Jewish apartheid.

"It is beyond dispute that Israel is committed to policies designed to entrench the domination of one people over 
another," the petition says. "Attempts to deny this, or smear those who allege it, are an attempt to defy truth and 
reality."
Above probably anyone else in the federal government, Aly, the Minister for Early Childhood Education and Youth, 
has the moral authority to pull Labor away from Israel's orbit. Aly is the first Muslim woman, first Arab, and first 
Egyptian-born person elected to the House of Representatives.
Yet, the co-organiser of the Australia Palestine Advocacy Network couldn't secure her endorsement, let alone a 
signature. Reached on Tuesday morning, Aly said: "As a member of the executive I am unable to sign petitions. 
This does not mean that I am not passionate about the plight of the Palestinian people and committed to peace in 
the region that I am culturally and linguistically connected to."
Aly is probably referring to cabinet solidarity principles, whereby ministers are expected to toe the party line, or 
resign if they feel compelled to break from the government's position on contentious issues.
Sanctions demands

The political establishment isn't backing the Palestinians
The lack of Labor signatories looks like a sign of institutional support for Israel in the upper political echelons, even 
as western Sydney ministers such as Tony Burke, Ed Husic and Chris Bowen signal to Muslim constituents anger 
over death and devastation in Gaza.
Australian Palestinians do not help themselves with extreme demands. They haven't excused the murderous 
Hamas rampage of October 7 - an event the petition acknowledged - but their expectations aren't within the bounds 
of diplomatic reality for a Western democracy either. They include the imposition of sanctions on Israeli political, 
military and media figures to punish the "genocidal regime".
As for the Jewish lobby - a term its members resist for historical reasons - it seemed pleased with the petition's thin 
response. Does anyone remember Brian Howe or Ian Macphee? Who cares about the positions of four assistant 
ministers in the NSW Labor government when the Premier, Chris Minns, promises to prosecute young men who 
chant "gas the Jews"?
"I thought the outcome might be worse," said one Jewish leader, who didn't want to go on the record because he 
thought it would give the petition more publicity.
In PR terms, it was effective, though. The Sydney Morning Herald, given a copy, published it on Tuesday's front 
page despite the limited sign-up. Another pro-Palestinian petition, for journalists, obtained 334 signatures, including 
some from The Australian Financial Review, and sparked an industry debate about how to cover people and 
governments we dislike.
Which side?
Australians are split. Forty per cent want the Israeli army to withdraw from Gaza immediately; 33 per cent don't, 
according to a Roy Morgan poll last month.
At the same time, about half say Australia shouldn't take sides, which might help explain why the Labor 
government is simultaneously supporting Israel while criticising it.
Last week, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese issued a statement with his Canadian and New Zealand counterparts 
on the war. They didn't call for an unconditional ceasefire, which would allow Hamas to strengthen its defences. 
The Israeli lobby was pleased.
A few hours later, Australia voted for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire" in the United Nations General 
Assembly, which delighted the Palestinians.
Work that out. Many can't. Which may be the objective.

Highlight: Childcare workers will be able to use strike action as a bargaining chip in multi-employer deals under 
Labor's employment bill designed to drive up wages.
Body
Early Childhood Education Minister Dr Anne Aly said a new ability for childcare workers to use strike action as a 
bargaining chip in multi-employer deals is crucial leverage in the fight for better pay.
The controversial wages bill Workplace Relations Minister Tony Burke wants to ram through the lower house this 
week gives workers in low-paid, female-dominated jobs such as early learning and aged care the right to launch 
industrial action across several employers to help secure higher incomes.

Academics and union leaders hosed down the prospect of multi-employer bargaining leading to widespread strikes 
during a parliamentary inquiry into the government's Secure Jobs, Better Pay bill last week following outcry from 
business leaders over the economic impact of the reforms.
After a roundtable with the Independent Education Union in Sydney on Friday, Aly told this masthead the new right 
for childcare workers to undertake industrial action in multi-employer bargaining was "incredibly crucial".
"It just makes it a lot more effective," Aly said, highlighting how workers would be able to bargain across employers 
grouped by location or the nature of the enterprise. "It's going to provide a much more effective bargaining system 
for the early education and childcare sector."
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Burke have singled out childcare and aged care as among the most 
important beneficiaries of the reforms.
Business leaders argue the sweeping workplace law changes will empower unions to trigger industry-wide strikes 
and rope employers into pay deals without their consent.
Australian Industry Group head Innes Willox said: "If this right to strike proposal gets up across the childcare sector, 
its proponents can explain to parents why their children won't get care due to widespread industrial action, and why 
workers don't get paid as they are forced not to work."

Power to go on strike will be 'crucial' for childcare workers: minister
"If the government wants childcare, aged care and disability sectors to be paid substantially more, they simply will 
have to pay for it, since these are sectors principally supported by government funding," he said.
Early Childhood Australia chief executive Samantha Page said the "masculine, adversarial" notion around striking 
didn't necessarily translate to a female-dominated sector where staff developed close, working relationships with 
children and families.
"Walking off a building site is one thing, but walking out of an aged-care or early learning centre is a different thing," 
Page said.
Under the bill, the Fair Work Commission will be able to force the government to take part in multi-employer wage 
deal negotiations for sectors it heavily funds, including aged care and childcare.
Early educators want their pay to match similar roles in primary schools, which would mean a 30 per cent increase 
in most categories. Asked whether the government was willing to be party to those wage deals, Aly said it was a 
matter for the industrial umpire.
The government is also being pressed to urgently fund an interim, 10 per cent pay rise to stop workers leaving the 
sector - which is suffering more than 7000 vacancies a month - ahead of its cheaper childcare reforms that will add 
to staffing pressures by increasing demand.
Aly said retention issues couldn't be fixed with Band-Aid or short-term solutions but there were "low-hanging fruit" 
stop-gaps, such as skilled migration, that could address the shortfall immediately.
"We're working with the sector to look at what we can do in the short-, medium- and long-term," she said. "It's 
something this government has put as a priority."
In welcoming the Fair Work decision to award aged-care workers an interim 15 per cent pay rise on Saturday, 
Albanese said wages had been held back in feminised industries because of the lack of bargaining power.
"It's an important decision, it's just a couple more stages to go, but it's a sign that the Fair Work Commission 
understands how important it is," he said.
The government has promised to fund the wage rise for aged-care workers. Asked how much it would cost during a 
press conference, the Prime Minister replied there were further stages to the Fair Work process.
"I can say that we allowed for a contingency in the budget that was handed down on Tuesday night two weeks ago 
because we anticipated a wage increase coming through," he said, adding the government didn't declare the 
amount.

Highlight: Peter Dutton says the prime minster should prioritise a trip to Israel ahead of the United States.
Body
Peter Dutton says Anthony Albanese should prioritise a visit to Tel Aviv ahead of his trip to the United States next 
week, as two Labor ministers effectively accused Israel of war crimes by pointing to its "collective punishment" of 
Palestinians in besieged Gaza.
With other world leaders visiting Israel to show support and try to stop the conflagration worsening, Mr Dutton 
messaged Mr Albanese earlier this week with the suggestion, then called publicly for the itinerary change on 
Thursday.

"That should be the priority, frankly, of any international travel at the moment so that we can seek to be part of an 
alliance, to keep the pressure down on those who seek to have a wider conflict in the region," Mr Dutton said.
Mr Albanese dismissed the suggestion and plans to leave on Sunday for a four-day official visit to Washington. The 
trip risks creating controversy at home given the prime minister's heavy travel schedule, and the juxtaposition of a 
black-tie dinner at the White House amid catastrophic events unfolding in the Middle East.
As the carnage in Gaza worsens due to Israel's reprisal raids, the uneasy truce that has held within Labor since the 
October 7 atrocities perpetrated in Israel by Hamas began to fray.
Cabinet minister Ed Husic and junior minister Anne Aly, who are both Muslim, expressed sympathy for Israel but 
also spoke out at its reprisal tactics of bombardments and cutting off fuel, water and electricity, all of which is 
causing immense suffering in Gaza.
Senior government figures said the view from the top was that the comments were balanced and, if anything, would 
help defuse tensions in the community, which ASIO has warned could lead to spontaneous violence.
Mr Husic said while Israel had "paid a terrible price for the barbarism of Hamas", which left 1400 people dead in 
southern Israel, and called for the unconditional release of almost 200 hostages, he was worried Palestinians would 
also pay a hefty price.

Dutton tells Albanese to visit Israel as Labor loyalties tested
"I feel very strongly that Palestinians are being collectively  punished here for Hamas' barbarism," Mr Husic told the 
ABC.
About 3000 Palestinians had thus far been killed in reprisal raids but "we don't see any public landmarks in 
Australia that have been lit up in red, black, white and green".
Dr Aly, a counterterrorism expert before entering parliament, said the Arab community was also feeling pained.
"It's difficult to argue that those children are Hamas, and it's difficult to argue that what is currently occurring is not a 
form of collective punishment," she said.
Backbencher Maria Vamvakinou expressed similar sympathies at a pro-Palestinian rally outside Parliament House.
Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-CEO Alex Ryvchin said Israel wanted to destroy Hamas not just for its 
own benefit but for that of the Palestinian people. It was the same rationale behind the elimination of ISIS, he said.
"The only way to ensure the safety and protection of both Israelis and Palestinians is to destroy Hamas completely 
so that they can never perform these atrocities and draw the region into war again," Mr Ryvchin said.

Body
The Greens senator Lidia Thorpe’s failure to declare a possible perceived conflict of interest in her relationship with 
a former bikie is “disappointing”, according to the then deputy chair of parliament’s law enforcement committee.
Anne Aly, now the minister for early childhood education, made the comment to Guardian Australia after the 
Greens leader, Adam Bandt, asked for and received Thorpe’s resignation as Greens deputy leader in the Senate  
over the undisclosed relationship with Dean Martin in 2021.
Martin, who has no criminal convictions, was associated with the Rebels bikie gang but stepped down as Victorian 
chapter president in 2018 after his brother Shane Martin – the father of AFL star Dustin Martin – was deported to 
New Zealand.
Thorpe was a member of the joint committee on law enforcement from February 2021 to April 2022.
In August 2021, the committee concluded a review of an amendment to reinforce the legality of the Australian 
Criminal Intelligence Commission’s powers to conduct special operations and investigations.
The ACIC has coercive powers to investigate serious criminal activities. In July 2020 it established a special 
operation on outlaw motorcycle gangs.
In its report , the committee noted the ACIC had offered to provide detail on “the importance of evidence obtained 
through its exercise of coercive powers in tackling serious and organised crime”, including “in camera” in a private 
session.

Aly told Guardian Australia “accountability and transparency are the responsibility of all members of parliament”. “ 
The committee has significant processes in place for members to declare all conflicts of interest – it’s disappointing 
to learn a member may not have taken this responsibility to the Australian community seriously.
“Adam Bandt needs to explain what his office knew and what he knew, and if he wasn’t informed about these 
issues, given his office was, why that is the case.”
In a statement, Thorpe said she accepts she “made mistakes” and had “not exercised good judgment”.
Thorpe told the ABC, which first revealed the relationship , she met Martin “through Blak activism and briefly dated 
in early 2021”.
“We remain friends and have collaborated on our shared interests advocating for the rights of First Nations 
peoples.”
Thorpe acknowledged she did not advise Bandt of her relationship with Martin, but insisted that confidential 
committee documents on how the AFP monitors outlaw motorcycle gangs were “treated in confidence”.
Thorpe said Martin’s history with the Rebels was a “past connection”.
“Obviously, I’m concerned about the criminal activities of outlaw motorcycle clubs in general. But when we met, Mr 
Martin was no longer involved with that world.”
Martin reportedly made a “peaceful handover”  of the Rebels presidency in April 2018. The club is considered to 
have the most members of any outlaw motorcycle gang in Australia.
He previously advocated  for the overhaul of deportation laws that had resulted in his brother Shane being exiled to 
New Zealand, telling the Age in 2016 that the then immigration minister Peter Dutton was victimising all club 
members. “He’s saying we’re all criminals, drug dealers. “None of us here have got criminal records and he’s 
slandering us all the time. “He’s accusing us; he’s chopping us off at the head, he reckons.” Martin referenced the

their mum’s Aboriginal – and it’s like stolen generations all over again.”
In 2013 he reportedly faced charges  relating to a raid on the Rebels clubhouse in Melbourne’s west, after police 
seized alcohol on the premises.
He pleaded guilty to charges of selling liquor without a licence and dealing with $76.45 suspected of being the 
proceeds of crime.
His lawyer told the Melbourne magistrates court Martin had not been at the clubhouse for four months prior to the 
raid as he was working interstate as a security manager for a construction company, but as president he was 
responsible for the breaches of the law.

Update FEDERAL Minister for Early Childhood Education Dr Anne Aly has stood by the government's training 
package for educators in this year's budget.
Childcare operators have called the package "chicken feed" and "a slap in the face" - arguing it doesn't address the 
real issue - a wage increase to keep people in the job.
The union has asked for a 25 per cent pay rise to attract more educators and retain the current workforce.
Dr Aly said she acknowledged early childhood educators and teachers do "incredible work".
"That's why we changed the law last year, to make it easier for them to get a pay rise," she said.
"The multi-employer provisions commence in June."
She said she was proud to be part of a government that recognises the importance of the workforce.
"Our professional development package is a direct response to the issues and the concerns the sector has raised 
with me over the year," she said.
"We know the early childhood education workforce is experiencing long-term challenges - professional development 
is key to retaining highly skilled educators and teachers in the sector, but also key to improving capacity and 
capability of early childhood education services."
Earlier CHILDCARE educators say the Federal Budget has made no real effort to address workforce shortages, 
calling a lack of wage growth a "slap in the face".
Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers announced a raft of measures designed to make childcare more affordable for 
parents and provide better support for educators' professional development on Tuesday night, but did not address 
the 25 per cent pay increase unions have strongly campaigned for.
Karuah Preschool director Karen Baloch said she can't take more enrolments because she doesn't have the staff 
and has had to ask employees to work extra hours to support families.

"There are so many people leaving the sector because not only are we thoroughly under-appreciated and under-
valued but that's made blatantly obvious every week when we get paid," she said.
"It's an absolute slap in the face, they make no effort to address educator shortages unless they address wages.
"Everything they do is completely tokenistic and as a workforce we know that."
The budget committed an extra $9 billion to the sector, bringing the total spend on childcare to $55.3 billion in the 
next four years.
It also included $724 million across five years to support training for educators and the care sector with more than 
80,000 early childhood educators expected to benefit.
Along with educators, the budget focused on making childcare more accessible and affordable for families, with 
about 1.2 million to benefit from July.
St Nicholas executive director David Healy said he welcomed the increased training measures but said more 
needed to be done to retain the workforce.
"To be frank it's a national-level issue and this is chicken feed being thrown at it, it looks attractive but realistically 
it's going to take years for those shortages to resolve themselves," he said.
Mr Healy said their centres operate up to 50 weeks a year and the concern is that the sector is losing skilled, 
qualified workers to teaching which offers longer breaks, shorter hours and better pay.
He said he can't run his centres at full capacity because of staffing shortages, and said that although it was great to 
see subsidies for parents to assist them with childcare the issue is having enough staff to offer them a place.
"It's hard to say what's not attracting people to the sector, certainly having further support to drive and encourage 
opportunities for people in the educator workforce who want to upskill will ultimately increase the number of degree-
qualified early childhood teachers and that is welcome," he said.
"On a national level the funding appears attractive on the face of it, but if you break it down to the shortages being 
experienced I'm not confident it does go far enough."
United Workers Union early education director Helen Gibbons said educators are passionate about providing 
quality learning to children and professional development that supports their practice is a "must".
"Better access to training and development will improve centres' ability to attract and retain educators, but it's not 
enough alone," she said.
"To properly response to the massive workforce crisis in early learning, the federal government must follow through 
and play its role in improving wages.
"The only way to keep educators from leaving the sector at current crisis levels is by paying them a wage that 
respects their vital contribution to our society."
The union is calling on the federal government to fund a 25 per cent pay rise for every educator in the sector.
The Newcastle Herald has contacted federal Minister for Early Childhood Education Anne Aly for comment.

The following information was released by the office of the Prime Minister of Australia:
TANIA LAWRENCE MP, MEMBER FOR HASLUCK: Good morning and welcome to North Metropolitan TAFE in 
Midland, in the seat of Hasluck. I'm Tania Lawrence, the Member for Hasluck. And it gives me great pleasure to be 
today joined with the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Premier Roger Cook, my state parliamentary colleagues, 
the teachers, the trainers and students of North Metro TAFE. When we, even before the election in 2022, we knew 
we had a skills and labour shortage. So, one of the very first actions that the Albanese Labor Government took, was 
to host a summit of unions, businesses, experts, economists, trainers from around the country to identify and 
articulate the problem and work a pathway to solving it. I also hosted a roundtable here in Perth, with industry 
leaders, TAFE institutions and with unions. And together, culminating now in this landmark agreement to really fund 
the institutions and vocational education training, with TAFE. And we all know, many of us here know, just how 
central it is to having TAFE as the base for education. I myself, as a graduate of TAFE, my staff have done 
apprenticeships as well, and it really does create the careers and pathway opportunities, that have benefited the 
nation. So with this, I'd love to hand over now to the Prime Minister.
ANTHONY ALBANESE, PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA: Well, thanks very much, Tania, and it's great to be 
back in the electorate of Hasluck. And it's terrific also to be here with our state parliamentary colleagues, led by 
Premier Roger Cook, and the Training Minister Simone McGurk, but also Michelle Roberts, the local member here. 
I am so excited to be in WA this weekend, because of course, it's Telethon Weekend. And you can feel a real uplift 
here, as WA does something that other states used to do, but don't do any more, unite in a common interest to 
raise money to assist sick kids and their family. So, a big shout out at the beginning of this weekend, to all of those 
involved in Telethon and an encouragement to dig deep over this weekend, to make sure that those young 
Australians who are so inspirational, who I look forward to meeting their ambassadors later today, and again to talk 
to people tomorrow about the remarkable example that they show in their resilience, in their positivity, under 
circumstances which can be very difficult. But today, we are here at this wonderful TAFE institution to celebrate and 
to mark the first National Skills Agreement since 2012. Throughout the entire period of my predecessors, there was 
not only no National Skills Agreement, there weren't skills agreements between indeed any individual jurisdiction 
and the Commonwealth. Well, my Government is different. I went to an election saying that we would prioritise 
TAFE at the center of the vocational education and training system and that we would value skills. The first 
announcement that I made as Labor Leader, was back here in Perth in 2019, where I announced the creation of 
Page 2 of 6
DOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023
Jobs and Skills Australia, a body to identify what the labour market needs were for Australian business going 
forward, not just over a one year period, but five years, 10 years time. To make sure that our education and training 
system was fit for purpose. To make sure, as well, that we didn't just rely upon temporary labour, bringing people in 
and then sending them out, and bringing in other people to do the same job. That when we identify an area of skill 
shortage, we actually have a strategy to tackle it. And that means firstly, training Australians for those jobs. We 
need also, of course, to have, migration will continue to play a role. But training Australians up, whether it be for 
their first job or retraining. And it was fantastic to meet some of the students who are here, some of them new in 
their first task that they're looking at doing but others looking at retraining, as well, for the jobs of the future, with the 
concentration that this TAFE will have on the renewable sector, which will require different skills. And that's why this 
$12 billion program that we have put in place over a five year period, with $1.2 billion directly for Western Australia, 
will make an enormous difference going forward, over the next five years. And I pay tribute to all of the State and 
Territory Governments. A lot of work has gone into this, in the lead up to the National Cabinet meeting that we held 
on Monday, but all of the Premiers and Chief Ministers are very excited about the prospects of going forward. And 
an example of the way that my Government is working cooperatively with State Governments. Not picking fights 
with them, not choosing to back Clive Palmer rather than the local State Government, but choosing instead to back 
Western Australians to deliver. Back in this most magnificent of economies, that has been so central to Australia's 
employment growth, to continue to be a powerhouse of the national economy. This week we had the labour market 
figures, showed an unemployment rate of 3.6 per cent. There have been 19 occasions since records began, where 
unemployment has had a three in front of it and 16 of the of them have been under my Labor Government, since 
were elected last May. Now, we will continue to prioritise the creation of jobs, we will continue to prioritise lifting 
wages and we will continue to prioritise giving people the skills, so they can fill those good, secure jobs. Now, the 
Fee-Free TAFE is already making an enormous difference. We committed to 180,000 Fee-Free TAFE places this 
year. We've delivered at least but still growing, 215,000. Here in WA, there were going to be 18,000 places, we've 
almost doubled that figure. WA was very quick off the mark in making a difference. And here at this TAFE, just one 
example of the difference that it has made, before Fee-Free TAFE this course in electronics used to cost $3,700. It 
attracted about seven students each term. Fee-Free TAFE means that now the course has 85 students enrolled, 
seven to 85. A practical example of how our commitment to Fee-Free TAFE, making a difference, working with 
State Governments is making a difference to the economy. But importantly as well, making a difference to people's 
lives by training them up and giving them the skills that they need for secure work into the future. So, I want to also 
conclude by just giving a shout out to those people who are doing the training. A lot of people, when I've been to 
TAFEs over the years, people who've already made a massive contribution through the skills and work that they've 
done, towards the end of their careers or sometimes after they're formally retired, go and impart those skills to the 
next generation coming through. And that's a really important thing about TAFE that we see and I thank those who 
are doing that. And this course at this wonderful TAFE, I just think this is a really practical announcement and a 
practical example of how my Government is getting on with dealing with cost of living pressures, dealing with the 
challenges which are in the economy and setting us up for a prosperous future. We're going to hear from the 
Premier and then the WA Training Minister, Simone. And then we'll take questions.
ROGER COOK, PREMIER OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA: Thanks very much, Anthony. It's great to have the Prime 
Minister back here in Western Australia and here in Midland at North Metropolitan TAFE, one of the centres that 
will be designed to train all the people we need for our renewable energy transition. So, it's terrific to be here to 
celebrate Fee-Free TAFE courses. I'm joined by Minister McGurk, I want to thank her for her leadership in the 
training field, but also acknowledge Tania Lawrence the Member for Hasluck. And of course, the great local 
Member for Midland, Michelle Roberts. This is an outstanding outcome for Western Australia. In 2023, 36,000 
Western Australians took advantage of our Fee-Free courses, over and above the anticipated 180,000. And so 
now, we've got more in 24. And we're really looking forward to extending the Fee-Free TAFE courses under the 
National Skills Agreement. Now, my Government always fights for the best deal for Western Australians and the 
National Skills Agreement is an outstanding outcome for training Western Australians, not only for the jobs of today, 
but for the jobs of the future. It enables us to properly target our resources to those qualifications that we know are 
going to be so vital for the ongoing prosperity of our economy. And it also provides us with an opportunity to target 
cohorts that we want to see get into the courses, that are so valuable. People from disadvantaged backgrounds, 
gender diversity in these courses. And so, this is an outstanding outcome. I was very proud to be at the National 
Cabinet meeting earlier in the week, where all the Premiers and Chief Ministers were able to sign off on the Page 3 of 6
DOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023
National Skills Agreement. It's a great sign of a Commonwealth Government, which is taking the lead to make sure 
our economy has the workforce that we need to continue to prosper. This is also in addition to my Government's 
$246 million redevelopment of our TAFE campuses, almost a quarter of a billion dollars around designing and 
making sure that our TAFE campuses are fit for purpose, to continue to provide great job opportunities for those 
skills that we'll need today, but to continue to make sure that we have the job opportunities for skills into the future. 
So, for instance, here at North Metropolitan TAFE, we'll be providing skills opportunities for those people looking to 
transition into the renewable energies future. We'll have a wind turbine here in the very near future, to provide skills 
for those people to be able to practice, not only working on wind turbines, but also working at height. So, you can 
see how these strategic investments are so important to providing people with jobs. And that's what my 
Government's priority is, is to make sure that Western Australians get the jobs that they deserve. And our 
unemployment rate figures, which were released yesterday, 3.3 per cent is an outstanding outcome for the Western 
Australian economy, and we want to do more. We want to continue to make sure that we provide opportunities for 
Western Australians to get rewarding jobs, in great industries, that are forward looking into the future. So, thank you 
very much to the Commonwealth Government. Congratulations to Minister McGurk for the National Skills 
Agreement. This is a great day for Western Australian jobs and training, and very much looking forward to seeing 
more success in the Fee-Free TAFE courses into the future.
SIMONE MCGURK, WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MINISTER FOR TRAINING: Thank you Premier and thank you 
Prime Minister for being here, as well as Tania Lawrence and Michelle Roberts. I just wanted to acknowledge what 
we're able to achieve when we work in cooperation with the Federal Government and the State Government, both 
being so committed in Western Australia to making sure that Western Australians are skilled to do the jobs that we 
know are out there and we know are coming. And this five year Skills Agreement, which will deliver $1.3 billion to 
Western Australia, $1.3 billion, and that would be $380 million more than we've had in previous, than previous 
funding arrangements with the Federal Government. But importantly, we have some certainty of funding for five 
years. And working together with a Commonwealth Government to understand what our priority areas are, for the 
jobs that we know are here now and the jobs that we know are coming at us. And to be here at North Metropolitan 
TAFE here in Midland, where we're able to meet students who are taking advantage of significant Fee-Free 
courses, making significant savings. And as the Prime Minister said, we've met a couple of students who are 
mature age and are coming back and taking the opportunity to upskill, but also young students who can see the 
opportunities that are here. These are electronic students and you can tell, there's real buzz in the room. They've 
really taken advantage of what we're able to deliver with Fee-Free and I would just like to repeat my 
acknowledgement of the cooperation that we're able to achieve with the Federal Government, when we work 
together. And for the Federal Government, under Prime Minister Albanese and the Skills Minister Brendan 
O'Connor, understanding that Western Australia has some real pressures and that we need to all work together to 
put our shoulder to the wheel, to meet the skills demands that are with us today.
PRIME MINISTER: Thanks very much, Simone. Happy to have questions, on this firstly. This is a really important 
announcement and I'm sure you have some other things you want to talk about.
JOURNALIST: Do you agree with Ed Husic and Anne Aly, who've accused Israel of collectively punishing 
Palestinians? And if it's not collective punishment, what is it?
PRIME MINISTER: Ed Husic, Anne Aly and my entire team voted for a resolution in the Parliament and indeed Ed 
and Anne spoke about it. That resolution was really important, it unequivocally condemned Hamas for the atrocities 
that it committed as a terrorist organisation, with its invasion of Israel. And with the atrocities that were committed, 
including to young people who were attending a music festival, we had people kidnapped and taken from their 
families. Israel has a right to defend itself. We also acknowledged in that resolution, importantly, that the lives of 
innocent civilians needed to be protected. Every loss of an innocent life matters, whether they are Israeli or 
Palestinian. And I do note the comments of President Biden today. This is what President Biden has had to say, 
'The US remains committed to the Palestinian people's right to dignity and self determination. We mourn every 
innocent life lost. We can't ignore the humanity of innocent Palestinians, who only want to live in peace.' And I 
applaud the efforts of President Biden, to work with nations in the region to make sure that Gaza will be able to 
have access to food, water and medicine. President Biden went on to say, 'We cannot give up on peace and we 
cannot give up on a two state solution.' And his comments are appropriate, I completely agree with them, and I Page 4 of 6
DOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023
stand by, as does every Member of the Labor Party, the resolution that was adopted overwhelmingly in the 
Parliament, in the House of Representatives and the same resolution in the Senate just this week.
JOURNALIST: We learned just this morning that a 16 year old Aboriginal boy has become first death in custody in 
WA in the last 50 years. The Voice was your key measure to avoid these sorts of outcomes. With that having failed, 
what's next?
PRIME MINISTER: Well, firstly, can I say that this news is a terrible tragedy and I give my condolences to the family 
and friends of this young person who has died. And there will now be, of course, a coronial inquiry and so on those 
specifics, it is not appropriate, therefore, to comment further. My Government is determined to Close the Gap with 
Indigenous Australians. We answered the invitation of indigenous Australians to give constitutional recognition in 
the form which was requested, which was through a constitutionally enshrined Voice to Parliament. Australians did 
not vote for that. Our constitution is difficult to change. We're now on eight out of 45, and it is though the case that 
Indigenous communities in remote Northern Territory, in places in the Kimberley, in Lockhart River and Palm Island 
and the Tiwis and other communities, overwhelmingly did vote Yes in this referendum. And that will be a difficult 
time, it is a difficult time for Indigenous Australians. But we respect the outcome in our democracy and I have done 
that. What we will continue to do, we'll continue to work on Closing the Gap though. The National Skills Agreement 
is an example, we have over $200 million of that agreement, is set aside for First Nation skills uplift. We want to 
make sure that there are more Indigenous apprentices, that there are more Indigenous trainees, that workforces are 
able to benefit from skilling up Indigenous Australians. I know that many of the companies that were out there 
supporting the Voice, are those that have done a lot in terms of reconciliation action plans, in Indigenous 
apprenticeships, and here in Western Australia, of course, has led that quite often, and that's a good thing. But the 
fact that we have this specific program is an indication that I believe whilst Australians did not vote in favour of the 
referendum, Australians do want to see the gap closed. They do want to see disadvantage dealt with, that is, in 
Indigenous communities. And we'll continue to work in this area, but in health, in life expectancy, in community 
services, in all of these areas, with the programs that we have. But also consult with Indigenous communities, 
because one of the things that I do know, and here in Western Australia of all places, is the case. I've been coming 
here for a long period of time. I've been here, I think, now 17 times as Prime Minister, that's more than one a month, 
and it's certainly more than what I committed to, of ten visits a year. Because if you want to find out what's 
happening on the ground, here in Western Australia, I think West Australians understand this. They don't want 
decisions to just be made in Canberra. They want people to come, to talk to people on the ground, to get those 
results. Now, that's a principle that doesn't just apply in Indigenous affairs, it's one that applies across the board. It's 
one that my Government will continue to do, which is why I've engaged so strongly with the Premier, Roger Cook, 
and why I engaged so strongly as well with his predecessor, Mark McGowan.
JOURNALIST: Prime Minister, you have been coming here for a long time before you were Prime Minister and as 
Prime Minister, as well. Did you expect such a strong No vote in this state?
PRIME MINISTER: People saw what polling was saying, we were determined, though. You had a call in 2017. 
You'll note that I was coming here in 2017, but I wasn't the Prime Minister. Nor was I the Prime Minister who 
established a process, which asked Indigenous Australians to deliberate on what form constitutional recognition 
should take. That process, we had John Howard way back in, we had a vote on the Preamble, which had a similar 
outcome, last century. We then had John Howard go to an election in 2007, we then had Tony Abbott and then 
Malcolm Turnbull establish a process. That process came up with the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017. You 
had Ken Wyatt appointed as the Minister for Indigenous Australians and go to Garma in 2019. I was there when he 
put forward the idea that there would be a referendum. That was the policy that Scott Morrison was elected on in 
2019. It never happened. It never happened. I'm a Prime Minister who will promise to do things and then go and do 
them. I think that's how you restore faith in politics. That is something that we need to do. I launched my campaign 
here at the stadium and I promised on multiple occasions, that we would do this. And we gave Australians their say, 
but we respect the outcome that was given.
JOURNALIST: How concerned are you about the unlawful use of solitary confinement in our detention centre, that 
can see Indigenous kids held in their cell for 23 hours? Including the one -Page 5 of 6
DOORSTOP - PERTH TRANSCRIPT 20 OCT 2023
PRIME MINISTER: I have no intention of commenting on, from Canberra, about the specifics of what occurs in 
every centre in Australia
JOURNALIST: But, if we're trying to Close the Gap
PRIME MINISTER: It's a question of the State. I'm not going to pretend, on a serious issue when it comes to 
Indigenous Australians, that I am somehow an expert on every issue. That's the whole point that I'm making here, is 
that you need to get local engagement and local input on matters.
JOURNALIST: What do you make of the Opposition Leader's claims yesterday, urging you to fly to Washington via 
Tel Aviv, in the final moments of Parliament?
PRIME MINISTER: Well, I think that quite clearly, the conflict in the Middle East is a complex one. It's one that has 
gone on for a considerable period of time. The responsibility for what is happening now rests firmly with Hamas and 
the actions that they have taken. But there are, of course, longer term issues which President Biden has indicated 
this morning again, has given people a reminder, that they are issues that need to be addressed. And I 
acknowledge the suffering of Israeli, as well as Palestinian citizens, who are innocent, who just want to live a life in 
security and with justice, as the resolution carried by the Parliament said, going forward. I also acknowledge that 
leaders have a responsibility at this time to make sure that there is, whilst there is some concern in the community 
and hurt being felt for people who have relatives and friends in the Middle East, whether they be Israeli or 
Palestinian, this is a very difficult time for the community. So, individuals and particularly people, I draw your 
attention to the comments of the Director General of ASIO, Mike Burgess, who's spoken about the need to be 
responsible in comments and to be careful about language which is used at this time. We have a harmonious 
community here in Australia, I want to see that continue. There's no place here in Australia for anti-Semitism. 
There is also no place here in Australia for Islamophobia. The Leader of the Opposition chose to do that, that's a 
matter for him. I have scheduled a visit, that has been longstanding with President Biden, where the logistics of 
organising that for Sunday, is when we will depart from Canberra. The leaders who have visited, and I note this, the 
leaders who have visited are members of the P5, the Permanent Members of the Security Council. The United 
States has a particular role in that, as does the United Kingdom, as does the other people who have visited there. 
And President Biden's visit produced outcomes of negotiating through with different states, but also was 
accompanied by a considerable security effort for President Biden. This is not a secure area. Our priority has been 
to engage and I've engaged, I've met personally with the Israeli Ambassador. I had him to my residence and had a 
discussion. I've had discussions with leaders of the Palestinian community, leaders of the Jewish community here 
in Australia, as well. The decision of the Leader of the Opposition to raise such an issue publicly, that's a matter for 
him. But at this point in time, I have no plans to visit the Middle East, and in terms of the security agencies as well, 
there's no disagreement from the position that I've taken.
JOURNALIST: From Joe Biden's speech, what are your thoughts, more specifically on these comments, that if we 
walk away and let Putin erase Ukraine's independence, would be aggressors, would be emboldened to try and do 
the same possibly in the Pacific and the Middle East more broadly?
PRIME MINISTER: Well, we're there with the people of Ukraine because the actions of Vladimir Putin, of invading, 
illegally the sovereign state of Ukraine, is an attack on the international rule of law and on respect for national 
boundaries and national sovereignty. That's why Australia has been a significant contributor to the struggle in 
Ukraine. And that's why we've provided support, including providing comfort and refuge for people fleeing Ukraine. 
Similarly, our priority hasn't been to get people into the Middle East, it's been to get people out of the Middle East. 
Australian citizens, is what we've been concentrating on, rather than having a whole contingent go into an area 
which is clearly very volatile, to say the least. It's a state of war, is going on. The people of Ukraine are showing 
extraordinary courage, extraordinary courage, and I support President Biden's call to continue to engage, to show 
resolve. Australia will continue to be a part of the support for the people of Ukraine, for as long as it is required, 
because this isn't just a struggle about what occurs in Ukraine. Thanks very much.

Hip hop, the Obamas and quite a bit of the ‘F' word: what drives Labor's Anne Aly
What's one vice you wish you could give up?Staying up too late and then not getting enough sleep and then 
drinking too much coffee to make up for it.
The song that's always on high rotation?Right now its Mafia by Mohamed Ramadan. It's Arabic hip hop. But 
usually, it's Nosebleed Section by Hilltop Hoods. There's definitely a theme in my playlist.
What are you reading?Surrounded by Psychopaths by Thomas Erickson. It's proving very handy.
Favourite movie of the past decade?A Star is Born. Basically, just anything with Bradley Cooper.
Top of your sporting bucket list?To see the Ice Hockey Hall of Fame in Oshawa Canada which features my 
hubby Dave. And to learn how to throw a ball.
What's the best piece of advice you've ever received?When I left school, my art teacher Mrs Fitzgerald said, 
"Don't be disappointed if your life doesn't turn out the way you imagined it would in the heady days of being 17". I've 
never forgotten her words, and they have served me well.
What are the three things you couldn't live without?Fire in my belly, my mini schnauzer Gucci and the love of 
family and friends.

Labor minister slams Aston Liberal candidate over childcare column
Labor minister slams Aston Liberal candidate over childcare column

Childcare will be a key battleground in the fight for the  marginal seat of Aston, as Prime Minister Anthony Albanese 
formally launches the campaign for Labor candidate Mary Doyle this weekend.
Labor has seized on a column Liberal candidate Roshena Campbell wrote for The Age that questioned "throw[ing] 
taxpayer money at childcare".
There are nearly 6000 families in the seat, held with a 2.8 per cent margin after a swing against retiring member 
Alan Tudge, who use childcare and could apply for subsidies that will be introduced by the Albanese government 
from July 1.
While the Coalition ultimately backed Labor's subsidies, in June last year Campbell questioned the $4.7 billion 
outlay, which will increase the subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning up to $80,000 and create a sliding 
scale in discounts for those earning less than $530,000.
"What is so extraordinary about this essentially bipartisan rush to throw taxpayer money at childcare is it has taken 
place without any real debate about whether it is a good idea to get mothers back into the workforce so quickly," 
Campbell wrote.
"If we are serious about giving working women choices, governments need to also be willing to support them in the 
choice of staying at home in the early years."
"Yet instead we subsidise childcare centres to replace parents for almost all our children's waking hours. In doing 
so, we send a strong message to mothers that they cannot afford to be out of the workforce for too long."
The minister responsible for childcare, Anne Aly, who will hold a press conference with Labor candidate Mary 
Doyle on Friday, said Campbell's arguments proved she wanted to "make the cost of living pressures in the outer-
east worse, not better".
"I hope Peter Dutton and his handpicked candidate travel to the outer-eastern suburbs to explain to local families 
why they don't deserve cost-of-living relief. We know quality early childhood education provides lifelong benefits - 
from improved education and health outcomes all the way to higher paying jobs," she said.

But Campbell affirmed her position and said she understood the pressures of raising a young family as a barrister 
and councillor.
"An article I wrote last year put forward one suggestion, that as well as subsidising child care, a portion of the 
government's assistance could support women who re-enter the workforce after taking extended parental leave," 
she said. "I believe policy debate is healthy and put forward that suggestion with a view to supporting more working 
parents."
Dutton has travelled to Aston three times since the April 1 byelection date was called last month, including on 
Thursday when he played table tennis with Chinese Australians, who make up nearly 15 per cent of the electorate. 
The Coalition has been working on rebuilding trust with the Chinese diaspora after the community shifted support 
away from the Morrison government.
The opposition's campaign in Aston has focussed on blaming Labor for the high cost of living and interest rate rises 
and holding the government to account for cutting key road projects in the seat.
The childcare plan is regarded by Labor sources who were not cleared to speak on the record as an underrated 
factor in the party's strong election win in May.
Treasury modelling suggests the childcare change will free up 37,000 workers in the policy's first year.
Labor candidate Mary Doyle, a former unionist and finance sector worker, said she experienced the large burden of 
childcare costs when she raised the two kids.
"Whenever I talk to parents in our community they're telling me the same thing, and they are thrilled when I tell them 
relief is on the way," she said.
Dutton has pitched the Liberal Party as the underdog in Aston, but it is expected to retain the seat because 
byelections usually produce swings against sitting governments. Labor figures privately believe it would be a 
positive result if it avoided a swing against it and held the current margin of 2.8 per cent, which was down from 10.1 
per cent in a swing against now-retiring member Alan Tudge.

briefing
Body
For Anne Aly, her swearing in this week as minister for early childhood and youth was more than just a personal 
achievement.
It was a moment that signified change and hope for her and fellow Muslim cabinet minister, Ed Husic.
Making history on Tuesday, Aly and Husic were sworn in to the federal cabinet, proudly clutching their Qurans, as 
the nation watched on.
It was a moment they had been hoping would happen, a potential reflection of changing perceptions of a community 
that has struggled with online and in-person vilification and abuse.
“In the post 9/11 years, Muslims around Australia were left with a profound sense of loss,” Aly told the Guardian
“It particularly impacted young Muslims who had never considered themselves anything but Australian. The political 
rhetoric that followed those years fed into Islamophobia and division.
“I hope that we are now witnessing a new era – an era where Australia is truly inclusive and where that inclusivity 
is reflected in our political institutions.”
Aly was also the first Muslim woman elected to parliament, winning her seat of Cowan in Western Australia in 2016 
and increasing her margin by 9% this year.

She said she was keenly aware of the significance of her appointment, beyond the responsibility it entails, reflecting 
on how her younger self would see this moment.
“Growing up, I often struggled with finding a sense of belonging. I think young Anne would be looking on this 
moment and I hope that it would give her some reassurance that she does belong.
“As a Muslim woman I realise that the significance of my appointment extends beyond my own feelings and has an 
impact for young women who can see themselves reflected in the leadership of this nation.
“I hope that it sends them a message that there is a place for them and that they do belong.”
A counter-terrorism expert before becoming a politician, Aly said it was a “great honour” to be appointed to the 
frontbench, adding that it was “heartening” to be part of the most diverse cabinet in history.
“I have always said that our parliament should be a reflection of the people we serve, not just in terms of diversity of 
gender or ethnic background but also in professional and life experience.
“When I was first elected to parliament in 2016, it was a very different place to the parliament of 2022. Seeing the 
breadth of diversity among my colleagues in the Albanese Labor government is a significant moment both 
personally and in the history of our nation.”
It comes after Islamophobia Register Australia (IRA) reported  a fourfold increase in reports of in-person incidents 
of anti-Muslim hate, and a spike in online Islamophobia, in particular after the Christchurch massacre.
The third Islamophobia in Australia report, released earlier this year, also showed an increase in the instances of 
Muslims being associated with being terrorists.
Husic, who was appointed minister for industry, told the ABC he was nervous waiting for the ceremony to begin.
“I felt the moment, the weight of that moment.”
Husic, who represents Chifley in Sydney’s west, is the son of Bosnian migrants and had previously served as 
parliamentary secretary to the former prime minister Kevin Rudd.
At the time he was also sworn in while holding a Quran and faced a fierce backlash online, but said he felt things 
have changed in the intervening years.
“I think things have changed quite a bit and the country is a lot more understanding and accepting,” he said.
“There are a lot of Muslim Australians that still cop a lot of hate speech and have to contend with a lot of things that 
many other Australians aren’t forced to.”

Palestinians in Gaza are being collectively punished, two Labor ministers say

Highlight: In strong comments that highlight tensions in Labor, ministers Ed Husic and Anne Aly also said 
Palestinian-Australians were feeling ignored.
Body
Two Labor ministers say Palestinian-Australians are feeling forgotten in the unfolding political reaction to the Israel-
Hamas war and that civilians in Gaza are being subjected to collective punishment.
Industry Minister Ed Husic and Early Childhood Education Minister Anne Aly urged for de-escalation of the conflict 
on Thursday morning, in strong comments that push the Albanese government to step up its support for 
Palestinians. Husic also suggested the government had only paid lip service to a two-state solution and Aly called 
for an investigation into potential Israeli war crimes.

Their intervention highlights internal tensions in Labor over a domestic response to the war that has involved 
monuments lit up in Israeli flags and political condemnation of pro-Palestinian protests. Labor has stood by Israel 
since Hamas launched its assault on Israeli civilians on October 7 and Israel retaliated, leading to a conflict that has 
killed more than 1300 Israelis and 3000 Palestinians.
Husic, a senior cabinet minister and the first Muslim elected to parliament, made a passionate plea for Australia to 
step up support for Palestinians as they faced what he described as a "humanitarian catastrophe" with 1000 
children dead, civilian infrastructure destroyed and a blockade on food, fuel, medicine and water.
"I feel very strongly that Palestinians are being collectively punished here for Hamas' barbarism," he said in an 
interview on ABC Radio National.
"I think it's really important ... that we contribute to international voices speaking up for Palestinians ... to say that 
there has got to be a more strategic and precise way to hold Hamas to account but not affect innocent Palestinian 
families."
He also sought to explain strong reactions from advocates in Australia, who have rallied on behalf of Palestinians. 
"Let me put it in a way that might be difficult for some to hear," Husic said.

Palestinians in Gaza are being collectively punished, two Labor ministers say
"Israel has described what happened on October 7 [as] Israel's equivalent of 9/11. The number of Palestinians that 
have been killed so far equates to the number of people who lost their lives in 9/11. We don't see any public 
landmarks in Australia that are being lit up in red, black, white and green.
"Now, there'll be people that are very uncomfortable with me making that remark. But it goes to the heart of what 
Palestinians and those who care for them in Australia [think], which is that Palestinian lives are considered lesser 
than."
Aly, a counter-terrorism expert who was born in Egypt, backed Husic's comments.
"I feel the pain of Australian Palestinians, Muslim and Christian. I feel the pain of Australian Muslims, and I know 
that Palestinians have for a long time felt that they have not been seen and have not been heard, that they have 
been forgotten by the international community, and I want to acknowledge that to them."
Parliament has been divided this week over its response to the unfolding war. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has 
urged the protection of civilian lives while asserting Israel's right to self-defence, while Opposition Leader Peter 
Dutton said Israel should show no restraint in retaliating to Hamas' attacks.
The Greens this week voted in parliament to condemn Israel of war crimes in motions that were voted down in both 
houses.

Labor senator Fatima Payman, who was born in Afghanistan, spoke out in the Senate on Tuesday when she said 
Israel's right to defend itself could not equate to the annihilation of Palestinian civilians.
"Yet today, the world watches, the state of Israel deprives an entire population - men, women and children - of the 
basic necessities of life: food, water, electricity, gas and medicines. We must condemn it," she said.
Aly on Thursday said it was "hard to argue that this is not a form of collective punishment".
"The idea of war crimes is something that needs to be investigated," she said. "I would be loath to claim war crimes 
without a full investigation, that is how international law operates. But I would say and I would urge Israel to abide 
by international laws on the rules of engagement."
Husic said there had been strong and dehumanising language used about Palestinians - referring to them as 
animals or collateral damage - which affected wider communities and could shape government decisions.
Regarding Israel's actions, he said: "Governments are different to terrorist organisations. [With] governments, there 
is a higher expectation that there will be a protection of innocent lives."
He also said he strongly felt there had been no practical commitment to a two-state solution, which is Labor policy.
"Speaking completely frankly, I think there was an important point in time when we sort of started saying: 'It's 
important that there is a two-state solution that we fight for that'," he said.
"What I'm genuinely concerned about now, is that this is spoken more as a way in which we can just comfort 
ourselves at these points. And then when the situation and the tension subside, nothing practically happens."
Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil said she was proud to sit with Husic in cabinet, when asked about his 
comments. However, she did not say the government should rethink how it talks about the conflict.
"Israel does have a right to defend itself. It has just suffered a heinous and barbaric terrorist attack including young 
people massacred at a music event," she said.Page 3 of 3

"We've got lots of people on different sides of this conflict who are feeling it really deeply, and I just want them to 
know that the Australian government grieves all loss of innocent life, whether it's a Jewish Israeli who has died or a 
Palestinian Muslim."
She also said there had been no progress on evacuating 46 Australians who are stuck in Gaza. Meanwhile, 
evacuations have continued for Australian citizens from Tel Aviv, where two flights were due to leave on Thursday.

The following information was released by the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia:
This week the Minister for Early Childhood Education and Youth, Dr Anne Aly, will travel to Amman, Jordan on 
behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to attend an international conference convened by Egypt, Jordan and the 
United Nations on the urgent humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Australia has been advocating for urgent humanitarian assistance to reach Palestinians in Gaza in desperate 
need. We have been clear that Israel must comply with the binding orders of the International Court of Justice, 
including to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance at scale.
Since the conflict began on 7 October, Australia has committed $62.5 million in humanitarian assistance to the 
region, including $41 million to address urgent needs in Gaza. Our funding is being directed to conflict-affected 
people with a focus on women and children, including to support food, water, medicines, and shelter.
The conference, known as International Call to Action: Urgent Humanitarian Response for Gaza, will be held on 11 
June local time.
Quotes attributable to Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon Penny Wong:
"This war must end. The human suffering in Gaza is unacceptable. Australia has been part of the international 
push for a ceasefire, for humanitarian aid to reach Gazans in desperate need, and for hostages to be released. 
Australia's participation in this conference is part of that international effort.
"Dr Anne Aly and her family are among many in the Australian community who have lived experience and 
understanding of the long and devastating conflict in the Middle East. We are fortunate that Dr Aly will bring her 
deep professional expertise and her perspectives as an Egyptian-born Australian in representing our country at this 
conference hosted by Egypt, Jordan and the UN."
Quotes attributable to Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth, the Hon Dr Anne Aly MP:

DR ANNE ALY TO REPRESENT AUSTRALIA AT GAZA HUMANITARIAN CONFERENCE
"The humanitarian situation in Gaza is catastrophic. Over one million Palestinians are facing catastrophic levels of 
food insecurity and around 1.7 million people have been displaced, many several times over. Humanitarian access 
remains grossly inadequate.
"Our participation in this conference will emphasise Australia's ongoing support for diplomatic efforts to end the 
conflict and to address the humanitarian crisis."

Early Childhood Education Minister Anne Aly will represent Australia at the UN-backed Middle East emergency 
talks, which will be held Tuesday in Jordan's capital Amman, to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
Aly will join U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the international conference organized by Egypt and Jordan, 
and backed by the United Nations.
"This conference is an opportunity for Australia to continue to use its respective voice to call for a ceasefire," Aly 
told SBS World News before her departure, SBS News  reported.
Aly, an outspoken critic of Israel's military operations in Gaza, has maintained that the loss of thousands of 
Palestinian lives to reportedly remove Hamas is "absolutely not" worth it.
About 36,801 civilians have reportedly lost their lives and thousands have been forced to flee from Gaza since 
Israel began its offensive against Hamas.
"War has rules and war has standards that are agreed upon by the international community, and if Israel wants to 
call this a war, then they must abide by those rules," she said.
"It is absolutely unacceptable, the number of civilian casualties that have been lost."
Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong said Aly, an Egyptian-born Australian, would bring her professional expertise 
to the talks, AAP reported .
"The human suffering in Gaza is unacceptable," Wong said on Monday. "Australia has been part of the 
international push for a ceasefire, for humanitarian aid to reach Gazans in desperate need, and for hostages to be 
released. Australia's participation in this conference is part of that international effort."

Calling the humanitarian situation in Gaza "catastrophic," Aly said Australia will support the diplomatic efforts to 
end the war in the region.
"Our participation in this conference will emphasize Australia's ongoing support for diplomatic efforts to end the 
conflict and to address the humanitarian crisis," she said.
Defense Industry Minister Pat Conroy too called for a ceasefire in Gaza. "It's fair to say that as a conflict has gone 
on, and we've been horrified by the images that we've been seeing, and that's why we've been steadfast in calling 
for a humanitarian ceasefire," he told ABC's Radio National.
The federal government has pledged AU$62.5 million in humanitarian aid, with AU$41 million directed to Gaza, 
since Israel began military operations against Hamas in October 2023.
