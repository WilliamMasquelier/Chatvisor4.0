If you're employed at an office where working from home has not been welcome after COVID lockdowns, asking for 
flexible working conditions may feel daunting.
People and management experts in Canberra have some suggestions that may help you ask for what you need.
Those who can complete their official duties just as well from home, it is worthwhile reminding yourself of the 
benefits of flexible working to build confidence. There's also evidence you can use.
A survey by tech firm CISCO in 2022 reported on Australian experiences in hybrid workplaces. Respondents 
belonged to industries including public service, healthcare, agriculture, IT, NGOs, finance, and food and beverage 
workers.
About 84 per cent of 1042 Australians who participated in the study said they saved $US180 (now $AU268) on 
average per week.
Some also reported eating healthier (65 per cent), becoming physically fitter (69.5 per cent), feeling happier (84.7 
per cent) and improving their work-life balance (82.4 per cent) . More than half of them also said their relationships 
with family and friends had improved.
Empower yourself with solutions and evidence Once you've decided to speak to your manager, review your job 
description and see which parts allowed for remote working.
Dr Jennifer Loh, professor in management at the University of Canberra, said it's good to be prepared with solutions 
for your boss, of how you plan to complete your duties. This will give them confidence you are capable of 
performing well even from home.
"It opens up that discussion in terms of, 'this task does not need me to be on site, can I maybe work from home half 
a day? I'll take care of everything, I can use the computer'," she said.

Want to work from home? Here's how to ask your boss
"The employer will then obviously have to recognize they need to be flexible because the responsibility of that 
particular employees does not need them to be on site," she said.
According to demographer Dr Liz Allen, from the Australian National University, ACT's population flows and 
workforce suggest that employees possess significant power.
"If you are a good employee, and you have demonstrated that loyalty with your employer, you should not fear 
asking for flexible working arrangements," Dr Allen said.
"From a demographic point of view, they have a lot more power than they realise, particularly in Canberra. Workers 
who are not having success in their current workplace might have the opportunity to go and negotiate more flexible 
working arrangements elsewhere."
"At the end of the day, data tends not to lie and the data is very clear - Australian workers want and need flexibility," 
Dr Allen said. "We will be living with Covid for the future time and we need to be better at responding and dealing 
with the challenges that that poses."
What can employers do? Dr Loh said employers could help facilitate this conversation by being transparent with 
their staff. Providing a forum, not during a one-on-one chat, for open communication where employees find out 
about their rights, enterprise agreements and relevant processes.
"[Managers] need to disseminate information, widely and officially ... where everybody appreciates their approach 
towards managing and leading," she said.
On the other hand, the CISCO study also reported about 58 per cent of Australian respondents believed they faced 
challenges in fully engaging with their company and coworkers during hybrid working.
To address this issue, employers and employees needed to work together creatively and flexibly to maintain a good 
standard of productivity and job satisfaction, Dr Loh said.

speaking to a union representative)
Gather evidence you can use to mount your case (loyalty, productivity, job description)
Provide solutions and arrangements that serve you and your employer (WFH on designated days/ half days/ one

More than a quarter of Australian companies have banned artificial intelligence tools in the workplace, citing privacy 
concerns, including the potential for corporate secrets to be shared with competitors, according to a new study.
Communications technology titan Cisco surveyed more than 2600 security and privacy professionals across 12 
countries, which revealed businesses were unplugging the much-hyped technology - for now.
This is despite bigger businesses beginning to reap productivity gains from the much-hyped technology, which the 
Albanese government expects will inject up to $600bn a year into the national economy by 2030. But, Cisco ANZ's 
director of cybersecurity Corien Vermaak said trust remains a big hurdle in fuelling AI's widespread adoption. Ms 
Vermaak said 27 per cent of Australian companies surveyed had banned the use of generative AI applications due 
to privacy risks.
Of that number, 77 per cent were worried corporate information entered into AI apps could be shared publicly or 
with competitors, while 69 per cent were concerned it could hurt their legal or intellectual property rights.
"As we do security awareness training, we now need to focus on that narrative on AI as well," Ms Vermaak said.
The Productivity Commission also found low levels of public trust in AI technologies could pose a "significant 
barrier" to uptake. But, it said governments should act as "exemplars" to demonstrate the safe and effective uses of 
AI in service delivery.

"As we do security awareness training, we now need to focus on that narrative on AI as well," Ms Vermaak said.
"Where organisations are unsure, they've banned it. What that tells me is a lot of organisations are looking to put 
the controls in place, are looking to educate, message and see where they can improve their processes before 
allowing it. My sense would be over the next few years we will see that decreasing." While bigger companies have 
signed up to tailored enterprise AI products, like Microsoft's Copilot, which has guardrails built in to protect 
corporate data, others do not have a clear strategy, with employees at some using publicly available AI platforms, 
sometimes without their managers' knowledge.
"One of the examples in our framework is that when an employee uses any generative AI tool, they have to actually 
disclose it. And, and that's a really important thing, because it changes the perception of the receiver of that work," 
Ms Vermaak said.

"There's two things that organisations and companies need to start with. That is the education part, which is 
critically important. And then putting in policies and frameworks to put guardrails up for when is it OK to use it.
" 'Can I use ChatGPT? Yes, you can use it for private things on your work device, but you can't use it for any work-
related matters' if that is what the company's risk acceptance is." The Productivity Commission also found that low 
levels of public trust in AI technologies could pose a "significant barrier" to uptake. But, it said governments should 
act as "exemplars" to demonstrate the safe and effective uses of AI in service delivery. Collete Stallbaumer, general 
manager of Microsoft 365, said it was still early days and companies were moving at different speeds.

SpaceX on the move Elon Musk's SpaceX is seeking to convert its business incorporation to Texas from Delaware. 
The Secretary of State of Texas on Wednesday issued a certificate evidencing the acceptance and filing of the 
conversion. The rocket company's move comes two weeks after a Delaware court ordered Musk to give up a Tesla 
compensation package valued at $US55.8bn. "Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware," Musk 
wrote on X following the court's decision, noting that shareholders would be able to vote on whether to move 
Tesla's incorporation to Texas.
Publishing spat Arena Group Holdings said it would continue publishing the print and digital editions of Sports 
Illustrated as it continued negotiating with the publication's owner, Authentic Brands Group. Arena, which also 
publishes TheStreet and Men's Journal, said there was an unresolved claim of $US45m against the company by 
Authentic, and it would continue to publish Sports Illustrated until the issue was resolved. The publisher previously 
missed a payment to Authentic, which licenses the Sports Illustrated brand to Arena. Under the publishing deal 
between the two, Authentic has the right to terminate its licensing agreement, which Authentic did. Arena on 
Wednesday also named Cavitt Randall as the company's next chief executive. Arena said in a regulatory filing that 
Randall was appointed chairman of the board January 23 and had previously served as CEO of investment firm 
MBX Clearing and operating chief of SI Capital. Randall, 46, has agreed to an annual salary of $US1, according to 
the filing.
Cisco axes staff Cisco Systems plans to cut about 5 per cent of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan to 
realign its business and enable further investment in key areas. The networking equipment company estimates it 
will recognise pre-tax charges of about $US800m, which will be primarily cash-based. It expects to take the majority 
of these actions in the third quarter and recognise about $US500m of these charges. Cisco expects about 
$US150m of the charges to be recognised in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and the remaining amount primarily 
through the first half of fiscal 2025. Cisco had about 84,900 employees as of July 29.
Morgan Stanley cuts Morgan Stanley plans to cut several hundred jobs in its wealth management division as new 
chief executive Ted Pick seeks to rein in costs in an area that is critical to the Wall Street firm's success but has 
shown signs of weakening lately. The cuts, which include a small number of managing directors as well as non-
customer-facing employees, are expected to hit less than 1 per cent of the wealth unit's employees, which number 
less than 40,000 in total. Affected employees are expected to be notified as soon as this week, according to people

Nvidia chief executive officer Jensen Huang said artificial intelligence had hit a "tipping point," sending the stock to 
new dizzying heights.
The renewed rally has Huang, known for his love of wearing leather jackets, on the verge of his own breakthrough: 
becoming one of the 20 richest people in the world.
Huang's wealth jumped $US9.6 billion ($14.7 billion) to $US69.2 billion, a gain that leapfrogged him ahead of 
Charles Koch and Chinese bottled-water tycoon Zhong Shanshan to 21st place on the Bloomberg Billionaires 
Index. It's a remarkable rise for the co-founder of the semiconductor company, who was ranked 128th with a net 
worth of $US13.5 billion as recently as early last year.
Nvidia surged 16 per cent to a record high on Thursday in New York, adding about $US277 billion in market value. 
That was the biggest single-session increase in market history, beating Meta's $US197 billion gain earlier this 
month. The company was able to exceed sky-high investor expectations with a revenue forecast that was more 
than $US2 billion ahead of analyst expectations.
Nvidia's rally boosted the fortunes of the 30 billionaires on Bloomberg's wealth list who attribute at least some of 
their wealth to AI by a combined $US42.8 billion. Charles Liang, CEO of Super Micro Computer, was the biggest 
winner on a percentage basis with a 33 per cent jump.
Nvidia's outlook extends a streak of the company shattering expectations, thanks to insatiable demand for its 
artificial intelligence accelerators - highly prized chips that crunch data for AI models. The technology has helped 
power a proliferation of chatbots and other generative AI services, which can create text and graphics based on 
simple prompts.
"Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point," Huang said. "Demand is surging worldwide 
across companies, industries and nations."

Nvidia's market capitalisation has now increased by more than $US650 billion this year - bringing its valuation to 
$US1.89 trillion - as investors bet that the company will remain the prime beneficiary of an AI computing boom.
That turned Wednesday's report into a highly anticipated event for both Wall Street and the tech world. And the 
numbers - along with the upbeat tone from Huang - renewed confidence that spending will stay strong.
"The entire market is watching this report and expectations have been elevated," Wolfe Research analyst Chris 
Caso said.
Guidance was strong enough to "demonstrate continued momentum, while also leaving room for continued upside 
through the second half."
Nvidia, co-founded by Huang in 1993, got its start as a provider of graphics cards for computer gamers. Its profile 
blew up in the last two years, when its technology proved adept at handling heavy AI workloads. The company's 
H100 accelerators have become legendary in the tech world, with customers scrambling to get their hands on as 
many as possible.
Companies such as Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Alphabet's Google are Nvidia's largest customers, 
accounting for nearly 40 per cent of its revenue, as they rush to invest in hardware for AI computing.
In the US fiscal fourth quarter, which ended January 28, Nvidia's revenue more than tripled to $US22.1 billion. Profit 
excluding certain items was $US5.16 a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $US20.4 billion and earnings 
of $US4.60 a share. Underscoring the magnitude of its recent growth streak: As recently as 2021, Nvidia didn't 
generate that much revenue in an entire year.
Nvidia's data centre division, now by far its largest source of sales, generated $US18.4 billion of revenue, up 409 
per cent from the same period a year earlier. Gaming chips provided $US2.87 billion of sales.
Nvidia is now working to spread its AI technology beyond the big data-centre companies. Huang, 61, has travelled 
the globe arguing that governments and corporations need their own AI systems - both to protect their data and 
gain a competitive advantage.
Nvidia announced a deal with Cisco Systems earlier this month that gives it a new distribution channel. As part of 
that deal, Cisco, the world's biggest provider of networking gear, will help sell complete AI systems to companies.
But Nvidia faces risks, including mounting competition and a push by some customers to develop their own AI 
chips.
"We're going to do our best to compete in that marketplace and succeed in the marketplace," Huang said.

AI is far better than managers at writing rosters - and it won't forget who's away, who can't work nights and to give 
part-timers a minimum of 12 hours a week.
The technology has for several months done just that for customers of Australian tech company Deputy, which 
provides rostering and employment advice for more than a quarter of a million businesses in over half the world's 
countries.
The technology was proving particularly good in hospitality settings, especially busy cafes that had high turnover, 
said Deepesh Banerji, who oversees the product as chief product officer.
"One of the most crushing things for employee engagement is having to work when you're busy or having to come 
into work when you didn't know you had to," he said.
AI Auto Scheduling is one of several products that Mr Banerji - as Deputy's resident AI chief - helped to shape, 
including a tool that can write job descriptions based on the data Deputy has about a business.
The 41-year-old, who studied maths and engineering at the University of Waterloo in Canada, is one of dozens of 
executives across the country who have been tasked with managing one of the fastest-growing technologies in the 
world.
Sometimes it can be hard to explain, Mr Banerji simply says: "It's all about intelligent machines that are making 
decisions, understanding information and recommending things." Mr Banerji said he tells friends the best way to 
understand the technology is to use it, and often recommends they try ChatGPT.
The technology had made several changes to the way the Deputy staff worked in recent years, with the company 
having developed its own large language model. "Our knowledge bases have the ability to ask questions on our 
internal internet," he said.
Page 2 of 2
Working out staff rosters 'best left to AI'
As for his AI prediction for the year, Mr Banerji has a similar view to Seek AI chief Grant Wright - "AI agents helping 
in the workplace," he said. Agents would not only schedule staff but make assessments of who might be the best at 
a particular role, choosing who might work the register and who might be better on the floor selling clothes.
At big four bank ANZ, chief technology officer Tim Hogarth, who studied business information systems and 
information technology at the University of South Australia, holds the reins on AI.
Prior to ANZ he worked as vice-president of innovation at TD bank in Canada and as head of application platform at 
CBA.
While most financial institutions have major technology teams, Mr Hogarth said it was important to remember "we're 
a bank first". He said: "When people write code it's 'if this, then that' - it's deterministic. But there's a whole bunch of 
problems we can't solve with 'if this, then that'.
"The way I explain it is I have both Taylor Swift and AC/DC in my playlist. You can't write rules to say 'this chief 
technical officer used to work in Canada, then play these songs'. But Spotify uses patterns and they discover music 
I like and overlap that with what other people like and it finds patterns between them." When it came to banking, he 
said: "AI can essentially find trends and implement solutions faster than we can interpret them and write the code 
ourselves." And in 2024, the technology is now brought several times a day. "It has changed from being one of the 
technologies that was occasionally mentioned to every single conversation," he said.
Mr Hogarth said he believed Australia had not yet seen the full innovation AI would bring. "We're at the bottom of 
the S curve," he said.
He wants Australia to be at the forefront of the revolution rather than "play catch-up", and that could happen if 
Australia didn't capitalise on the opportunity.
US multinational Cisco might have one of Australia's most senior AI executives, with 28-year veteran Carl Solder 
leading the charge.
Mr Solder is chief technology officer of ANZ, a role he took up after briefly leaving Cisco after spending several 
years as vice-president of engineering, based in Silicon Valley in California.
"AI is software that intends to mimic human intelligence," Mr Solder said. "A traditional computer program follows a 
set of fixed instructions to perform an outcome that's always the same. With AI, the outcome you'll get is going to be 
a little bit more fluid." Last year Cisco conducted a global AI readiness that found just 5 per cent of Australian 
customers were ready to adopt AI. That same report found 59 per cent of respondents believed they had just 12 
months to adopt AI, which leaves him to the conclusion that companies would race to adopt the technology either 
through off-the-shelf products from the company or going out creating their own AI product.

Beiling's buy-local policy has hit US tech giants hard For American tech companies in China, the writing is on the 
wall. It's also on paper, in Document 79.
The 2022 Chinese government directive expands a drive that is muscling US technology out of the country - an 
effort some refer to as "Delete A", for Delete America.
Document 79 was so sensitive that high-ranking officials and executives were only shown the order and weren't 
allowed to make copies, sources say. It requires state-owned companies in finance, energy and other sectors to 
replace foreign software in their IT systems by 2027.
American tech giants had long thrived in China as they hot-wired the country's meteoric industrial rise with 
computers, operating systems and software. Chinese leaders want to sever that relationship, driven by a push for 
self-sufficiency and concerns over the country's long-term security.
The first targets were hardware makers. Dell, IBM and Cisco Systems have gradually seen much of their 
equipment replaced by products from Chinese competitors.
Document 79, named for the numbering on the paper, targets companies that provide the software enabling daily 
business operations from basic office tools to supply chain management. The likes of Microsoft and Oracle are 
losing ground in the field, one of the last bastions of foreign tech profitability in the country.
The effort is just one salvo in a year-long push by Chinese leader Xi Jinping for self-sufficiency in everything from 
critical technology such as semiconductors and fighter jets to the production of grain and oilseeds. The broader 
strategy is to make China less dependent on the West for food, raw materials and energy, and instead focus on 
domestic supply chains.
Officials in Beijing issued Document 79 in September 2022, as the US was ratcheting up chip export restrictions 
and sanctions on Chinese tech companies. It requires state-owned firms to provide quarterly updates on their 
Page 2 of 4

progress in replacing foreign software used for email, human resources and business manage-ment with Chinese 
alternatives.
The directive came down from the agency overseeing the country's massive state-owned enterprise sector - a 
group that includes more than 60 of China's 100 largest listed companies.
That agency, the State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, and the country's national 
cabinet, the State Council, didn't respond to requests for comment.
Spending by China's state sector topped 48 trillion yuan ($10 trillion) in 2022. The directive leverages that 
purchasing power to support Chinese tech companies, which in turn can improve their products and narrow the 
technology gap with US rivals.
State firms have ramped up their buying of domestic brands, even if the Chinese substitutes sometimes aren't as 
good. The buyers include banks, financial brokerages and public services such as the postal system.
Back in 2006, "China was the land of milk and honey, and intellectual property was the main challenge", says a 
former US Trade Representative official involved in previous technology discussions with the Chinese. "Now, there 
is a feeling that the sense of opportunity is off. Companies are merely hanging on." The push to localise tech is 
known as Xinchuang, loosely translated as "IT innovation" with a reference to technology that is secure and 
trustworthy. The policy has gained urgency amid an escalating tech and trade war with Washington, which has cut 
many Chinese entities off from American technologies.
Premier Li Qiang reiterated the push during China's annual legislative sessions this week. China's central 
government plans to increase its spending on science and technology by 10 per cent to about $US51bn ($77bn) 
this year, according to a budget report released on Tuesday - up from a 2 per cent increase last year.
At some trade fairs across the country, vendors tout homegrown tech as an alternative to foreign brands. One 
semiconductor equipment maker stall in Nanjing put it bluntly, offering to help buyers "Delete A" from their supply 
chain.
Domestic alternatives are growing more user-friendly. A local official recalled how in 2016, it took a whole day to 
open and close a spreadsheet on a computer with an operating system known as KylinOS, developed by a Chinese 
military-linked company. He compares the usability of the latest KylinOS version to Microsoft's Windows 7, 
introduced in 2009 - workable if not great.
As recently as six years ago, most government tenders sought hardware, chips and software from Western brands. 
By 2023, many were seeking Chinese tech products instead. When the customs department in the eastern Chinese 
city of Ningbo sought to purchase rack servers in 2018, it stated a preference for brands such as Dell and Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise, and for hardware powered by Intel's Xeon central processing units. Five years later, the same 
agency asked for rack servers made by Chinese companies and equipped with Huawei chips.
These servers are typically assembled by state-owned tech manufacturers that barely sell equipment overseas, 
such as Beijing-based Tsinghua Tongfang. Tongfang's controlling shareholder is a state-owned company in charge 
of China's civilian and military nuclear programs.
Some government officials in China's capital had their foreign-branded PCs replaced with those made by Tongfang 
and officials last year were told to use Chinese phones instead of Apple's iPhones for work.
Over the past decade, Xi has repeatedly emphasised technological innovation and the use of trusted homegrown 
technology in government departments and industry. Revelations by former National Security Agency contractor 
Edward Snowden in 2013 that US authorities had hacked into Chinese mobile phone communications, universities 
and private companies strengthened Xi's resolve. More recently, he has told senior officials that China should 
leverage its strengths and market to break bottlenecks in the development of essential software such as operating 
systems.Page 3 of 4

As China focused on replacing hardware, IBM's China revenues have steadily declined. It downsized its China 
research operations in Beijing in 2021, more than two decades after it opened.
Cisco, once a technology powerhouse in China, said in 2019 that it was losing orders in the country to local 
vendors. PC maker Dell's market share in China has almost halved in the past five years, to 8 per cent. Hewlett 
Packard Enterprise, which makes servers, storage and networks, got 14.1 per cent of its revenue from China in 
2018, according to estimates from FactSet. By 2023, that had fallen to 4 per cent.
In May, HPE said it would sell its 49 per cent stake in its Chinese joint venture. The company continues to sell direct 
to multinational customers in China and sells selected products to the broader mainland market through its Chinese 
partner.
In software, Adobe, Citrix parent Cloud Software Group and Salesforce have pulled out or downsized direct 
operations in the country over the past two years.
Microsoft, the world's biggest software provider, historically dominated computer operating systems in China. A 
Morgan Stanley poll of 135 chief information officers in China found that many expected the share of computers 
powered by Microsoft's Windows operating system installed in their companies to fall over the next three years. 
They expected Linux-based UOS, or Unity Operating System, an effort co-led by a state-owned company, to gain in 
the shift. Even as Microsoft's top executives and co-founder Bill Gates have frequently travelled to Beijing for high-
profile meetings with Chinese leaders on subjects like co-operation on AI and US-China trade relations in recent 
years, the company has decreased its offerings in China. Microsoft president Brad Smith said in a subcommittee 
hearing last September that China made up just 1.5 per cent of its overall sales. The company posted sales of 
$US212bn in the last fiscal year.
Some state-owned companies are dragging their feet on orders to replace foreign IT products that are essential to 
their core businesses over concerns about the stability and performance of domestic alternatives.
But in addition to becoming more advanced, China's own technology is also plugged into the local ecosystem. 
Providers of domestic business software allow interoperability with WeChat, a ubiquitous chat messaging app 
widely used in place of email among Chinese businesses.
The buy-local policy is trickling down to privately run companies, which are showing greater inclination to buy 
domestic software, according to Morgan Stanley's CIO survey.
A shift towards hosting and managing data on cloud servers instead of servers on the premises has also allowed 
Chinese companies to narrow the gap. Oracle, IBM and Microsoft dominated the database software market in 
China in 2010. Since then, Chinese companies including Alibaba and Huawei have come up with their own 
database management products to replace American technology.
China-based vendors took more than half of that market in China - worth $US6.3bn overall - for the first time in 
2022, and continue to grow, according to researcher Gartner. Tenders examined by the Journal show more state-
linked entities and companies have opted for Huawei's databases in recent years.
China's banks, brokerage firms and insurers had sped up procurement of homegrown databases, Yang Bing, chief 
executive of Chinese database company OceanBase, said at a Beijing conference in November. OceanBase, 
developed by Alibaba and its fintech affiliate Ant Group, replaced Oracle databases at Alibaba and Ant in 2016.
Western companies are being replaced not just by Chinese national champions such as Huawei but also more 
specialised companies. Yonyou Network Technology, a Shanghai-listed firm with a market value of $US6bn, 
provides systems to manage human resources, inventory and finances. Yonyou has been gaining users at the 
expense of Oracle and SAP, which together used to dominate more than half the market.

Cisco Systems has completed its $US28bn ($42.8bn) all-cash acquisition of cyber security and analytics company 
Splunk.
The deal, the largest in Cisco's history, was closed months earlier than projected, reflecting the extraordinary effort 
many companies are undertaking as they remake their businesses around data and artificial intelligence.
Cisco chief executive Chuck Robbins and former Splunk CEO Gary Steele - now an executive vice-president at 
Cisco - said in an interview that AI would be deeply woven into the combined companies, and that they saw no hint 
that the current wave of business AI adoption was going to slow down or reverse course.
The combined company will use AI to help customers draw correlations in intelligence coming from different vendor 
platforms, so that they can take a more predictive approach to cyber security. While that predictive capability has 
been developing for some time, the company also plans to launch more capabilities that make use of generative AI 
to simplify their software and make it easier for people without technical training to operate the tools.
Splunk, launched in 2003, developed a dashboard that allows users to search, monitor and analyse machine-
generated data. It takes training to use it and generative AI helps reduce the learning curve, according to Mr Steele. 
"Splunk has its own proprietary language, the way in which you issue commands, and you have to be reasonably 
technical to do that," he said.
"With the AI assistance that we've launched, you can use English language to automatically generate that 
proprietary language. You can get outcomes without having all the advanced knowledge." Splunk's AI would benefit 
from Cisco's massive amounts of data, not to mention its global presence and sales and marketing channels, Mr 
Steele said.
Generative AI will have other applications across Cisco's business, such as simplifying the complex task of setting 
a configuration screen for a company's security policy, according to Mr Robbins. "It's very technical. We're going to 
enable our customers to just use English language to describe what security capabilities they would like â€¦ and 
then we will translate that into a policy that they would review," he said.

The software will function as an assistant, simplifying and speeding up the deployment of security policy and other 
resources without replacing human operators, according to Mr Robbins.
When the deal was announced in September 2023, the companies said it expected it to be completed by the end of 
September 2024. The process was completed in roughly half a year. Last week, the European Union gave the deal 
unconditional antitrust approval, after regulators found it wouldn't pose barriers to competition. Networking 
equipment pioneer Cisco, founded in 1984, rode the telecommunications boom of the 1990s. It was for a time the 
most valuable company in the world.

Highlight: Cisco will reportedly eliminate 4000 jobs in a second round of layoffs this year, as it moves its focus to 
areas such as cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.
Body
Cisco Systems plans to eliminate thousands more jobs in a second round of layoffs this year, Reuters reported, as 
the networking equipment maker shifts its focus to faster-growing businesses such as cybersecurity and artificial 
intelligence.
The news follows Cisco's move to cut about 4000 jobs in February after a slowdown in corporate tech spending 
wiped out its sales growth. The company had almost 85,000 workers at the end of fiscal 2023, which ran to July of 
that year.
Cisco joins other tech companies in paring jobs as they cope with uneven demand. Though AI spending has 
helped fuel growth in some areas, traditional information technology giants have not benefited as much.
Intel announced plans this month to slash 15,000 jobs as it contends with sluggish sales. Dell Technologies is also 
cutting positions as part of a reorganisation of its sales teams.
Cisco shares fell as much as 1.3 per cent to $US45.24 in New York. They were down 9.3 per cent this year 
heading into Friday's session.
The latest job cuts could be announced as early as Wednesday when the company reports fourth-quarter results, 
according to Reuters.
Three months ago, an upbeat Cisco forecast sparked hope that IT customers had picked up spending again. But 
the broader tech industry has been dogged by more recent concerns about the economy - and the idea that AI 
spending might not have a near-term payoff.
A representative for Cisco declined to comment on layoff plans.
Over the longer term, chief executive Chuck Robbins has been trying to transform Cisco into a provider of 
networking services and software, rather than a company focused on one-time sales of hardware.
It also looks to capitalise more on the AI boom that has fuelled sales for companies such as Nvidia. Last year, the 
company made a big move into the cybersecurity market with the $US28 billion acquisition of software firm Splunk.

Transport & AI, UNSW Sydney
Highlight: AI systems more intelligent than humans in some ways already exist - but general-purpose superhuman 
intelligence is probably still a long way off.
Body
In 2014, the British philosopher Nick Bostrom published a book about the future of artificial intelligence (AI) with the 
ominous title Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies. It proved highly influential in promoting the idea that 
advanced AI systems - "superintelligences" more capable than humans - might one day take over the world and 
destroy humanity.
A decade later, OpenAI boss Sam Altman says superintelligence may only be " a few thousand days" away. A year 
ago, Altman's OpenAI cofounder Ilya Sutskever set up a team within the company to focus on " safe 
superintelligence", but he and his team have now raised a billion dollars to create a startup of their own to pursue 
this goal.
What exactly are they talking about? Broadly speaking, superintelligence is anything more intelligent than humans. 
But unpacking what that might mean in practice can get a bit tricky.
Different kinds of AI
In my view the most useful way to think about different levels and kinds of intelligence in AI was developed by US 
computer scientist Meredith Ringel Morris and her colleagues at Google.
Their framework lists six levels of AI performance: no AI, emerging, competent, expert, virtuoso and superhuman. It 
also makes an important distinction between narrow systems, which can carry out a small range of tasks, and more 
general systems.
A narrow, no-AI system is something like a calculator. It carries out various mathematical tasks according to a set of 
explicitly programmed rules.
Page 2 of 3
What is AI superintelligence? Could it destroy humanity? And is it really almost here?
There are already plenty of very successful narrow AI systems. Morris gives the Deep Blue chess program that 
famously defeated world champion Garry Kasparov way back in 1997 as an example of a virtuoso-level narrow AI 
system. 
Some narrow systems even have superhuman capabilities. One example is Alphafold, which uses machine learning 
to predict the structure of protein molecules, and whose creators won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry this year. 
What about general systems? This is software that can tackle a much wider range of tasks, including things like 
learning new skills. 
A general no-AI system might be something like Amazon's Mechanical Turk: it can do a wide range of things, but it 
does them by asking real people. 
Overall, general AI systems are far less advanced than their narrow cousins. According to Morris, the state-of-the-
art language models behind chatbots such as ChatGPT are general AI - but they are so far at the "emerging" level 
(meaning they are  "equal to or somewhat better than an unskilled human"), and yet to reach "competent" (as good 
as 50% of skilled adults). 
So by this reckoning, we are still some distance from general superintelligence.
How intelligent is AI right now?
As Morris points out, precisely determining where any given system sits would depend on having reliable tests or 
benchmarks. 
Depending on our benchmarks, an image-generating system such as DALL-E might be at virtuoso level (because it 
can produce images 99% of humans could not draw or paint), or it might be emerging (because it produces errors 
no human would, such as mutant hands and impossible objects). 
There is significant debate even about the capabilities of current systems. One notable 2023 paper argued GPT-4 
showed "sparks of artificial general intelligence".
OpenAI says its latest language model, o1, can "perform complex reasoning" and "rivals the performance of human 
experts" on many benchmarks.
However, a recent paper from Apple researchers found o1 and many other language models have significant 
trouble solving genuine mathematical reasoning problems. Their experiments show the outputs of these models 
seem to resemble sophisticated pattern-matching rather than true advanced reasoning. This indicates 
superintelligence is not as imminent as many have suggested.
Will AI keep getting smarter?
Some people think the rapid pace of AI progress over the past few years will continue or even accelerate. Tech 
companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in AI hardware and capabilities, so this doesn't seem 
impossible.
If this happens, we may indeed see general superintelligence within the "few thousand days" proposed by Sam 
Altman (that's a decade or so in less scifi terms). Sutskever and his team mentioned a similar timeframe in their 
superalignment article.
Many recent successes in AI have come from the application of a technique called "deep learning", which, in 
simplistic terms, finds associative patterns in gigantic collections of data. Indeed, this year's Nobel Prize in Physics 
has been awarded to John Hopfield and also the " Godfather of AI" Geoffrey Hinton, for their invention of Hopfield 
Networks and Boltzmann machine, which are the foundation for many powerful deep learning models used today.  Page 3 of 3
What is AI superintelligence? Could it destroy humanity? And is it really almost here?
General systems such as ChatGPT have relied on data generated by humans, much of it in the form of text from 
books and websites. Improvements in their capabilities have largely come from increasing the scale of the systems 
and the amount of data on which they are trained. 
However, there may not be enough human-generated data to take this process much further (although efforts to 
use data more efficiently, generate synthetic data, and improve transfer of skills between different domains may 
bring improvements). Even if there were enough data, some researchers say language models such as ChatGPT 
are fundamentally incapable of reaching what Morris would call general competence. 
One recent paper has suggested an essential feature of superintelligence would be open-endedness, at least from 
a human perspective. It would need to be able to continuously generate outputs that a human observer would 
regard as novel and be able to learn from. 
Existing foundation models are not trained in an open-ended way, and existing open-ended systems are quite 
narrow. This paper also highlights how either novelty or learnability alone is not enough. A new type of open-ended 
foundation model is needed to achieve superintelligence.
What are the risks?
So what does all this mean for the risks of AI? In the short term, at least, we don't need to worry about 
superintelligent AI taking over the world.
But that's not to say AI doesn't present risks. Again, Morris and co have thought this through: as AI systems gain 
great capability, they may also gain greater autonomy. Different levels of capability and autonomy present different 
risks.
For example, when AI systems have little autonomy and people use them as a kind of consultant - when we ask 
ChatGPT to summarise documents, say, or let the YouTube algorithm shape our viewing habits - we might face a 
risk of over-trusting or over-relying on them. 
In the meantime, Morris points out other risks to watch out for as AI systems become more capable, ranging from 
people forming parasocial relationships with AI systems to mass job displacement and society-wide ennui. 
What's next?
Let's suppose we do one day have superintelligent, fully autonomous AI agents. Will we then face the risk they 
could concentrate power or act against human interests?
Not necessarily. Autonomy and control can go hand in hand. A system can be highly automated, yet provide a high 
level of human control. 
Like many in the AI research community, I believe safe superintelligence is feasible. However, building it will be a 
complex and multidisciplinary task, and researchers will have to tread unbeaten paths to get there.

Australian companies have been given an artificial intelligence reality check, with 58 per cent that have invested in 
artificial programs and applications saying the technology has fallen short of expectations.
Meanwhile, about 70 per cent of investors have pulled out of active deals due to AI consideration. Cisco's AI 
readiness index, undertaken for the second time this year, found 38 per cent of companies had allocated between 
10 to 30 per cent of their IT budget to AI, despite many not seeing a return on the investment.
The firm's Australian chief technology officer Carl Solder said Cisco's index found about half of the companies 
surveyed found assistance from AI with processes and operations did not hit the mark. About 44 per cent saw either 
no or not enough improvement in the technology automating their business.
"I think the reality is that they started to appreciate the work and effort involved in getting all those building blocks 
squared away, and the strategy, infrastructure data governance, talent and culture," he said. "The reality is that 
maybe there is a bit more work that we have to do to be fully prepared." Cisco's Index measured the responses of 
3660 senior business leaders from companies with 500 or more staff across 14 countries in the Asia Pacific. The 
index found just 4 per cent of the country was in a position to leverage AI, a figure that dropped from 5 per cent the 
previous year. Mr Solder said 92 per cent of companies were facing increasing pressure to adopt AI despite much 
of it not showing a return on investment over the past year. Most of that pressure came from company chief 
executives and boards.

La Trobe University, Media Release, 5 December 2024
A smart irrigation system powered by artificial intelligence will tell sugarcane farmers when and where to water their 
crops in an advance that could one day revolutionise agriculture – and help preserve the health of the Great Barrier 
Reef.
Developed by Victoria’s La Trobe University for far-north Queensland ag-tech company Aglantis, the intelligent 
irrigation system uses the Internet of Things to automate water pump management and monitor sunlight, 
temperature and humidity levels without human interaction.

The system was initially conceived as a project to improve land management and prevent fertiliser run-off from 
farms into the Great Barrier Reef, but with new technology making smart irrigation more affordable, Aglantis 
managing director Luke Malan said the potential of the product was almost limitless.
In addition to saving water, future AI additions could teach the system how to conserve energy, responding to solar 
or energy tariffs. It could also examine soil profiles and make intelligent choices around crop selection and yields.
“It essentially takes the guesswork out of farming,” Luke said. “With growing pressures on profitability, it’s more 
imperative to know what you’re doing and how you can do it better. This flips conventional thinking on its head and 
opens the doorway to new possibilities.”

Professor Wei Xiang, Cisco Research Chair and Director of La Trobe University’s Cisco Centre for AI and the 
Internet of Things, said the smart irrigation system was the centre’s first commercial product and showed how 
industry could drive research to tangible and groundbreaking results.
La Trobe is already working with the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), creating the world’s first AI-
powered three-dimensional digital twin of the Great Barrier Reef to monitor its health.
The new smart irrigation system – developed in a one-metre plastic tub housed in the Digital Innovation Hub at La 
Trobe’s Melbourne campus - further enhances the University’s reputation in the AI research space.
The University recently announced its bold ambition to transform research, education, student support and business 
operations by applying an “AI-first” approach.
“Now we've proven the technology, the next step is to add additional features to improve productivity and crop 
yields through leveraging cutting-edge AI technology,” Professor Xiang said. “This will make farming on the whole 
more sustainable."
IoT researchers Kamyar Karimi and Aravindan Madasamy, who developed the system for La Trobe under the 
supervision of Professor Xiang, said it would reduce labour costs, increase water efficiency and allow more 
precision in farm decision-making.
Ultimately, the system design could include intelligent sequencing to determine the perfect order of irrigation across 
different farm sections, predictive maintenance and continuous learning from historical data, seasonal patterns and 
crop responses.

"This technology represents a major shift towards data-driven, sustainable agriculture where AI and IoT optimise 
every drop of water for maximum farming efficiency," Kamyar said.
Aravindan said the development of the smart irrigation system was a transformative step forward for farmers.
"By automating labour-intensive processes and putting control in the hands of advanced technology, farmers can 
save time, conserve resources and focus on other priorities without the stress of manual management.”
The system features an ultra-compact design and precision valve control adjustable to any degree.
It is currently installed on an 80-hectare plot of Mark and Andrew Castelanelli’s farm in the Burdekin region near 
Townsville.
For Mark, who has been a sugarcane farmer for 55 years, smart irrigation heralds the future of farming.
Mark said while other smart systems had been on the market for a few years, this was the first that had been 
purpose-built for the sugarcane industry.
The veteran farmer previously racked up 15,000 kilometres each year driving to irrigate crops within a six-kilometre 
radius on his farm.
Mark said using the smart system to irrigate with precision would save labour costs, increase efficiency and leave 
time to focus on other things.
"There's endless opportunity and the power of computing is just getting smarter."

Australian companies have been given an artificial intelligence reality check, with 58 per cent of those who have 
invested in programs and applications saying the technology has fallen short of -expectations.
Meanwhile, 70 per cent of investors have pulled out of active deals due to AI considerations.
Cisco's AI readiness index, formulated for the second time this year, has found that 38 per cent of companies 
allocate between 10 to 30 per cent of their IT budget to AI, despite many not seeing a return on the investment.
Carl Solder, the company's Australian chief technology officer, said about half of the companies surveyed find AI 
has not hit the mark with processes and operations. About 44 per cent see no improvement or not enough in 
automating their businesses.
"I think the reality is that they started to appreciate the work and effort involved in getting all those building blocks 
squared away, and the strategy, infrastructure data governance, talent and culture," he said.
"The reality is that maybe there is a little bit more work that we have to do to be fully -prepared." Cisco's index 
measured the responses of 3660 senior business leaders from companies with 500 or more staff across 14 
countries in the Asia-Pacific.
The index found just 4 per cent of the country are in a position to leverage AI, down from 5 per cent the previous 
year.
Mr Solder said 92 per cent of companies were facing increasing pressure to adopt AI.
Most of that pressure comes from chief executives and boards and it has risen over the past six months.
"Fifty-six per cent of those organisations said that the pressure has increased significantly," Mr Solder said.
More than one fifth of companies plan to allocate 40 per cent of their IT budget to AI over the next four to five years.

Second thoughts on AI as results fall short
Meanwhile, Bain has found that investors believe generative artificial intelligence will not add much value in 2025, 
believing it will take up to three years to see the full benefit.
A number of investors said that just 20 per cent of their portfolio companies had Generative AI use cases that were 
"delivering value". About 30 per cent of portfolio companies are still testing or developing AI use cases.
Similarly to Cisco, Bain found that AI investments are four times more likely to disappoint investors than they are to 
exceed -expectations.
Over the past 12 months, AI agents - chatbots that use "large language models" to undertake tasks such as reading 
and responding to emails - have been cited as one of the first major uses of the technology.
But Australian workers disagree, with a recent EY report finding that just 37 per cent of employees are comfortable 
with their companies introducing AI assistants and just 31 per cent thinking AI chatbots are helpful for customer 
service.
That report says the integration of AI in the workplace has been met with mixed responses.
More than half of those surveyed are deeply concerned that AI could result in job losses. That fear is greater for 
women: 59 per cent are concerned about job losses, compared to 51 per cent of men.
Meanwhile, 40 per cent are "deeply uncomfortable" with AI being used to monitor their behaviour and 46 per cent 
don't want AI to provide efficiency -recommendations.
Almost half of respondents are uncomfortable with AI taking on employee performance reviews and 52 per cent 
don't wish to be interviewed by a chatbot when going for a new role.
Almost two thirds of respondents - 62 per cent - are worried that employees will attempt to manipulate the way they 
think with AI applications.
EY chief technology officer Katherine Boiciuc said there were real "innovation versus insecurity" and "progress 
versus privacy" issues.
"On the one hand, there's recognition of the benefits AI can bring to business and people, suggesting an openness 
to the potential for it to enhance productivity and improve work-life balance," she said.
"On the other hand, there is a level of discomfort and concern among Australians about the broader implications AI 
might have on their employment, workplace culture and privacy." It was clear AI used in a supervisor-type role "has 
also struck a nerve" and the technology was fuelling "insecurities" in the workplace, especially "among those in 
manual labour/skilled trades and among women".

Highlight: Set-and-forget investing can get good results over long periods, but you'll need to overcome the 
temptation to trade.
Body
Shani Jayamanne is a self-confessed "lazy investor". It's an unusual admission for someone whose day job is 
director and investment specialist at financial services firm Morningstar, but Jayamanne says she "doesn't 
particularly enjoy the art of investing".
"I don't enjoy poring through company reports on a Friday night," she says.
Jayamanne learnt early in her investing journey that stock picking wasn't for her - owning shares directly in 
individual companies made her "incredibly nervous".
"I tend to try to seek out as much information as I can, confirming that I've made the right decision all the time, and 
that's quite exhausting," she says.
Instead, she has adopted a no-hassles, "lazy" approach to her portfolio, investing in managed equity funds and 
exchange-traded funds (ETFs).
Lazy investors lean into diversification, low-cost products and a long investment horizon.
Ashley Owen, who runs a consulting business called Owen Analytics and writes a weekly newsletter about 
investing, says the biggest barriers to lazy investing are an inability to tune out noise and ignore emotions, and 
avoiding the temptation to chase returns, all of which can be costly.
"Human nature is the killer of buy and hold," he says. "You literally have to learn to control yourself to ignore 
frenzied booms and the frenzied busts, and that's very hard to do. Controlling your emotions is the hardest part of 
investing."
Vanguard founder John Bogle and legendary investor Warren Buffett both advise that individual investors can get 
by with a simple portfolio consisting of just two index funds - one covering US shares and one covering US bonds.
But a lazy Australian investor might have 70 per cent invested in growth assets like Australian and global shares, 
with the global shares usually 50 per cent hedged, Owen says.
Page 2 of 4
How to become a lazy investor (and yes, it's a good thing)
The remaining 30 per cent could be in defensive assets such as Australian and global fixed rate investment grade 
government or corporate bonds, with the global component fully hedged.
Owen's own long-term investment portfolio features 10 ETFs, none of which are invested in long-duration bonds, 
which Owen believes won't deliver the same returns over the next 20 years as they have over the past 30 years.
He adds that if someone is establishing a set-and-forget portfolio today, they should also be aware that they're 
"going to be buying shares at a very expensive point in the cycle", with future returns to be lower than average.
ETFs and managed funds
Jayamanne isn't invested in bonds, either. Her portfolio consists of four managed funds and three ETFs tracking 
broad market indexes across Australian and international equities.
Owen says someone with a standard growth portfolio mix - 70 per cent invested in Australian and global shares and 
30 per cent in bonds - achieved a return of about 11 per cent after fees in the 2023-24 financial year. This is the 
asset mix most large superannuation funds use as their "default" option.
"Even after inflation of 4 per cent, a lazy return of 11 per cent is still a very healthy 7 per cent real return for the 
year," he says. "I say 'lazy' because any passive investor would have achieved these returns without trying to chase 
hot stocks or funds or themes or fads, or fiddle with opaque alternatives, or whacky 'new' asset classes, or listened 
to perennial doomsayers prattling on about recessions or political crises or world wars."
Investors using a buy-and-hold strategy need to accept that there will inevitably be periods of outperformance and 
underperformance, Jayamanne says.
But on average, you will perform better compared to someone who tries to time the market by switching in and out 
of investments, she says.
Besides incurring the transaction costs associated with buying and selling, market data for the past 30 years shows 
that if you missed the S&P 500's 10 best days, your returns will be cut in half, Jayamanne says.
"And if you missed the best 30 days ... your return would be 83 per cent lower," she says.
Jayamanne takes the emotion out of her investment decisions by adhering to an investment policy statement, a 
document that outlines exactly what she's investing for and how her investments connect to her financial goals.
"Those sorts of guidelines allow you to sit back and think about why you're making a decision, whether it's 
emotionally driven, whether you're feeling like you're missing out on something, or you're doing it in line with your 
portfolio, your financial goals, and what will benefit you over the long term."
Jayamanne's investment policy statement also includes parameters for when she will buy and sell investments.
Buying at the right price
These are the two most critical time points for lazy investors, Owen says. In particular, buying investments at the 
right price is key, as buying when investments are overvalued can destroy returns from a set and forget portfolio for 
decades, he says.

"You make your money when you buy. You've got to be aware of when things are expensive and you've got to be 
aware of when things are cheap."
Eric Marais, an investment specialist at Orbis Investment Management, agrees that little matters more than the buy-
in price.Page 3 of 4
How to become a lazy investor (and yes, it's a good thing)
Orbis invests based on an active management philosophy of seeking out undervalued companies, and Marais 
points to investors who bought into successful tech companies like Cisco Systems and Microsoft before the dotcom 
crash of the early 2000s, as an example of those who got the buy-in price wrong.
"Cisco is a business that has actually been extremely successful. It's continued to grow its revenue and its profits, 
but it has yet to recoup its peak price 25 years later." In the case of Microsoft, Marais says recovering to its pre-
dotcom share price took 16 years.
For lazy investors who don't want to follow the markets closely enough to time their entry, the solution is dollar cost 
averaging, which is the approach Jayamanne uses. Dollar cost averaging is the process of investing the same sum 
at regular intervals, regardless of market movements.
"You're just putting $100 in every week, and you buy all the way through the booms and busts and that works quite 
well," Owen says.
When to review
Despite her hands-off approach, Jayamanne does monitor her portfolio.
"You always have to monitor and maintain your portfolio because markets will always change, economic conditions 
will change," she says. "There's no set-and-forget portfolio that you can just leave and let it run and be confident 
that it's still aligned with your goals over the long term."
Jayamanne reviews her portfolio every six months. "I think that's a pretty good cadence for lazy investors," she 
says.
Owen agrees that some tweaking does make sense from time to time as conditions change, adding that "about 
once or twice per decade there is a major market rupture that requires some serious thinking and major changes".
Yield Financial Planning managing director James McFall agrees staying invested when markets fall suddenly and 
waiting for the recovery is part of a successful investor's mindset.
He advocates a more active approach, suggesting investors should "actively switch among asset classes where the 
greater risk or opportunity is at different points in the market cycle".
While the thesis that there are some companies that you can buy and hold forever might be considered central to 
lazy investing, Marais calls this idea "dangerous".
"Over time, it has tended to be the case that most businesses get disrupted, so the idea that there is a good-
enough company that you can buy and hold forever is sort of redundant."
He says rather than an annual or biannual review, the right time to review your investments "should be based on 
what's changing in the market".
