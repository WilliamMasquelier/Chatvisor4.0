1. Cisco Systems has successfully completed its $28 billion (approximately $42.8 billion AUD) acquisition of Splunk, marking the largest deal in Cisco's history and reflecting a significant shift towards data and AI integration in business operations.

2. The merger aims to leverage AI capabilities to enhance cybersecurity by enabling customers to draw predictive insights from data across various vendor platforms, indicating a strategic focus on advanced analytics in the digital communications sector.
