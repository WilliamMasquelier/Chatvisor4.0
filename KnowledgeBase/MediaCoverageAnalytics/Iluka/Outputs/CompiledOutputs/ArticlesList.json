Iluka boss Tom O'Leary called out \nChina's capacity to use market dominance in rare earths to dictate premiums and influence the Asian Metal index.\nThe cost of the Iluka project was originally forecast to be $1 billion to $1.2 billion when the company took a final \ninvestment decision in April 2022.\nMr O'Leary said a comprehensive update on the company's rare earths division that had been expected at the end \nof March would be delayed pending the outcome of the talks on funding.\n\"The Australian government is our strategic partner in this development, and has been kept up to date ... we are \nworking with the government to come to a pathway to deliver the refinery,\" he said.\n\"I think it's fair to say that Eneabba's strategic importance in providing a secure Western supply chain has only \nincreased in recent times following China's ban on the export of heavy rare technology in December.\n\"We've also seen several further offtake and toll trading arrangements and projects which involve downstream \nprocessing of Australian sourced rare earths in China.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nIluka seeks more funding for rare earths refinery\nMr O'Leary said Iluka remained committed to not selling rare earths concentrate to China or elsewhere while the \nrefinery was a work in progress, and all but ruled out selling its 20 per cent stake in Iluka spin-off Deterra Royalties \nthat provides exposure to the iron ore sector.\nHe said the talks with government were broadly about Iluka's need to take a disciplined approach to capital \nallocation with a focus on shareholder returns and the long-term strategic importance to Australia and its allies of \nEneabba, which is slated to supply light and heavy rare earths essential in electronics, wind turbines and in defence \ntechnology.\nIluka announced in December that on top of the cost blowout, first production at Eneabba had been pushed back \nfrom 2025 to 2026.\nThe company reported full-year net profit after tax of $342.6 million, down from $517.3 million last year.

Mineral sands \nrevenue was down 19 per cent at $1.24bn with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation down \n32 per cent at $582m.\nAnd Iluka's 4c-a-share final dividend reflects only the pass through of funds received from its 20 per cent holding in \nDeterra Royalties, which holds a production royalty over BHP's Mining Area C and South Flank iron ore operations.\nWhile Iluka's earnings and net profit both beat analyst expectations, the company's market outlook remains \ncautious at a time when it is ramping up capital spending on a new mineral sands operation at Balranald, NSW, and \non its rare earth refinery near Geraldton in the Mid West of Western Australia.\nWhile the latter is being funded by a $1.25bn federal government lending facility, the cost overhang remains a key \nissue for the company, with Iluka still locked in discussions with the federal govern-ment over funding options for \nthe additional cash needed to complete its construction.\nIluka updated the Eneabba refinery's likely cost on Wednesday, saying its ongoing front-end engineering and \ndesign suggested the refinery was likely to cost $1.7bn-$1.8bn, up from a previous range of $1.5bn-$1.8bn. It was \nsupposed to cost $1.2bn when Iluka made a final investment decision in 2022.\nThe refinery has been billed as a plank in Iluka's long-term growth and diversification strategy, and as a key \nstrategic asset from a geopolitical perspective, designed to reduce the reliance of Australia and major allies such as \nthe US on rare earth metals produced in China.\nPage 2 of 2\nIluka refinery hangs on government talks\nRare earth prices have tumbled in recent months on slowing demand and an increase in Chinese production quotas \nin 2023. China also banned the export of rare earth extraction and separation technologies in December in a move \nseen as an effort to protect its dominance of the refining market.\nMr O'Leary would not comment on the details of discussions between Iluka and the government, but signalled the \ncompany's reluctance to commit commercial debt to the project if further government loan facilities were not \nextended.\nHe said offtake deals with Northern Minerals, as well as progress on its own mineral sands and rare earth projects \nin NSW and western Victoria, had added to the longevity of the refinery, which was initially designed to use feed \nfrom tailings at Iluka's former mineral sands mines at Eneabba.\nBut he said price incentives were still needed for the construction of non-Chinese refineries, even given project \ngrowth in demand for rare earth metals.\n\"On price, we're all aware of Chinese dominance in the market. Again, that's a factor we take into account in \nassessing risk-adjusted returns around making a disciplined capital allocation to the -refinery,\" he said.\n\"So as we contemplate funding, both we and government are really cognisant of the risks of the project and also the \nstrategic importance of the project - not only from a geopolitical and defence perspective, but also from the \nperspective of its contribution to facilitating global decarbonisation.\" But Iluka needed to weigh the refinery's \nstrategic importance in light of its responsibility to its shareholders, Mr O'Leary said.\n\"So while government and Iluka's objectives are aligned around the development of the refinery, discipline around \nour capital allocation decisions has got to be maintained.\" Iluka rose 5.8 per cent to $7.63.\nBOTTOM LINE\nILUKA RESOURCES Full Year NET PROFIT $342.6m\"42% REVENUE $1.24bn \"19% FINAL DIVIDEND 4c \"16c \nSHARES CLOSED AT $7.63 \u00e2\u2013\u00b25.8%\nLoad-Date: February 21, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 2\nLength: 991 words\nByline: Jennifer Hewett\nBody\nAndrew Forrest won't allow the looming collapse of Australia's nickel hopes to dent his still soaring ambitions for \nAustralia's green energy revolution and his continued attacks on coal and gas as \"fossil fuel dinosaurs\".\nThat's even though Forrest has announced that his private company, Wyloo Metals, shortly will shut down the \nWestern Australian nickel mines it bought for $760 million only last year, as global prices have been crippled in \nrecent months by the massive expansion of Indonesia's nickel industry.\nBut neither the London Metals Exchange nor buyers and manufacturers of electric vehicles are showing much \ninterest in Forrest's demands for a distinction to be made between Indonesia's \"dirty\" nickel and supplies produced \nwith higher environmental standards.\nThe pressure from Forrest and other players, large and small, in Australia's critical minerals industries may be \nharder for the Albanese government to ignore.\nLabor's enthusiasm for the potential of green manufacturing in Australia, including electric vehicle batteries and \ncomponents, is rapidly developing into an even sharper contrast given what's happening on the ground in critical \nminerals such as nickel and lithium.\nIn an address to the National Press Club, Forrest was relatively circumspect about the benefits of production tax \ncredits being sought by many miners to help alleviate their current woes.\n\"I haven't looked at it closely enough,\" he said.\n\"It seems to make a lot of sense applying a tax credit on a profit you don't have yet, so it seems a win-win for the \nAustralian taxpayer, but I would like to look at it further.\"\nOther nickel and lithium companies are much more insistent in demands for production tax credits to be granted \nurgently, with a delegation of executives in Canberra tomorrow to meet Minister for Resources Madeleine King and \nTreasury officials.\nPage 2 of 3\nNew reality for critical minerals, and Canberra Page Two\nKing doesn't need persuading of the benefits of such a measure. Treasury - and Treasurer Jim Chalmers - do.\nKing is just one member of a cabinet with little sympathy for miners.\nNor is the industry united in its views. BHP, for example, certainly got politicians' attention when it announced this \nmonth it was considering the future of its West Australian nickel interests after a massive $US3.5 billion ($5.3 \nbillion) write-down of their value given the \"structural\" change in the industry.\nBut chief executive Mike Henry is adamant governments should focus more on getting policy fundamentals right in \nareas such as industrial relations and approval processes rather than offering short-term subsidies as a cure.\nWithout that basis, he warned this month, a production tax credit may not be enough to save BHP's WA's nickel \nbusiness in a world where Australia doesn't have the natural advantages it did in supplying iron ore or coal.\nSo far, this message is not getting much traction in Canberra.\nInstead, the political focus is more on addressing the general community clamour for greater government \nassistance to help with cost-of-living pressures - with the adequacy of the response to be tested by the results of \nthe Dunkley byelection in Victoria on Saturday.\nThat's despite the budget's heavy reliance on the mining industry for any continuing surpluses or to help pay for \ngovernment services.\nThat trade-off has been increasingly obscured by continued high prices for commodities such as iron ore.\nBut Australia's hopes of extending this bonanza into the supply of critical minerals to belatedly counter China's \ndominance and price manipulation is in the midst of a reality check.\nThe impact of dramatically reduced prices is not just obvious in the sudden closure or scaling back of nickel and \nlithium prospects.\nIluka Resources' plans to build Australia's first rare earths refinery are now in difficulties following a big increase in \ncosts as well as the weaker prices for rare earths.\nIt's part of the long-running debate about whether Australia should continue to rely on exporting the raw materials it \nmines, especially to China, and to what extent the government should provide incentives to develop downstream \nalternatives.\nIn its dying days, the Morrison government provided a $1.25 billion loan to Iluka to build a refinery to separate rare \nearth oxides from its tailings at Eneabba and to process concentrate from other miners. The timetable for the start \nof operations has now been delayed a year to 2026, while Iluka is quietly asking for more assistance from its \n\"strategic partner\" in Canberra.\nChief executive Tom O'Leary will say only that the company is \"working with the government to come to a pathway \nto deliver the refinery\".\n\"I think it's fair to say that Eneabba's strategic importance in providing a secure Western supply chain has only \nincreased in recent times following China's ban on the export of heavy rare earths technology in December,\" he \nsaid at Iluka's results this month.\n\"As we contemplate funding, both we and the government are really cognisant of the risks of the project and also its \nstrategic importance, not only from a geopolitical and defence perspective but also from the perspective of its \ncontribution to facilitating global decarbonisation.\"\nYet some other industry analysts suggest the refinery can never be commercially viable and the Australian \ngovernment instead should be smoothing licensing and regulatory approvals and improving common infrastructure \nrather than giving subsidies to individual companies.Page 3 of 3\nNew reality for critical minerals, and Canberra Page Two\n\"We should dig up rare earths if we can do so profitably,\" one says.\n\"But it is the major advanced industrial economies of the US, Europe and Japan that are most at risk of unfair \nChinese processing competition. They are the ones that should subsidise processing if their companies will not \nbuild it commercially.\"\nThat's unlikely to be the sort of logic that appeals to most of the would-be players in the critical minerals industry, \nincluding Andrew Forrest - or to the Albanese government.\nDecisions ... or more reviews?\njennifer.hewett@afr.com.au\nLoad-Date: February 29, 2024\nEnd of Document",

As well as \nthe 1300 staff that left when PwC was forced to spin off its lucrative government business for just $1 after it was \nbanned from any further government work.\nThe firm's website still boasts of a workforce of 8000 employees, but those stats are from a year ago when the \nnews surfaced that several PwC partners had allegedly used confidential government tax information to woo some \nof the biggest companies in the world as clients.\nThe outlook appears grim and not just for the tax business, which was the source of PwC's woes. There are clear \nsigns that the audit and assurance business - the original core business of the big four firms and the unit that PwC \nis counting on to lift it out of the mire - is also suffering.\nWestpac's dramatic dumping of PwC last week in favour of KPMG was a big blow, with the bank's business worth \n$70 million over the last two years alone. But that is not the only signal of the corporate sector's disaffection with the \nfirm.\nOn March 1, PwC's 19-year run as the auditor of $3 billion Super Retail Group - the company behind retail names \nsuch as Rebel Sport, Supercheap Auto and BCF - came to an end.\nMineral sands group Iluka Resources will end its 33-year relationship with PwC in May.\nPage 2 of 3\nPwC pays high price on its road to redemption\n\"Following completion of a tender process, and given PwC's tenure, the board of Iluka considered it appropriate to \nreplace PwC with KPMG as Iluka's external auditor,\" it said.\nFinance group Harmoney Corp and ed-tech group Keypath dropped PwC in December and January, respectively.\nDeveloper Lendlease is still keeping quiet on its audit plans. PwC was meant to replace KPMG last year on audit \nwork.\nMacquarie Group is also keeping silent on its plans after flagging a review of its audit services last year to see if it \nshould end its 30-year relationship with PwC. Macquarie paid PwC more than $79 million in fees last year.\nThe irony is that the assurance business, which includes audit, was highlighted as one of the few positives in last \nyear's Switkowski review, which was triggered by the tax scandal and ordered by interim PwC boss Kristin \nStubbins.\n\"Some parts of PwC Australia - notably the Assurance business - appear substantially to model best practice. The \nfirm should ... look to these strengths as it rebuilds,\" the report said.\nBut that is easier said than done. The whole point of hiring a big four audit firm such as PwC is to attach your \nfinancial results to a brand whose reputation is beyond question.\nPwC's reputation is far from that, and it will suffer further this year at the hands of the incredibly influential Canberra \npoliticians who helped bring the malfeasance by those partners to light.\nThe level of political fury in Canberra has not abated due to the firm's patchy record at coming clean on the tax \nscandal.\nThe latest flashpoint is PwC Australia's insistence that it has no access to the report by law firm Linklaters, which \nhad been commissioned by PwC's international office to independently investigate the involvement of global \npartners in the tax leak.\nOnly a one-page summary of this report has been released publicly. It says while six international partners should \nhave raised questions about the confidential information that was shared with them, the report found no evidence \nthat any PwC personnel outside Australia used the information from PwC Australia for commercial gain.\nBurrowes, who was parachuted in as CEO of PwC Australia by the global group, told a Senate hearing last month \nthat the group had declined to give him access to the full report.\n\"So you're going to accept, from PwC International, a failure to respond to your request, as the CEO of what's \ndescribed as a systemically significant player in the Australian economy, and we're supposed to put up with that, as \na nation? That seems to be a completely untenable position,\" Labor senator Deborah O'Neill told the hearing.\nGreens senator Barbara Pocock described it as a \"running sore of dishonesty\".\nThe bigger issue, as O'Neill puts it, is that the statement by PwC International on the Linklaters report \"is certainly at \nodds with evidence we've received in the Australian parliament from the Tax Practitioners Board [TPB] in recent \nweeks, where it's not only six people who have been identified, but more than that.\"\nThe Tax Practitioners Board, which brought the scandal to light when it banned former PwC partner Peter Collins, \nsaid it had nine current investigations stemming from the tax scandal.\nThe Australian Federal Police announced in May 2023 it was also pursuing a criminal investigation of the tax leak \nscandal.\nBut the next bombshell for PwC is likely to be the final report by the Senate inquiry into the integrity of consulting \nservices. The report, which is due this month, is expected to be postponed until May.Page 3 of 3\nPwC pays high price on its road to redemption\nAs inquiry chairman, Liberal senator Richard Colbeck, indicated with a comment at the most recent hearing that it \nwill not be pleasant for PwC: \"I really do want to inflict some pain on PwC in relation to this Linklater's report.\"\nLoad-Date: March 15, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 2\nLength: 1007 words\nByline: Jennifer Hewett\nBody\nThe recent collapse in prices for key critical minerals is accelerating attempts by Western governments to use \ncheap loans, grants and tax breaks to break China's stranglehold on the processing of rare earths.\nSuccess is far from guaranteed. But taxpayer funds are now the common ingredient to boost the processing of rare \nearths into the metals and magnets vital for everything from mobile phones to wind turbines to advanced defence \ntechnology.\nThe Australian government's announcement of $840 million worth of cheap funding and grants to progress \nArafura's proposed rare earths mine and refinery in the Northern Territory is part of this global battle.\nIt follows the Morrison government giving Iluka Resources a $1.25 billion loan to build a refinery in Western \nAustralia to separate rare earth oxides.\nWhile Canberra has nothing like the financial firepower of the US, it is under growing pressure to also subsidise \nintermediate processing as well as mining of rare earths.\nThis new push inevitably brings up old questions about backing particular companies with taxpayer money - given \nthey may still not be financially viable anyway. It's no surprise that first production at Iluka's refinery is delayed a \nyear until 2026 while estimated building costs have increased by several hundred million dollars.\nWhat is not disputed is the urgent need for a strategic counter to China's control - developed over decades - of \nprocessing technology and skills required to create the crucial metals and magnets essential for modern living and \nnational security.\nJust how much governments will pay and how feasible these alternative supply chains in all critical minerals \nremains a gamble. Final investment decisions are still a way off in most cases, even before protracted delays in \nbuilding.\nThe 17 rare earth elements in the periodic table are a subset of the general category of critical minerals and found \nin minute quantities of much larger clay or hard rock mineral deposits. Their grade - typically measured in parts per \nPage 2 of 3\nReality test for big bet on rare earths; Page Two\nmillion in clay or a small percentage in rock - is just one aspect of the challenge. Rare earth elements are neither \nrare nor that valuable in themselves, particularly at current prices.\nBut panicked Western governments belatedly realised their vulnerability to Beijing's ability to withdraw supply of the \nvital metals and magnets that result from processing them.\nComplacency - compounded by the lure of China's cheap prices - meant other countries had not even tried to \nmaster complex chemistry processes and technology needed to turn concentrates into essential ingredients for \nmodern living and defence needs.\nAustralia is a player not only because of its abundance of resources but also because its close relationship with the \nUS means Australian projects or their American customers may be eligible for US government support.\nThat can include access to generous subsidies under the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. US \ndetermination to compete with China and to derisk supply chains ensures some financial support will continue no \nmatter who is president.\nThis explains why the US Export Import Bank, for example, has just provided non-binding pledges of loans to two \nsmall Australian rare earths companies, Australian Strategic Minerals and Meteoric Resources, to help them \ndevelop mines in NSW and Brazil respectively. Lynas, which has Australia's only operating rare earths mine, has a \n$US258 million ($395 million) grant from the US Department of Defence to build a refinery in Texas.\nAngus Barker, chairman of Australian Rare Earths and former ministerial adviser and investment banker, says rare \nearths are at the intersection of two mega-trends globally - decarbonisation and geopolitics. \"That's why \ngovernments are so interested and why they are throwing money at them,\" he says. \"They want secure, reliable \nalternatives.\"\nBut the experience of Australian Rare Earths (AR3), which plans eventually to develop a clay-based project on the \nSouth Australian border, is typical of challenges facing Australian hopefuls.\nAs prices and recognition of critical minerals surged a few years ago, a host of speculative Australian investors and \ncompanies, including AR3, bet on rare earths as part of a new resources boom.\nDepending on grade, the collapse in prices means it makes no commercial sense for most of these proposed mines \nto even consider developing their hard rock or clay deposits right now - perhaps indefinitely.\nThat's apart from the costs and complexity of developing domestic downstream processing beyond producing basic \nconcentrate.\nBut although less than expected global demand, increased supply and China's manipulation of prices are curbing \nrare earths developments - along with lithium and nickel - entrepreneurial enthusiasm about the potential remains.\n\"In a tough environment, you focus on areas you can control - like opportunities in higher grade elements to find a \npath forward,\" says Barker.\nSome Australian-owned projects are not even in Australia. Meteoric Resources is not the only Australian company \nwith a project in Brazil.\nIn the US, American Rare Earths is listed on the ASX but focused on its attempt to develop a rare earths mine in \nthe mining-friendly state of Wyoming. After releasing its scoping study this month, its managing director, Donald \nSwartz, is in Australia to talk to investors about the benefits of its particular allanite minerals geology in Wyoming \nenabling the company to apply simpler, cheaper conventional technology to develop its resource.\nAs well as the ability to access US tax credits, US agencies are also helping finance a joint venture research effort \ninto more efficient processing technologies. Swartz maintains there's more understanding of rare earths among \nAustralian investors than in his home country.Page 3 of 3\nReality test for big bet on rare earths; Page Two\nYet despite Australia's reputation for efficient mining, it has far less experience in the advanced, complex and \nextremely expensive processing of even intermediate material. It will be a reality test of Australia's ambitions.\njennifer.hewett@afr.com\nLoad-Date: March 28, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Mr Albanese did not single out battery manufacturing, or allied industries such as the high-\nintensity magnets needed for wind turbines, but federal Resources Minister Madeleine King identified both sectors \nas key targets for support in the upcoming federal budget, as the government looks to support critical minerals \nmining to move further downstream. \"We want that part of the Future Made in Australia because we have those \nnatural resources and we really need to capitalise on it,\" she said.\nThe best means to make that happen has been the source of significant debate in both the mining and \nmanufacturing industry, but industry experts say the government should invest in the broader infrastructure needed \nto create production hubs around the industry. That includes streamlining approvals processes to make sure \ninvestment can be deployed quickly, but also ensuring competitive power and water prices, as well as investing in \nbasic research to help industry catch up with the massive investments made by China in the complex chemistry \nneeded to build batteries and process difficult ores.\nFuture Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre (FBICRC) chairman Tim Shanahan said the government \npackage needed to level the investment playing field to try to attract \"lighthouse companies\" to set up \nmanufacturing plants in Australia.\nThe FBICRC has been a champion for funds to back the basic science to grow Australia's knowledge base, but Mr \nShanahan said the government also needed to target major manufacturing companies - such as battery makers \nsuch as Tesla and Panasonic - that had already developed their own expertise. \"We can develop some of this \ntechnology ourselves. We need to attract leading international companies with the right business conditions to \nsecure their investment and we need to help these businesses succeed by building a competitive ecosystem \naround them,\" he said. \"Australia can be competitive in manufacturing, but we need to develop a competitive and \nPage 2 of 2\nCall for regional mineral hub support\nintegrated manu-facturing ecosystem.\" Melbourne-based engineering firm GHD has been designing and building \nprocessing plants for Australian mining companies for decades, and will be presenting its vision for production hubs \nat the Battery Minerals Conference in Perth on Monday.\nGHD Australian Energy and Resources leader Paul Greaney told The Australian that, despite Australia's mining \nexpertise, government support was needed in the face of subsidies on offer overseas. Mr Greaney said a key area \nof support should be helping Australian companies take advantage of our mineral wealth by putting the basic \ninfrastructure to help industrial development take place near where the minerals are produced, rather than in capital \ncities.\n\"I think the biggest bang for investment by government is in the infrastructure that will be common to particular \nhubs, that will become centres for development of particular products,\" he said.\nBuilding processing centres near major mining hubs in the Pilbara or other regional centres would eliminate the cost \nof transporting ore or concentrate over long distances, he said, making Australian manufacturing more competitive.\nBut to work, that would mean the government would need to support the provision of power and water to isolated \nsites, as well as speeding up approvals processes, he said. \"But this incentive is really a great step in the right \ndirection, to give the confidence to a lot of investors that Australia is somewhere that is a lot more attractive than it \nwas the day before this announcement.\" Iluka Resources chief executive Tom O'Leary has been outspoken on the \nneed for Australia to use the booming demand for critical minerals to build an onshore mining and processing \nindustry, and the company is a beneficiary of a $1bn government-backed loan for its Australian-first rare earth \nprocessing plant in WA.

It is considering mothballing its \nentire WA nickel division after the global market responded to a new abundance of much cheaper, but still high-\nquality, Indonesian nickel. So much for the proposed $1 billion upgrade of BHP's Kalgoorlie nickel smelter that had \nbeen anticipated this year.\nCEO Mike Henry suggests the advent of Indonesian nickel is likely to be a structural rather than a cyclical change in \nthe market. He obviously has more immediate interest in chasing Anglo American's copper assets in South \nAmerica, and maintains Australia needs to get more of the basics right in areas like infrastructure, power supply, \napprovals and industrial relations.\nStill, many struggling lithium and nickel producers have pressed Chalmers and Treasury for incentives, such as \nproduction tax credits. Some form of tax investment allowance is expected in next week's budget to add to the \nroyalty relief recently provided to nickel miners by the WA government.\nBut whether this will be enough to sustain a competitive large-scale critical minerals industry over the rest of this \ndecade looks far less certain than the government's rhetoric suggests.\nDespite all the talk from the Biden administration about creating reliable alternatives to China's dominance, \nparticularly in rare earths, there's been a dearth of investment in Australian mines or downstream processing efforts \nfrom either the US or Europe.\nChalmers' announcement that approvals for foreign investment from trusted sources will be accelerated will remove \nsome of the roadblocks, but it won't necessarily make the dollars add up for foreign investors any time soon.\nThe Australian government has attempted to fill some of the vacuum via cheap loans and grants to individual \ncompanies via its critical minerals fund, and other facilities. But this is inadequate to sustain attempts to \nsubstantially grow the industry.\nRecent low prices, combined with Australia's high costs, make it harder to see how we can be competitive, \nparticularly in further processing of minerals to the extent envisaged by Canberra's talk of electric vehicle batteries.\nThe generous taxpayer subsidies available under the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, for example, \nhave so far been devoted mainly to projects operating within the confines of the US.\nIn contrast, China's money, as well as its technical expertise, has made its companies valued local partners, as well \nas much-needed customers underpinning the development of many WA projects.\nSome of those wanting to move more into rare earths processing still argue that China is deliberately suppressing \nprices and controlling production to deter challenges to its stranglehold on the sector.\nIluka Resources managing director Tom O'Leary this week expressed his frustration about the difficulties in \nfinishing the company's rare earths refinery at Eneabba in WA, for example. Despite $1.25 billion of cheap loans \nprovided by the Morrison government in its dying days, a subsequent cost blowout in construction means Iluka \nneeds more funds just when the market is contracting.Page 3 of 3\nPM's troubled dream of critical minerals Page Two\n\"No participant, regardless of geography, is making money at today's prices,\" he told the annual general meeting. \n\"China's dominance of the rare earths industry, which in the case of heavy rare earths is near total, is achieved \nthrough production supremacy and its influence over pricing.\"\nChallenging that equation will take a lot more than decent mapping.\njennifer.hewett@afr.com\nLoad-Date: May 11, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Despite the even worse electoral calamity of a state Liberal Party reduced to a ludicrous two \nseats at the last state election, many voters in a traditionally conservative stronghold have grown disenchanted with \nLabor.\nBut Dutton's rejection of the Albanese government's budget spending to boost critical minerals processing and jibes \nof \"billions for billionaires\" will not be popular in a state that has done so well from resources development.\nAmbitious rhetoric about a new resources boom leveraging critical minerals and hydrogen in a decarbonising world \nreached fever peak in the state about a year ago - coinciding with The Australian Financial Review Mining Summit \nin Perth.\nAnthony Albanese's obsession with creating \"green\" manufacturing jobs neatly fitted WA's enthusiasm about further \nrefining and processing critical minerals rather than just exporting its raw materials to China.\nMining billionaires like Andrew Forrest, Gina Rinehart and Chris Ellison were competing with the establishment \ncompanies such as BHP and Rio Tinto to expand their interests in lithium and/or nickel. The WA Treasury was \nhappily counting almost $1 billion in royalties it had collected from the lithium industry that year, way behind the $9 \nbillion worth from iron ore but rising fast.\nThen-deputy premier and now Premier Roger Cook told the Summit his daily commute from south of Perth was like \na multibillion-dollar glimpse into the future of decarbonisation, citing lithium hydroxide plants and nickel sulphate \nrefineries in the industrial park of Kwinana.\nBut the rapid rise and then recent fall of prices for critical minerals like nickel and lithium, along with rare earths, \ndemonstrates the volatility of this nascent market. It also shows the modest contribution to the state's economy so \nPage 2 of 3\nWhy WA loves the minerals tax boost Page Two\nfar of a scattering of relatively small-scale critical minerals projects compared with the massive staples of iron ore \nand LNG.\nIt means the mood at tomorrow's Financial Review Mining Summit in Perth will be very different, following company \nafter company announcing plans to scale back, close or not proceed with various mining and processing projects.\nYet, Western Australia has always prided itself on its entrepreneurial, frontier spirit, particularly in the resources \nindustry. So the promise of billions of dollars worth of production tax credits for processing of critical minerals and \ngreen hydrogen will offer fresh hope that WA can get back on track towards its newest resources dream.\nThe WA Liberals certainly see it that way, rejecting the negative views of their federal colleagues. The tax credits \nwill only be paid for costs incurred in producing value-added materials and metals, and are designed to reward \nresults rather than ideas that are never executed.\nIt's why the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies (AMEC) has been pushing hard numbers, insisting \nthis model will help kick-start the industry but with no risk to the government if particular projects don't proceed.\nThis version does seem a financially safer model than providing direct subsidies to individual companies given the \nobvious risks in a government \"picking winners\". That general guidelines for the Future Made in Australia \ninvestments are so broad - and new government \"off-budget\" special funds now so numerous - guarantee some \ncostly failures. Nor does Treasury favour Albanese's vision of Australia making electric vehicle batteries.\nDutton uses a commercial rationale to resist spending taxpayers' money on projects he insists must be able to \nsupport themselves to survive beyond a future made in Canberra. And he is right that production tax credits are less \nimportant than getting the fundamentals right by reducing other costs including delayed approvals, excessive \nregulations, inflexible industrial relations and lack of common, crucial infrastructure. But there's little sign of this \nhappening - rather the reverse.\nNor will the tax credits even begin until 2027, meaning there will be little immediate assistance to financially \nstruggling projects.\nBHP has already given itself a timetable of August to decide whether to shut its nickel smelter in Kalgoorlie with the \nloss of 3000 jobs.\nChief executive Mike Henry's belief that the collapse in the global price of nickel due to a flood of supply from \nIndonesia is a structural change rather than a cyclical one also means there's no chance currently of reviving the \nplan to invest in the necessary upgrade of a smelter that looks every bit of its 50-plus years.\nAny shift in the commercial logic of closure will be the subject of further consultations with the federal government - \nand no doubt potential further subsidies. There's still an obvious economic and political logic to attempts to diversify \ncritical minerals processing, especially rare earths, away from China's control.\nThe Morrison government provided $1.25 billion in cheap loans to Iluka Resources to build a rare earths refinery in \nWA, for instance. Since then, other governments, particularly the Biden administration in the US, have begun \nproviding gargantuan incentives to counter Chinese dominance, bolstering the government's case that Australia \nmust play this game to remain competitive.\nEven so, Iluka's construction costs have blown out, forcing the company to search for more funding. As well as \nsome other small grants, the Albanese government is betting $840 million worth of grants and loans to help Arafura \nRare Earths develop its mine and refinery in the Northern Territory.\nThat makes them examples of the potential pitfalls and the promise of the 2020s version of industrial policy.\nGambling on the future of value-adding to the Australian mining industry still makes much more sense than the \nAlbanese government investing $1 billion into solar panel manufacturing.Page 3 of 3\nWhy WA loves the minerals tax boost Page Two\nWest Australians certainly understand that.

The downturn in prices for several minerals - primarily \nnickel, lithium and rare earths - had put intense pressure on an industry that his government hopes will drive WA's \nnext era of prosperity.\nHe remains pragmatic. Just as the iron ore sector took decades to come into its pomp, so too would the critical \nminerals sector face a bumpy ride before establishing itself. \"This stuff takes grit, determination and a certain \namount of risk,\" Cook says.\nThe iron ore sector was ultimately transformed by China's economic super-cycle, and the Summit made it clear that \nthe fate of the critical minerals industry would also rest with China. But this time, China looms as both saviour and \nenemy.\nAs Warren Pearce, CEO of the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, told the Summit, \"a large portion \nof West Australian mining projects have been turned on with the support of Chinese dollars and Chinese \ninvestment\" over the past two decades, with Chinese companies often acting as both financiers and major \ncompanies via offtake agreements.\nBut as an increasingly hawkish US government seeks to build its own supply chains for reasons of national and \neconomic security, pressure is mounting on Australian miners to turn away from Chinese capital.\nPage 2 of 3\nBig China question hangs over critical minerals sector\n\"That concerns us,\" Pearce says. \"That investment isn't necessarily coming from other countries, particularly the \nUS, and so if we're turning away that investment, we've got to find that capital somewhere else. That makes it more \nchallenging for us to get projects up and ... to reap the benefits of those projects.\"\nPeter Coleman, the former chief executive of Woodside who is now chairman of the world's third-biggest lithium \nproducer, Arcadium Lithium, is even more blunt given China's status as the world's centre of critical minerals \nrefining and manufacturing.\n\"I just can't see a future where you don't co-invest together,\" he says.\nThe production tax credits announced by federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers last week will provide a test of this split \nbetween China and the West. Many of the WA-based miners that will be eligible for the tax production credits have \nChinese ownership. Will local companies with Chinese shareholders be barred from the tax production credits \ncompletely? Or will there be some limit - say a maximum Chinese ownership share of 25 per cent, which would be \nin line with US restrictions?\nResources Minister Madeleine King would not be drawn into this yesterday, saying the government is still \ndesigning the credit regime, but foreign ownership issues are under consideration.\nAMEC will clearly push back hard on anything that hurts miners with Chinese backers. And Cook is diplomatic; \nAustralia and WA must understand the opportunities that the trade partnership with China has created, but also \nmust not allow itself to become \"overly exposed to a single industry or a single commodity or to a single market or \nsingle customer\".\nThat's a sensible position to take, but the realities of the critical minerals sector will make this balancing act difficult. \nAs Pearce says, Chinese investment tends to move faster than that of Japan, South Korea and the US, and speed \nmatters in industries such as critical minerals, where volatility is almost guaranteed.\nOf course, as Iluka Resources chief executive Tom O'Leary told the Summit, China can be responsible for a lot of \nthat volatility, particularly when it comes to rare earths.\nHe again accused China of effectively manipulating the price of rare earths via the Asian Metals Index.\nHe says China has used its dominant position across the supply chain to increase production capacity to drive \nprices on the index down to a point where, he claims, every producer in the sector (both inside and outside China) \nis unprofitable. In Iluka's demand, this is being done to protect the longevity of China's domestic rare earths sector.\nO'Leary wants the industry to stop linking bilateral contracts to the Asian Metals Index, which he says does not \nreflect the true value of rare earths.\nBut Brett Beatty, a private equity investor and Australian managing director of Resource Capital Funds, says \nChina's ability to shift markets to its advantage is nothing new, and it is something that his fund thinks hard about \nwhen it invests. \"They have spent the last 20 to 30 years building this strategic monopoly in many of these \ncommodities,\" he says.\nAustralia and other nations should look for ways to reduce China's control of critical minerals markets by \ndiversifying supply. But beware: this will not be easy, or fast.\n\"The reality is, we'll spend the next 15 or 20 years trying to unwind that and our movement of capital is slower, so \nyou can only imagine what China's going to do over the next 15 years to protect that position,\" Beatty says.\nJAMES THOMSON\nLoad-Date: May 25, 2024Page 3 of 3\nBig China question hangs over critical minerals sector\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 2\nLength: 1021 words\nByline: Jennifer Hewett\nBody\nMost Australians have never heard of Northern Minerals. But the ownership of its rare earths project in north-\nwestern Australia is evidence of the pushback against further entrenching China's control of the rare earths \nprocessing considered crucial to the global energy transition and to national security.\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers' order that Chinese funds reduce their shareholding in Northern Minerals comes after a \nvicious brawl for board control, in which former executive chairman Nick Curtis was effectively forced out of his \nposition.\nFor investors, it's a cautionary tale about major geopolitical pressures underlying the typical corporate manoeuvres, \nlinkages and big bets playing out in a still relatively nascent critical minerals industry in Australia.\nWu Tao, the Chinese businessman behind the Singapore-based Yuxiao Fund, certainly wasn't subtle in his tactics. \nIn February last year, Chalmers - acting on the advice of the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) - rejected \nWu's wish to increase his 9.8 per cent stake in Northern Minerals to 19.9 per cent.\nWu allegedly attempted to get around this block by using related entities to purchase shares - a concern that Curtis \nthen referred to the FIRB for investigation.\nThis battle is part of the background for Curtis recently becoming a \"strategic adviser\" to the company while backing \nthe appointment of a new chairman, former CFO Adam Handley, before a showdown with Wu and allies at a \nshareholder meeting called for this Thursday.\nThe Yuxiao Fund had nominated Wu for a seat on the board and had also demanded access to Northern Minerals' \naccounts and marketing contracts. It also signed co-operation agreements last year with two big Chinese rare \nearths processors: China Northern and Shenghe Resources.\nThe Australian Financial Review reported last November that a director of China Northern described this as \n\"another important measure to thoroughly implement the spirit of ... Xi Jinping's important instructions on the \ndevelopment of the rare earth industry\". But Chalmers' edict now orders Yuxiao to reduce its ownership of Northern \nPage 2 of 3\nRare earths caught in geopolitical struggle Page Two\nMinerals to 8.5 per cent, and the other associated parties - two individuals and two companies - will be forced to sell \ntheir shares, which currently add up to another 9 per cent.\nAccording to a spokesman for the treasurer, the decision is \"designed to protect our national interest and ensure \ncompliance with our foreign investment framework\".\nThat seems a reasonable response to what appears to be a remarkably blatant attempt to bypass the FIRB.\nDespite the treasurer's simultaneous insistence that Australia operates a \"non-discriminatory foreign investment \nframework\", the primary target for foreign investment restrictions on the ownership of Australian critical minerals is \nalso clear: China, China, China. This will doubtless be a topic of discussion when Chinese Premier Li Qiang visits \nAustralia this month.\nBut many small miners argue that Chinese investment, technology and partnerships will continue to be necessary \ningredients in Australia's attempts to develop a critical minerals processing industry - as well as its role as \nAustralia's most important customer for all its minerals.\nAnd if that's not complicated enough, there's another politically sensitive domestic issue lurking.\nNorthern Minerals' proposed project is supposed to have the rare earths it wants to mine - dysprosium and terbium \n- processed by Iluka Resources' refinery, which is still under construction at Eneabba in WA. These \"heavy\" rare \nearths are required for the manufacture of permanent magnets necessary for electrical equipment, electric vehicles, \nwind turbines and other advanced technology, including for defence purposes.\nIluka is building the refinery that was provided $1.25 billion in cheap loans during the last days of the Morrison \ngovernment. It is looking for additional funds to finish the project, given that costs have - also typically - blown out \nwhile prices have fallen.\nIluka Resources CEO Tom O'Leary has been particularly vocal in warning of China's price manipulation to force \nout competitors in other countries that are struggling with the abrupt decline in a range of critical minerals, including \nrare earths.\nCurtis is personally familiar with this storyline. Until 2013, he was executive chairman of another Australian rare \nearths player, Lynas Rare Earths, one of only two companies globally undertaking any processing outside China. \nLynas received essential financial backing from Japan to survive when facing extreme competitive pressure from \nChinese interests.\nNorthern Minerals is yet to take a final investment decision on its Browns Range project. But governments in \nAustralia, and the US and Europe, belatedly recognise the risks of relying on a China-dominated supply chain.\nThat led to the Albanese government's willingness, for example, to assist other projects, such as Arafura Rare \nEarths, with an announcement in March of $840 million in concessional financing to develop its mine and refinery in \nthe Northern Territory.\nArafura has agreements to supply rare earths to South Korean automaker Hyundai, Siemens Gamesa Renewable \nEnergy, and GE as other countries try to diversify their supply chains away from China\nChalmers' budget also included up to $7 billion in production tax credits over a decade for critical minerals \nprocessing in Australia.\nWhat is less clear is what level of Chinese investment will be permitted for these projects to be eligible for these \ncredits. The details are awaiting further consultations with industry.\nIf Australia follows the US, Chinese involvement in companies would be held to a maximum of 25 per cent to be \neligible. But many projects, particularly in Western Australia, already have higher levels of Chinese ownership, \nallowing them access to more funding and expertise.Page 3 of 3\nRare earths caught in geopolitical struggle Page Two\nThe Association of Mining and Exploration Companies - influential in persuading the Albanese government of the \nbenefits of production tax credits - will be arguing that a 25 per cent threshold would be too low to allow the industry \nto flourish.\nIt's a story still being written.\njennifer.hewett@afr.com\nLoad-Date: June 6, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: CHANTICLEER; Pg. 36\nLength: 761 words\nByline: James Thomson\nBody\nThere's something almost cinematic about the rollicking tale of intrigue that has enveloped the $212 million rare \nearths hopeful Northern Minerals.\nOnce upon a time, a small Australian company, which one day hopes to mine two little-known minerals - \ndysprosium and terbium, crucial to the production of high-performance magnets, batteries and defence equipment - \nwas targeted by a mysterious Chinese businessman, Wu Tao.\nHe's a big wheel in the Chinese rare earths sector, which has used its dominant position to control price, supply and \ntrade flows in an industry that has become central to tensions between China and the West.\nWu took a 9.8 per cent stake of Northern Minerals via his Singapore-registered company, Yuxiao Fund, but wanted \na bigger slice, outlining a plan in 2022 to increase his stake to 19.9 per cent. But when this bid was thwarted in \nFebruary last year by Treasurer Jim Chalmers, on the advice of the Foreign Investment Review Board, Wu is \naccused of taking matters into his own hands by orchestrating the buying of shares via a series of related entities \nand parties, including Black Stone Resources and Indian Ocean International Shipping and Service Co, plus Ms \nXimei Liu and Mr Xi Wang.\nIn October 2023, then Northern Minerals chief executive Nick Curtis referred the share buying to FIRB - and \nsubsequently found himself the subject of an attempt by Wu to remove him as a director of the company at an \nextraordinary general meeting showdown on June 6.\nLast Monday, Curtis fell on his sword, resigning as a director and moving to a position as a special adviser. But \nyesterday, Chalmers struck again, ordering Yuxiao to reduce its stake from 9.8 per cent to 8.5 per cent within 60 \ndays, and Black Stone, Ocean International, Liu and Wang to dispose of shares equivalent to about 9 per cent.\nSuch disposal orders are extremely rare in commercial matters, and so the implication seems clear: Chalmers has \nused his power to prevent a surreptitious attempt by Chinese interests to grab control of a promising miner, whose \nprecious products may help insulate Australia's high-end electrification and defence supply chains from Chinese \ncontrol of the rare earths market.\nPage 2 of 2\nSell-down order adds to crazy tale\nRoll credits! Well, maybe not so fast. One of Australia's top FIRB experts argues that the disposal orders issued by \nTreasury were widely predicted and welcome: this was an attempt to use the backdoor to get around an earlier \nFIRB order and couldn't be allowed to go ahead. So our expert says this shouldn't necessarily be read as a sudden \nhardening of Treasury's stance against Chinese investment in critical minerals.\nNevertheless, the timing of the announcement is fascinating, and not just because it seems poor old Nick Curtis \nresigned a week too early.\nAs the government goes through the design process for the critical minerals production tax credit regime \nannounced in last month's budget, the question of whether projects with Chinese investment will be treated \ndifferently is high on the minds of those in the Australian sector.\nJust as the birth of Australia's iron ore sector in the 1960s was financed with Japanese and Korean capital, China \nhas emerged as a powerful force in the creation of Australia's critical minerals industry, as financier, customer and \nprovider of key infrastructure, particularly processing capacity. Some US government money has found its way into \nkey projects, but not nearly as much as Chinese interests have provided.\nBut at the same time, key figures in the Australian critical minerals sector are growing more vocal in the warnings \nabout Chinese control of markets. At The Australian Financial Review Mining Summit in Perth last month, Iluka \nResources chief executive Tom O'Leary repeated his warnings that China is using its power to manipulate rare \nearths pricing.\nIronically, Iluka is both a shareholder in Northern Minerals and, if all goes to plan, will process Northern Minerals' \nproduction at its new $1.8 billion refinery at Eneabba in Western Australia. Perhaps it might even be in the market \nfor the 10 per cent of Northern Minerals that will now be on the market.\nThe Australian critical minerals industry, and indeed the federal government, is in a sticky position, caught between \nthe need to keep tapping Chinese capital and growing geopolitical tensions in a vital industry.\nChalmers' latest intervention might not represent a change in the government's view on Chinese involvement in the \nsector, but where it draws the line on Chinese exposure to the new production tax credit regime will be telling.\nJAMES THOMSON\nj.thomson@afr.com\nLoad-Date: June 6, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The sighs of relief in Canberra could -almost be heard in Perth.\nNorthern Minerals is a vital link in the Australian and US strategy to reduce dependence on China for key rare \nearths, which are vital in producing magnets used in energy production involving extreme heat, including -nuclear \nsubmarines.\nThe Chinese believed they had voting control of the company, so put forward motions to appoint four Chinese-\nbacked new directors. If passed, the motions would have resulted in control of the board of this vital company \npassing to people linked to the Chinese rare earths industry.\nAbout 73 per cent of the capital voted and, while the Chinese -motions were lost, they showed China's total voting \npower, with a 49 per cent vote for one director and 41 per cent for another.\nSupport for the other two nominations was much smaller.\nChina controls 100 per cent of the market for two of the so-called heavy rare earths - terbium and dysprosium - that \nare essential in the production of high temperatures magnets required in trains, wind turbines, plus many defence \napplications apart from nuclear submarines.\nAt this stage, Northern Minerals is the best source in the Western world for these two rare earths, so if China is to \nmaintain 100 per cent of the market, gaining board control of Northern Minerals becomes an essential step.\nNorthern Minerals is set to produce concentrates from its West Australian Browns Range deposits (near the \nNorthern Territory border) that it has contacted to supply to Iluka Resources, which is being backed by the federal \nPage 2 of 3\nWHY CHINESE WANT MINER\ngovernment to erect a refinery that will produce a range of rare earths. Iluka requires Northern Minerals' \nconcentrates to produce terbium and dysprosium.\nThe Australian government has agreed to loan $1.25bn to the refinery project without recourse to Iluka. As is usual \nin Australia, the original refinery cost estimates were wrong, and the latest estimates are 20 per cent above the \noriginal sums. My guess is that the final cost will be higher again. Hence, extra government money is required, and \nalarm are ringing in Canberra, causing delay.\nBut given the importance of the refinery to the US defence alliance, Jim Chalmers will simply have to find more \nmoney. It's conceivable that if Australia doesn't deliver the two essential heavy rare earths, it could jeopardise the \nAUKUS submarine program.\nThe US is funding another Australian company, Lynas, into a second rare earths refinery in the US on a far more \ngenerous basis than Australia's backing of Iluka.\nAt this stage, Lynas does not have a source of concentrates to produce terbium and dysprosium. Northern Minerals \ndrilling is increasing the size of its terbium and dysprosium reserves, so it is conceivable that its material may also \nbe required in the US.\nAustralian Rare Earths has clay-based rare earths deposits on the South Australia/Victoria border, containing both \nterbium and dysprosium. Clay-based reserves are much cheaper to extract than the Northern Minerals hard rock \ndeposits, but SA deposits are at a much earlier stage of exploration than those of Northern Minerals.\nIluka also has terbium and dysprosium deposits in Victoria's Wimmera, but they are also at an early development \nstage.\nShareholders connected to the Chinese rare earth industry realised the Northern Minerals deposits could break \ntheir global stranglehold and acquired 10 per cent of Northern Minerals, and there are a series of other Chinese \ninvestors who have a presence on the register.\nBut earlier this week, the Treasurer ordered four Chinese-linked investment funds to significantly reduce their \nholdings in Northern Minerals, citing Australia's \"national interest\".\nNick Curtis, the former executive chair of Lynas, took control of Northern Minerals in 2001 and negotiated the Iluka \nsupply deal, so is not popular among the Chinese rare earths industry people.\nPrior to the meeting, most of the existing directors had appeared optimistic that the four Chinese would not be \nelected.\nCurtis's unpopularity with the Chinese intensified when he referred their share buying patterns to the Foreign \nInvestment Review Board because he believed they breached foreign investment rules. It took the FIRB a long time \nto determine that the rules had been breached, but that decision, requiring Chinese rare earths industry-connected \ninvestments to be sold, was made in the week of the meeting. The meeting had been postponed many times \nbecause of FIRB delays, but more delays were not possible.\nA Chinese rare earth industry-controlled Northern Minerals board would still have had a binding contract with Iluka, \nbut almost certainly there would be many obstacles put in the way of its execution. In turn, that would put in doubt \nthe economics of the Iluka refinery, leaving the Chinese with full control of the terbium and dysprosium market.\nAnother motion put before the annual meeting was to authorise the board to make a 10 per cent share placement, \nwhich would further reduce the Chinese position on the register - although a Chinese-controlled board might make \nthe placement to their connected shareholders. As a legacy of times when Chinese dominance was not an issue, \nthere are two existing Chinese directors on the Northern Minerals board. One came up for re-election at the annual \nmeeting but was not opposed by the existing board.Page 3 of 3\nWHY CHINESE WANT MINER\nLoad-Date: June 6, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Rare earths are vital for the permanent magnets used in wind turbines and electric motors. \nCopper and aluminium are needed in electricity grids.\nThe transition to renewables is driving significantly increased demand for these minerals, an appetite which is \nexpected to continue growing as the move to a green economy accelerates around the world. At the same time, \nnations are manoeuvring to ensure their critical mineral supply lines are as secure as possible at a time of \ngeopolitical tension.\nGovernments around the world are taking action to establish resilient supply chains to provide supply security for \nonshore manufacturers, according to a spokesman for Australian company Lynas Rare Earths, the only scale \nproducer of separated rare earths outside China.\nThe Covid pandemic demonstrated the risks of single-sourced supply chains, the spokesman added, noting: \"Our \nnew Kalgoorlie facility has been designed to accept third party feedstock which will provide opportunities as new \nprojects come online.\" Lynas says the development of critical minerals processing in Australia will require different \ngovernment support at different stages, and while the company welcomes the production tax credit, it recommends \ninvestment in common user infrastructure where Australia has a cost disadvantage.\n\"Much of today's infrastructure is expensive and not fit for purpose and this puts Australian critical minerals \nproducers at a cost disadvantage,\" the Lynas spokesman says. \"This is particularly apparent with utilities such as \nenergy and water, landside logistics such as road freight, and labour costs. We see this as a once in a generation \nopportunity for government investment in 21st century infrastructure.\" Australia is already a world leader in the \nproduction of several critical minerals. In 2022, Australia was the top producer of lithium (52 per cent) and among \nPage 2 of 3\nNet zero unlocks the nation's critical minerals potential\nthe top five producers of cobalt, manganese, rare earths and others, according to data published by the \ngovernment's earth sciences agency, Geoscience Australia.\nAt the same time, there is ongoing federal support for new critical mineral discoveries and developments, and \nGeoscience Australia has been promised $566m over the next 10 years to fund mapping the nation's rich reserves \nof critical minerals.\nThe Australian government sees critical minerals as essential for economic sovereignty and the clean energy \ntransition and the nation's Critical Minerals Strategy is intended to be a framework for the development of the \nindustry.\n\"So much of our future prosperity depends on finding more critical minerals, extracting more critical minerals and \ndoing more with critical minerals before we export them,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told a Perth audience in \nMay.\nThe government has provided the industry with substantial financial support, including a $7bn production tax credit \nand funding for infrastructure projects to boost exploration, processing and development.\nThe Critical Minerals Strategy includes a list of 26 critical minerals that \"represent potential economic opportunities\" \n- minerals such as lithium, magnesium, nickel, manganese, rare earths, titanium, zirconium, silicon and graphite.\nAustralia has rich critical mineral deposits, but to date the nation has limited processing capability, and the \ngeographical concentration of some critical minerals and the long lead times for new mine development have raised \nconcerns about supply chain security and potential price spikes.\nThe Australian critical minerals industry is often at the mercy of boom-and-bust investment cycles. Nickel lost value \nover recent months following a glut of cheaper products from Indonesia. This led to intense speculation the mining \ngiant BHP would shutter its Nickel West operation, although the nickel price is beginning to rebound now with the \ntroubles in New Caledonia.\nLithium, too, once described as the \"white gold\" of the renewables transition and an essential element in electric \nvehicles, fell in price. This followed a boom in value which led to oversupply and a consequent price slump.\nInternational trade settings can affect the Australian critical minerals industry to a marked degree. China, for \ninstance, dominates the rare earths industry, particularly the heavy rare earths industry, which is critical for many \ndefence technologies.\nIn a statement in early June, Australian treasurer Jim Chalmers said he ordered five international companies linked \nto China to divest their shares in Australian heavy rare earths prospector Northern Minerals \"to protect our national \ninterest and ensure compliance with our foreign investment framework\".\nNorthern Minerals, which operates the strategically-crucial Browns Range mine in Western Australia's Kimberley, \nwants to become the first major producer outside China of dysprosium, a rare earth used in electric vehicles and \nwind turbines.\nThe managing director of Australian mining company Iluka, Tom O'Leary, voiced his concern about China's \ndominance of the rare earths industry at the company's annual general meeting in May.\nIluka has interests in titanium and zircon, as well as rare earths. O'Leary said China's dominance of the heavy rare \nearths industry was near total and \"achieved through production supremacy and its influence over pricing\", adding \nthat last December China had banned the export of heavy rare earth processing technology.\n\"In addition to being essential for the production of electric vehicles and wind turbines, the key heavy rare earths, \ndysprosium and terbium, have critical applications in defence and national security,\" he said. O'Leary discussed the \n\"megatrends shaping the global economy\", including the transition to clean energy, the development of independent \nsupply lines and the current policy settings of nations including Canada, Japan, South Korea, European Union Page 3 of 3\nNet zero unlocks the nation's critical minerals potential\nnations and Australia, which \"are now aimed squarely at retaining onshore some of the economic opportunities of \nthe energy transition\".\nLoad-Date: June 18, 2024\nEnd of Document",

It's a projection of our region of strategic interest and illustrates our \ngeography as it really is. I wish I had had it when I was defence minister. In the 1980s we operated off the RAAF's \nstrategic planning map - a projection of the northern approaches to the Australian continent with a series of \nconcentric circles emanating from the focal point, Darwin.\nI am reminded of the statement by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche: if you stare into the abyss long enough it \nwill stare back into you. If you stare into this map long enough, the lines of required effort in the defence of our \ncontinent stares back at us. It elevates our significance. We lie athwart the choke points between the Indian Ocean \nand the Pacific. We have a huge domain that shouts out our capacity for dispersal. The tilt of this map effectively \nmakes the whole of Western Australia our frontline.\nFour decades ago my late friend Des Ball wrote a book on the joint facilities entitled A suitable piece of real estate. \nHe saw our significance to the US in the then Cold War context as a southern vantage point for most facets of the \nevolving US strategic deterrent. Though continually evolving their technology, the US still finds the joint facilities so. \nBut now there is an added dimension.\nDuring the Cold War our geography was useful for the strategic balance, but no other component of the strategic \npicture. Now we are at the centre of their principal strategic focus. That has been so since the presidency of Barack \nObama. The rebalance to the Indo-Pacific is now cemented in the American strategic mind.\nThe American opinion is not simply driven by kindness to allies. This is about hard-headed military interest - ours \nand theirs. We need to get out of the habit of our focus on shared values. While they are there, we all know we \nhave very different constitutional arrangements, and values won't always be identical.\nHard military interests are another matter. They need to be separated out from what might be challengeable on the \nvalues front, particularly if Donald Trump is re-elected as US president. The DSR map tells us that if the US \nremains committed to the defence of the Western Pacific, our geography is critical. The US has a range of allies \nand friends in our zone. We are potentially the last bastion.\nPage 2 of 3\nWestern Australia is the AUKUS state\nThe US is not waiting around for the arrival of our AUKUS submarines. I am confident I will be dead when the first \nof those arrives. But, with our ability to provide facilities for submarine, air and missile deployments, we will remain \nvital. Above all our capacity for dispersal, if effectively pursued, will provide a continuation of our status as a \n\"suitable piece of real estate\". That is an effective contribution to our deterrence as well as that of our close allies.\nCapabilities and intentions are different phenomena. Our diplomacy must be devoted to sustaining friendships. But \nimportant to that effort is the appearance and reality of the fact we have a powerful ally. It is a vital component \nunderpinning that -diplomacy should evolving capabilities, at some point, confront changing intentions and views of \nus. AUKUS is not a defence -alliance, but both pillars - one and two - are vital in reinforcing ANZUS.\nTwo elements require urgent attention. They are for Pillar 1, the rapid development of HMAS Stirling (the RAN's \nmain base in WA) and the nearby Henderson naval construction and maintenance facility. For Pillar 2, it is \nleveraging our status as a world-class mining and, potentially, minerals processing nation for rare earths. Many \nother elements of our posture, not least the northern airbases at Learmonth and Curtin, are vital, but getting these \ntwo right is crucial.\nStirling/Henderson requires immediate and urgent attention. HMAS Stirling recently hosted a visit by an American \nsubmarine tender, the USS Frank Cable. Frequent such visits are useful. They should help keep us abreast of \nAmerica's needs. Within three years the US and UK rotational submarine deployments to WA will commence. What \nis being done now requires high security. We don't know how well it is proceeding.\nWhat hasn't proceeded fast enough is the land acquisition and building of accommodation in Rockingham of at \nleast 300 houses necessary to support planned US and UK submarine rotations. Defence Personnel Minister Matt \nKeogh's announcement earlier this month regarding construction of relevant defence housing in Rockingham will \nhelp settle frustrated minds. This development must quickly expand for the additional workforce required to \nconstruct the General Purpose Frigates and other naval programs.\nHenderson is nowhere near where it should be for all the planned developments involving the RAN and its naval \npartners. It needs security upgrades and dry-docking facilities.\nThe question of ownership of the various facilities required for shipbuilding and sustainment needs resolution. When \nwe built the Anzac frigates we were assisted by the creation of a joint venture for the vessels' construction. That \nwas AMECON, which first built two American-designed FFGs (Frigate, Guided Missiles) and then constructed the \nAnzac class. The latter were produced on time and under budget - still our best performance in naval shipbuilding.\nA joint venture is essential now. Austal does not have any guarantees for the planned General Purpose Frigate, but \nit does have the contract to build to Birdon's design 18 amphibious land craft (LC-Ms) for the Army. A joint venture \nfor the -facilities and subsequent builds would include at least Austal, BAE, Birdon and CIVMEC, which actually \nowns the main building at Henderson. Birdon might seem an unusual partner, but its executive chairman John \nWhite supervised the construction of the Anzac-class frigates, and has done it all before.\nThe government should insist on a joint venture being rapidly formed. The winner of the forthcoming General \nPurpose Frigate tender could join the joint venture when that deliberation is concluded. (Disclosure: I am a member \nof the Australian board of Luerssen - the company building the offshore patrol vessels [OPVs] in CIVMEC's \nbuilding.) The second pillar - and I think it should be a third pillar for its significance - would be the capacity in WA to \nmine and process rare earths for magnets vital to addressing a major American strategic weakness. Rare earths \nare crucial to 3400 American weapons systems. China already has a complete mine-to-missiles production \nprocess.\nWA has two companies capable of challenging Chinese dominance. One is Lynas. Strongly supported by the \nJapanese, it has survived repeated efforts by the Chinese to shut it down. Lynas's mine is at Mt Weld. It was \nselected by the US to construct a heavy rare earth processing facility in Texas.\nTo assist the process, it is building such a facility in Malaysia. It has a processing facility constructed in Kalgoorlie, \nbut that is for light rare earths. It is deeply aware of how vital this is to the US.Page 3 of 3\nWestern Australia is the AUKUS state\nA second is Iluka. Its processing facility is at Eneabba, 280km north of Perth. It has received government support, \nbut it needs more. The federal government is providing useful tax concessions for critical minerals, but additional \nhelp is needed to underpin efforts with offtake agreements and stockpiling.\nIn the northeast of WA, Northern Minerals is assessing a potential massive heavy rare earths deposit, which \nincludes dysprosium and terbium, at Browns range near the Northern Territory border. The federal government is \nalert to this and trying to compel (much resisted by Beijing) a selldown of Chinese interests in the project.\nThe global trade in these rare earths is about $US2bn ($2.9bn), but they support $US7 trillion of global \nmanufacturing. That man-ufacturing scoops up not just weapons production but also new technologies critical for \naddressing climate change.\nWe are ethical miners. Many across the globe are not.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 15\nLength: 1021 words\nByline: Jemima Whyte\nBody\nOne investor describes it as the M&A arbitrage trade of the year, except for the fact hedge funds are noticeably \nabsent.\nSierra Rutile, spun out of Iluka Resources in 2022, has attracted three takeover bids from three wildly different \nsuitors in the past five months.\nIn March, commercial construction company PRM Services lobbed a 9.5\u00a2 a share offer (and was swiftly rejected).\nNow, the board has recommended an 18\u00a2 a share offer from Sierra Leone-controlled oil company Leonoil Group, \nwhich outbid London-based emerging markets fund Gemcorp within weeks. A bidders' statement from Leonoil, \nwhich supplies fuel to Sierra Rutile, is due this week.\nIt's a return of more than three times since January if the bid goes through, but most of the well-known investors on \nthe register, including Samuel Terry, Regal and Perpetual, are long gone.\nIn a market where contested M&A remains thin on the ground, three bidders - even for a $76 million company - is \nnotable. All the more so as this company's performance has underwhelmed, and its cash position looks strained.\nAdding further intrigue are the different bidders tussling for control. They range from a Sierra Leone-backed energy \ngroup, a global metals trader, through to a London investor that the Financial Times has described as among the \n\"most daring emerging markets funds\" in an article documenting its historical links to Russian money.\nSierra Rutile, which mines rutile, the natural form of titanium dioxide used in paint and tiles, in West Africa, has \nbeen better known as another cautionary tale of large Australian companies investing offshore.\nIluka spun out the business within five years of buying it for $375 million. Within three years of the purchase, Iluka \nimpaired the carrying value by $US290 million and wrote down associated tax assets by $US115 million.\nOn deciding to divest in 2022, Greg Martin, now Sierra Rutile's chairman, said Iluka had to report corrupt behaviour \nby previous management, and the introduction of new mining technologies proved operationally difficult. At the start \nPage 2 of 3\nWhy M&A arb funds are sitting out 'trade of year' Due Diligence\nof this year, the company's register was still dotted with institutional investors that simply inherited the stock as part \nof their Iluka holdings.\nBut they were beginning to get antsy. Shares in the company that estimates it controls 20 per cent of the world's \nrutile had fallen to 5.8\u00a2 ahead of the PRM bid, from as high as 43\u00a2 at the time of spinout.\nOne tension point was whether it made sense to keep developing its Sembehun project, or focus on returning \ncapital to investors. The issue looked set to curdle further as Sierra Rutile found itself in a dispute with the Sierra \nLeone government, essentially over the split the West African nation's government should receive.\nBut then the rush of bidders arrived.\nSince July 22, the board has recommended investors back Leonoil's 18\u00a2 a share bid, which has no minimum \nacceptance conditions. It's an impressive turnaround from January levels, but still a long way from a demerger \nsuccess story for Iluka.\nIt's unclear which parties are siding with which strategic investors, and whether it is a done deal. Gemcorp, for one, \nstill holds 19.9 per cent of the company and has an offer that remains live, even if it is subject to a minimum 51 per \ncent acceptance.\nThis is far from the only question around this evolving situation. (A Takeovers Panel application by PRM Services \narguing some parties were acting together was dismissed. On Friday, the panel released the reasons for doing so, \nwhich disclosed that Sierra Rutile held talks with Gemcorp before it bought its shareholding.)\nAmong the many questions are how any bidders can appropriately value the mine based on available information \nabout Sierra Leone's taxes and fees.\nMuch of the intrigue is around the bidders themselves, which make up three of the group's four largest investors \nand account for almost 65 per cent of the company between them.\nFocus on trumped suitor Gemcorp, which swooped in late April as local fund Samuel Terry sold its 19.9 per cent \nholding, has increased after the FT article. It outlined how Gemcorp turned its focus to Africa at the same time \nVladimir Putin drove Russian diplomatic and commercial investment to minimise the impact of Western sanctions. \nAnd it detailed how it had hired a long list of well-connected UK government ministers and advisers.\nGemcorp told the FT that neither it nor its founder had ever acted in support of the Russian state nor broken \nsanctions.\nEven so, Gemcorp has been outbid by Leonoil. Leonoil Group popped its head above the substantial line on April \n29 and has since upped its stake to 7.5 per cent. The company provides fuel to Sierra Rutile and exports oil from \nthe largest terminal in the country, as well as owning and managing 24 petrol stations. Traditionally, sources say, \nthe company has been more aligned to the Sierra Leone opposition party than the government.\n(That compares to the only major investor that is yet to make an offer: contractor Mano Mining & Logistics, which \nowns 13.3 per cent of the company and is regarded as more aligned to the ruling government. Mano had been one \nof the contractors operating at the company's Area 1 until the suspension of mining, announced on March 11.)\nAnd there is still lots of noise around the first bidder to show up at Sierra Rutile, PRM Services, which maintains an \n11.46 per cent shareholding. Initially, PRM, which had its offer swiftly rejected, had sought to remove four non-\nexecutive directors and replace them with its own candidates.\nThe Puerto Rico-registered group's majority shareholder and chairman is Craig Dean, who runs the London-\nheadquartered Gerald Group. Gerald Group is an employee-owned metals trading company that already has a \npresence in Sierra Leone through its Marampa iron ore mine.Page 3 of 3\nWhy M&A arb funds are sitting out 'trade of year' Due Diligence\nAs the bid was lobbed, photos surfaced of Sierra Leone president Julius Maada Bio disembarking a plane \nregistered at the same address as the Gerald Group office in Connecticut. A spokeswoman for Gerald Group did \nnot confirm or deny if the jet belonged to the company, instead providing The West Australian with a statement on \nbroader \"market rumours\".\nLoad-Date: July 31, 2024\nEnd of Document",

All Rights Reserved\nSection: ASIA\nLength: 490 words\nBody\nOn the face of it, Australia should have a huge advance in the race for critical minerals. Its red centre holds large \nreserves of the minerals and rare earths that are vital for green and military technologies. Its centre-left Labor \ngovernment wants to dig and process more of them. It should be the perfect match.\nBut Australia is struggling to get its critical minerals out of the ground. A string of its lithium and nickel mines have \nclosed this year. Refineries are also in trouble. In July BHP, a mining giant, said it would close its nickel-processing \nfacilities in Western Australia. Weeks later, Albemarle, an American company, announced it was scaling back a \nlithium refinery. Ostensibly the problem is a market crash. Demand for electric vehicles, which use these minerals, \nis weaker than expected. And supplies of minerals have soared, driving down prices.\nAustralian miners see a bigger hand at work. China produces more than half the world's rare earths and refines \nalmost all of them. It subsidises rare-earth companies. Where it lacks its own big critical mineral deposits, it has \ninvested abroad-including in the Indonesian nickel that is flooding the market. It buys and refines the lion's share of \nlithium. This lets China force down prices, says John Coyne of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.\nAustralia's rare-earth miners are dangerously exposed, complains Tom O'Leary, chief executive of Iluka \nResources, one such group. In 2022 China issued a directive for its producers to \"guide product prices to return to \nrationality\". Rare-earth prices have since plunged by more than two-thirds. This makes it hard for competitors to be \nprofitable, says Mr O'Leary.\nChinese investors are also accused of using shady methods to secure access to Australian supply chains. Last \nyear Australia's government barred a Chinese-linked fund from increasing its stake in Northern Minerals, a miner, \non national-security grounds. Shares were subsequently purchased by several other funds. After an investigation, \nthe government determined that they were linked to China and ordered them to divest their holdings in June.\nPage 2 of 2\nWhy Australia is not yet a critical minerals powerhouse\nFor Australia, it is not just the potential for lucrative mines at home that China's dominance severely threatens. It's \nalso about its own security of supply. China cut off rare-earth exports to Japan during a diplomatic dispute in 2010, \nand curbed exports of gallium and germanium, used in semiconductors, last year. Western countries face \"an \nexistential risk around security of supply\", says Mr O'Leary.\nSo far, Australia's answer is to support miners with cheap loans and grants. It promises them tax breaks under a \nnew industrial policy. But the help only goes so far. The government lent Iluka A$1.25bn ($850m) in 2022 to open a \nrare-earths refinery. On August 21st Iluka declared that it needs more funding to complete the facility. There is still \na long way to go to end, or even reduce, reliance on China. \nGraphic\n \nKalgoorlie Nickel Project Goongarrie Hub site outside Kalgoorlie, Western Australia\nLoad-Date: August 30, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 15\nLength: 858 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nTreasury will run the rule over new major shareholders in Northern Minerals after the China-linked fund ordered by \nthe federal government to offload the majority of its stake sold out to Hong Kong-registered groups with almost no \ncorporate history.\nNorthern Minerals is key to Labor's plan to start a domestic critical minerals processing industry, with its Browns \nRange project supplying Australia's first fully integrated rare earths refinery being built by Iluka Resources with a \n$1.25 billion government loan.\nThose minerals can be used in weapons systems and Australia, along with the United States, is pushing to break \nChina's monopoly on processing.\nIn June, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said he would force Northern Minerals' largest shareholder, Singapore-registered \nYuxiao Fund, and its associates to sell shares, citing their close connection with Chinese interests.\nAhead of a deadline set by the government, Yuxiao sold its stake to two Hong Kong-registered companies, Qogir \nTrading & Service and Hong Kong Ying Tak. Each now controls 8.4 per cent of Northern Minerals.\nBut Qogir was only registered in April and has paid up capital of just $HK10,000 ($1892), according to the Hong \nKong register of company interests. Eight of its nine shareholders live in China; the ninth, its only director, is a \nChinese citizen.\nYing Tak is also registered in Hong Kong and has issued capital of $HK60 million. It was an investor in Northern \nMinerals before last week's purchase.\nNorthern Minerals said it wants to meet with its two new shareholders.\nA spokesman for Dr Chalmers said the government expected some 165 million shares owned by one of Yuxiao's \nassociates which had yet to be sold to be divested quickly.\nPage 2 of 2\nProbe into investors in minerals firm\n\"The government expects all outstanding share sales to be finalised imminently and will take further action if \nrequired to protect our national interest in relation to this matter,\" the spokesman said. \"As part of its usual \nprocesses, Treasury will undertake a full assessment of compliance with the disposal orders.\"\nTreasury's assessment of whether the divestment orders have been followed will include any links between those \nforced to sell and the new shareholders. It will come amid speculation that Dr Chalmers will visit China this month \nfor meetings, including with representatives of the National Development and Reform Commission.\nNorthern Minerals' former executive chairman Nick Curtis raised suspicious share trading and requested the \nForeign Investment Review Board investigate last year. By the time that Mr Curtis had raised the alarm, Dr \nChalmers had already blocked Yuxiao from increasing its stake in Northern Minerals to 19.9 per cent.\nMr Curtis quit the board in the face a Yuxiao-led push to have him removed at an extraordinary general meeting \nthat was scheduled for June 6.\nDr Chalmers issued his sell down order on June 3 and the following day Northern Minerals informed the market of a \ncybersecurity breach. The breach included the disclosure of corporate, operational and financial information, \npersonnel records and shareholder information, with some of it published on the dark web.\nThe Australian Financial Review reported in November that Yuxiao, which was close to major Chinese rare earths \nplayers, signed a co-operation deal with China Northern and Shanghai-listed Shenghe Resources in front of \nCommunist Party officials.\nNorthern Minerals shares were trading flat at 2.5\u00a2 yesterday, down from a 12-month high of 4.7\u00a2 in June in the \naftermath of the divestment order.\nSources with direct knowledge of the transaction said that part of the problem for Yuxiao was the difficulty that \nbrokers were having as they tried to sell Northern Mineral shares.\nA plunge in price for the key ingredient in wind turbines, electronics and military applications has seen Lynas Rare \nEarths, the world's biggest non-China supplier, withhold a portion of supply from the market this year. The lower \nprices have been linked to softer demand for permanent magnets and to oversupply in China.\nThe government's push to start a domestic processing industry with the loan to Iluka last month hit a roadblock, \nwhen the company warned that it would halt work on the refinery unless more funding was given.\nThe stand-off between Iluka and the government comes amid a delay in Lynas building a US military-backed \nrefinery in Texas that is expected to produce heavy rare earths oxides needed in the manufacture of permanent \nmagnets. They are essential in modern weapons, including warplanes and nuclear-powered submarines.\nLabor has begun taking a harder line on Chinese investment in the critical minerals sector as it looks to grow \ndomestic processing and develop supply chains. China dominates global supply of most rare earths materials and \nhas a monopoly on the processing of dysprosium and terbium.\nThe US military, in particular, could be left stranded if China cuts off a supply of dysprosium and terbium.\nLast December, China banned the export of rare earth technologies in a move to protect its market dominance.\nNorthern Minerals has previously ended offtake agreements with Chinese groups in favour of a deal with German \nconglomerate Thyssenkrupp.\nLoad-Date: September 6, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Iluka Resources is in a prolonged dispute with the Albanese government regarding additional funding for a partially constructed rare earths refinery in Western Australia, which has significant implications for the company's future mining projects in New South Wales and Victoria.\n\n2. The cost of the refinery has escalated to between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, prompting Iluka to seek further taxpayer support beyond the existing $1.25 billion loan from Export Finance Australia, which has created uncertainty among investors and stakeholders.\n\n3. Iluka's shares dropped by 3.6% following disappointing revenue results from its core mineral sands operations, which fell short of market expectations, indicating investor concern over the company's financial health and the unresolved funding situation for the refinery.\n\n4. The company has halted major contract signings and reduced operational activities due to the funding uncertainty, which could delay the commissioning of its planned mineral sands-rare earths mine at Balranald in NSW and the potential mine at Wimmera in Victoria.\n\n5. Despite having a million-tonne stockpile of ore containing rare earths, Iluka currently lacks an operational rare earths mine, highlighting the urgency of resolving the funding standoff to secure its position in the rare earths market amid global supply chain concerns.",

farmers their land will be used for a 3,000-hectare mine, \nunder compulsorily acquisition powers in Victoria's Mining Act.\nBody\nAfter more than 100 years, the Johns family have found their beloved farm in the footprint of a potential new mine.\nIf it is approved, they won't be able to live in their house for 36 years while mining at WIM Resource's new \nAvonbank mineral sands site is underway because of the noise, lights, vibration and \"toxic dust\".\nDonna Johns said her family's future was on hold.\n\"The stress that it's caused has been fairly immense \u2026 the lack of information too, has been hard on us,\" she said.\nVictoria's Mining Act allows mining companies to compulsorily acquire land once granted a mining licence.\nPlanning Minister Sonya Kilkenny's office said the project's Environmental Effects Statement was still under review \n\u2014 as it has been for more than a year \u2014 meaning it was not yet determined whether the mine at Dooen would go \nahead.\nBut multiple farmers have told the ABC they've received phone calls from WIM Resource saying it has been \napproved and an announcement would follow.\nIt means WIM Resource could have the power to compulsorily acquire the Johns family's property for the duration \nof the mine's life.\nFifth-generation farmer Chris Johns's eyes welled up thinking about what could be lost.\n\"Growing up [here] and spending \u2026 times with my father and mum, who passed away a few years ago, this is \nsuper important to me,\u201d Mr Johns said. \nPage 2 of 3\nDevastated farmers told Avonbank mineral sands mine will go ahead on their land\n\"We own this land and we've worked our guts out to keep what's here.\u201d\nApplication documents show WIM Resource, a Chinese-backed company, would mine 490 tonnes of ore, pay the \nstate $180 million in royalties over the mine's life, and generate nearly $513 million in state revenue annually.\nAcross Victoria, hundreds of exploration licences have been taken out, while about 30 retention licences have \nstaked claims on identified deposits in the Wimmera-Mallee.\nThe Avonbank project is one of 10 mineral sands projects in various planning stages across the Wimmera-Mallee \nand across the NSW border.\nHome of the lentil industry\nAndrew Weidemann is the research and development spokesperson for Grain Producers Australia, and a local \nfarmer.\n\"There are only two or three really strong zones in Australia where you can grow lentils,\" he said.  \nLast harvest, Victoria shipped 8.7 million tonnes of grain \u2014 including lentils \u2014 internationally, according to the \nstate's 2024 food and fibre export summary.\nOf the $5.6 billion generated, Mr Weidemann estimates about $2 billion came from the Wimmera.\nThe Avonbank mine plans to extract 12.75 million tonnes of heavy mineral concentrate for export to China, and for \nuse in electric vehicles, magnets, wind turbines and ceramics. \nMining mineral sands also exposes monazite, a naturally occurring radioactive mineral that can be refined into \nuranium. \nMr Weidemann is on the Avonbank mine's advisory committee and is worried about the potential contamination of \nproduce, grain exporting facilities and an agricultural college.\n\"You couldn't have picked a worse spot even if you tried,\" he said.\nProponents say regulation is strict\nJames Sorahan, executive director of the Minerals Council of Australia's Victorian branch, said the environmental \nrisk was low because government regulation was strict.\n\"Rehabilitation and all of these environmental and safety measures are fully integrated into a mine plan before the \nmine is approved,\" Mr Sorahan said. \nWIM Resource plans to mine a maximum of 400 hectares at any one time before moving onto other holes, so \nprevious pits can be rehabilitated.\nThe company said this technique was less invasive and only three years would be required before mined land could \nbe sown again.\nWIM Resource grew barley and lentil crops in 2021 and 2022 on a test pit, but local farmers weren't convinced.\nGavin Puls cropped a paddock alongside the test pit and said the company overestimated the results.\n\"We know what the crop looked like when they harvested it, and [how] ours was going next door, and theirs was \nnowhere near,\" he said. \n\"We deal with dirt everyday so we understand what can grow and what can't.\"Page 3 of 3\nDevastated farmers told Avonbank mineral sands mine will go ahead on their land\nRehabilitation and regulation doubts\nFarmers have also pointed to farmland further south at Kanagulk, where ore was mined between 2004 and 2012.\nThe main pit of Iluka Resources' Douglas mine is still being backfilled after tailings, which included radioactive \nmaterial from other Victorian and interstate mines, were deposited there.\n\"It [was] supposed to be a moving footprint but that never happened, the whole site was mined,\" Kanagulk \nLandcare group chair Ian Ross said.\nMr Ross sat on the mine's environmental review committee.\nHe said large stockpiles of soil were also left on private farmland for 15 years instead of the three years promised, \ncompacting the ground underneath and killing off any organic and microbial activity.\nHe said in other areas, holes being backfilled weren't compacted properly, so the ground sank and made it \nimpossible to crop.\nIluka Resources showed the ABC the pit they began rehabilitating 10 years ago.\n\"A lot of that land that was here prior to us being here was not suitable for agriculture,\" head of rare earths Daniel \nMcGrath said.\nHe said the company had rehabilitated land in Victoria for 20 years and was confident the private farmland they \nreturned to the landholder could be cropped.\n\"We've handed a closure and completion notice to the landholder so I'm comfortable they're very happy with the \nresults,\" Mr McGrath said.\nThe property owner who leased the land to Ilukatold the ABC more work needed to be done but declined to \ncomment further because they were bound by a confidentiality agreement.\nThe Victorian government's regulatory arm is the Earth Resources Regulator.\nA spokesperson said Iluka's change from a moving hole to a fully open mine was consistent with their \nEnvironmental Effects Statement.\nMr Ross no longer has faith in the state regulator, given his experience with the Douglas mine.\n\"For there to be an equitable balance, farmers need to be more empowered than they are,\" he said.\n\"You've got a well-oiled machine coming into a community with great resources, and each individual farmer has to \ntry look at the Environmental Effects Statement and the science and make sure what they've been told is true.\"\nWIM Resource was contacted for comment but did not

The Avonbank mineral sands project, backed by WIM Resource, has raised significant concerns among local farmers regarding land acquisition and potential environmental impacts, echoing past issues experienced with Iluka Resources' Douglas mine, where rehabilitation promises were not met.\n\n2. Farmers have expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of mining rehabilitation efforts, citing Iluka's previous failures in backfilling and soil management, which have led to long-term agricultural damage and loss of trust in regulatory assurances.\n\n3. The project is expected to generate substantial state revenue, with WIM Resource planning to extract 12.75 million tonnes of heavy mineral concentrate, indicating a growing demand for mineral sands in industries such as electric vehicles and renewable energy, which may impact Iluka's market positioning.\n\n4. Local agricultural representatives have voiced concerns about the potential contamination of crops and the long-term viability of farming in the region, drawing parallels to the negative experiences with Iluka's past operations, which have left lasting scars on the land.\n\n5. The regulatory environment surrounding mining operations in Victoria is under scrutiny, with farmers advocating for greater empowerment and transparency in the approval process, reflecting a broader distrust in the system that has previously allowed companies like Iluka to operate with perceived impunity.",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 22\nLength: 813 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nLabor has cleared the path to the country's first rare earths refinery after agreeing to lend its developer an additional \n$400 million, breaking a long impasse about who should cover a major cost blowout at the project.\nBut shares in the developer, ASX-listed Iluka, crashed almost 11 per cent to a four-year low on Friday after it \nagreed to cover a portion of the cost blowout on the Eneabba project in Western Australia, which was originally \nexpected to cost around $1.2 billion when it was approved in April 2022. The refinery will make separated rare earth \noxides and is a key plank in the Albanese government's plan to break China's stranglehold on critical minerals by \nprocessing minerals locally.\nDiscussion over how to fund the cost blowouts took more than a year, but was resolved on Friday when the \ngovernment's Export Finance Australia agency agreed to lend the extra $400 million towards the project.\nThe new financing is in addition to the original $1.25 billion loan facility offered by EFA in the final weeks of the \nMorrison government in 2022.\nIluka will contribute an extra $214 million of cash to cover its share of the blowouts. The company's accounts show \nit had cash of just over $154 million on June 30, down from almost $343 million a year earlier.\nBut investors are concerned that the miner may have difficulties funding its share of the refinery blowouts and fear \nIluka may struggle to make a profit from the Eneabba refinery once it is completed and operating.\nIluka managing director Tom O'Leary said the company was unlikely to sell its 19.99 per cent stake in Deterra \nRoyalties to raise the funds. The stake in Deterra was worth about $400 million on Friday. Friday's slump means \nIluka's value slipped below that of Deterra, which it spun off in 2020.\nWhile EFA's original $1.25 billion loan did not come with any conditions around offtake, yesterday's deal was \ncontingent on Iluka striking agreements to sell the refinery's product only to customers deemed \"satisfactory\" to the \nfederal government.\nMr O'Leary said offtake agreements would likely be struck closer to completion of construction at Eneabba.\nPage 2 of 2\nIluka snares loan for rare earth refinery; Critical minerals\nThe government is likely to want Iluka's customers to be from \"like-minded\" nations such as South Korea, Japan, \nthe US and Britain, given the rationale for the taxpayer-funded investment was to break China's stranglehold on \nprocessing of rare earths such as neodymium, praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium.\nGlobal demand for those four elements was about 78,000 tonnes in 2024, but Iluka predicts demand will rise to at \nleast 113,000 tonnes by 2034 and could be as high as 209,000 tonnes.\nPrices for neodymium and praseodymium were weak around $US48 a kilogram in the three months to September; \na price at which many analysts believe the Eneabba project will struggle to be profitable.\nJPMorgan analyst Al Harvey told his clients last month that he expected Eneabba would deliver negative returns if \nneodymium and praseodymium prices averaged $US80 per kilogram long term, adding that Iluka shares would \nbenefit if the entire processing project was abandoned.\nBut Iluka believes China has used its market power to depress rare earths prices on the Asian Metal Index, and Mr \nO'Leary said customers would eventually pay much higher prices for Eneabba's product to ensure a supply chain \nthat avoids China, which has a stranglehold on much of the product.\nIluka cited forecasts by Adamas Intelligence which suggests neodymium and praseodymium would fetch closer to \n$US160 per kilogram by 2034.\n\"This is a strategic infrastructure asset that puts Iluka and Australia at the forefront of global electrification, the \ncreation of new and resilient critical minerals supply chains and the establishment of a rare earths industry that is \ngenuinely independent,\" said Mr O'Leary.\nThe Eneabba refinery was originally supposed to deliver first production in 2025, but Iluka delayed the schedule to \n2026 when it disclosed the blowouts in December last year. The company revealed another slip in the schedule on \nFriday when it said commissioning of the refinery was expected in 2027.\nThe refinery would run for nine years if it processed only the monazite stockpile at Eneabba and ore from Iluka's \nmine at Balranald in NSW.\nBut Iluka plans to supplement those feedstocks with additional sources of ore from third parties such as explorer \nNorthern Minerals and from its own proposed mine in Victoria's Wimmera.\nRare earths are used to make the industrial magnets inside EVs, and in technology used in defence and the \ntransition to clean energy.\n\"Not only are critical minerals and rare earths key to the energy transition, they are essential to the defence industry \nand our national security,\" Resources Minister Madeleine King said. \"We stand at an important moment in time \nwhere the world wants what we have and we just happen to have the most advanced mining sector in the world.\"\nLoad-Date: December 9, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 28\nLength: 851 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nThe failed campaign to hand Australian nickel a so-called green premium is barely over. But politicians and miners \nare already making a fresh bet that foreign customers will voluntarily pay overs for our critical minerals.\nThat much was clear from Friday's Eneabba rare earths update. The refinery is now the recipient of the second-\nbiggest taxpayer loan in history after receiving an additional $400 million from Export Finance Australia.\nTaxpayers are now lending a total of $1.65 billion to a project that will struggle to make a profit if rare earths prices \nstay at current levels.\nTo be successful, the Eneabba project and its developer, Iluka Resources, need a revolution to sweep through the \nmining industry and change everything about how rare earths are priced.\nIt's a bold bet, and it has split the investment community between those, such as JP Morgan analyst Al Harvey, who \nwish it were abandoned, and those, such as Goldman Sachs analyst Paul Young, who believe the refinery, which \nwill be one of the first in the country, will be a strategically valuable asset.\nIluka managing director Tom O'Leary is the ring-leader of the revolution, arguing that China has used its market \npower to depress the rare earths prices quoted on the major price discovery venue: the Asian Metal Index.\nO'Leary reckons the AMI should be disregarded, and he has publicly lobbied rare earths rivals such as Lynas to \ncease giving the index credibility by selling their product on contracts that link to the index. Iluka is the owner of the \nEneabba refinery, and O'Leary spent Friday's call justifying a business case for the refinery that assumed long-term \nprices for neodymium and praseodymium would average between $US82 and $US148 per kilogram; well above the \n$US58 per kilogram price quoted on AMI.\n\"The consequence of having to go with AMI is that the whole industry is losing money, so thus the importance and \nthe general acceptance I think in the industry that we need to break away from an AMI linkage,\" he said.\n\"We must find a new pricing dynamic for the sale of rare earths into this more open, Western supply chain.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nTaxpayers have bet $1.65b on a rare earths premium\nO'Leary's alternative vision is for rare earths to be sold on bilateral contracts that allow non-Chinese miners to \nreceive higher prices, while the non-Chinese customers get security of supply in an era where China wields \ninfluence by occasionally starving rival nations of the metals they need for their manufacturing industries.\n\"It is really landing with customers and with the rest of the industry, so I am confident we will get those [better-priced \nsale contracts] in place with plenty of time,\" said O'Leary.\nThe French government's top bureaucrat for strategic minerals, Benjamin Gallezot, visited Australia in October and \nsaid European carmakers would need to be protected from the extreme peaks in commodity price cycles if, in \nexchange, Australian miners wanted a special premium to help them survive periods of weak prices.\n\"You can't have a system that walks just one way,\" he said.\nSo, will the rare earths pricing revolution happen? It is easy to be pessimistic after an 18-month period in which the \nhubristic exceptionalism of the Australian critical minerals sector has been punctured.\nLocal nickel miners no longer speak with certainty that they will receive a \"green premium\" to reflect their lower \ncarbon footprint. Electric vehicle makers such as Tesla have shown they are willing to buy the cheap nickel coming \nout of Indonesia, even if it causes more harm to the landscape.\nLocal lithium miners also spend less time talking about the Inflation Reduction Act these days, after realising the \nfine detail of the eligibility criteria means most of them won't qualify for a subsidy because of links to Chinese \ninvestors or processors.\nBut unlike the green premium sought by nickel and lithium miners for their environmental attributes, O'Leary's pitch \nfor a premium is more khaki green because it is based on the threat of war, or at least a protracted cold war.\nIf China can control the supply of neodymium, praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium, it can limit Western nations' \nability to make defence equipment such as night-vision goggles and fighter jets.\nWhile the environmental policies that stoked talk of a \"green premium\" may have lost momentum, there is no sign \nthat geopolitical tensions between China and the US are easing.\nThe past month has seen President-elect Donald Trump talk up a new round of tariffs, while China last week placed \nfresh curbs on the export of critical minerals such as gallium and germanium. Those headlines are grist for the mill \nin O'Leary's push for a rare earths pricing revolution.\nExport Finance Australia has given itself a little bit of protection in case O'Leary's price revolution doesn't eventuate; \nthe extra $400 million pledged can only be drawn down after Iluka strikes offtake agreements. In other words, the \ngovernment has told Iluka it must crystallise its price revolution into a sales contract before it gets any more \ntaxpayer funds.\nThe clock is now ticking, and O'Leary has about two years before he needs to deliver. Vive la revolution.\nLoad-Date: December 11, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 2\nLength: 1014 words\nByline: Jennifer Hewett\nBody\nA buoyant Western Australia might still be crucial to Anthony Albanese's election hopes, but the mood in the state's \nmining industry has changed considerably since 2022.\nThat goes well beyond the collapse in the global price of lithium and nickel, which has led to the shutdown of lithium \nand nickel mines and processing - from projects owned by BHP to the usual cast of WA resources billionaires.\nJust a couple of years ago, optimism about Australia's future as a global supplier of critical minerals had created a \nsurge of enthusiasm about the potential of domestic processing and manufacturing jobs.\nFederal Labor politicians such as Albanese and state politicians like WA Premier Roger Cook, who was the then \nstate resources minister, promoted Australia's potential in advanced chemical processing and \"value-added\" \nmanufacturing, including batteries and other complex products, rather than just selling raw resources to China.\nHowever, the complications and costs of critical minerals production coincided unhappily with falling prices for most \nof these products. The surging price of gold, along with the staple of iron ore, has helped WA compensate for the \nelusive nature of such options.\nYet traditional gold production, although highly lucrative, is different to the early 2020s vision of a green revolution \nand advanced technology creating an ever-expanding need for Australia's range of critical minerals, including rare \nearths.\nThe Morrison government was never quite so seduced by the lure of new manufacturing industries based on the \nenergy transition, but it was still willing to place some sizeable bets on their progress.\nThe biggest - as one of its last acts - was a $1.25 billion loan to Iluka Resources to build a rare earths refinery at \nEneabba, north of Perth.\nThe project is now an object lesson in the pitfalls as well as the potential for Australia's ambitions in critical \nminerals.\nPage 2 of 3\nCritical minerals dream meets reality Page Two\nUnsurprisingly, the construction of the refinery has not gone to plan, budget or timetable. This created a protracted \nstalemate with the Albanese government over the need for additional funding to finish the building work.\nThis has been resolved - at least for the moment - with an agreement between the government and Iluka this \nmonth for a $400 million loan from Export Finance Australia.\nThe additional money is contingent on Iluka selling its product to customers considered \"satisfactory\" by the \ngovernment. That is polite cover for not selling to China.\nThat's because the primary reason for the government's interest is the attempt to create alternative sources of \nsupply to what is effectively Chinese control of the rare earths industry, as part of that country's global dominance in \ncritical minerals processing in general.\nThat's not just important to Australia, of course. There's a belated recognition by the US and the rest of the West \nthat China has been far more strategic about building on its strengths in this area over decades.\nIts competitive edge in technology, experience and funding has also included regularly suppressing prices by \ndramatically increasing supply to limit unwanted competition or to demonstrate an ability to punish opponents.\nThe bottom line for Australia is that critical minerals production - let alone processing - is becoming only more \ndifficult given the sharply reduced prices compounding the high costs, the financial and technical complications and \nthe delays in approvals for any project here.\nUS lithium giant Albemarle is curbing output from its new lithium hydroxide plant in WA not only because of the \ndramatic fall in lithium prices but also because it has more competitive options elsewhere.\nUnlike Western Australia's major export commodity of iron ore, critical minerals cannot rely on huge scale and \nefficiency of production to deliver viable projects. The complexity of mining and processing, often of relatively small \nquantities, makes for a very different business case and style of operation.\nThe hope that Western companies or countries would be willing to pay a \"green premium\" is yet to be realised in \npractice. Despite frequent rhetoric about ensuring \"security of supply\" by creating an alternative supply to challenge \nChina's stranglehold, there's also little evidence of the market's willingness to pay a \"national security premium\" \neither.\nThe rare earths industry is no exception to this reluctance to invest in projects that are at best marginal or more \ncommonly loss-making at current prices. Iluka Resources has delayed the opening of the refinery until 2027. But \nmost mining or processing projects in Australia are on an indefinite hold anyway, especially given the country's \nincreasing hesitation about accepting any further Chinese investment.\nAlthough Japan has been more willing to risk long-term capital, the replacement of Chinese investment with US and \nEuropean money is extremely elusive.\nThat hesitation is despite China's obvious willingness to retaliate against US tariffs and trade bans by increasing \nrestrictions on crucial supplies of critical minerals such as rare earths even before Donald Trump takes office.\nAfter the Biden administration recently expanded export restrictions on chip-making equipment and sanctioned \nmore Chinese companies from trading with companies from the US or its allies, the Chinese announced new \nmeasures on exports to the US with \"dual use\" civilian and military applications.\nThis included banning the export to the US of rare earth minerals such as gallium, germanium and antimony, all \nimportant for military, industrial and semiconductor production.\nBackers of projects such as Iluka Resources' refinery, including the Australian government, can only rely on such \ntensions eventually leading to a commitment to pay higher prices or negotiate profitable, long-term contracts for \nnon-Chinese suppliers.Page 3 of 3\nCritical minerals dream meets reality Page Two\nThe additional $400 million government loan, for example, is dependent on Iluka Resources signing offtake \nagreements with customers in what are diplomatically called \"like-minded nations\".\nWhen and whether that happens is an even bigger bet on the future.\njennifer.hewett@afr.com\nLoad-Date: December 20, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The government had already extended $840 million in loans to help the Gina Rinehart-backed company \ndevelop its Nolans project outside Alice Springs.\nArafura's shares closed up 17 per cent at 14\u00a2 yesterday, giving the miner a market capitalisation of $320 million. Its \nshares are down 16 per cent over the past year.\nWhen it is up and running, the venture will produce neodymium and praseodymium - rare earths used in the \nmanufacture of magnets found in electric vehicles and wind turbines.\nArafura chief executive Darryl Cuzzubbo said the company had already agreed to binding offtake deals with \ncustomers prepared to pay a premium above the current price for various rare earths to avoid sourcing the minerals \nfrom China.\n\"When we're talking to our customers, it's all about supply security and not about price,\" he said. \"Consequently, \nwe've got floors in our contracts that are materially above the current pricing, and that meets some of our conditions \nrequired by our lenders.\n\"This demonstrates that customers are more concerned about supply security than pricing, per se.\"\nChina controls more than 80 per cent of rare earths production, and governments including in the United States, the \nEuropean Union, Canada, Japan and Australia are working to wrest away Beijing's grip on the supply of critical \nminerals during the global energy transition.\nPage 2 of 2\nDoubts raised over $1b rare earths bet\nHowever, rare earths prices are in the doldrums after China used its dominance to depress the market and cut \ncompetition, forcing Arafura and rival Iluka to go cap-in-hand for government backing.\nAnd the theory that foreign customers will pay more for Australian minerals also came undone in the failed \ncampaign by mining billionaire Andrew Forrest to sell local nickel at a \"green premium\" compared with the \ncommodity produced by less environmentally friendly regimes overseas.\nBell Potter mining analyst Regan Burrows said that despite a lot of talk about the prospect of a \"non-China\" \npremium across various commodities, it had not eventuated.\n\"Good luck to Arafura if they can achieve it,\" he said\nMr Burrows noted that rival Australian producer Lynas was not receiving such a premium for its rare earths.\n\"There might be a security or supply angle that more than outweighs the cost ... but I want to see proof,\" he aid.\nLast month, Labor agreed to an additional $400 million of loans to help ASX-listed Iluka develop the country's first \nrare earths refinery, also on the assumption of a \"non-China\" premium.\nAl Harvey, a mining analyst at JPMorgan, was sceptical that such a pricing differential would eventuate.\n\"How do you value the strategic elements of rare earths? There still seems to be a view that there will be an ex-\nChina premium, but I can't see it happening until we get an ex-China supply chain developed, and I think that's a \nmuch longer-dated phenomenon to play out,\" he said.\nHancock Prospecting - the private company controlled by Mrs Rinehart, Australia's richest person - is the largest \nshareholder in Arafura with an 8.6 per cent stake.\nIndustry Minister Ed Husic acknowledged the current low price of rare earths, but said the Nolans project would \ncreate hundreds of jobs and give Australia a strategic foothold in the industry.\n\"At this point in time, prices aren't anything to brag about. If they change, then [Nolans] is something that puts us in \na position to meet global demand,\" he said.\nArafura has signed offtake agreements that account for roughly half the expected production from the first phase of \nthe Nolans ramp-up, Mr Cuzzubbo said.

Heavy rare earths, like the dysprosium and terbium over which China has a \nstranglehold, are a crucial element in the permanent high-strength magnets used in robotics, defence technology \nand ocean wind turbines, where they require little maintenance to generate electricity far from the coastline.\nThe minerals refined by Australian companies are now a strategic asset as America swings sharply towards a more \ntransactional trade stance under US President Donald Trump, and Beijing counters US tariffs by clamping down on \nsupply of scarce metals.\nIf Australia is dragged into a trade war with the US and China, \"heavy rare earths could serve as a bargaining chip,\" \nsaid Neha Mukherjee, a senior analyst in rare earths at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\nWithin hours of Trump imposing a 10 per cent tariff on China last week, Beijing introduced export controls on a raft \nof key minerals such as tungsten, tellurium, molybdenum, bismuth and indium that are critical to a range of high-\ntech goods. China's Commerce Ministry said the controls were to \"safeguard national security interests.\"\nThe clampdown exposes a fault line running through the global economy.\nChina has invested heavily for decades in refining production of critical minerals and rare earths and accounts for \n90 per cent of all rare earth oxides used in global manufacturing, effectively controlling all supply of key heavy rare \nearths. Governments around the world are scrambling to secure supplies of the key minerals, as a result.\nLink to Image\nPage 2 of 3\nAustralia close to breaking China's critical mineral stranglehold\nTrevor Collens\n\"Rare earths are among very few metals where China has demonstrated a preparedness to withhold supply to \nachieve unrelated political or other objectives. We've also seen China previously implement restrictions on the \nexport of rare earth processing technology,\" Iluka managing director Tom O'Leary said.\n\"We've all seen the perils of concentrated supply chain over the last several years, and so there's much greater \nawareness now of the importance of security of supply,\" O'Leary said.\nIluka is building a fully integrated rare earths refinery at Eneabba in Western Australia with the help of a $1.65 \nbillion federal government loan. Within a decade of firing up the plant in 2027, it will account for 10 per cent the \nworld's rare earth oxide supply, and refine more than a third of globe's strategically important heavy rare earth \noxides, the company says.\nWe're seeing critical minerals being used more and more as bargaining chips in trade negotiations, with countries \nleveraging their control over supply chains to get a better deal\nCameron Perks, analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\nMeanwhile, ASX-listed Lynas - valued at $6.5 billion - late last year turned on production at its newly built $800 \nmillion mixed rare-earth processing plant in Kalgoorlie. It will ship the carbonate output from Kalgoorlie for further \nrefining in Malaysia where it operates the world's largest single rare earths processing plant producing separated \nrare earths for export.\nLynas is also building a heavy rare earths refinery in Texas, backed by $384 million in Defence Department funding \nfrom the Biden administration, in a bid to accelerate America's access to supplies of rare earths.\nAnother Benchmark analyst, Cameron Perks, said if the US-China trade war escalates, combined with new tariffs \nand export controls, it's going to have a significant impact on the critical minerals sector as a whole.\n\"We're seeing critical minerals being used more and more as bargaining chips in trade negotiations, with countries \nleveraging their control over supply chains to get a better deal,\" Perks said.\n\"Clients in South Korea and Japan have been reaching out to Australia a lot lately, wanting insights on supply, \ndemand, pricing, and cost curves as they try to figure out the impact of Trump's policies. They're trying to figure out \nif this is an opportunity or if they should be backing out,\" he said.\nAustralia's current heavy rare earth output accounts for just 1 per cent of global mined production, Mukherjee said. \nBut it's projected to jump significantly, reaching 14 per cent by 2029 - the fastest growth outside of China.\nRamping up refining capacity is costly, technically challenging and time-consuming. Few have gained the foothold \nrequired to compete with China, even on more basic materials like lithium.\nASX-listed IGO began producing battery-grade lithium hydroxide with joint venture partner China's Tianqi Lithium \nfrom its Kwinana Refinery in Western Australia in 2022, only to shutter parts of the operation in January this year as \nsluggish demand for electric vehicles and slumping prices slowed sales and created a global stockpile of the white \nbattery metal.\nThe Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day's trading.

Heavy rare earths, like the dysprosium and terbium over which China has a \nstranglehold, are a crucial element in the permanent high-strength magnets used in robotics, defence technology \nand ocean wind turbines, where they require little maintenance to generate electricity far from the coastline.\nThe minerals refined by Australian companies are now a strategic asset as America swings sharply towards a more \ntransactional trade stance under US President Donald Trump, and Beijing counters US tariffs by clamping down on \nsupply of scarce metals.\nIf Australia is dragged into a trade war with the US and China, \"heavy rare earths could serve as a bargaining chip,\" \nsaid Neha Mukherjee, a senior analyst in rare earths at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.\nWithin hours of Trump imposing a 10 per cent tariff on China last week, Beijing introduced export controls on a raft \nof key minerals such as tungsten, tellurium, molybdenum, bismuth and indium that are critical to a range of high-\ntech goods. China's Commerce Ministry said the controls were to \"safeguard national security interests.\"\nThe clampdown exposes a fault line running through the global economy.\nChina has invested heavily for decades in refining production of critical minerals and rare earths and accounts for \n90 per cent of all rare earth oxides used in global manufacturing, effectively controlling all supply of key heavy rare \nearths. Governments around the world are scrambling to secure supplies of the key minerals, as a result.\nPage 2 of 2\nMiners close to breaking China's rare earths grip Critical minerals\n\"Rare earths are among very few metals where China has demonstrated a preparedness to withhold supply to \nachieve unrelated political or other objectives,\" Iluka managing director Tom O'Leary said. \"We've all seen the \nperils of concentrated supply chain over the last several years, and so there's much greater awareness now of the \nimportance of security of supply.\"\nIluka is building a fully integrated rare earths refinery at Eneabba in Western Australia with the help of a $1.65 \nbillion federal government loan. Within a decade of firing up the plant in 2027, it will account for 10 per cent the \nworld's rare earth oxide supply, and refine more than a third of globe's strategically important heavy rare earth \noxides, the company says.\nMeanwhile, ASX-listed Lynas - valued at $6.5 billion - late last year turned on production at its newly built $800 \nmillion mixed rare-earth processing plant in Kalgoorlie. It will ship the carbonate output from Kalgoorlie for further \nrefining in Malaysia where it operates the world's largest single rare earths processing plant producing separated \nrare earths for export.\nLynas is also building a heavy rare earths refinery in Texas, backed by $384 million in Defence Department funding \nfrom the Biden administration, in a bid to accelerate America's access to supplies of rare earths.\nAnother Benchmark analyst, Cameron Perks, said if the US-China trade war escalates, combined with new tariffs \nand export controls, it's going to have a significant impact on the critical minerals sector as a whole.\n\"We're seeing critical minerals being used more and more as bargaining chips in trade negotiations, with countries \nleveraging their control over supply chains to get a better deal,\" Perks said. \"Clients in South Korea and Japan have \nbeen reaching out to Australia a lot lately, wanting insights on supply, demand, pricing, and cost curves as they try \nto figure out the impact of Trump's policies. They're trying to figure out if this is an opportunity or if they should be \nbacking out.\"\nLoad-Date: February 9, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 2\nLength: 1006 words\nByline: Jennifer Hewett\nBody\nJust before the last election, Iluka Resources chief executive Tom O'Leary persuaded the Morrison government to \ntake a big bet on the future of rare earths processing in Australia. The then prime minister sanctioned a $1.25 billion \nloan from Export Finance Australia for the construction of a rare earths refinery in Western Australia.\nA new Labor government was even more enthused about the potential for another resources boom in critical \nminerals processing, including rare earths, as Western countries and customers belatedly recognised the risks of \nrelying on China's domination of the industry.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese and West Australian Premier Roger Cook promoted Australia's potential in \nadvanced chemical processing and \"value-added\" manufacturing, including batteries and other complex products, \nrather than just selling its raw resources to China.\nBut as the next election looms, there's been a hard reckoning in the difficulties in developing new mines or new \nprocessing and manufacturing projects aimed at escaping China's firm grip on the market.\nThis doesn't mean the strategic imperative to develop alternatives to China's control of critical minerals, especially \nthe 17 rare earth element minerals, has reduced. Instead, the sense of urgency has only grown as China has \nrepeatedly demonstrated its willingness to turn supply on and off.\nIn some areas, China has dramatically increased and assisted production of minerals like lithium, including making \nuse of Chinese stakes and financing in developing countries. This is an effective way to depress prices and ensure \ncompeting projects in Western countries are financially unviable.\nAt other times, China has restricted or banned exports of key rare earth elements required for advanced \ntechnology, including energy transition and defence needs.\nThat's particularly significant when China accounts for 70 per cent of global extraction of rare earths, 87 per cent of \nglobal processing and 100 per cent of processing of \"heavy\" rare earths like dysprosium and terbium crucial for \ndefence, robotics and electric vehicles.\nPage 2 of 3\nHard reckoning for a critical future; PAGE TWO\nRare earths aren't actually that rare. Some are not really valuable in themselves, while small volumes for others \nmake them commercially challenging to process, given the need for complex chemical technology.\nAustralia has still been a strong advocate of the role it can play in addressing the West's belated concerns about \nthe control China has developed over decades.\nThat's despite the Donald Trump presidency leaving the fate of the \"climate, critical minerals and clean energy \ntransformation compact\" signed with the US in the Biden era unclear.\nTrump's suggestion of a \"minerals for aid\" deal to Ukraine and a takeover of Greenland and its rare earths \nresources reflects his willingness to trash any concept of alliance relationships that goes well beyond cutting China \nout of supply chains.\nYet most major customers of critical minerals have been reluctant to pay any \"non-China\" or \"green\" premium to \nmake replacement projects profitable or investible on normal commercial terms.\nThat's compounded by the cost of construction accelerating across the world, particularly obvious in sharp price \nincreases in Australia.\nThe result is a dismal record of indefinite deferrals, delays or shuttering of a range of critical minerals projects and \nprocessing as companies struggle to survive let alone expand.\nThe Albanese government has more than doubled financial assistance available from its predecessor's $2 billion \ncritical minerals facility, including taking minor equity stakes and providing a range of grants and loans.\nIn most cases, the finances still don't stack up.\nBut Iluka Resources has stockpiled rare earths from its own mineral sands operations since 1991 on the \npresumption these would one day be valuable. It now wants to use this supply and other potential feedstocks to \nproduce light and heavy rare earth oxides required for the permanent magnets and metals needed for \nelectrification, defence and other advanced technology.\nThe company and the government still had a stand-off for more than 12 months after Iluka insisted it needed an \nadditional loan to build its refinery at Eneabba north of Perth.\nThis was only resolved after Canberra agreed to lend Iluka an extra $400 million to help cover the increased costs, \nwith Iluka providing another $214 million.\nThe extra government commitment is contingent on the company signing off-take agreements \"satisfactory\" to the \nCommonwealth.\nThe refinery is now due to start operations in 2027.\nThe federal government has also just made a $200 million equity investment in Arafura Rare Earths.\nThat's in addition to an earlier $840 million in government loans to Arafura to develop a mine and refinery in the \nNorthern Territory to produce neodymium and praseodymium.\nThere's still plenty of market scepticism about whether such projects will ever be profitable despite company \nassurances that customers in countries including South Korea, Japan and European nations will be willing to pay \nmore over time to guarantee security and diversity of supply.\nAs Iluka announced a 33 per cent decline in full-year net profit from its other mineral sands and mining operations \nyesterday, its chief executive sounded optimistic about higher prices to come.\n\"Neither we nor the customers are focused on the current prices that are published by the Asian Metals Index,\" \nO'Leary said.Page 3 of 3\nHard reckoning for a critical future; PAGE TWO\n\"Our customers are pretty focused on diversity of supply sources and security of supply. We are engaging with \nthem on a price framework and I think we are getting good traction on that.\n\"There's a growing acceptance by the industry that there is need for change ... It clearly takes time to evolve and \ndevelop the market for products that have hitherto been completely controlled almost by the Chinese.\"\nO'Leary was still careful to remind analysts that the government loans allowing Iluka \"an opportunity to build a \nterrific business and diversify the company\" are strictly non-recourse.\nThat's bottom-line business.\njennifer.hewett@afr.com\nLoad-Date: February 22, 2025\nEnd of Document",
