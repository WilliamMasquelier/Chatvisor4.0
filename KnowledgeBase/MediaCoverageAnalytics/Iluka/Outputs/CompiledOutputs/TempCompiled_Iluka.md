The ASX is poised to open lower this morning following the lead of the US overnight where all three major indices 
ended the session lower. 
The Dow Jones index fell by 64 points or 0.2%, the S&P 500 index slid 0.6% and the Nasdaq index shed 145 points 
or 0.9%. 
ASX futures are down 21 points or 0.3% at 8 am AEDT.
The big news of the morning is the resignation of Woolworths CEO Brad Banducci after 13 years at the retail giant. 
Banducci's decision to step down comes after he walked out of an interview on Monday where allegations of price 
gouging were put to him by an ABC journalist.  
Previously credited by investors with turning around the supermarket giant in his eight years as chief executive, 
Banducci last year failed to meet customer satisfaction targets amid an increased focus on supermarket shelf prices 
and profit margins. 
Woolworths head of loyalty and e-commerce Amanda Bardwell will step into the chief executive role effective 
September 1. 
Mixed company results 
Reporting a 9.2% fall in half-year net profit to $58 million, Domino's Pizza Enterprises has cut its first-half dividend 
to 55.5¢ from 67.4¢ a year ago.

The morning catch up: ASX set to follow US markets down
Meanwhile, WiseTech lifted its interim dividend to 7.7¢, up 17%, after the software provider posted a 5% increase in 
statutory net profit to $118.2 million and reconfirmed guidance for FY2024.
Mineral sands miner Iluka Resources says persistent inflation, subdued demand, geopolitical volatility and higher 
costs are behind a 42% fall in the company's full-year net profit. The miner will pay a final dividend of 4¢ per share, 
taking its full-year dividend to 7¢  - well down on the prior year's 45¢ payout.
National Australia Bank has warned of growing arrears in local home lending and a slowing economy, with the 
company's cash earnings sinking by almost 17% in the December quarter to $1.8 billion.
But the banks are not the only ones feeling the weakness of the property market. 
Stockland said current conditions remained uncertain as it "reshapes" its portfolio with a focus on its residential 
communities business. The property giant reported its profit fell by almost $200 million in the first half of 2024 year, 
from $102 million to $301 million in the same six months last year. 
Scentre - the owner and operator of Westfield shopping centres - has recorded a 41.8% fall in annual statutory 
profit to $174.9 million. This comes after it booked an unrealised $1 billion writedown on the value of its shopping 
centre portfolio.
What happened overnight? 
Here's what we saw (source CommSec):
US markets
US sharemarkets fell on Tuesday as chipmaker Nvidia slid 4.4% ahead of its highly anticipated earnings report. 
Although Nvidia is expected to post impressive results, investors have expressed concerns about its sky-high 
valuation.
Traders also assessed a report that Microsoft is developing a networking card as an alternative to the one supplied 
by Nvidia.
Super Micro Computer dropped 2% as investors took a break from betting on the stock as a big beneficiary of 
strong artificial intelligence technology demand. 
Lithium producer Albemarle tumbled 6.3%, despite announcing a multi-year agreement with BMW for lithium 
hydroxide supplies.
Walmart hit a record high and was up 3.2% after the US retail giant forecast fiscal 2025 sales largely above market 
expectations and raised its annual dividend by 9%. 
Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS) surged 12.6% on Warren Buffett-backed consumer bank Capital One's 
plans to acquire the US credit card issuer in a US$35.3 billion deal. 
US government bond yields dipped on Tuesday in a holiday-shortened week as investors consolidated positions 
following last week's gains in the wake of stronger-than-expected US inflation data.
Investors are looking to Wednesday's minutes of the January Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting for 
more clues on the US interest rate outlook.
European markets
European sharemarkets snapped a four-day winning streak on Tuesday, weighed down by mining and energy 
stocks, which fell between 1.1% and 1.8%. Technology shares also lost 1.8%, with software firm Temenos sliding 
5.6% after forecasting slower earnings growth in 2024. Page 3 of 4

Iluka Resources is in talks with the Albanese government about the future of Australia's first rare earths refinery 
after revealing a building cost blowout is at the top end of what it feared two months ago.
Perth-headquartered Iluka said yesterday the new price tag on the refinery was $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, at the top 
end of the blowout range it warned investors about in December.
Iluka is building the refinery at Eneabba in Western Australia on the back of $1.25 billion in taxpayer funding 
provided through Export Finance Australia.
It appears more taxpayer funds could be tipped into the project depending on the outcome of talks between Iluka 
and the government, which is weighing up relief measures for the collapsing nickel industry and the flagging lithium 
sector.
Like nickel and lithium, the rare earths industry has been hit by weaker pricing. Iluka boss Tom O'Leary called out 
China's capacity to use market dominance in rare earths to dictate premiums and influence the Asian Metal index.
The cost of the Iluka project was originally forecast to be $1 billion to $1.2 billion when the company took a final 
investment decision in April 2022.
Mr O'Leary said a comprehensive update on the company's rare earths division that had been expected at the end 
of March would be delayed pending the outcome of the talks on funding.
"The Australian government is our strategic partner in this development, and has been kept up to date ... we are 
working with the government to come to a pathway to deliver the refinery," he said.
"I think it's fair to say that Eneabba's strategic importance in providing a secure Western supply chain has only 
increased in recent times following China's ban on the export of heavy rare technology in December.
"We've also seen several further offtake and toll trading arrangements and projects which involve downstream 
processing of Australian sourced rare earths in China."

Iluka seeks more funding for rare earths refinery
Mr O'Leary said Iluka remained committed to not selling rare earths concentrate to China or elsewhere while the 
refinery was a work in progress, and all but ruled out selling its 20 per cent stake in Iluka spin-off Deterra Royalties 
that provides exposure to the iron ore sector.
He said the talks with government were broadly about Iluka's need to take a disciplined approach to capital 
allocation with a focus on shareholder returns and the long-term strategic importance to Australia and its allies of 
Eneabba, which is slated to supply light and heavy rare earths essential in electronics, wind turbines and in defence 
technology.
Iluka announced in December that on top of the cost blowout, first production at Eneabba had been pushed back 
from 2025 to 2026.
The company reported full-year net profit after tax of $342.6 million, down from $517.3 million last year. Revenue 
from its mineral sands operation fell from $1.52 billion to $1.24 billion.
Iluka declared a final fully franked dividend of 4¢ a share.

Iluka Resources says building its Australian rare earth refinery is likely to blow out to at least $1.7bn-$1.8bn, at the 
top end of previous estimates, as managing director Tom O'Leary said the company would not necessarily risk its 
own balance sheet to build a strategic asset.
The mineral sands miner slashed its final dividend to 4c a share on Wednesday, a shadow of its 20c-a-share 
payout a year ago, after persistent inflation, subdued demand and higher costs hit the company's core markets.
The group delivered a statutory net profit of $342.6m, down 42 per cent on the previous year. Mineral sands 
revenue was down 19 per cent at $1.24bn with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation down 
32 per cent at $582m.
And Iluka's 4c-a-share final dividend reflects only the pass through of funds received from its 20 per cent holding in 
Deterra Royalties, which holds a production royalty over BHP's Mining Area C and South Flank iron ore operations.
While Iluka's earnings and net profit both beat analyst expectations, the company's market outlook remains 
cautious at a time when it is ramping up capital spending on a new mineral sands operation at Balranald, NSW, and 
on its rare earth refinery near Geraldton in the Mid West of Western Australia.
While the latter is being funded by a $1.25bn federal government lending facility, the cost overhang remains a key 
issue for the company, with Iluka still locked in discussions with the federal govern-ment over funding options for 
the additional cash needed to complete its construction.
Iluka updated the Eneabba refinery's likely cost on Wednesday, saying its ongoing front-end engineering and 
design suggested the refinery was likely to cost $1.7bn-$1.8bn, up from a previous range of $1.5bn-$1.8bn. It was 
supposed to cost $1.2bn when Iluka made a final investment decision in 2022.
The refinery has been billed as a plank in Iluka's long-term growth and diversification strategy, and as a key 
strategic asset from a geopolitical perspective, designed to reduce the reliance of Australia and major allies such as 
the US on rare earth metals produced in China.
Page 2 of 2
Iluka refinery hangs on government talks
Rare earth prices have tumbled in recent months on slowing demand and an increase in Chinese production quotas 
in 2023. China also banned the export of rare earth extraction and separation technologies in December in a move 
seen as an effort to protect its dominance of the refining market.
Mr O'Leary would not comment on the details of discussions between Iluka and the government, but signalled the 
company's reluctance to commit commercial debt to the project if further government loan facilities were not 
extended.
He said offtake deals with Northern Minerals, as well as progress on its own mineral sands and rare earth projects 
in NSW and western Victoria, had added to the longevity of the refinery, which was initially designed to use feed 
from tailings at Iluka's former mineral sands mines at Eneabba.
But he said price incentives were still needed for the construction of non-Chinese refineries, even given project 
growth in demand for rare earth metals.
"On price, we're all aware of Chinese dominance in the market. Again, that's a factor we take into account in 
assessing risk-adjusted returns around making a disciplined capital allocation to the -refinery," he said.
"So as we contemplate funding, both we and government are really cognisant of the risks of the project and also the 
strategic importance of the project - not only from a geopolitical and defence perspective, but also from the 
perspective of its contribution to facilitating global decarbonisation." But Iluka needed to weigh the refinery's 
strategic importance in light of its responsibility to its shareholders, Mr O'Leary said.
"So while government and Iluka's objectives are aligned around the development of the refinery, discipline around 
our capital allocation decisions has got to be maintained." Iluka rose 5.8 per cent to $7.63.

Andrew Forrest won't allow the looming collapse of Australia's nickel hopes to dent his still soaring ambitions for 
Australia's green energy revolution and his continued attacks on coal and gas as "fossil fuel dinosaurs".
That's even though Forrest has announced that his private company, Wyloo Metals, shortly will shut down the 
Western Australian nickel mines it bought for $760 million only last year, as global prices have been crippled in 
recent months by the massive expansion of Indonesia's nickel industry.
But neither the London Metals Exchange nor buyers and manufacturers of electric vehicles are showing much 
interest in Forrest's demands for a distinction to be made between Indonesia's "dirty" nickel and supplies produced 
with higher environmental standards.
The pressure from Forrest and other players, large and small, in Australia's critical minerals industries may be 
harder for the Albanese government to ignore.
Labor's enthusiasm for the potential of green manufacturing in Australia, including electric vehicle batteries and 
components, is rapidly developing into an even sharper contrast given what's happening on the ground in critical 
minerals such as nickel and lithium.
In an address to the National Press Club, Forrest was relatively circumspect about the benefits of production tax 
credits being sought by many miners to help alleviate their current woes.
"I haven't looked at it closely enough," he said.
"It seems to make a lot of sense applying a tax credit on a profit you don't have yet, so it seems a win-win for the 
Australian taxpayer, but I would like to look at it further."
Other nickel and lithium companies are much more insistent in demands for production tax credits to be granted 
urgently, with a delegation of executives in Canberra tomorrow to meet Minister for Resources Madeleine King and 
Treasury officials.
Page 2 of 3
New reality for critical minerals, and Canberra Page Two
King doesn't need persuading of the benefits of such a measure. Treasury - and Treasurer Jim Chalmers - do.
King is just one member of a cabinet with little sympathy for miners.
Nor is the industry united in its views. BHP, for example, certainly got politicians' attention when it announced this 
month it was considering the future of its West Australian nickel interests after a massive $US3.5 billion ($5.3 
billion) write-down of their value given the "structural" change in the industry.
But chief executive Mike Henry is adamant governments should focus more on getting policy fundamentals right in 
areas such as industrial relations and approval processes rather than offering short-term subsidies as a cure.
Without that basis, he warned this month, a production tax credit may not be enough to save BHP's WA's nickel 
business in a world where Australia doesn't have the natural advantages it did in supplying iron ore or coal.
So far, this message is not getting much traction in Canberra.
Instead, the political focus is more on addressing the general community clamour for greater government 
assistance to help with cost-of-living pressures - with the adequacy of the response to be tested by the results of 
the Dunkley byelection in Victoria on Saturday.
That's despite the budget's heavy reliance on the mining industry for any continuing surpluses or to help pay for 
government services.
That trade-off has been increasingly obscured by continued high prices for commodities such as iron ore.
But Australia's hopes of extending this bonanza into the supply of critical minerals to belatedly counter China's 
dominance and price manipulation is in the midst of a reality check.
The impact of dramatically reduced prices is not just obvious in the sudden closure or scaling back of nickel and 
lithium prospects.
Iluka Resources' plans to build Australia's first rare earths refinery are now in difficulties following a big increase in 
costs as well as the weaker prices for rare earths.
It's part of the long-running debate about whether Australia should continue to rely on exporting the raw materials it 
mines, especially to China, and to what extent the government should provide incentives to develop downstream 
alternatives.
In its dying days, the Morrison government provided a $1.25 billion loan to Iluka to build a refinery to separate rare 
earth oxides from its tailings at Eneabba and to process concentrate from other miners. The timetable for the start 
of operations has now been delayed a year to 2026, while Iluka is quietly asking for more assistance from its 
"strategic partner" in Canberra.
Chief executive Tom O'Leary will say only that the company is "working with the government to come to a pathway 
to deliver the refinery".
"I think it's fair to say that Eneabba's strategic importance in providing a secure Western supply chain has only 
increased in recent times following China's ban on the export of heavy rare earths technology in December," he 
said at Iluka's results this month.
"As we contemplate funding, both we and the government are really cognisant of the risks of the project and also its 
strategic importance, not only from a geopolitical and defence perspective but also from the perspective of its 
contribution to facilitating global decarbonisation."
Yet some other industry analysts suggest the refinery can never be commercially viable and the Australian 
government instead should be smoothing licensing and regulatory approvals and improving common infrastructure 
rather than giving subsidies to individual companies.Page 3 of 3
New reality for critical minerals, and Canberra Page Two
"We should dig up rare earths if we can do so profitably," one says.
"But it is the major advanced industrial economies of the US, Europe and Japan that are most at risk of unfair 
Chinese processing competition. They are the ones that should subsidise processing if their companies will not 
build it commercially."
That's unlikely to be the sort of logic that appeals to most of the would-be players in the critical minerals industry, 
including Andrew Forrest - or to the Albanese government.
Decisions ... or more reviews?

Venture Minerals Limited (ASX:VMS, OTC:VTMLF) has initiated the second stage of its resource definition drilling 
program at the Jupiter Rare Earths prospect, positioned in Western Australia's Mid-West region.
The aim of the ambitious 300-drillhole campaign is to achieve a drill density of 500 metres by 250 metres across the 
40-square-kilometre target area, essential for the forthcoming maiden resource estimate at Jupiter.
The aircore drilling program is slated for a six to eight-week completion window, subject to drilling conditions.
Venture Minerals is set to submit multiple sample batches throughout this period, with expectations high for the 
imminent assay results from the final 30 holes of the initial stage program, alongside ongoing mineralogical and 
metallurgical studies.
High-grade REE prospect 
Jupiter has already yielded promising highlights, including a record Australian clay-hosted intersection of 48 metres 
at 3,025 parts per million (ppm) total rare earth oxides (TREO), with consistent high-grade zones and notable 
results up to 13,906 ppm and 20,538 ppm TREO.
The discovery included one intersection containing 5,056 ppm of NdPr oxides, which contain significant 
concentrations of neodymium, praseodymium and other magnet rare earth oxides (MREO), with an MREO average 
of 23% in intersections over 1,000 ppm TREO.
Page 2 of 2

These findings not only underscore the high-grade nature of the Jupiter prospect but also confirm the geological 
anomaly defining the extensive target area.
Venture's strategic positioning near crucial infrastructure and proximity to significant developments like Iluka 
Resources Limited's Eneabba Rare Earths Refinery and Lynas Rare Earths' Mount Weld Concentrator, 
underscores the project's potential synergies with Australia's Critical Minerals Strategy and broader industrial 
objectives.
Accelerating towards maiden resource
Venture managing director Andrew Radonjic said: "With the recent record drill results delivered by the first two 
batches of assays from the stage one resource definition drill program at Jupiter, the company has committed to an 
extensive 300 drillhole stage two program to accelerate towards delivering the much-anticipated maiden resource.
"The highlights to date clearly demonstrate that Jupiter is emerging as a major, rare earths discovery in the tier one 
jurisdiction of Western Australia, located between Lynas's existing plant and Iluka's planned rare earth processing 
facilities.
"Shareholders should expect plenty of news flow in the following weeks with assays from the final batch of the 
stage one program due shortly and assays from the several batches of samples that will be submitted over the 
course of this current drill program."

Consulting firm PwC remains a pariah as the fallout from the tax leak scandal continues to bite, writes Colin Kruger.
'I'm extremely proud of the contribution every individual at PwC Australia makes to this firm and their ongoing 
commitment to producing exceptional results for our clients."
This was the brave part of the statement PwC boss Kevin Burrowes made on Wednesday as he announced 
another 366 employees and partners would be cut at the embattled firm to right-size the shrinking business.
This was on top of the 340 staff sacked in November due to the tax scandal, and economic conditions. As well as 
the 1300 staff that left when PwC was forced to spin off its lucrative government business for just $1 after it was 
banned from any further government work.
The firm's website still boasts of a workforce of 8000 employees, but those stats are from a year ago when the 
news surfaced that several PwC partners had allegedly used confidential government tax information to woo some 
of the biggest companies in the world as clients.
The outlook appears grim and not just for the tax business, which was the source of PwC's woes. There are clear 
signs that the audit and assurance business - the original core business of the big four firms and the unit that PwC 
is counting on to lift it out of the mire - is also suffering.
Westpac's dramatic dumping of PwC last week in favour of KPMG was a big blow, with the bank's business worth 
$70 million over the last two years alone. But that is not the only signal of the corporate sector's disaffection with the 
firm.
On March 1, PwC's 19-year run as the auditor of $3 billion Super Retail Group - the company behind retail names 
such as Rebel Sport, Supercheap Auto and BCF - came to an end.
Mineral sands group Iluka Resources will end its 33-year relationship with PwC in May.

"Following completion of a tender process, and given PwC's tenure, the board of Iluka considered it appropriate to 
replace PwC with KPMG as Iluka's external auditor," it said.
Finance group Harmoney Corp and ed-tech group Keypath dropped PwC in December and January, respectively.
Developer Lendlease is still keeping quiet on its audit plans. PwC was meant to replace KPMG last year on audit 
work.
Macquarie Group is also keeping silent on its plans after flagging a review of its audit services last year to see if it 
should end its 30-year relationship with PwC. Macquarie paid PwC more than $79 million in fees last year.
The irony is that the assurance business, which includes audit, was highlighted as one of the few positives in last 
year's Switkowski review, which was triggered by the tax scandal and ordered by interim PwC boss Kristin 
Stubbins.
"Some parts of PwC Australia - notably the Assurance business - appear substantially to model best practice. The 
firm should ... look to these strengths as it rebuilds," the report said.
But that is easier said than done. The whole point of hiring a big four audit firm such as PwC is to attach your 
financial results to a brand whose reputation is beyond question.
PwC's reputation is far from that, and it will suffer further this year at the hands of the incredibly influential Canberra 
politicians who helped bring the malfeasance by those partners to light.
The level of political fury in Canberra has not abated due to the firm's patchy record at coming clean on the tax 
scandal.
The latest flashpoint is PwC Australia's insistence that it has no access to the report by law firm Linklaters, which 
had been commissioned by PwC's international office to independently investigate the involvement of global 
partners in the tax leak.
Only a one-page summary of this report has been released publicly. It says while six international partners should 
have raised questions about the confidential information that was shared with them, the report found no evidence 
that any PwC personnel outside Australia used the information from PwC Australia for commercial gain.
Burrowes, who was parachuted in as CEO of PwC Australia by the global group, told a Senate hearing last month 
that the group had declined to give him access to the full report.
"So you're going to accept, from PwC International, a failure to respond to your request, as the CEO of what's 
described as a systemically significant player in the Australian economy, and we're supposed to put up with that, as 
a nation? That seems to be a completely untenable position," Labor senator Deborah O'Neill told the hearing.
Greens senator Barbara Pocock described it as a "running sore of dishonesty".
The bigger issue, as O'Neill puts it, is that the statement by PwC International on the Linklaters report "is certainly at 
odds with evidence we've received in the Australian parliament from the Tax Practitioners Board [TPB] in recent 
weeks, where it's not only six people who have been identified, but more than that."
The Tax Practitioners Board, which brought the scandal to light when it banned former PwC partner Peter Collins, 
said it had nine current investigations stemming from the tax scandal.
The Australian Federal Police announced in May 2023 it was also pursuing a criminal investigation of the tax leak 
scandal.
But the next bombshell for PwC is likely to be the final report by the Senate inquiry into the integrity of consulting 
services. The report, which is due this month, is expected to be postponed until May.Page 3 of 3

As inquiry chairman, Liberal senator Richard Colbeck, indicated with a comment at the most recent hearing that it 
will not be pleasant for PwC: "I really do want to inflict some pain on PwC in relation to this Linklater's report."

The recent collapse in prices for key critical minerals is accelerating attempts by Western governments to use 
cheap loans, grants and tax breaks to break China's stranglehold on the processing of rare earths.
Success is far from guaranteed. But taxpayer funds are now the common ingredient to boost the processing of rare 
earths into the metals and magnets vital for everything from mobile phones to wind turbines to advanced defence 
technology.
The Australian government's announcement of $840 million worth of cheap funding and grants to progress 
Arafura's proposed rare earths mine and refinery in the Northern Territory is part of this global battle.
It follows the Morrison government giving Iluka Resources a $1.25 billion loan to build a refinery in Western 
Australia to separate rare earth oxides.
While Canberra has nothing like the financial firepower of the US, it is under growing pressure to also subsidise 
intermediate processing as well as mining of rare earths.
This new push inevitably brings up old questions about backing particular companies with taxpayer money - given 
they may still not be financially viable anyway. It's no surprise that first production at Iluka's refinery is delayed a 
year until 2026 while estimated building costs have increased by several hundred million dollars.
What is not disputed is the urgent need for a strategic counter to China's control - developed over decades - of 
processing technology and skills required to create the crucial metals and magnets essential for modern living and 
national security.
Just how much governments will pay and how feasible these alternative supply chains in all critical minerals 
remains a gamble. Final investment decisions are still a way off in most cases, even before protracted delays in 
building.
The 17 rare earth elements in the periodic table are a subset of the general category of critical minerals and found 
in minute quantities of much larger clay or hard rock mineral deposits. Their grade - typically measured in parts per 
Page 2 of 3
Reality test for big bet on rare earths; Page Two
million in clay or a small percentage in rock - is just one aspect of the challenge. Rare earth elements are neither 
rare nor that valuable in themselves, particularly at current prices.
But panicked Western governments belatedly realised their vulnerability to Beijing's ability to withdraw supply of the 
vital metals and magnets that result from processing them.
Complacency - compounded by the lure of China's cheap prices - meant other countries had not even tried to 
master complex chemistry processes and technology needed to turn concentrates into essential ingredients for 
modern living and defence needs.
Australia is a player not only because of its abundance of resources but also because its close relationship with the 
US means Australian projects or their American customers may be eligible for US government support.
That can include access to generous subsidies under the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. US 
determination to compete with China and to derisk supply chains ensures some financial support will continue no 
matter who is president.
This explains why the US Export Import Bank, for example, has just provided non-binding pledges of loans to two 
small Australian rare earths companies, Australian Strategic Minerals and Meteoric Resources, to help them 
develop mines in NSW and Brazil respectively. Lynas, which has Australia's only operating rare earths mine, has a 
$US258 million ($395 million) grant from the US Department of Defence to build a refinery in Texas.
Angus Barker, chairman of Australian Rare Earths and former ministerial adviser and investment banker, says rare 
earths are at the intersection of two mega-trends globally - decarbonisation and geopolitics. "That's why 
governments are so interested and why they are throwing money at them," he says. "They want secure, reliable 
alternatives."
But the experience of Australian Rare Earths (AR3), which plans eventually to develop a clay-based project on the 
South Australian border, is typical of challenges facing Australian hopefuls.
As prices and recognition of critical minerals surged a few years ago, a host of speculative Australian investors and 
companies, including AR3, bet on rare earths as part of a new resources boom.
Depending on grade, the collapse in prices means it makes no commercial sense for most of these proposed mines 
to even consider developing their hard rock or clay deposits right now - perhaps indefinitely.
That's apart from the costs and complexity of developing domestic downstream processing beyond producing basic 
concentrate.
But although less than expected global demand, increased supply and China's manipulation of prices are curbing 
rare earths developments - along with lithium and nickel - entrepreneurial enthusiasm about the potential remains.
"In a tough environment, you focus on areas you can control - like opportunities in higher grade elements to find a 
path forward," says Barker.
Some Australian-owned projects are not even in Australia. Meteoric Resources is not the only Australian company 
with a project in Brazil.
In the US, American Rare Earths is listed on the ASX but focused on its attempt to develop a rare earths mine in 
the mining-friendly state of Wyoming. After releasing its scoping study this month, its managing director, Donald 
Swartz, is in Australia to talk to investors about the benefits of its particular allanite minerals geology in Wyoming 
enabling the company to apply simpler, cheaper conventional technology to develop its resource.
As well as the ability to access US tax credits, US agencies are also helping finance a joint venture research effort 
into more efficient processing technologies. Swartz maintains there's more understanding of rare earths among 
Australian investors than in his home country.Page 3 of 3

Yet despite Australia's reputation for efficient mining, it has far less experience in the advanced, complex and 
extremely expensive processing of even intermediate material. It will be a reality test of Australia's ambitions.

The federal government should back regional minerals processing hubs, streamline project approvals and try to 
attract the world's biggest battery makers to boost advanced manufacturing, industry experts say.
The comments come after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese last week promised greater government intervention to 
help rebuild Australia's faltering manufacturing centre, promising to bring together more than $20bn worth of 
existing programs promised by Labor before the last election under a single "Future Made in Australia" banner, 
backed by legislation. Mr Albanese did not single out battery manufacturing, or allied industries such as the high-
intensity magnets needed for wind turbines, but federal Resources Minister Madeleine King identified both sectors 
as key targets for support in the upcoming federal budget, as the government looks to support critical minerals 
mining to move further downstream. "We want that part of the Future Made in Australia because we have those 
natural resources and we really need to capitalise on it," she said.
The best means to make that happen has been the source of significant debate in both the mining and 
manufacturing industry, but industry experts say the government should invest in the broader infrastructure needed 
to create production hubs around the industry. That includes streamlining approvals processes to make sure 
investment can be deployed quickly, but also ensuring competitive power and water prices, as well as investing in 
basic research to help industry catch up with the massive investments made by China in the complex chemistry 
needed to build batteries and process difficult ores.
Future Battery Industries Cooperative Research Centre (FBICRC) chairman Tim Shanahan said the government 
package needed to level the investment playing field to try to attract "lighthouse companies" to set up 
manufacturing plants in Australia.
The FBICRC has been a champion for funds to back the basic science to grow Australia's knowledge base, but Mr 
Shanahan said the government also needed to target major manufacturing companies - such as battery makers 
such as Tesla and Panasonic - that had already developed their own expertise. "We can develop some of this 
technology ourselves. We need to attract leading international companies with the right business conditions to 
secure their investment and we need to help these businesses succeed by building a competitive ecosystem 
around them," he said. "Australia can be competitive in manufacturing, but we need to develop a competitive and

Call for regional mineral hub support
integrated manu-facturing ecosystem." Melbourne-based engineering firm GHD has been designing and building 
processing plants for Australian mining companies for decades, and will be presenting its vision for production hubs 
at the Battery Minerals Conference in Perth on Monday.
GHD Australian Energy and Resources leader Paul Greaney told The Australian that, despite Australia's mining 
expertise, government support was needed in the face of subsidies on offer overseas. Mr Greaney said a key area 
of support should be helping Australian companies take advantage of our mineral wealth by putting the basic 
infrastructure to help industrial development take place near where the minerals are produced, rather than in capital 
cities.
"I think the biggest bang for investment by government is in the infrastructure that will be common to particular 
hubs, that will become centres for development of particular products," he said.
Building processing centres near major mining hubs in the Pilbara or other regional centres would eliminate the cost 
of transporting ore or concentrate over long distances, he said, making Australian manufacturing more competitive.
But to work, that would mean the government would need to support the provision of power and water to isolated 
sites, as well as speeding up approvals processes, he said. "But this incentive is really a great step in the right 
direction, to give the confidence to a lot of investors that Australia is somewhere that is a lot more attractive than it 
was the day before this announcement." Iluka Resources chief executive Tom O'Leary has been outspoken on the 
need for Australia to use the booming demand for critical minerals to build an onshore mining and processing 
industry, and the company is a beneficiary of a $1bn government-backed loan for its Australian-first rare earth 
processing plant in WA. The Iluka boss welcomed the federal government's announcement on Friday, and said 
state governments needed to get on board with a new federally-led manufacturing policy.

  Mineral sands and rare earths company Iluka Resources has issued a stern warning as China seeks to 
"weaponise" the supply of vital materials and discourage Australian progress.
   "Rare earths are among the very few metals where China has demonstrated a preparedness to weaponise its 
control, chief executive Tom O'Leary told the annual general meeting in Perth on Tuesday.
   China's dominance was achieved through production supremacy as well as influence over pricing, he said.
   "It's this monopolistic production combined with interference in pricing that's resulting in market failure," he 
warned.
   Iluka is planning Australia?s first fully integrated refinery for the production of separated rare earth oxides at 
Eneabba in Western Australia, supported by a $1.25 billion federal loan, but shareholders are concerned about a 
cost blowout.
   The company disclosed in February that the plant's price tag had increased to $1.7-$1.8 billion from around $1.5 
billion.
   Mr O'Leary said although there was a "significant increase in the capital" required to build the refinery, the energy 
transition and need for sovereign capabilities to counter interference were megatrends shaping the global economy.
   "The need to act with urgency particularly in relation to heavy rare earths is self-evident," he said.
   "For our part, we have taken steps to catalyse an Australian rare earths industry that is truly independent."
   Mr O'Leary said Iluka was in discussions with the federal government on the company's capital structure but 
would not be drawn on arrangements or likely terms.
   But it was "extremely unlikely that the commonwealth would countenance advancing all of the funds necessary to 
meet the additional capital requirement", he said.
   Meanwhile United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea and some European countries were "aiming squarely" at 
retaining onshore some of the economic opportunities of the energy transition, he said.
   "In addition to being essential for the production of electric vehicles and wind turbines, the key heavy rare earths 
dysprosium and terbium have critical applications in defence and national security," Mr O'Leary explained.

   "And there are clear ongoing efforts, including by China's state-owned entities to extend their nation's monopoly 
by controlling Australia's rare earths deposits from Western Australia to western Victoria," he said.
   Binding offtake agreements for raw materials and stakes in Australian producers were among the tactics used to 
discourage local development of refineries, he said.
   China in December banned the export of heavy rare earths extraction and separation technologies, to further 
tighten control.

Iluka Resources managing director Tom O'Leary has accused China of rigging rare earths prices so producers 
cannot make money, as it tries to advance its grip on mineral deposits.
Mr O'Leary said there were clear efforts by Chinese state-owned entities to control rare earths production, including 
in Western Australia and Victoria. "This is taking place via a number of binding offtake agreements with various 
companies, and via ownership, as in the well documented case of Northern Minerals," he said.
Northern Minerals sought a foreign investment probe of its own shareholder, Chinese businessman Wu Tao.
Mr O'Leary said the entire industry was unprofitable as China manipulated prices to further its stranglehold on the 
supply of minerals essential in defence, electronics and the transition away from fossil fuels. "No participant, 
regardless of geography, is making any money at today's prices," he said.
ASX-listed Lynas has previously claimed it was the only profitable producer outside China.
Iluka is further convinced pricing provided by Asian Metal indices, which are relied on by producers, is rigged. 
"Linking prices to the Asian Metals index only further entrenches China's market power," he said yesterday.
Mr O'Leary's attack comes amid uncertainty over the future of a part-built rare earths refinery in WA and a protest 
lodged by the Albanese government over an incident at the weekend involving an Australian navy helicopter and 
Chinese fighter jet.
Iluka is locked in talks with Labor about more taxpayer support to finish building Australia's first rare earths refinery 
after a cost blowout taking its price tag up to $1.8 billion. It is building the refinery at Eneabba with $1.25 billion in 
taxpayer-funded finance.
The company has acknowledged the government is "extremely unlikely" to advance all of the money needed.
The government has made a two-way bet on rare earths by allocating more than $800 million in loans and grants to 
the Gina Rinehart-backed Arafura Resources and its Nolans project in the Northern Territory.
Page 2 of 2
Iluka boss calls out China over rare earths prices
Iluka said it was under pressure from some shareholders to monetise a stockpile of rare earths material left behind 
by its mineral sands mining by selling it to China.
Selling the stockpile, valued at more than $1 billion and put up as security in return for the current taxpayer backing, 
would involve unwinding the entire refinery deal between Iluka and the government. A compromise appears likely, 
with Mr O'Leary and Iluka chairman Rob Cole telling shareholders at the annual general meeting in Perth yesterday 
they remained confident in the long-term value of diversifying into rare earths.
Iluka has no plans to sell its 20 per cent stake in $2.5 billion spin-off Deterra Royalties to help meet the funding 
shortfall on Eneabba.
Mr O'Leary said China's influence over rare earths went beyond its reach in other critical minerals such as lithium, 
or even titanium and zircon, which Iluka mines too.

Iluka Resources CEO Tom O'Leary has warned that China is weaponising its domination of the rare earths 
market, driving down prices to keep alternative sources out of the market while buying up access to deposits in 
Australia.
Speaking at Iluka's annual shareholder meeting in Perth on Tuesday, Mr O'Leary said Chinese state-owned entities 
had a "pervasive" influence on pricing for rare earth metals, and were prepared to wear a loss to keep other 
producers out of global markets.
"China's dominance of the rare earths industry, which in the case of heavy rare earths is near total, is achieved 
through production supremacy and its influence over pricing," Mr O'Leary told shareholders.
Iluka is building its own rare earths refinery at its former Eneabba mineral sands mine in the Mid West of WA, but is 
still in -negotiations with the federal government over an extension to its $1.25bn lending facility from the 
government's Critical Minerals Facility, needed to cover a construction blowout that will take the plant's cost to as 
much as $1.8bn.
Mr O'Leary pointed to the Chinese government's decision in December to ban the export of knowledge and 
technology related to the complex chemistry needed to turn rare earth deposits into metals, saying the move was a 
clear indication of China's intent to maintain its industry dominance both for commercial and defence purposes.
"In addition to being essential for the production of electric vehicles and wind turbines, the key heavy rare earths 
dysprosium and terbium have critical applications in defence and national security," he said.
Mr O'Leary has previously backed calls for a domestic reservation of Australian-mined critical minerals, and on 
Tuesday said Australia and its allies needed to support a price structure for metals separate from Chinese sources 
of supply.
"China's influence over the global rare earths market is pervasive, including through pricing indices such as the 
Asian Metals Index," he said.
Page 2 of 2
Iluka slams rare earths 'weaponisation'
He said rare earths differed from emerging markets for other metals needed for electrification of the transport 
industry and energy networks - such as lithium, copper and nickel - because China also dominated production of 
rare earths, particularly heavy rare earths.
"It is this monopolistic production, combined with interference in pricing, that is resulting in market failure; and rare 
earths are among very few metals where China has demonstrated a preparedness to weaponise its control," he 
said.
"Our CFO, Adele Stratton, will present at an investor conference in the coming days and will demonstrate through 
publicly available information that no participant, regardless of geography, is making any money at today's prices." 
The alternative to support for the establishment of new supply chains outside of China, Mr O'Leary said, was for 
Western governments to also accept the looming Chinese domination of electric-vehicle production, weaken 
defence industries that rely on rare earth elements, and put the decarbonisation of energy and transport networks in 
Chinese hands. "Will they acquiesce to their flagship carmakers merely managing the assembly of electric-vehicle 
parts supplied by Chinese companies, if indeed China is willing to permit such activities taking place at all?" he 
said.
Mr O'Leary said the company welcomed new foreign investment rules floated by Jim Chalmers this month, as well 
as the Albanese government's support for local manufacturing.
But he said more must be done to limit China's influence over Australian critical minerals deposits.
"There are clear, ongoing -efforts, including by Chinese state-owned entities, to extend their nation's monopoly by 
controlling Australia's rare earth deposits," he said.
"From Western Australia to western Victoria, this is taking place via a number of binding offtake agreements with 
various companies; and via ownership." Iluka shares rose 40c to $7.99.

Anthony Albanese says no state will benefit more than Western Australia from his government's decision to fund 
comprehensive mapping of the nation's sub-surface and seabed resources.
It's part of the prime minister's efforts to ensure the West feels included in Labor's Future Made in Australia policy, 
where funding so far has been directed towards manufacturing rather than mining projects.
The government wants to get credit for its efforts to promote downstream processing of Australia's critical minerals - 
of particular significance in such a resource rich state.
"So much of our future prosperity depends on finding more critical minerals, extracting more critical minerals - and 
doing more with critical minerals before we export them," Albanese said in Perth yesterday.
Encouraging the opportunities that flow from co-location of extraction and production would be a priority for 
Tuesday's federal budget.
"Providing the investment incentives and the regulatory framework to support more downstream processing, on our 
shores," he said.
"Taking raw materials to the nearest regional centre for value-adding, rather than shipping them to the other side of 
the world."
But the collapse in prices for nickel, lithium and rare earths has dented last year's optimism about WA hosting a 
new boom in critical minerals and further minerals processing - key ingredients in the green transition.
The mining industry has politely welcomed the government's investment in further mapping, led by Geoscience 
Australia, to help identify opportunities for mineral deposit development or for carbon capture and storage projects, 
particularly in under-explored and remote areas.
The catch is that the $560 million to be spent over a decade can be no more than a modest and drawn-out 
foundation for an increasingly obvious and urgent gap in the critical minerals industry.

PM's troubled dream of critical minerals Page Two
Iron ore remains the massively profitable powerhouse that underpins the West Australian economy - and Jim 
Chalmers' federal budget.
But rather than the mining land rush under way this time last year, many lithium, nickel and rare earth mines are 
now being closed, further development is on indefinite hold, and plans for processing are being scaled back or 
cancelled because projects can't be competitive at current prices.
It is not just smaller players contemplating a messy and expensive end to ambitions that rested on the promise that 
all these critical minerals would be needed by a decarbonising world.
In February, BHP wrote off the value of its nickel assets by $5.4 billion pre-tax. It is considering mothballing its 
entire WA nickel division after the global market responded to a new abundance of much cheaper, but still high-
quality, Indonesian nickel. So much for the proposed $1 billion upgrade of BHP's Kalgoorlie nickel smelter that had 
been anticipated this year.
CEO Mike Henry suggests the advent of Indonesian nickel is likely to be a structural rather than a cyclical change in 
the market. He obviously has more immediate interest in chasing Anglo American's copper assets in South 
America, and maintains Australia needs to get more of the basics right in areas like infrastructure, power supply, 
approvals and industrial relations.
Still, many struggling lithium and nickel producers have pressed Chalmers and Treasury for incentives, such as 
production tax credits. Some form of tax investment allowance is expected in next week's budget to add to the 
royalty relief recently provided to nickel miners by the WA government.
But whether this will be enough to sustain a competitive large-scale critical minerals industry over the rest of this 
decade looks far less certain than the government's rhetoric suggests.
Despite all the talk from the Biden administration about creating reliable alternatives to China's dominance, 
particularly in rare earths, there's been a dearth of investment in Australian mines or downstream processing efforts 
from either the US or Europe.
Chalmers' announcement that approvals for foreign investment from trusted sources will be accelerated will remove 
some of the roadblocks, but it won't necessarily make the dollars add up for foreign investors any time soon.
The Australian government has attempted to fill some of the vacuum via cheap loans and grants to individual 
companies via its critical minerals fund, and other facilities. But this is inadequate to sustain attempts to 
substantially grow the industry.
Recent low prices, combined with Australia's high costs, make it harder to see how we can be competitive, 
particularly in further processing of minerals to the extent envisaged by Canberra's talk of electric vehicle batteries.
The generous taxpayer subsidies available under the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act, for example, 
have so far been devoted mainly to projects operating within the confines of the US.
In contrast, China's money, as well as its technical expertise, has made its companies valued local partners, as well 
as much-needed customers underpinning the development of many WA projects.
Some of those wanting to move more into rare earths processing still argue that China is deliberately suppressing 
prices and controlling production to deter challenges to its stranglehold on the sector.
Iluka Resources managing director Tom O'Leary this week expressed his frustration about the difficulties in 
finishing the company's rare earths refinery at Eneabba in WA, for example. Despite $1.25 billion of cheap loans 
provided by the Morrison government in its dying days, a subsequent cost blowout in construction means Iluka 
needs more funds just when the market is contracting.Page 3 of 3

"No participant, regardless of geography, is making money at today's prices," he told the annual general meeting. 
"China's dominance of the rare earths industry, which in the case of heavy rare earths is near total, is achieved 
through production supremacy and its influence over pricing."
Challenging that equation will take a lot more than decent mapping.

Peter Dutton's claims to be getting Australia "back on track" risk him getting seriously off track politically when he 
next visits Western Australia.
The state is an increasingly attractive target for Coalition hopes of regaining some of the seats they lost in the 2022 
wipeout in the west. Despite the even worse electoral calamity of a state Liberal Party reduced to a ludicrous two 
seats at the last state election, many voters in a traditionally conservative stronghold have grown disenchanted with 
Labor.
But Dutton's rejection of the Albanese government's budget spending to boost critical minerals processing and jibes 
of "billions for billionaires" will not be popular in a state that has done so well from resources development.
Ambitious rhetoric about a new resources boom leveraging critical minerals and hydrogen in a decarbonising world 
reached fever peak in the state about a year ago - coinciding with The Australian Financial Review Mining Summit 
in Perth.
Anthony Albanese's obsession with creating "green" manufacturing jobs neatly fitted WA's enthusiasm about further 
refining and processing critical minerals rather than just exporting its raw materials to China.
Mining billionaires like Andrew Forrest, Gina Rinehart and Chris Ellison were competing with the establishment 
companies such as BHP and Rio Tinto to expand their interests in lithium and/or nickel. The WA Treasury was 
happily counting almost $1 billion in royalties it had collected from the lithium industry that year, way behind the $9 
billion worth from iron ore but rising fast.
Then-deputy premier and now Premier Roger Cook told the Summit his daily commute from south of Perth was like 
a multibillion-dollar glimpse into the future of decarbonisation, citing lithium hydroxide plants and nickel sulphate 
refineries in the industrial park of Kwinana.
But the rapid rise and then recent fall of prices for critical minerals like nickel and lithium, along with rare earths, 
demonstrates the volatility of this nascent market. It also shows the modest contribution to the state's economy so 
Page 2 of 3
Why WA loves the minerals tax boost Page Two
far of a scattering of relatively small-scale critical minerals projects compared with the massive staples of iron ore 
and LNG.
It means the mood at tomorrow's Financial Review Mining Summit in Perth will be very different, following company 
after company announcing plans to scale back, close or not proceed with various mining and processing projects.
Yet, Western Australia has always prided itself on its entrepreneurial, frontier spirit, particularly in the resources 
industry. So the promise of billions of dollars worth of production tax credits for processing of critical minerals and 
green hydrogen will offer fresh hope that WA can get back on track towards its newest resources dream.
The WA Liberals certainly see it that way, rejecting the negative views of their federal colleagues. The tax credits 
will only be paid for costs incurred in producing value-added materials and metals, and are designed to reward 
results rather than ideas that are never executed.
It's why the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies (AMEC) has been pushing hard numbers, insisting 
this model will help kick-start the industry but with no risk to the government if particular projects don't proceed.
This version does seem a financially safer model than providing direct subsidies to individual companies given the 
obvious risks in a government "picking winners". That general guidelines for the Future Made in Australia 
investments are so broad - and new government "off-budget" special funds now so numerous - guarantee some 
costly failures. Nor does Treasury favour Albanese's vision of Australia making electric vehicle batteries.
Dutton uses a commercial rationale to resist spending taxpayers' money on projects he insists must be able to 
support themselves to survive beyond a future made in Canberra. And he is right that production tax credits are less 
important than getting the fundamentals right by reducing other costs including delayed approvals, excessive 
regulations, inflexible industrial relations and lack of common, crucial infrastructure. But there's little sign of this 
happening - rather the reverse.
Nor will the tax credits even begin until 2027, meaning there will be little immediate assistance to financially 
struggling projects.
BHP has already given itself a timetable of August to decide whether to shut its nickel smelter in Kalgoorlie with the 
loss of 3000 jobs.
Chief executive Mike Henry's belief that the collapse in the global price of nickel due to a flood of supply from 
Indonesia is a structural change rather than a cyclical one also means there's no chance currently of reviving the 
plan to invest in the necessary upgrade of a smelter that looks every bit of its 50-plus years.
Any shift in the commercial logic of closure will be the subject of further consultations with the federal government - 
and no doubt potential further subsidies. There's still an obvious economic and political logic to attempts to diversify 
critical minerals processing, especially rare earths, away from China's control.
The Morrison government provided $1.25 billion in cheap loans to Iluka Resources to build a rare earths refinery in 
WA, for instance. Since then, other governments, particularly the Biden administration in the US, have begun 
providing gargantuan incentives to counter Chinese dominance, bolstering the government's case that Australia 
must play this game to remain competitive.
Even so, Iluka's construction costs have blown out, forcing the company to search for more funding. As well as 
some other small grants, the Albanese government is betting $840 million worth of grants and loans to help Arafura 
Rare Earths develop its mine and refinery in the Northern Territory.
That makes them examples of the potential pitfalls and the promise of the 2020s version of industrial policy.
Gambling on the future of value-adding to the Australian mining industry still makes much more sense than the 
Albanese government investing $1 billion into solar panel manufacturing.Page 3 of 3

West Australians certainly understand that. Peter Dutton beware.

They're a parochial mob over here in Western Australia, and with iron ore prices booming, new tax production tax 
credits announced in the federal budget, and GST revenue flowing from the east, there was a buoyant mood on the 
floor of the Mining Summit.
"I can confirm that we have no active plans to secede," a beaming Premier Roger Cook quipped.
But Cook, whose ascent to the Labor leadership came just weeks after last year's Summit, did acknowledge that it 
hadn't been all smooth sailing over the past 12 months. The downturn in prices for several minerals - primarily 
nickel, lithium and rare earths - had put intense pressure on an industry that his government hopes will drive WA's 
next era of prosperity.
He remains pragmatic. Just as the iron ore sector took decades to come into its pomp, so too would the critical 
minerals sector face a bumpy ride before establishing itself. "This stuff takes grit, determination and a certain 
amount of risk," Cook says.
The iron ore sector was ultimately transformed by China's economic super-cycle, and the Summit made it clear that 
the fate of the critical minerals industry would also rest with China. But this time, China looms as both saviour and 
enemy.
As Warren Pearce, CEO of the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, told the Summit, "a large portion 
of West Australian mining projects have been turned on with the support of Chinese dollars and Chinese 
investment" over the past two decades, with Chinese companies often acting as both financiers and major 
companies via offtake agreements.
But as an increasingly hawkish US government seeks to build its own supply chains for reasons of national and 
economic security, pressure is mounting on Australian miners to turn away from Chinese capital.
Page 2 of 3
Big China question hangs over critical minerals sector
"That concerns us," Pearce says. "That investment isn't necessarily coming from other countries, particularly the 
US, and so if we're turning away that investment, we've got to find that capital somewhere else. That makes it more 
challenging for us to get projects up and ... to reap the benefits of those projects."
Peter Coleman, the former chief executive of Woodside who is now chairman of the world's third-biggest lithium 
producer, Arcadium Lithium, is even more blunt given China's status as the world's centre of critical minerals 
refining and manufacturing.
"I just can't see a future where you don't co-invest together," he says.
The production tax credits announced by federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers last week will provide a test of this split 
between China and the West. Many of the WA-based miners that will be eligible for the tax production credits have 
Chinese ownership. Will local companies with Chinese shareholders be barred from the tax production credits 
completely? Or will there be some limit - say a maximum Chinese ownership share of 25 per cent, which would be 
in line with US restrictions?
Resources Minister Madeleine King would not be drawn into this yesterday, saying the government is still 
designing the credit regime, but foreign ownership issues are under consideration.
AMEC will clearly push back hard on anything that hurts miners with Chinese backers. And Cook is diplomatic; 
Australia and WA must understand the opportunities that the trade partnership with China has created, but also 
must not allow itself to become "overly exposed to a single industry or a single commodity or to a single market or 
single customer".
That's a sensible position to take, but the realities of the critical minerals sector will make this balancing act difficult. 
As Pearce says, Chinese investment tends to move faster than that of Japan, South Korea and the US, and speed 
matters in industries such as critical minerals, where volatility is almost guaranteed.
Of course, as Iluka Resources chief executive Tom O'Leary told the Summit, China can be responsible for a lot of 
that volatility, particularly when it comes to rare earths.
He again accused China of effectively manipulating the price of rare earths via the Asian Metals Index.
He says China has used its dominant position across the supply chain to increase production capacity to drive 
prices on the index down to a point where, he claims, every producer in the sector (both inside and outside China) 
is unprofitable. In Iluka's demand, this is being done to protect the longevity of China's domestic rare earths sector.
O'Leary wants the industry to stop linking bilateral contracts to the Asian Metals Index, which he says does not 
reflect the true value of rare earths.
But Brett Beatty, a private equity investor and Australian managing director of Resource Capital Funds, says 
China's ability to shift markets to its advantage is nothing new, and it is something that his fund thinks hard about 
when it invests. "They have spent the last 20 to 30 years building this strategic monopoly in many of these 
commodities," he says.
Australia and other nations should look for ways to reduce China's control of critical minerals markets by 
diversifying supply. But beware: this will not be easy, or fast.
"The reality is, we'll spend the next 15 or 20 years trying to unwind that and our movement of capital is slower, so 
you can only imagine what China's going to do over the next 15 years to protect that position," Beatty says.

Most Australians have never heard of Northern Minerals. But the ownership of its rare earths project in north-
western Australia is evidence of the pushback against further entrenching China's control of the rare earths 
processing considered crucial to the global energy transition and to national security.
Treasurer Jim Chalmers' order that Chinese funds reduce their shareholding in Northern Minerals comes after a 
vicious brawl for board control, in which former executive chairman Nick Curtis was effectively forced out of his 
position.
For investors, it's a cautionary tale about major geopolitical pressures underlying the typical corporate manoeuvres, 
linkages and big bets playing out in a still relatively nascent critical minerals industry in Australia.
Wu Tao, the Chinese businessman behind the Singapore-based Yuxiao Fund, certainly wasn't subtle in his tactics. 
In February last year, Chalmers - acting on the advice of the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) - rejected 
Wu's wish to increase his 9.8 per cent stake in Northern Minerals to 19.9 per cent.
Wu allegedly attempted to get around this block by using related entities to purchase shares - a concern that Curtis 
then referred to the FIRB for investigation.
This battle is part of the background for Curtis recently becoming a "strategic adviser" to the company while backing 
the appointment of a new chairman, former CFO Adam Handley, before a showdown with Wu and allies at a 
shareholder meeting called for this Thursday.
The Yuxiao Fund had nominated Wu for a seat on the board and had also demanded access to Northern Minerals' 
accounts and marketing contracts. It also signed co-operation agreements last year with two big Chinese rare 
earths processors: China Northern and Shenghe Resources.
The Australian Financial Review reported last November that a director of China Northern described this as 
"another important measure to thoroughly implement the spirit of ... Xi Jinping's important instructions on the 
development of the rare earth industry". But Chalmers' edict now orders Yuxiao to reduce its ownership of Northern 
Page 2 of 3
Rare earths caught in geopolitical struggle Page Two
Minerals to 8.5 per cent, and the other associated parties - two individuals and two companies - will be forced to sell 
their shares, which currently add up to another 9 per cent.
According to a spokesman for the treasurer, the decision is "designed to protect our national interest and ensure 
compliance with our foreign investment framework".
That seems a reasonable response to what appears to be a remarkably blatant attempt to bypass the FIRB.
Despite the treasurer's simultaneous insistence that Australia operates a "non-discriminatory foreign investment 
framework", the primary target for foreign investment restrictions on the ownership of Australian critical minerals is 
also clear: China, China, China. This will doubtless be a topic of discussion when Chinese Premier Li Qiang visits 
Australia this month.
But many small miners argue that Chinese investment, technology and partnerships will continue to be necessary 
ingredients in Australia's attempts to develop a critical minerals processing industry - as well as its role as 
Australia's most important customer for all its minerals.
And if that's not complicated enough, there's another politically sensitive domestic issue lurking.
Northern Minerals' proposed project is supposed to have the rare earths it wants to mine - dysprosium and terbium 
- processed by Iluka Resources' refinery, which is still under construction at Eneabba in WA. These "heavy" rare 
earths are required for the manufacture of permanent magnets necessary for electrical equipment, electric vehicles, 
wind turbines and other advanced technology, including for defence purposes.
Iluka is building the refinery that was provided $1.25 billion in cheap loans during the last days of the Morrison 
government. It is looking for additional funds to finish the project, given that costs have - also typically - blown out 
while prices have fallen.
Iluka Resources CEO Tom O'Leary has been particularly vocal in warning of China's price manipulation to force 
out competitors in other countries that are struggling with the abrupt decline in a range of critical minerals, including 
rare earths.
Curtis is personally familiar with this storyline. Until 2013, he was executive chairman of another Australian rare 
earths player, Lynas Rare Earths, one of only two companies globally undertaking any processing outside China. 
Lynas received essential financial backing from Japan to survive when facing extreme competitive pressure from 
Chinese interests.
Northern Minerals is yet to take a final investment decision on its Browns Range project. But governments in 
Australia, and the US and Europe, belatedly recognise the risks of relying on a China-dominated supply chain.
That led to the Albanese government's willingness, for example, to assist other projects, such as Arafura Rare 
Earths, with an announcement in March of $840 million in concessional financing to develop its mine and refinery in 
the Northern Territory.
Arafura has agreements to supply rare earths to South Korean automaker Hyundai, Siemens Gamesa Renewable 
Energy, and GE as other countries try to diversify their supply chains away from China
Chalmers' budget also included up to $7 billion in production tax credits over a decade for critical minerals 
processing in Australia.
What is less clear is what level of Chinese investment will be permitted for these projects to be eligible for these 
credits. The details are awaiting further consultations with industry.
If Australia follows the US, Chinese involvement in companies would be held to a maximum of 25 per cent to be 
eligible. But many projects, particularly in Western Australia, already have higher levels of Chinese ownership, 
allowing them access to more funding and expertise.Page 3 of 3
Rare earths caught in geopolitical struggle Page Two
The Association of Mining and Exploration Companies - influential in persuading the Albanese government of the 
benefits of production tax credits - will be arguing that a 25 per cent threshold would be too low to allow the industry 
to flourish.
It's a story still being written.

There's something almost cinematic about the rollicking tale of intrigue that has enveloped the $212 million rare 
earths hopeful Northern Minerals.
Once upon a time, a small Australian company, which one day hopes to mine two little-known minerals - 
dysprosium and terbium, crucial to the production of high-performance magnets, batteries and defence equipment - 
was targeted by a mysterious Chinese businessman, Wu Tao.
He's a big wheel in the Chinese rare earths sector, which has used its dominant position to control price, supply and 
trade flows in an industry that has become central to tensions between China and the West.
Wu took a 9.8 per cent stake of Northern Minerals via his Singapore-registered company, Yuxiao Fund, but wanted 
a bigger slice, outlining a plan in 2022 to increase his stake to 19.9 per cent. But when this bid was thwarted in 
February last year by Treasurer Jim Chalmers, on the advice of the Foreign Investment Review Board, Wu is 
accused of taking matters into his own hands by orchestrating the buying of shares via a series of related entities 
and parties, including Black Stone Resources and Indian Ocean International Shipping and Service Co, plus Ms 
Ximei Liu and Mr Xi Wang.
In October 2023, then Northern Minerals chief executive Nick Curtis referred the share buying to FIRB - and 
subsequently found himself the subject of an attempt by Wu to remove him as a director of the company at an 
extraordinary general meeting showdown on June 6.
Last Monday, Curtis fell on his sword, resigning as a director and moving to a position as a special adviser. But 
yesterday, Chalmers struck again, ordering Yuxiao to reduce its stake from 9.8 per cent to 8.5 per cent within 60 
days, and Black Stone, Ocean International, Liu and Wang to dispose of shares equivalent to about 9 per cent.
Such disposal orders are extremely rare in commercial matters, and so the implication seems clear: Chalmers has 
used his power to prevent a surreptitious attempt by Chinese interests to grab control of a promising miner, whose 
precious products may help insulate Australia's high-end electrification and defence supply chains from Chinese 
control of the rare earths market.
Page 2 of 2
Sell-down order adds to crazy tale
Roll credits! Well, maybe not so fast. One of Australia's top FIRB experts argues that the disposal orders issued by 
Treasury were widely predicted and welcome: this was an attempt to use the backdoor to get around an earlier 
FIRB order and couldn't be allowed to go ahead. So our expert says this shouldn't necessarily be read as a sudden 
hardening of Treasury's stance against Chinese investment in critical minerals.
Nevertheless, the timing of the announcement is fascinating, and not just because it seems poor old Nick Curtis 
resigned a week too early.
As the government goes through the design process for the critical minerals production tax credit regime 
announced in last month's budget, the question of whether projects with Chinese investment will be treated 
differently is high on the minds of those in the Australian sector.
Just as the birth of Australia's iron ore sector in the 1960s was financed with Japanese and Korean capital, China 
has emerged as a powerful force in the creation of Australia's critical minerals industry, as financier, customer and 
provider of key infrastructure, particularly processing capacity. Some US government money has found its way into 
key projects, but not nearly as much as Chinese interests have provided.
But at the same time, key figures in the Australian critical minerals sector are growing more vocal in the warnings 
about Chinese control of markets. At The Australian Financial Review Mining Summit in Perth last month, Iluka 
Resources chief executive Tom O'Leary repeated his warnings that China is using its power to manipulate rare 
earths pricing.
Ironically, Iluka is both a shareholder in Northern Minerals and, if all goes to plan, will process Northern Minerals' 
production at its new $1.8 billion refinery at Eneabba in Western Australia. Perhaps it might even be in the market 
for the 10 per cent of Northern Minerals that will now be on the market.
The Australian critical minerals industry, and indeed the federal government, is in a sticky position, caught between 
the need to keep tapping Chinese capital and growing geopolitical tensions in a vital industry.
Chalmers' latest intervention might not represent a change in the government's view on Chinese involvement in the 
sector, but where it draws the line on Chinese exposure to the new production tax credit regime will be telling.

Northern Minerals is a key player in the rare earths market Rarely in Australia and arguably in the Western world 
has a corporate annual meeting been more -important than the Northern Minerals meeting held in Perth on 
Thursday.
The Chinese combined to almost spike the US-Australian policy of containing China's domin-ance on global rare 
earths. The sighs of relief in Canberra could -almost be heard in Perth.
Northern Minerals is a vital link in the Australian and US strategy to reduce dependence on China for key rare 
earths, which are vital in producing magnets used in energy production involving extreme heat, including -nuclear 
submarines.
The Chinese believed they had voting control of the company, so put forward motions to appoint four Chinese-
backed new directors. If passed, the motions would have resulted in control of the board of this vital company 
passing to people linked to the Chinese rare earths industry.
About 73 per cent of the capital voted and, while the Chinese -motions were lost, they showed China's total voting 
power, with a 49 per cent vote for one director and 41 per cent for another.
Support for the other two nominations was much smaller.
China controls 100 per cent of the market for two of the so-called heavy rare earths - terbium and dysprosium - that 
are essential in the production of high temperatures magnets required in trains, wind turbines, plus many defence 
applications apart from nuclear submarines.
At this stage, Northern Minerals is the best source in the Western world for these two rare earths, so if China is to 
maintain 100 per cent of the market, gaining board control of Northern Minerals becomes an essential step.
Northern Minerals is set to produce concentrates from its West Australian Browns Range deposits (near the 
Northern Territory border) that it has contacted to supply to Iluka Resources, which is being backed by the federal

government to erect a refinery that will produce a range of rare earths. Iluka requires Northern Minerals' 
concentrates to produce terbium and dysprosium.
The Australian government has agreed to loan $1.25bn to the refinery project without recourse to Iluka. As is usual 
in Australia, the original refinery cost estimates were wrong, and the latest estimates are 20 per cent above the 
original sums. My guess is that the final cost will be higher again. Hence, extra government money is required, and 
alarm are ringing in Canberra, causing delay.
But given the importance of the refinery to the US defence alliance, Jim Chalmers will simply have to find more 
money. It's conceivable that if Australia doesn't deliver the two essential heavy rare earths, it could jeopardise the 
AUKUS submarine program.
The US is funding another Australian company, Lynas, into a second rare earths refinery in the US on a far more 
generous basis than Australia's backing of Iluka.
At this stage, Lynas does not have a source of concentrates to produce terbium and dysprosium. Northern Minerals 
drilling is increasing the size of its terbium and dysprosium reserves, so it is conceivable that its material may also 
be required in the US.
Australian Rare Earths has clay-based rare earths deposits on the South Australia/Victoria border, containing both 
terbium and dysprosium. Clay-based reserves are much cheaper to extract than the Northern Minerals hard rock 
deposits, but SA deposits are at a much earlier stage of exploration than those of Northern Minerals.
Iluka also has terbium and dysprosium deposits in Victoria's Wimmera, but they are also at an early development 
stage.
Shareholders connected to the Chinese rare earth industry realised the Northern Minerals deposits could break 
their global stranglehold and acquired 10 per cent of Northern Minerals, and there are a series of other Chinese 
investors who have a presence on the register.
But earlier this week, the Treasurer ordered four Chinese-linked investment funds to significantly reduce their 
holdings in Northern Minerals, citing Australia's "national interest".
Nick Curtis, the former executive chair of Lynas, took control of Northern Minerals in 2001 and negotiated the Iluka 
supply deal, so is not popular among the Chinese rare earths industry people.
Prior to the meeting, most of the existing directors had appeared optimistic that the four Chinese would not be 
elected.
Curtis's unpopularity with the Chinese intensified when he referred their share buying patterns to the Foreign 
Investment Review Board because he believed they breached foreign investment rules. It took the FIRB a long time 
to determine that the rules had been breached, but that decision, requiring Chinese rare earths industry-connected 
investments to be sold, was made in the week of the meeting. The meeting had been postponed many times 
because of FIRB delays, but more delays were not possible.
A Chinese rare earth industry-controlled Northern Minerals board would still have had a binding contract with Iluka, 
but almost certainly there would be many obstacles put in the way of its execution. In turn, that would put in doubt 
the economics of the Iluka refinery, leaving the Chinese with full control of the terbium and dysprosium market.
Another motion put before the annual meeting was to authorise the board to make a 10 per cent share placement, 
which would further reduce the Chinese position on the register - although a Chinese-controlled board might make 
the placement to their connected shareholders. As a legacy of times when Chinese dominance was not an issue, 
there are two existing Chinese directors on the Northern Minerals board. One came up for re-election at the annual 
meeting but was not opposed by the existing board.Page 3 of 3

With government support and an abundance of the mineral resources vital for many renewable energy 
technologies, Australia has the potential to become a critical minerals powerhouse as the world shifts to net zero. 
Yet experts warn there are headwinds that require careful navigation.
Certain critical minerals are essential for aspects of renewable energy generation, storage and transmission. 
Lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and graphite are all crucial for electric car batteries and solar and wind power 
storage systems. Rare earths are vital for the permanent magnets used in wind turbines and electric motors. 
Copper and aluminium are needed in electricity grids.
The transition to renewables is driving significantly increased demand for these minerals, an appetite which is 
expected to continue growing as the move to a green economy accelerates around the world. At the same time, 
nations are manoeuvring to ensure their critical mineral supply lines are as secure as possible at a time of 
geopolitical tension.
Governments around the world are taking action to establish resilient supply chains to provide supply security for 
onshore manufacturers, according to a spokesman for Australian company Lynas Rare Earths, the only scale 
producer of separated rare earths outside China.
The Covid pandemic demonstrated the risks of single-sourced supply chains, the spokesman added, noting: "Our 
new Kalgoorlie facility has been designed to accept third party feedstock which will provide opportunities as new 
projects come online." Lynas says the development of critical minerals processing in Australia will require different 
government support at different stages, and while the company welcomes the production tax credit, it recommends 
investment in common user infrastructure where Australia has a cost disadvantage.
"Much of today's infrastructure is expensive and not fit for purpose and this puts Australian critical minerals 
producers at a cost disadvantage," the Lynas spokesman says. "This is particularly apparent with utilities such as 
energy and water, landside logistics such as road freight, and labour costs. We see this as a once in a generation 
opportunity for government investment in 21st century infrastructure." Australia is already a world leader in the 
production of several critical minerals. In 2022, Australia was the top producer of lithium (52 per cent) and among 
Page 2 of 3
Net zero unlocks the nation's critical minerals potential
the top five producers of cobalt, manganese, rare earths and others, according to data published by the 
government's earth sciences agency, Geoscience Australia.
At the same time, there is ongoing federal support for new critical mineral discoveries and developments, and 
Geoscience Australia has been promised $566m over the next 10 years to fund mapping the nation's rich reserves 
of critical minerals.
The Australian government sees critical minerals as essential for economic sovereignty and the clean energy 
transition and the nation's Critical Minerals Strategy is intended to be a framework for the development of the 
industry.
"So much of our future prosperity depends on finding more critical minerals, extracting more critical minerals and 
doing more with critical minerals before we export them," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told a Perth audience in 
May.
The government has provided the industry with substantial financial support, including a $7bn production tax credit 
and funding for infrastructure projects to boost exploration, processing and development.
The Critical Minerals Strategy includes a list of 26 critical minerals that "represent potential economic opportunities" 
- minerals such as lithium, magnesium, nickel, manganese, rare earths, titanium, zirconium, silicon and graphite.
Australia has rich critical mineral deposits, but to date the nation has limited processing capability, and the 
geographical concentration of some critical minerals and the long lead times for new mine development have raised 
concerns about supply chain security and potential price spikes.
The Australian critical minerals industry is often at the mercy of boom-and-bust investment cycles. Nickel lost value 
over recent months following a glut of cheaper products from Indonesia. This led to intense speculation the mining 
giant BHP would shutter its Nickel West operation, although the nickel price is beginning to rebound now with the 
troubles in New Caledonia.
Lithium, too, once described as the "white gold" of the renewables transition and an essential element in electric 
vehicles, fell in price. This followed a boom in value which led to oversupply and a consequent price slump.
International trade settings can affect the Australian critical minerals industry to a marked degree. China, for 
instance, dominates the rare earths industry, particularly the heavy rare earths industry, which is critical for many 
defence technologies.
In a statement in early June, Australian treasurer Jim Chalmers said he ordered five international companies linked 
to China to divest their shares in Australian heavy rare earths prospector Northern Minerals "to protect our national 
interest and ensure compliance with our foreign investment framework".
Northern Minerals, which operates the strategically-crucial Browns Range mine in Western Australia's Kimberley, 
wants to become the first major producer outside China of dysprosium, a rare earth used in electric vehicles and 
wind turbines.
The managing director of Australian mining company Iluka, Tom O'Leary, voiced his concern about China's 
dominance of the rare earths industry at the company's annual general meeting in May.
Iluka has interests in titanium and zircon, as well as rare earths. O'Leary said China's dominance of the heavy rare 
earths industry was near total and "achieved through production supremacy and its influence over pricing", adding 
that last December China had banned the export of heavy rare earth processing technology.
"In addition to being essential for the production of electric vehicles and wind turbines, the key heavy rare earths, 
dysprosium and terbium, have critical applications in defence and national security," he said. O'Leary discussed the 
"megatrends shaping the global economy", including the transition to clean energy, the development of independent 
supply lines and the current policy settings of nations including Canada, Japan, South Korea, European Union Page 3 of 3

nations and Australia, which "are now aimed squarely at retaining onshore some of the economic opportunities of 
the energy transition".

An Australian miner racing to break China's global stranglehold of rare earths says the Asian powerhouse is 
manipulating resource prices, posing an "existential threat" to Western countries.

Western Australia, marking China's push to retain control of the world's critical minerals and rare earths.

Around the same time, the boss of $2.7 billion ASX-listed Iluka Resources, Tom O'Leary, was warning participants 
at a global mining conference in Japan about the "uncomfortable reality" behind China's superiority.
"China's dominance of the rare earths supply chain has led to market failure, and this presents an existential threat 
to manufacturing in Western and like-minded countries," O'Leary said.
Beijing's monopoly of rare earths is being leveraged to control prices, O'Leary maintains. He said that significant 
price swings on the Asian Metal index over the past three and a half years indicate the price is being manipulated 
by China.
"Most telling is the price fall, from the peak in early 2022, which occurred almost immediately following what was 
effectively a Chinese government directive to its rare earth firms to 'jointly guide product prices to return to 
rationality'," he said.
Independent forecasters point to a future supply squeeze and rising prices, yet Asian Metal index prices for rare 
earths remain at historic lows. At today's index prices, no producer, regardless of location, is making any money, 
O'Leary said.
China makes more than 90 per cent of the world's rare earth oxides and monopolises the global supply of two 
heavy rare earth elements - dysprosium and terbium. It can extract profits anywhere along the supply chain.
Page 2 of 2
China's global grip on rare earths an 'uncomfortable reality'
Both elements are used to make high-strength magnets for thousands of defence applications, electric motors and 
drivetrains in wind turbines.
Governments around the world are scrambling to counter China's monopoly and secure the materials needed to 
power the clean energy economy and the planet's energy transition.
Iluka is building a refinery - backed by the Australian government to the tune of $1.25 billion - in Eneabba north of 
Perth that will produce enough separated light and heavy rare earth oxides to meet more than half of the West's 
forecast demand by 2030.
Julian Kettle, senior vice president of metals and mining at analytics firm Wood Mackenzie, said taxpayers will end 
up underwriting the refining and processing being built to counter China.
Most of the value in minerals is extracted by miners, rather than refiners. "What that means is that you require 
higher prices to make the subsidy numbers work. The taxpayer always pays," Kettle said.
"There needs to be a different conversation with China. We can't keep China bashing," he said.
China's reserves of heavy rare earths will run out within 11 years at current demand levels, data from Adamas 
Intelligence suggests.
That timeline may be driving an aggressive push by Beijing to sign binding offtake agreements with smaller miners 
and increase Chinese ownership of Australian resource companies such as Northern Minerals.
Treasurer Jim Chalmers earlier this month ordered Chinese funds that own shares in Northern Minerals to 
significantly reduce their stakes in the rare earths prospector, as the Australian government sharpens its focus on 
supply chain security.
Kim Beazley, chairman of the US Asia Centre think tank in Perth and former defence minister, said a miner such as 
Iluka could potentially change the game if it can supply half of the West's demand for rare earths within the next six 
years.
"That's it. Finished. Strategic game over [for China]," he said.
"If we are going to get these precise rare earths - terbium, dysprosium and a couple of others - that are critical to 
making magnets ... that is what gives us a reasonable chance, or the Americans a reasonable chance, of 
independent survival."

INDIAN OCEAN DEFENCE & SECURITY SPECIAL REPORT The most enlightening map in the 2023 Defence 
Strategic Review (DSR) appears on page 27. It's a projection of our region of strategic interest and illustrates our 
geography as it really is. I wish I had had it when I was defence minister. In the 1980s we operated off the RAAF's 
strategic planning map - a projection of the northern approaches to the Australian continent with a series of 
concentric circles emanating from the focal point, Darwin.
I am reminded of the statement by the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche: if you stare into the abyss long enough it 
will stare back into you. If you stare into this map long enough, the lines of required effort in the defence of our 
continent stares back at us. It elevates our significance. We lie athwart the choke points between the Indian Ocean 
and the Pacific. We have a huge domain that shouts out our capacity for dispersal. The tilt of this map effectively 
makes the whole of Western Australia our frontline.
Four decades ago my late friend Des Ball wrote a book on the joint facilities entitled A suitable piece of real estate. 
He saw our significance to the US in the then Cold War context as a southern vantage point for most facets of the 
evolving US strategic deterrent. Though continually evolving their technology, the US still finds the joint facilities so. 
But now there is an added dimension.
During the Cold War our geography was useful for the strategic balance, but no other component of the strategic 
picture. Now we are at the centre of their principal strategic focus. That has been so since the presidency of Barack 
Obama. The rebalance to the Indo-Pacific is now cemented in the American strategic mind.
The American opinion is not simply driven by kindness to allies. This is about hard-headed military interest - ours 
and theirs. We need to get out of the habit of our focus on shared values. While they are there, we all know we 
have very different constitutional arrangements, and values won't always be identical.
Hard military interests are another matter. They need to be separated out from what might be challengeable on the 
values front, particularly if Donald Trump is re-elected as US president. The DSR map tells us that if the US 
remains committed to the defence of the Western Pacific, our geography is critical. The US has a range of allies 
and friends in our zone. We are potentially the last bastion.
Page 2 of 3
Western Australia is the AUKUS state
The US is not waiting around for the arrival of our AUKUS submarines. I am confident I will be dead when the first 
of those arrives. But, with our ability to provide facilities for submarine, air and missile deployments, we will remain 
vital. Above all our capacity for dispersal, if effectively pursued, will provide a continuation of our status as a 
"suitable piece of real estate". That is an effective contribution to our deterrence as well as that of our close allies.
Capabilities and intentions are different phenomena. Our diplomacy must be devoted to sustaining friendships. But 
important to that effort is the appearance and reality of the fact we have a powerful ally. It is a vital component 
underpinning that -diplomacy should evolving capabilities, at some point, confront changing intentions and views of 
us. AUKUS is not a defence -alliance, but both pillars - one and two - are vital in reinforcing ANZUS.
Two elements require urgent attention. They are for Pillar 1, the rapid development of HMAS Stirling (the RAN's 
main base in WA) and the nearby Henderson naval construction and maintenance facility. For Pillar 2, it is 
leveraging our status as a world-class mining and, potentially, minerals processing nation for rare earths. Many 
other elements of our posture, not least the northern airbases at Learmonth and Curtin, are vital, but getting these 
two right is crucial.
Stirling/Henderson requires immediate and urgent attention. HMAS Stirling recently hosted a visit by an American 
submarine tender, the USS Frank Cable. Frequent such visits are useful. They should help keep us abreast of 
America's needs. Within three years the US and UK rotational submarine deployments to WA will commence. What 
is being done now requires high security. We don't know how well it is proceeding.
What hasn't proceeded fast enough is the land acquisition and building of accommodation in Rockingham of at 
least 300 houses necessary to support planned US and UK submarine rotations. Defence Personnel Minister Matt 
Keogh's announcement earlier this month regarding construction of relevant defence housing in Rockingham will 
help settle frustrated minds. This development must quickly expand for the additional workforce required to 
construct the General Purpose Frigates and other naval programs.
Henderson is nowhere near where it should be for all the planned developments involving the RAN and its naval 
partners. It needs security upgrades and dry-docking facilities.
The question of ownership of the various facilities required for shipbuilding and sustainment needs resolution. When 
we built the Anzac frigates we were assisted by the creation of a joint venture for the vessels' construction. That 
was AMECON, which first built two American-designed FFGs (Frigate, Guided Missiles) and then constructed the 
Anzac class. The latter were produced on time and under budget - still our best performance in naval shipbuilding.
A joint venture is essential now. Austal does not have any guarantees for the planned General Purpose Frigate, but 
it does have the contract to build to Birdon's design 18 amphibious land craft (LC-Ms) for the Army. A joint venture 
for the -facilities and subsequent builds would include at least Austal, BAE, Birdon and CIVMEC, which actually 
owns the main building at Henderson. Birdon might seem an unusual partner, but its executive chairman John 
White supervised the construction of the Anzac-class frigates, and has done it all before.
The government should insist on a joint venture being rapidly formed. The winner of the forthcoming General 
Purpose Frigate tender could join the joint venture when that deliberation is concluded. (Disclosure: I am a member 
of the Australian board of Luerssen - the company building the offshore patrol vessels [OPVs] in CIVMEC's 
building.) The second pillar - and I think it should be a third pillar for its significance - would be the capacity in WA to 
mine and process rare earths for magnets vital to addressing a major American strategic weakness. Rare earths 
are crucial to 3400 American weapons systems. China already has a complete mine-to-missiles production 
process.
WA has two companies capable of challenging Chinese dominance. One is Lynas. Strongly supported by the 
Japanese, it has survived repeated efforts by the Chinese to shut it down. Lynas's mine is at Mt Weld. It was 
selected by the US to construct a heavy rare earth processing facility in Texas.
To assist the process, it is building such a facility in Malaysia. It has a processing facility constructed in Kalgoorlie, 
but that is for light rare earths. It is deeply aware of how vital this is to the US.Page 3 of 3
Western Australia is the AUKUS state
A second is Iluka. Its processing facility is at Eneabba, 280km north of Perth. It has received government support, 
but it needs more. The federal government is providing useful tax concessions for critical minerals, but additional 
help is needed to underpin efforts with offtake agreements and stockpiling.
In the northeast of WA, Northern Minerals is assessing a potential massive heavy rare earths deposit, which 
includes dysprosium and terbium, at Browns range near the Northern Territory border. The federal government is 
alert to this and trying to compel (much resisted by Beijing) a selldown of Chinese interests in the project.
The global trade in these rare earths is about $US2bn ($2.9bn), but they support $US7 trillion of global 
manufacturing. That man-ufacturing scoops up not just weapons production but also new technologies critical for 
addressing climate change.
We are ethical miners. Many across the globe are not. Our miners and processors, assisted by -organisations such 
as ANSTO and CSIRO, know how to do this sustainably. Iluka managing director Tom O'Leary says that its 
potential production of dysprosium and terbium (critical for the magnets for weapons systems and much else) has 
the capacity to account for "greater than half of 2030 forecast Western demand". Combine that with Lynas and we 
can probably account for the lot.
This would be a great outcome for AUKUS and for WA - the AUKUS state. Kim Beazley was Australia's defence 
minister from 1984-1990 and the governor of WA from 2018-2022.

Lynas Rare Earths says the Albanese government should contribute funding to a chemical plant that would supply 
sulphuric acid, after the end of produce from BHP's nickel business.
Lynas said yesterday it might need to produce its own acid to feed a new $800 million rare earths processing plant 
at Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. Industry sources indicated it could cost about $130 million to build a plant 
capable of producing 1000 tonnes of sulphuric acid a year.
Lynas, led by managing director Amanda Lacaze, has a contract with BHP for the supply of sulphuric acid from 
either the Kalgoorlie nickel smelter or imported sources. The contract runs until 2027, and Lynas has said it intends 
to hold BHP to the terms.
Sulphuric acid is a byproduct of nickel smelting, but BHP will suspend operations in WA, along with nickel mining, 
from October.
Ms Lacaze said Kalgoorlie needed better infrastructure, including power supply, and there was a strong case for the 
government to do more to help now that Lynas and others faced an issue with sulphuric acid supply.
BHP also supplies some of the acid needed by Glencore to run its Murrin Murrin nickel laterite mine.
"It's one thing to have a policy that says we want to have a critical minerals industry. It is another to put the enabling 
infrastructure in place for that to let us be successful," Ms Lacaze said. "One of the benefits of a sulfuric acid plant 
is that it produce energy, which means that you can capture that energy, and it gives you a significant benefit in 
terms of electricity usage."
Ms Lacaze said Lynas could consider building a plant in partnership with others if the government met part of the 
cost. More than $2 billion of taxpayer funds has been pumped into rare earth projects at Iluka Resources and 
Arafura Resources that are slated to compete with Lynas, the world's biggest non-China supplier.
Iluka said yesterday that it remained in talks with the government on funding on top of a $1.25 billion finance 
package, after cost blowouts on a rare earths refinery it is building in WA.

Lynas faces a number of issues apart from sulphuric acid supply as rare earths prices hover at a five-year low.
UBS noted that operational issues at the Lynas processing hub in Malaysia meant the company missed its output 
target in the three months to June 30.
Lynas produced 2188 tonnes of rare earths oxide in the June quarter, down from 3545 tonnes in the previous 
period, and 4455 tonnes a year ago.
Lynas shares closed 3¢ lower yesterday at $6.02.

One investor describes it as the M&A arbitrage trade of the year, except for the fact hedge funds are noticeably 
absent.
Sierra Rutile, spun out of Iluka Resources in 2022, has attracted three takeover bids from three wildly different 
suitors in the past five months.
In March, commercial construction company PRM Services lobbed a 9.5¢ a share offer (and was swiftly rejected).
Now, the board has recommended an 18¢ a share offer from Sierra Leone-controlled oil company Leonoil Group, 
which outbid London-based emerging markets fund Gemcorp within weeks. A bidders' statement from Leonoil, 
which supplies fuel to Sierra Rutile, is due this week.
It's a return of more than three times since January if the bid goes through, but most of the well-known investors on 
the register, including Samuel Terry, Regal and Perpetual, are long gone.
In a market where contested M&A remains thin on the ground, three bidders - even for a $76 million company - is 
notable. All the more so as this company's performance has underwhelmed, and its cash position looks strained.
Adding further intrigue are the different bidders tussling for control. They range from a Sierra Leone-backed energy 
group, a global metals trader, through to a London investor that the Financial Times has described as among the 
"most daring emerging markets funds" in an article documenting its historical links to Russian money.
Sierra Rutile, which mines rutile, the natural form of titanium dioxide used in paint and tiles, in West Africa, has 
been better known as another cautionary tale of large Australian companies investing offshore.
Iluka spun out the business within five years of buying it for $375 million. Within three years of the purchase, Iluka 
impaired the carrying value by $US290 million and wrote down associated tax assets by $US115 million.
On deciding to divest in 2022, Greg Martin, now Sierra Rutile's chairman, said Iluka had to report corrupt behaviour 
by previous management, and the introduction of new mining technologies proved operationally difficult. At the start

of this year, the company's register was still dotted with institutional investors that simply inherited the stock as part 
of their Iluka holdings.
But they were beginning to get antsy. Shares in the company that estimates it controls 20 per cent of the world's 
rutile had fallen to 5.8¢ ahead of the PRM bid, from as high as 43¢ at the time of spinout.
One tension point was whether it made sense to keep developing its Sembehun project, or focus on returning 
capital to investors. The issue looked set to curdle further as Sierra Rutile found itself in a dispute with the Sierra 
Leone government, essentially over the split the West African nation's government should receive.
But then the rush of bidders arrived.
Since July 22, the board has recommended investors back Leonoil's 18¢ a share bid, which has no minimum 
acceptance conditions. It's an impressive turnaround from January levels, but still a long way from a demerger 
success story for Iluka.
It's unclear which parties are siding with which strategic investors, and whether it is a done deal. Gemcorp, for one, 
still holds 19.9 per cent of the company and has an offer that remains live, even if it is subject to a minimum 51 per 
cent acceptance.
This is far from the only question around this evolving situation. (A Takeovers Panel application by PRM Services 
arguing some parties were acting together was dismissed. On Friday, the panel released the reasons for doing so, 
which disclosed that Sierra Rutile held talks with Gemcorp before it bought its shareholding.)
Among the many questions are how any bidders can appropriately value the mine based on available information 
about Sierra Leone's taxes and fees.
Much of the intrigue is around the bidders themselves, which make up three of the group's four largest investors 
and account for almost 65 per cent of the company between them.
Focus on trumped suitor Gemcorp, which swooped in late April as local fund Samuel Terry sold its 19.9 per cent 
holding, has increased after the FT article. It outlined how Gemcorp turned its focus to Africa at the same time 
Vladimir Putin drove Russian diplomatic and commercial investment to minimise the impact of Western sanctions. 
And it detailed how it had hired a long list of well-connected UK government ministers and advisers.
Gemcorp told the FT that neither it nor its founder had ever acted in support of the Russian state nor broken 
sanctions.
Even so, Gemcorp has been outbid by Leonoil. Leonoil Group popped its head above the substantial line on April 
29 and has since upped its stake to 7.5 per cent. The company provides fuel to Sierra Rutile and exports oil from 
the largest terminal in the country, as well as owning and managing 24 petrol stations. Traditionally, sources say, 
the company has been more aligned to the Sierra Leone opposition party than the government.
(That compares to the only major investor that is yet to make an offer: contractor Mano Mining & Logistics, which 
owns 13.3 per cent of the company and is regarded as more aligned to the ruling government. Mano had been one 
of the contractors operating at the company's Area 1 until the suspension of mining, announced on March 11.)
And there is still lots of noise around the first bidder to show up at Sierra Rutile, PRM Services, which maintains an 
11.46 per cent shareholding. Initially, PRM, which had its offer swiftly rejected, had sought to remove four non-
executive directors and replace them with its own candidates.
The Puerto Rico-registered group's majority shareholder and chairman is Craig Dean, who runs the London-
headquartered Gerald Group. Gerald Group is an employee-owned metals trading company that already has a 
presence in Sierra Leone through its Marampa iron ore mine.Page 3 of 3

As the bid was lobbed, photos surfaced of Sierra Leone president Julius Maada Bio disembarking a plane 
registered at the same address as the Gerald Group office in Connecticut. A spokeswoman for Gerald Group did 
not confirm or deny if the jet belonged to the company, instead providing The West Australian with a statement on 
broader "market rumours".

Former defence minister Kim Beazley says Western Australia is the part of Australia "most worthwhile attacking" in 
any future conflict with China or other adversaries.
Mr Beazley said basing nuclear submarines at Garden Island near Perth under the AUKUS security pact was 
essential to protecting resources, industry assets and land mass that would be prized under any major escalation 
of geopolitical tensions.
"WA is the AUKUS state. It is potentially the most vulnerable and potentially the most worthwhile to attack," he told 
a Diggers & Dealers mining conference audience that included Opposition Leader Peter Dutton.
The former Australian ambassador to the US said nuclear submarines were a "force multiplier" in comments that 
endorsed former prime minister Scott Morrison's decision to abandon a deal with France to supply conventional 
submarines.
Mr Beazley likened conventional submarines to funnel web spiders that could deliver a nasty bite but were not 
deterrent to entering your backyard.
He said nuclear submarines were more like having a "hungry panther" prowling around your backyard to keep 
people out.
Mr Beazley, who served in a variety of senior Labor rules during a 27-year career in federal parliament, urged the 
Albanese government to take an even harder line on blocking Chinese investment and off-take deals in critical 
minerals.
He suggested Australia should buy and stockpile certain materials essential to modern weapons systems at times 
when China used its near monopoly on processing technology to depress pricing.
Mr Beazley said his main concern was heavy rare earths materials dysprosium and terbium, which are essential for 
the permanent magnets used in weapons' systems to give them extreme accuracy.

Beazley: WA is most open to attack by China
The federal Labor government has blocked Chinese investments in rare earths, intervening in a row over the control 
of potential heavy rare earths miner Northern Minerals and pumping more than $2 billion of taxpayer money into 
rare earths projects free of links to China. Mr Beazley suggested the government should offer more funding, on top 
of the $1.25 billion it has already provided Iluka Resources, to build a fully integrated rare earths refinery at 
Eneabba in WA.
Iluka has been locked in talks with Labor for months as it seeks more taxpayer support to finish building what would 
be Australia's first such refinery after the cost blowout to $1.8 billion.
Mr Beazley backed claims by Iluka boss Tom O'Leary that China manipulated prices to further its stranglehold on 
the supply of rare earths materials.
Speaking on the sidelines of the conference, Lynas Rare Earths managing director Amanda Lacaze said China had 
built up inventories last year as prices fell but noted signs those stockpiles were now being reduced.
Mr Beazley said permanent magnets made using rare earths were found in 3400 US weapons systems and that the 
AUKUS partner was "totally vulnerable" if China cut off supply of dysprosium and terbium.

  Iluka Resources is weighing the cost of expansion into rare earths as global economic uncertainty depresses 
demand for its mineral sands.
   The mining and processing company on Wednesday reported a first-half net profit of $134 million, down 34 per 
cent from $204 million a year earlier, as global economic uncertainty continues to weigh on sales.
   Mineral sands revenue fell 15 per cent to $606 million from $712 million on subdued demand in the construction 
and real estate sectors, particularly in China.
   A rare earths business update would be provided in September, managing director Tom O'Leary said, with the 
capital estimate for the proposed Eneabba project confirmed at $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion.
   Discussions on "appropriate risk-sharing" are "very well-advanced" with the federal government, which 
understands the facility has merit as under their critical minerals strategy, he told a teleconference.
   Iluka already has a $1.25 billion non-recourse loan for the development of the Eneabba rare earths refinery from 
the government's $2 billion critical minerals facility.
   Despite softness in global construction, demand from industrial applications was steady, with prices for Iluka's 
zircon products relatively stable and contracts for synthetic rutile providing a degree of revenue certainty.
   The second half of the financial year would be driven by economic and political dynamics, offset by stable 
European demand as industry benefits from declining energy prices, Iluka said.
   The company declared an interim dividend of four cents a share, fully franked.

The development of Iluka Resources' $1.8bn Eneabba mineral sands refinery hangs in the balance with the 
company warning it needs more federal support to press ahead with the project, which it says is critical to national 
security and the energy transition.
Iluka originally costed the West Australian project at $1bn-$1.2bn, with the government's Export Finance Australia 
coming to the party with a limited recourse loan of up to $1.25bn under the Critical Minerals Facility.
Costs have since blown out and the project is now expected to cost between $1.7bn and $1.8bn.
The Eneabba refinery is seen as strategically important given China's dominance in the global rare earths trade, a 
point Iluka Resources managing director Tom O'Leary was keen to make while handing down the company's first-
half results on Wednesday.
"The Eneabba refinery will be a critical piece of infrastructure for both national security and the energy transition," 
Mr O'Leary said.
"It's an archetypal project for the delivery of Western and like-minded policy initiatives in these areas.
"I've noted many times before the risk and opportunities that this investment presents.
"I've also been clear that Iluka requires an appropriate risk-sharing partnership with the government in order to 
continue the refinery development." Mr O'Leary said discussions with the government were "well-advanced", and to 
comment further would be inappropriate given the confidential nature of those talks.
"I will say though that the Australian government, our strategic partner, understands Iluka's position regarding risk 
sharing and also understands the merits of the Eneabba refinery, which is central to its critical minerals policy 
objectives," he said.
"I know shareholders' patience is limited and we are doing all in our power to delivery certainty." A spokesperson for 
Resources Minister Madeleine King said the EFA "has been working closely with Iluka, like it would with any

borrower, to assess options and identify appropriate solutions for Iluka to address cost increases at its Eneabba 
project".
Iluka said in its half-year report it expected to provide further updates on its rare earths business in the second half 
of the calendar year.
Iluka on Wednesday reported a first-half profit of $133.7m, down 34.4 per cent on the previous corresponding 
period, on revenue of $606.2m, down 14.9 per cent.
The company said three key factors played into the result: subdued activity globally in the construction and real 
estate markets, a strategic decision to build ilmenite inventory, and investment in capital developments.
It said global economic uncertainty was "affecting customer buying behaviour in both the -titanium and zircon 
markets".
Iluka said its Balranald rutile deposit in western NSW was on track for commissioning in the second half of 2025. 
Iluka will pay a fully franked dividend of 4c a share, up 1c from the previous corresponding period. Its shares closed 
2.5 per cent higher at $5.82 on Wednesday.

Iluka Resources has ramped up pressure on the Albanese government to kick loose more taxpayer funding to 
complete Australia's first fully integrated rare earths refinery.
Tom O'Leary-led Iluka maintains the refinery is vital to Australia's security and energy transition, as well as Labor's 
critical minerals ambitions, but the future of the project at Eneabba in Western Australia is in the balance.
Iluka spent $49 million on the partly built refinery in the six months to June 30. It has not provided guidance for any 
additional spending in the second half.
The government and Iluka have been at a stalemate for about nine months over additional funding on top of a 
$1.25 billion limited recourse loan from Export Finance Australia issued in the dying days of the Morrison 
government. Iluka revealed in February that the cost of building the refinery had blown out to $1.7 billion to $1.8 
billion after previously alerting the market that the price tag was much higher than initial estimates.
A spokesman for Resources Minister Madeleine King said taxpayers would expect the government to carry out a 
"robust and rigorous" assessment when considering a financial commitment of the size required by Iluka.
"Proper examination and consideration of financing options takes time," the spokesman said.
Rare earths experts note the government has made a risky each-way bet in refining by agreeing to part-fund the 
Gina Rinehart-backed Arafura Rare Earths project in the Northern Territory.
Iluka managing director Tom O'Leary said yesterday the minerals sands miner and processor would not complete 
its refinery without more government funding. He was speaking after Iluka declared a fully franked 4¢-a-share 
interim dividend and net profit after tax of $133.7 million, down 33 per cent on the same time last year.
"I've noted many times before the risks and opportunities that this investment presents. I've also been clear that 
Iluka requires an appropriate risk-sharing partnership with the Australian government in order to continue the 
refinery development," he said.

Iluka demands Labor funding for rare earths refinery
Iluka remains focused on what it calls a "strategic partnership" with the government and said it was not interested in 
any third-party deal.
If Labor retains power at the next election and the refinery is built, Iluka is set to be one of the big winners from the 
10 per cent production tax credit scheme. The company has also benefited from the government's intervention to 
kick investors suspected of having links to China off the register of rare earths play Northern Minerals.
Iluka intends to source heavy rare earths essential in modern weapons systems from Northern Minerals for refining 
at Eneabba as part of moves to break China's stranglehold on downstream processing.
Ms King's office said Export Finance Australia managed the $1.25 billion loan to Iluka under the critical minerals 
facility. "EFA has been working closely with Iluka, like it would with any borrower, to assess options and identify 
appropriate solutions for Iluka to address cost increases at its Eneabba project," Ms King's spokesman said.
Iluka shareholders are pushing for guidance on what happens if there is no more funding from the government. The 
company said it would update the market this year either way.

On the face of it, Australia should have a huge advance in the race for critical minerals. Its red centre holds large 
reserves of the minerals and rare earths that are vital for green and military technologies. Its centre-left Labor 
government wants to dig and process more of them. It should be the perfect match.
But Australia is struggling to get its critical minerals out of the ground. A string of its lithium and nickel mines have 
closed this year. Refineries are also in trouble. In July BHP, a mining giant, said it would close its nickel-processing 
facilities in Western Australia. Weeks later, Albemarle, an American company, announced it was scaling back a 
lithium refinery. Ostensibly the problem is a market crash. Demand for electric vehicles, which use these minerals, 
is weaker than expected. And supplies of minerals have soared, driving down prices.
Australian miners see a bigger hand at work. China produces more than half the world's rare earths and refines 
almost all of them. It subsidises rare-earth companies. Where it lacks its own big critical mineral deposits, it has 
invested abroad-including in the Indonesian nickel that is flooding the market. It buys and refines the lion's share of 
lithium. This lets China force down prices, says John Coyne of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
Australia's rare-earth miners are dangerously exposed, complains Tom O'Leary, chief executive of Iluka 
Resources, one such group. In 2022 China issued a directive for its producers to "guide product prices to return to 
rationality". Rare-earth prices have since plunged by more than two-thirds. This makes it hard for competitors to be 
profitable, says Mr O'Leary.
Chinese investors are also accused of using shady methods to secure access to Australian supply chains. Last 
year Australia's government barred a Chinese-linked fund from increasing its stake in Northern Minerals, a miner, 
on national-security grounds. Shares were subsequently purchased by several other funds. After an investigation, 
the government determined that they were linked to China and ordered them to divest their holdings in June.
Page 2 of 2
Why Australia is not yet a critical minerals powerhouse
For Australia, it is not just the potential for lucrative mines at home that China's dominance severely threatens. It's 
also about its own security of supply. China cut off rare-earth exports to Japan during a diplomatic dispute in 2010, 
and curbed exports of gallium and germanium, used in semiconductors, last year. Western countries face "an 
existential risk around security of supply", says Mr O'Leary.
So far, Australia's answer is to support miners with cheap loans and grants. It promises them tax breaks under a 
new industrial policy. But the help only goes so far. The government lent Iluka A$1.25bn ($850m) in 2022 to open a 
rare-earths refinery. On August 21st Iluka declared that it needs more funding to complete the facility. There is still 
a long way to go to end, or even reduce, reliance on China.

Treasury will run the rule over new major shareholders in Northern Minerals after the China-linked fund ordered by 
the federal government to offload the majority of its stake sold out to Hong Kong-registered groups with almost no 
corporate history.
Northern Minerals is key to Labor's plan to start a domestic critical minerals processing industry, with its Browns 
Range project supplying Australia's first fully integrated rare earths refinery being built by Iluka Resources with a 
$1.25 billion government loan.
Those minerals can be used in weapons systems and Australia, along with the United States, is pushing to break 
China's monopoly on processing.
In June, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said he would force Northern Minerals' largest shareholder, Singapore-registered 
Yuxiao Fund, and its associates to sell shares, citing their close connection with Chinese interests.
Ahead of a deadline set by the government, Yuxiao sold its stake to two Hong Kong-registered companies, Qogir 
Trading & Service and Hong Kong Ying Tak. Each now controls 8.4 per cent of Northern Minerals.
But Qogir was only registered in April and has paid up capital of just $HK10,000 ($1892), according to the Hong 
Kong register of company interests. Eight of its nine shareholders live in China; the ninth, its only director, is a 
Chinese citizen.
Ying Tak is also registered in Hong Kong and has issued capital of $HK60 million. It was an investor in Northern 
Minerals before last week's purchase.
Northern Minerals said it wants to meet with its two new shareholders.
A spokesman for Dr Chalmers said the government expected some 165 million shares owned by one of Yuxiao's 
associates which had yet to be sold to be divested quickly.

"The government expects all outstanding share sales to be finalised imminently and will take further action if 
required to protect our national interest in relation to this matter," the spokesman said. "As part of its usual 
processes, Treasury will undertake a full assessment of compliance with the disposal orders."
Treasury's assessment of whether the divestment orders have been followed will include any links between those 
forced to sell and the new shareholders. It will come amid speculation that Dr Chalmers will visit China this month 
for meetings, including with representatives of the National Development and Reform Commission.
Northern Minerals' former executive chairman Nick Curtis raised suspicious share trading and requested the 
Foreign Investment Review Board investigate last year. By the time that Mr Curtis had raised the alarm, Dr 
Chalmers had already blocked Yuxiao from increasing its stake in Northern Minerals to 19.9 per cent.
Mr Curtis quit the board in the face a Yuxiao-led push to have him removed at an extraordinary general meeting 
that was scheduled for June 6.
Dr Chalmers issued his sell down order on June 3 and the following day Northern Minerals informed the market of a 
cybersecurity breach. The breach included the disclosure of corporate, operational and financial information, 
personnel records and shareholder information, with some of it published on the dark web.
The Australian Financial Review reported in November that Yuxiao, which was close to major Chinese rare earths 
players, signed a co-operation deal with China Northern and Shanghai-listed Shenghe Resources in front of 
Communist Party officials.
Northern Minerals shares were trading flat at 2.5¢ yesterday, down from a 12-month high of 4.7¢ in June in the 
aftermath of the divestment order.
Sources with direct knowledge of the transaction said that part of the problem for Yuxiao was the difficulty that 
brokers were having as they tried to sell Northern Mineral shares.
A plunge in price for the key ingredient in wind turbines, electronics and military applications has seen Lynas Rare 
Earths, the world's biggest non-China supplier, withhold a portion of supply from the market this year. The lower 
prices have been linked to softer demand for permanent magnets and to oversupply in China.
The government's push to start a domestic processing industry with the loan to Iluka last month hit a roadblock, 
when the company warned that it would halt work on the refinery unless more funding was given.
The stand-off between Iluka and the government comes amid a delay in Lynas building a US military-backed 
refinery in Texas that is expected to produce heavy rare earths oxides needed in the manufacture of permanent 
magnets. They are essential in modern weapons, including warplanes and nuclear-powered submarines.
Labor has begun taking a harder line on Chinese investment in the critical minerals sector as it looks to grow 
domestic processing and develop supply chains. China dominates global supply of most rare earths materials and 
has a monopoly on the processing of dysprosium and terbium.
The US military, in particular, could be left stranded if China cuts off a supply of dysprosium and terbium.
Last December, China banned the export of rare earth technologies in a move to protect its market dominance.
Northern Minerals has previously ended offtake agreements with Chinese groups in favour of a deal with German 
conglomerate Thyssenkrupp.

Iluka Resources Ltd (ASX:ILU) shares fell 3.7% to a four-month low of A$5.97 following the release of a 
disappointing third-quarter production report, which revealed mineral sands revenue significantly below 
expectations, softer pricing guidance and no update on the funding for its Eneabba refinery project.
Citi analyst Paul McTaggart described the report as "disappointing," citing revenue that fell "well short" of forecasts.
The company's Q3 mineral sands revenue came in at A$232 million, missing McTaggart's A$306 million forecast. 
Total sales of zircon, rutile and synthetic rutile reached 97,000 tonnes, including 59,000 tonnes of zircon, 24,000 
tonnes of which was lower-grade material.
Realised zircon prices dropped 7% quarter-on-quarter, with synthetic rutile prices down 1%, resulting in an overall 
unit revenue decline of 4% for zircon, rutile and synthetic rutile.
Zircon sales in Q4 are anticipated to be impacted by seasonal weakness, with prices forecasted to decline by 
US$40 to US$50 per tonne.
Weighed down by production challenges
Production challenges were also evident at the Jacinth-Ambrosia mine in South Australia, where heavy mineral 
concentrate (HMC) output fell to 52,000 tonnes, down from 80,000 tonnes in the previous quarter due to lower-
grade ore processing.

Iluka shares drop 3.7% on weak Q3 production report
In Western Australia, the Cataby mine produced 159,000 tonnes of HMC, benefiting from a 9% quarter-on-quarter 
increase in ore-treated volumes following the commissioning of a second mining unit.
Iluka's Narngulu mineral separation plant processed material primarily from Jacinth-Ambrosia, producing 69,000 
tonnes of zircon and 10,000 tonnes of rutile. The SR2 kiln yielded 59,000 tonnes of synthetic rutile, which supports 
Iluka's long-term take-or-pay contracts totalling approximately 200,000 tonnes per annum.
Year-to-date, work-in-progress HMC inventory has increased by 193,000 tonnes, primarily from ilmenite-bearing 
concentrate at Cataby. This stockpile is expected to support the potential restart of the SR1 kiln, which remains 
offline.
Eneabba update
While there has been no news on funding Eneabba's refinery, it is still set to become Australia's first fully integrated 
refinery for producing separated rare earth oxides, through a strategic partnership between Iluka Resources and 
the Australian Government. 
As part of this collaboration, Iluka has secured a $1.25 billion non-recourse loan under the Critical Minerals Facility, 
managed by Export Finance Australia.
The project has a capital guidance of $1.7 to $1.8 billion, with ongoing discussions with the government regarding 
funding arrangements. An updated project report is expected in the second half of the year.
During the third quarter, site activities concentrated on advancing critical path items, with capital expenditure 
carefully managed due to the ongoing funding negotiations.
The tendering and awarding of contracts for equipment, fabrication and site work packages continue, with priorities 
based on schedule criticality and overall cost commitments. Recently, contracts for structural steel and pipe racks 
were awarded.

Iluka Resources and the federal government are at loggerheads over the future of a part-built rare earths refinery 
in Western Australia after 10 months of tense negotiations.
Tom O'Leary-led Iluka says it will not finish building the refinery unless it receives more taxpayer funding, in a row 
that has ramifications for the company's plans for new mines in NSW and Victoria.
Iluka wants the extra funding on top of a $1.25bn limited recourse loan from Export Finance Australia after the price 
tag attached to the refinery blew out to $1.7-$1.8bn. The funding stand-off has left investors and Australia's allies in 
the dark.
Iluka's share price fell more than 3 per cent to a four-month low of $5.97 in early trading Tuesday after revenue 
from its core mineral sands in the September quarter came in below market expectations. Investors hoping for an 
update on the refinery were left disappointed. Iluka said talks on its "strategic partnership" with the government 
continued and promised to update the market before the end of 2024.

Iluka Resources and the Albanese government remain at loggerheads over the future of a part-built rare earths 
refinery in Western Australia after 10 months of tense negotiations.
The Tom O'Leary-led Iluka maintains it will not finish building the refinery unless it receives more taxpayer funding, 
in a row that has ramifications for the company's plans for new mines in NSW and Victoria. Iluka wants the extra 
funding on top of a $1.25bn limited recourse loan from Export Finance Australia after the price tag attached to the 
refinery blew out to $1.7bn-$1.8bn.
The funding standoff has left investors and Australia's allies in the dark about the future of the refinery that Iluka 
and former defence minister Kim Beazley have said is vital to security and the energy transition, given China's 
dominance in rare earths supply.
Ilukas shares fell 3.6 per cent to $5.98 on Tuesday after revenue from its core mineral sands in the September 
quarter came in below market expectations.
Investors hoping for an update on the refinery were left disappointed. Iluka said talks around its "strategic 
partnership" with the government continued, and it promised to update the market before the end of the year.
Iluka spent $49m on the refinery in the six months to June 30. It has not provided guidance on spending in the 
second half.
It has cut back work and is holding off on signing major contracts, with funding up in the air.
Citi analysts said it was a disappointing quarter for Iluka, with mineral sands revenue of $232m, well below its 
$306m forecast.
Iluka's zircon, rutile and synthetic rutile sales totalled 97,000 tonnes, with it tipping zircon prices to fall by $US40-
$US50 a tonne in the December quarter despite China's stimulus measures aimed at the property market.
Iluka received an average price of $US1891 for the zircon it shipped in the three months to September 30.

It has a million-tonne stockpile of ore containing rare earths left over from mineral sands mining that underpins the 
business case for the new refinery, but no rare earths mine. Iluka expects to commission a mineral sands-rare 
earths mine at Balranald in NSW next year. It is considering a mine at Wimmera in Victoria for the long-term supply 
of rare earths and zircon.

Highlight: Avonbank mineral sands' company informs farmers their land will be used for a 3,000-hectare mine, 
under compulsorily acquisition powers in Victoria's Mining Act.
Body
After more than 100 years, the Johns family have found their beloved farm in the footprint of a potential new mine.
If it is approved, they won't be able to live in their house for 36 years while mining at WIM Resource's new 
Avonbank mineral sands site is underway because of the noise, lights, vibration and "toxic dust".
Donna Johns said her family's future was on hold.
"The stress that it's caused has been fairly immense … the lack of information too, has been hard on us," she said.
Victoria's Mining Act allows mining companies to compulsorily acquire land once granted a mining licence.
Planning Minister Sonya Kilkenny's office said the project's Environmental Effects Statement was still under review 
— as it has been for more than a year — meaning it was not yet determined whether the mine at Dooen would go 
ahead.
But multiple farmers have told the ABC they've received phone calls from WIM Resource saying it has been 
approved and an announcement would follow.
It means WIM Resource could have the power to compulsorily acquire the Johns family's property for the duration 
of the mine's life.
Fifth-generation farmer Chris Johns's eyes welled up thinking about what could be lost.
"Growing up [here] and spending … times with my father and mum, who passed away a few years ago, this is 
super important to me,” Mr Johns said. 
Page 2 of 3
Devastated farmers told Avonbank mineral sands mine will go ahead on their land
"We own this land and we've worked our guts out to keep what's here.”
Application documents show WIM Resource, a Chinese-backed company, would mine 490 tonnes of ore, pay the 
state $180 million in royalties over the mine's life, and generate nearly $513 million in state revenue annually.
Across Victoria, hundreds of exploration licences have been taken out, while about 30 retention licences have 
staked claims on identified deposits in the Wimmera-Mallee.
The Avonbank project is one of 10 mineral sands projects in various planning stages across the Wimmera-Mallee 
and across the NSW border.
Home of the lentil industry
Andrew Weidemann is the research and development spokesperson for Grain Producers Australia, and a local 
farmer.
"There are only two or three really strong zones in Australia where you can grow lentils," he said.  
Last harvest, Victoria shipped 8.7 million tonnes of grain — including lentils — internationally, according to the 
state's 2024 food and fibre export summary.
Of the $5.6 billion generated, Mr Weidemann estimates about $2 billion came from the Wimmera.
The Avonbank mine plans to extract 12.75 million tonnes of heavy mineral concentrate for export to China, and for 
use in electric vehicles, magnets, wind turbines and ceramics. 
Mining mineral sands also exposes monazite, a naturally occurring radioactive mineral that can be refined into 
uranium. 
Mr Weidemann is on the Avonbank mine's advisory committee and is worried about the potential contamination of 
produce, grain exporting facilities and an agricultural college.
"You couldn't have picked a worse spot even if you tried," he said.
Proponents say regulation is strict
James Sorahan, executive director of the Minerals Council of Australia's Victorian branch, said the environmental 
risk was low because government regulation was strict.
"Rehabilitation and all of these environmental and safety measures are fully integrated into a mine plan before the 
mine is approved," Mr Sorahan said. 
WIM Resource plans to mine a maximum of 400 hectares at any one time before moving onto other holes, so 
previous pits can be rehabilitated.
The company said this technique was less invasive and only three years would be required before mined land could 
be sown again.
WIM Resource grew barley and lentil crops in 2021 and 2022 on a test pit, but local farmers weren't convinced.
Gavin Puls cropped a paddock alongside the test pit and said the company overestimated the results.
"We know what the crop looked like when they harvested it, and [how] ours was going next door, and theirs was 
nowhere near," he said. 
"We deal with dirt everyday so we understand what can grow and what can't."Page 3 of 3
Devastated farmers told Avonbank mineral sands mine will go ahead on their land
Rehabilitation and regulation doubts
Farmers have also pointed to farmland further south at Kanagulk, where ore was mined between 2004 and 2012.
The main pit of Iluka Resources' Douglas mine is still being backfilled after tailings, which included radioactive 
material from other Victorian and interstate mines, were deposited there.
"It [was] supposed to be a moving footprint but that never happened, the whole site was mined," Kanagulk 
Landcare group chair Ian Ross said.
Mr Ross sat on the mine's environmental review committee.
He said large stockpiles of soil were also left on private farmland for 15 years instead of the three years promised, 
compacting the ground underneath and killing off any organic and microbial activity.
He said in other areas, holes being backfilled weren't compacted properly, so the ground sank and made it 
impossible to crop.
Iluka Resources showed the ABC the pit they began rehabilitating 10 years ago.
"A lot of that land that was here prior to us being here was not suitable for agriculture," head of rare earths Daniel 
McGrath said.
He said the company had rehabilitated land in Victoria for 20 years and was confident the private farmland they 
returned to the landholder could be cropped.
"We've handed a closure and completion notice to the landholder so I'm comfortable they're very happy with the 
results," Mr McGrath said.
The property owner who leased the land to Ilukatold the ABC more work needed to be done but declined to 
comment further because they were bound by a confidentiality agreement.
The Victorian government's regulatory arm is the Earth Resources Regulator.
A spokesperson said Iluka's change from a moving hole to a fully open mine was consistent with their 
Environmental Effects Statement.
Mr Ross no longer has faith in the state regulator, given his experience with the Douglas mine.
"For there to be an equitable balance, farmers need to be more empowered than they are," he said.
"You've got a well-oiled machine coming into a community with great resources, and each individual farmer has to 
try look at the Environmental Effects Statement and the science and make sure what they've been told is true."
WIM Resource was contacted for comment but did not respond by deadline.

Chinese interests appear determined to exert influence over Northern Minerals and its strategically important rare 
earths project in Western Australia, -despite two major interventions by Jim Chalmers.
A mystery Chinese businessman came close to snaring a seat on the Northern Minerals board at the company's 
annual general meeting on Friday as the company received a second strike against its remuneration report.
The board power grab came less than three months after the Treasurer's office vowed it would investigate 
compliance with orders aimed at keeping Northern Minerals out of China's grasp.
Almost 48 per cent of shareholders voted in favour of an 11th-hour bid by Enping Fu to become a director, in 
defiance of a recommendation from the Northern Minerals board.
Mr Fu was nominated by two shareholders who had stakes of less than 1 per cent of the stock. Northern Minerals 
said it could not ascertain the ultimate owners of shareholdings.
Northern Minerals told shareholders it had not had an opportunity to conduct usual background checks or been able 
to verify Mr Fu's independence. Mr Fu submitted an outline of his education and experience in Chinese businesses 
in support of his nomination but did not give any other details.
Speaking after the meeting, Northern Minerals managing director Shane Hartwig said the company had been 
unable to contact one of the new major shareholders which came on board after Dr Chalmers ordered a China-
linked fund to offload the majority of its stake.
It is understood Treasury is investigating the entities that purchased the shares divested by the Singapore-
registered Yuxiao Fund.
Yuxiao sold its stake to two Hong Kong-registered companies, Qogir Trading & Service and Hong Kong Ying Tak, 
which each now controls about 8.4 per cent of Northern Minerals. Mr Hartwig said Northern Minerals had been 
unable to establish any contact with Qogir.
Page 2 of 2

The Hong Kong register of company interests shows Qogir was only registered in April and had paid capital of just 
$HK10,000 ($1970).
Ying Tak, also registered in Hong Kong, was an investor in Northern Minerals before buying some of the stock 
Yuxiao was forced to divest. Yuxiano took out a full-page advertisement in The Australian on October 29 to say it 
had fully withdrawn from the Australian investment market but continued to be positive about Chinese-Australian 
co-operation in critical minerals.
Mr Hartwig said he could not comment on whether Treasury, which has responsibly for the Foreign Investment 
Review Board, had requested information from Northern Minerals about the new shareholders.
Asked about the strong support for Mr Fu, Mr Hartwig said: "It's hard for me to comment in -relation to why 
shareholders vote the way they do. The numbers are what the numbers are and he received 48 per cent support." 
Northern Minerals is strategically important as a source of heavy rare earths from its Browns Range projects about 
160km east of Halls Creek in WA. Two heavy rare earths - dysprosium and terbium - are essential for modern 
weapons systems, including guided missiles - and Australia, along with the US, is pushing to break China's 
monopoly on processing.
Northern Minerals has an offtake deal to supply Iluka Resources, which has received $1.25bn in taxpayer funding 
to build Australia's first fully integrated rare earths refinery but is at loggerheads with the federal government over 
additional funding.
Northern Minerals' former executive chairman, Nick Curtis, last year raised the alarm about suspicious share 
trading and requested a FIRB investigation.
Dr Chalmers had previously blocked Yuxiao from increasing its stake to 19.9 per cent. Mr Curtis eventually quit the 
board in the face of agitation from Yuxiao.
Dr Chalmers intervened for a second time on June 3, ordering Yuxiao to sell down its stake. The following day 
Northern Minerals told shareholders of a cybersecurity breach that involved corporate, operational and financial 
information, personnel records and shareholder information.
Mr Hartwig on Friday said Northern Minerals was the rarest of all rare earths projects based on the high levels of 
dysprosium and terbium in its Browns Range deposit.
The company is trying to raise about $620m needed to develop Browns Range and is in discussions about funding 
through the Northern Australian Infrastructure Facility and Export Finance Australia, and with Iluka. Northern 
Minerals closed flat at 2c on Friday.

The Australian government has put China on notice that it will take more action to protect the national interest when 
it comes to a strategically important rare earths project in Western Australia.
The warning came amid evidence of Chinese interests continuing to try to exert influence over ASX-listed Northern 
Minerals despite two previous major interventions by federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers.
Treasury, which has responsibility for the Foreign Investment Review Board, is investigating whether five China-
linked entities have complied with an order to divest shares in Northern Minerals.
The divestment deadline passed at the start of August but events at the Northern Minerals annual general meeting 
last Friday set off more alarm bells in Canberra. A mystery Chinese businessman came within a whisker of securing 
a seat on the Northern Minerals board as the company revealed it had been unable to contact a Hong Kong-
registered entity that became a major shareholder in the wake of the divestment order.
A Treasury spokesman said the government closely monitored compliance with foreign investment legislation to 
protect the national interest and national security. "Treasury is undertaking a full assessment of Northern Minerals' 
compliance with the disposal orders," he said.
"The government will take further action if required to protect our national interest in relation to this matter." The 
latest row over Chinese involvement in Northern Minerals comes with the company in talks with the taxpayer-
funded Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility and Export Finance Australia about funding to develop its Brown 
Range heavy rare earths deposit near Halls Creek in WA.
The Treasury investigation and latest red flags around shareholders have added complexity to tense negotiations 
between the government and Iluka Resources over the future of Australia's first fully integrated rare earths refinery 
at Eneabba in WA.
The government and Iluka have been at a stalemate for almost 12 months over additional funding on top of a 
$1.25bn limited recourse loan from Export Finance Australia to finish the part-built refinery.

Red flags: Canberra warning to China on rare earths project
Iluka managing director Tom O'Leary has made it clear the company will not finish building the refinery without 
more government funding.
If the refinery does go ahead, Iluka intends to source heavy rare earths essential in modern weapons systems from 
Northern Minerals for refining at Eneabba as part of moves to break China's stranglehold on downstream 
processing. Iluka has told the market it will provide an update on the refinery project before the end of December.
It is understood the ongoing Treasury investigation into Northern Minerals includes the entities that purchased 
shares -divested by Singapore-registered Yuxiao Fund.
Yuxiao sold its stake to two Hong Kong-registered -companies, Qogir Trading & Service and Hong Kong Ying Tak, 
which each now controls about 8.4 per cent of Northern Minerals.
Northern Minerals has been unable to establish contact with Qogir. The Hong Kong register of company interests 
shows Qogir was only registered in April with paid-up capital of just $HK10,000 ($1970).
Ying Tak, also registered in Hong Kong, was an investor in Northern Minerals before buying some of the stock 
Yuxiao was forced to divest.
Yuxiano took out a full-page ad in The Australian on October 29 to say it had fully withdrawn from the Australian 
investment market but remained positive about Chinese-Australian co-operation in critical minerals.
Northern Minerals is strategically important as a source of heavy rare earths from its Browns Range projects about 
160km east of Halls Creek in WA. Two heavy rare earths - dysprosium and terbium - are essential for modern 
weapons systems, including guided missiles, and Australia, along with the US, is pushing to break China's 
monopoly on processing.
Northern Minerals has an offtake deal to supply Iluka Resources, which has received $1.25bn in taxpayer funding 
to build Australia's first fully integrated rare earths refinery but is at loggerheads with the government over additional 
funding. In 2023 Northern Minerals' former executive chairman, Nick Curtis, raised the alarm about suspicious 
share trading and requested a FIRB investigation.
Dr Chalmers had previously blocked Yuxiao from increasing its stake to 19.9 per cent.
Mr Curtis eventually quit the board in the face of agitation from Yuxiao. Dr Chalmers intervened for a second time 
on June 3, ordering Yuxiao to sell down its stake. The following day Northern Minerals told shareholders of a 
cybersecurity breach that involved corporate, operational and financial information, personnel records and 
shareholder information. Mr Hartwig said last week that Northern Minerals was the rarest of all rare earths projects 
based on the high levels of dysprosium and terbium in its Browns Range deposit.

Highlight: The funding is aimed at increasing the domestic refining of critical minerals, which are key to 
technologies used in the transition to green energy.
Body
Mining giant Iluka Resources will receive nearly half a billion dollars in finance from taxpayers to develop a rare 
earths refinery, as part of the federal government's efforts to set up a critical minerals supply chain independent of 
China.
The $475 million — mostly in the form of a loan — will see Iluka's Eneabba refinery produce rare earth oxides at an 
existing industrial facility south of Geraldton in Western Australia.
Rare earth oxides are used in advanced manufacturing of a wide range of items, including electronic devices, 
batteries, magnets, metal alloys, medical devices and defence weaponry.
China has a near monopoly on the processing of critical minerals, prompting Australia and other nations to invest 
more in setting up refineries domestically to reduce reliance on China.
The funding for Iluka Resources comes from the government's $4 billion Critical Minerals Facility, which provides 
low-interest loans to miners and processors of critical minerals such as cobalt, lithium, nickel, manganese and rare 
earths.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was in Western Australia to announce the investment, describing it as a "really 
practical example of what we're talking about when we're talking about wanting a future made here in Australia".
"If we get this right, if we get the transition to net zero, take up the opportunities that are there in areas like rare 
earths and critical minerals, then we can be even more prosperous in the future.
Page 2 of 2

"But it will take a government facilitating that private sector investment."
Iluka Resources chief executive Tom O'Leary described the funding deal as an example of where "our own 
commercial objectives … have been aligned with the policy objectives of the Australian government".
"In Australia, and particularly Western Australia, we export a lot of minerals but in terms of value addition and 
processing minerals, particularly critical minerals, I think we've often fallen well short of our ambition."
Resources Minister Madeleine King said the Eneabba refinery would support jobs locally and improve Australia's 
sovereign manufacturing capabilities.
"The Iluka rare earths refinery will be one of a ribbon of rare earth refineries going right across the continent, that 
together, will lessen Australia's reliance on a single supply chain," she said.
"China is ahead of the game. They've invested in critical minerals and rare earths and solar panels and green 
technologies for 30 years. I take my hat off to that investment. So, we need to step up."

The Albanese government will have the power to prevent sales to China after stumping up an additional $400m to 
help Iluka Resources complete Australia's first fully integrated rare earths refinery.
The new funding is on top of a $1.25bn limited recourse loan from Export Finance Australia (EFA) issued to Iluka in 
the dying days of the Morrison government.
The deal to end a tense standoff with Iluka is subject to the company securing offtake agreements satisfactory to 
the government, which has already intervened several times to prevent China extending its rare earths dominance 
to assets in Australia.
The new terms of the loan agreement include a financial incentive for Iluka to source rare earths from third-parties 
or its own new rare earths mines. Iluka has been in talks with government and EFA about additional funding for 
more than 12 months, with the company's managing director, Tom O'Leary, threatening to stop work on the refinery 
at Eneabba in WA without more financial backing.
Mr Albanese was in WA on Friday to coincide with Iluka revealing the latest funding injection to shareholders.
Former defence minister Kim Beazley was among those who maintain the refinery was vital to Australia's security 
and energy transition, as well as the government's critical minerals future and its Made in Australia policy, with rare 
earths essential in modern weapons systems as well as in the renewables and electronics industries.
Iluka revealed earlier this year the cost of building the refinery had blown out to $1.7bn-$1.8bn after previously 
alerting the market the price tag was much higher than initial estimates. The project is underpinned by a million-
tonne stockpile of ore containing rare earths left over from Iluka's mineral sands mining which is sufficient to feed 
the refinery until the early 2030s. Iluka also has an offtake deal with Northern Minerals for the supply of heavy rare 
earths dysprosium and terbium from its Browns Range project in WA.
The government is still investigating whether five China-linked entities have complied with an order to divest shares 
in Northern Minerals. Treasury also put Chinese interests on notice it could take more action to protect national

interests over the strategically important rare earths project, on top of two previous interventions by Treasurer Jim 
Chalmers.
Iluka will contribute an additional $214m in cash to building the refinery under the new government funding deal.
The Iluka share price closed 10 per cent lower at $4.93, with question marks about its share of the refinery funding.
Perth-based Iluka reported net cash of $154m at June 30. Iluka said it was focused on securing "commercially-
attractive supply agreements for the benefit of all stakeholders" in the refinery.

Labor has cleared the path to the country's first rare earths refinery after agreeing to lend its developer an additional 
$400 million, breaking a long impasse about who should cover a major cost blowout at the project.
But shares in the developer, ASX-listed Iluka, crashed almost 11 per cent to a four-year low on Friday after it 
agreed to cover a portion of the cost blowout on the Eneabba project in Western Australia, which was originally 
expected to cost around $1.2 billion when it was approved in April 2022. The refinery will make separated rare earth 
oxides and is a key plank in the Albanese government's plan to break China's stranglehold on critical minerals by 
processing minerals locally.
Discussion over how to fund the cost blowouts took more than a year, but was resolved on Friday when the 
government's Export Finance Australia agency agreed to lend the extra $400 million towards the project.
The new financing is in addition to the original $1.25 billion loan facility offered by EFA in the final weeks of the 
Morrison government in 2022.
Iluka will contribute an extra $214 million of cash to cover its share of the blowouts. The company's accounts show 
it had cash of just over $154 million on June 30, down from almost $343 million a year earlier.
But investors are concerned that the miner may have difficulties funding its share of the refinery blowouts and fear 
Iluka may struggle to make a profit from the Eneabba refinery once it is completed and operating.
Iluka managing director Tom O'Leary said the company was unlikely to sell its 19.99 per cent stake in Deterra 
Royalties to raise the funds. The stake in Deterra was worth about $400 million on Friday. Friday's slump means 
Iluka's value slipped below that of Deterra, which it spun off in 2020.
While EFA's original $1.25 billion loan did not come with any conditions around offtake, yesterday's deal was 
contingent on Iluka striking agreements to sell the refinery's product only to customers deemed "satisfactory" to the 
federal government.
Mr O'Leary said offtake agreements would likely be struck closer to completion of construction at Eneabba.

Iluka snares loan for rare earth refinery; Critical minerals
The government is likely to want Iluka's customers to be from "like-minded" nations such as South Korea, Japan, 
the US and Britain, given the rationale for the taxpayer-funded investment was to break China's stranglehold on 
processing of rare earths such as neodymium, praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium.
Global demand for those four elements was about 78,000 tonnes in 2024, but Iluka predicts demand will rise to at 
least 113,000 tonnes by 2034 and could be as high as 209,000 tonnes.
Prices for neodymium and praseodymium were weak around $US48 a kilogram in the three months to September; 
a price at which many analysts believe the Eneabba project will struggle to be profitable.
JPMorgan analyst Al Harvey told his clients last month that he expected Eneabba would deliver negative returns if 
neodymium and praseodymium prices averaged $US80 per kilogram long term, adding that Iluka shares would 
benefit if the entire processing project was abandoned.
But Iluka believes China has used its market power to depress rare earths prices on the Asian Metal Index, and Mr 
O'Leary said customers would eventually pay much higher prices for Eneabba's product to ensure a supply chain 
that avoids China, which has a stranglehold on much of the product.
Iluka cited forecasts by Adamas Intelligence which suggests neodymium and praseodymium would fetch closer to 
$US160 per kilogram by 2034.
"This is a strategic infrastructure asset that puts Iluka and Australia at the forefront of global electrification, the 
creation of new and resilient critical minerals supply chains and the establishment of a rare earths industry that is 
genuinely independent," said Mr O'Leary.
The Eneabba refinery was originally supposed to deliver first production in 2025, but Iluka delayed the schedule to 
2026 when it disclosed the blowouts in December last year. The company revealed another slip in the schedule on 
Friday when it said commissioning of the refinery was expected in 2027.
The refinery would run for nine years if it processed only the monazite stockpile at Eneabba and ore from Iluka's 
mine at Balranald in NSW.
But Iluka plans to supplement those feedstocks with additional sources of ore from third parties such as explorer 
Northern Minerals and from its own proposed mine in Victoria's Wimmera.
Rare earths are used to make the industrial magnets inside EVs, and in technology used in defence and the 
transition to clean energy.
"Not only are critical minerals and rare earths key to the energy transition, they are essential to the defence industry 
and our national security," Resources Minister Madeleine King said. "We stand at an important moment in time 
where the world wants what we have and we just happen to have the most advanced mining sector in the world."

The Albanese government will have the power to prevent sales to China after stumping up an additional $400m to 
help Iluka Resources complete Australia's first fully integrated rare earths -refinery.
The new funding is on top of a $1.25bn limited recourse loan from Export Finance Australia (EFA) that was issued 
to Iluka in the dying days of the Morrison government.
The deal to end a tense standoff with Iluka is subject to the company securing offtake agreements satisfactory to 
the government, which has already intervened several times to prevent China extending its rare earths dominance 
to assets in Australia.
While the offtake clause doesn't mention China by name, it is clearly intended to ensure rare earths oxides from the 
West Australian refinery go to Western allies even if the market appears limited by a lack of downstream capacity at 
this point.
The Iluka share price plunged 10 per cent to $4.93 - its lowest level in more than four years - amid analyst and 
investor doubts about the economics of the project. Iluka is banking on demand growth and a new pricing 
mechanism involving customers in Western nations.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Resources Minister Madeline King yesterday highlighted China's dominance 
of the strategically important rare earths supply chain in talking about the $1.65bn funding package alongside Iluka 
managing director Tom O'Leary.
Asked if the government risked inflaming tension with China, Ms King said Australia had to develop independent 
supply chains.
"I think we need to be clear, and people need to understand, that China's ahead of the game," she said.
"They've invested in critical minerals and rare earths and solar panels and green technologies for 30 years. We 
need to step up and make sure we're competing as well." China raised fears around rare earths supply this week by 
banning exports of three critical minerals to the US.

The move on gallium, germanium and antimony - all used in military applications - appeared in retaliation over the 
latest US crackdown on China's semiconductor industry.
The new terms of government's increased funding agreement include a financial incentive for Iluka to source rare 
earths from third parties or its own new rare earths mines.
Iluka has been in talks with government and EFA about additional funding for more than 12 months, with Mr 
O'Leary threatening to stop work on the refinery at Eneabba in WA without more financial backing.
The company hailed the new government finance package as the biggest for a critical mineral project anywhere in 
the world.
Former defence minister Kim Beazley is among those who maintain the refinery is vital to Australia's security and 
energy transition. It is also central to the government's critical minerals ambitions and Made in Australia policy, with 
rare earths essential in modern weapons systems as well as in the renewables and electronics industries.
Iluka revealed earlier this year the cost of building the refinery had blown out to $1.7bn-$1.8bn, after previously 
alerting the market the price tag was much higher than initial estimates.
The project is underpinned by a million-tonne stockpile of ore containing rare earths left over from Iluka's mineral 
sands mining, which is sufficient to feed the refinery until the early 2030s.
Iluka warned earlier this year it was under pressure from some shareholders to monetise the stockpile by selling it 
to China.
Mr O'Leary said on Friday the new funding arrangements were an "appropriate sharing of risk and the alignment of 
commercial and policy objectives".
Iluka also has an offtake deal with Northern Minerals for the supply of heavy rare earths dysprosium and terbium 
from its Browns Range project in WA.
The Australian recently revealed the government is still investigating whether five China-linked entities have 
complied with an order to divest shares in Northern Minerals.
Treasury also put Chinese interests on notice it could take more action to protect national interests over the 
strategically important rare earths project, on top of two previous interventions by Treasurer Jim Chalmers.
Mr O'Leary repeated his fierce criticism of China's influence over rare earths on Friday, accusing it of using the Asia 
Metals Index to manipulate pricing to nobble projects in Australia.
He said Iluka planned to commission the refinery in 2027.
Iluka will contribute an additional $214m in cash to building the refinery. Iluka and the government also agreed to 
set up a $150m cost overrun facility on a 50/50 basis.

The failed campaign to hand Australian nickel a so-called green premium is barely over. But politicians and miners 
are already making a fresh bet that foreign customers will voluntarily pay overs for our critical minerals.
That much was clear from Friday's Eneabba rare earths update. The refinery is now the recipient of the second-
biggest taxpayer loan in history after receiving an additional $400 million from Export Finance Australia.
Taxpayers are now lending a total of $1.65 billion to a project that will struggle to make a profit if rare earths prices 
stay at current levels.
To be successful, the Eneabba project and its developer, Iluka Resources, need a revolution to sweep through the 
mining industry and change everything about how rare earths are priced.
It's a bold bet, and it has split the investment community between those, such as JP Morgan analyst Al Harvey, who 
wish it were abandoned, and those, such as Goldman Sachs analyst Paul Young, who believe the refinery, which 
will be one of the first in the country, will be a strategically valuable asset.
Iluka managing director Tom O'Leary is the ring-leader of the revolution, arguing that China has used its market 
power to depress the rare earths prices quoted on the major price discovery venue: the Asian Metal Index.
O'Leary reckons the AMI should be disregarded, and he has publicly lobbied rare earths rivals such as Lynas to 
cease giving the index credibility by selling their product on contracts that link to the index. Iluka is the owner of the 
Eneabba refinery, and O'Leary spent Friday's call justifying a business case for the refinery that assumed long-term 
prices for neodymium and praseodymium would average between $US82 and $US148 per kilogram; well above the 
$US58 per kilogram price quoted on AMI.
"The consequence of having to go with AMI is that the whole industry is losing money, so thus the importance and 
the general acceptance I think in the industry that we need to break away from an AMI linkage," he said.
"We must find a new pricing dynamic for the sale of rare earths into this more open, Western supply chain."
Page 2 of 2
Taxpayers have bet $1.65b on a rare earths premium
O'Leary's alternative vision is for rare earths to be sold on bilateral contracts that allow non-Chinese miners to 
receive higher prices, while the non-Chinese customers get security of supply in an era where China wields 
influence by occasionally starving rival nations of the metals they need for their manufacturing industries.
"It is really landing with customers and with the rest of the industry, so I am confident we will get those [better-priced 
sale contracts] in place with plenty of time," said O'Leary.
The French government's top bureaucrat for strategic minerals, Benjamin Gallezot, visited Australia in October and 
said European carmakers would need to be protected from the extreme peaks in commodity price cycles if, in 
exchange, Australian miners wanted a special premium to help them survive periods of weak prices.
"You can't have a system that walks just one way," he said.
So, will the rare earths pricing revolution happen? It is easy to be pessimistic after an 18-month period in which the 
hubristic exceptionalism of the Australian critical minerals sector has been punctured.
Local nickel miners no longer speak with certainty that they will receive a "green premium" to reflect their lower 
carbon footprint. Electric vehicle makers such as Tesla have shown they are willing to buy the cheap nickel coming 
out of Indonesia, even if it causes more harm to the landscape.
Local lithium miners also spend less time talking about the Inflation Reduction Act these days, after realising the 
fine detail of the eligibility criteria means most of them won't qualify for a subsidy because of links to Chinese 
investors or processors.
But unlike the green premium sought by nickel and lithium miners for their environmental attributes, O'Leary's pitch 
for a premium is more khaki green because it is based on the threat of war, or at least a protracted cold war.
If China can control the supply of neodymium, praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium, it can limit Western nations' 
ability to make defence equipment such as night-vision goggles and fighter jets.
While the environmental policies that stoked talk of a "green premium" may have lost momentum, there is no sign 
that geopolitical tensions between China and the US are easing.
The past month has seen President-elect Donald Trump talk up a new round of tariffs, while China last week placed 
fresh curbs on the export of critical minerals such as gallium and germanium. Those headlines are grist for the mill 
in O'Leary's push for a rare earths pricing revolution.
Export Finance Australia has given itself a little bit of protection in case O'Leary's price revolution doesn't eventuate; 
the extra $400 million pledged can only be drawn down after Iluka strikes offtake agreements. In other words, the 
government has told Iluka it must crystallise its price revolution into a sales contract before it gets any more 
taxpayer funds.
The clock is now ticking, and O'Leary has about two years before he needs to deliver. Vive la revolution.

A buoyant Western Australia might still be crucial to Anthony Albanese's election hopes, but the mood in the state's 
mining industry has changed considerably since 2022.
That goes well beyond the collapse in the global price of lithium and nickel, which has led to the shutdown of lithium 
and nickel mines and processing - from projects owned by BHP to the usual cast of WA resources billionaires.
Just a couple of years ago, optimism about Australia's future as a global supplier of critical minerals had created a 
surge of enthusiasm about the potential of domestic processing and manufacturing jobs.
Federal Labor politicians such as Albanese and state politicians like WA Premier Roger Cook, who was the then 
state resources minister, promoted Australia's potential in advanced chemical processing and "value-added" 
manufacturing, including batteries and other complex products, rather than just selling raw resources to China.
However, the complications and costs of critical minerals production coincided unhappily with falling prices for most 
of these products. The surging price of gold, along with the staple of iron ore, has helped WA compensate for the 
elusive nature of such options.
Yet traditional gold production, although highly lucrative, is different to the early 2020s vision of a green revolution 
and advanced technology creating an ever-expanding need for Australia's range of critical minerals, including rare 
earths.
The Morrison government was never quite so seduced by the lure of new manufacturing industries based on the 
energy transition, but it was still willing to place some sizeable bets on their progress.
The biggest - as one of its last acts - was a $1.25 billion loan to Iluka Resources to build a rare earths refinery at 
Eneabba, north of Perth.
The project is now an object lesson in the pitfalls as well as the potential for Australia's ambitions in critical 
minerals.

Critical minerals dream meets reality Page Two
Unsurprisingly, the construction of the refinery has not gone to plan, budget or timetable. This created a protracted 
stalemate with the Albanese government over the need for additional funding to finish the building work.
This has been resolved - at least for the moment - with an agreement between the government and Iluka this 
month for a $400 million loan from Export Finance Australia.
The additional money is contingent on Iluka selling its product to customers considered "satisfactory" by the 
government. That is polite cover for not selling to China.
That's because the primary reason for the government's interest is the attempt to create alternative sources of 
supply to what is effectively Chinese control of the rare earths industry, as part of that country's global dominance in 
critical minerals processing in general.
That's not just important to Australia, of course. There's a belated recognition by the US and the rest of the West 
that China has been far more strategic about building on its strengths in this area over decades.
Its competitive edge in technology, experience and funding has also included regularly suppressing prices by 
dramatically increasing supply to limit unwanted competition or to demonstrate an ability to punish opponents.
The bottom line for Australia is that critical minerals production - let alone processing - is becoming only more 
difficult given the sharply reduced prices compounding the high costs, the financial and technical complications and 
the delays in approvals for any project here.
US lithium giant Albemarle is curbing output from its new lithium hydroxide plant in WA not only because of the 
dramatic fall in lithium prices but also because it has more competitive options elsewhere.
Unlike Western Australia's major export commodity of iron ore, critical minerals cannot rely on huge scale and 
efficiency of production to deliver viable projects. The complexity of mining and processing, often of relatively small 
quantities, makes for a very different business case and style of operation.
The hope that Western companies or countries would be willing to pay a "green premium" is yet to be realised in 
practice. Despite frequent rhetoric about ensuring "security of supply" by creating an alternative supply to challenge 
China's stranglehold, there's also little evidence of the market's willingness to pay a "national security premium" 
either.
The rare earths industry is no exception to this reluctance to invest in projects that are at best marginal or more 
commonly loss-making at current prices. Iluka Resources has delayed the opening of the refinery until 2027. But 
most mining or processing projects in Australia are on an indefinite hold anyway, especially given the country's 
increasing hesitation about accepting any further Chinese investment.
Although Japan has been more willing to risk long-term capital, the replacement of Chinese investment with US and 
European money is extremely elusive.
That hesitation is despite China's obvious willingness to retaliate against US tariffs and trade bans by increasing 
restrictions on crucial supplies of critical minerals such as rare earths even before Donald Trump takes office.
After the Biden administration recently expanded export restrictions on chip-making equipment and sanctioned 
more Chinese companies from trading with companies from the US or its allies, the Chinese announced new 
measures on exports to the US with "dual use" civilian and military applications.
This included banning the export to the US of rare earth minerals such as gallium, germanium and antimony, all 
important for military, industrial and semiconductor production.
Backers of projects such as Iluka Resources' refinery, including the Australian government, can only rely on such 
tensions eventually leading to a commitment to pay higher prices or negotiate profitable, long-term contracts for 
non-Chinese suppliers.Page 3 of 3
Critical minerals dream meets reality Page Two
The additional $400 million government loan, for example, is dependent on Iluka Resources signing offtake 
agreements with customers in what are diplomatically called "like-minded nations".
When and whether that happens is an even bigger bet on the future.

The rare earths company that has won $1 billion in taxpayer funding is banking on foreign customers paying over 
the odds for Australian-refined critical minerals in the hope of loosening China's stranglehold over the market, but 
analysts have raised doubts about the plan.
Arafura Rare Earths' bid to build a $1.7 billion mine and refinery in the Northern Territory received a boost 
yesterday after it landed a $200 million equity investment from the Albanese government's National Reconstruction 
Fund. The government had already extended $840 million in loans to help the Gina Rinehart-backed company 
develop its Nolans project outside Alice Springs.
Arafura's shares closed up 17 per cent at 14¢ yesterday, giving the miner a market capitalisation of $320 million. Its 
shares are down 16 per cent over the past year.
When it is up and running, the venture will produce neodymium and praseodymium - rare earths used in the 
manufacture of magnets found in electric vehicles and wind turbines.
Arafura chief executive Darryl Cuzzubbo said the company had already agreed to binding offtake deals with 
customers prepared to pay a premium above the current price for various rare earths to avoid sourcing the minerals 
from China.
"When we're talking to our customers, it's all about supply security and not about price," he said. "Consequently, 
we've got floors in our contracts that are materially above the current pricing, and that meets some of our conditions 
required by our lenders.
"This demonstrates that customers are more concerned about supply security than pricing, per se."
China controls more than 80 per cent of rare earths production, and governments including in the United States, the 
European Union, Canada, Japan and Australia are working to wrest away Beijing's grip on the supply of critical 
minerals during the global energy transition.

Doubts raised over $1b rare earths bet
However, rare earths prices are in the doldrums after China used its dominance to depress the market and cut 
competition, forcing Arafura and rival Iluka to go cap-in-hand for government backing.
And the theory that foreign customers will pay more for Australian minerals also came undone in the failed 
campaign by mining billionaire Andrew Forrest to sell local nickel at a "green premium" compared with the 
commodity produced by less environmentally friendly regimes overseas.
Bell Potter mining analyst Regan Burrows said that despite a lot of talk about the prospect of a "non-China" 
premium across various commodities, it had not eventuated.
"Good luck to Arafura if they can achieve it," he said
Mr Burrows noted that rival Australian producer Lynas was not receiving such a premium for its rare earths.
"There might be a security or supply angle that more than outweighs the cost ... but I want to see proof," he aid.
Last month, Labor agreed to an additional $400 million of loans to help ASX-listed Iluka develop the country's first 
rare earths refinery, also on the assumption of a "non-China" premium.
Al Harvey, a mining analyst at JPMorgan, was sceptical that such a pricing differential would eventuate.
"How do you value the strategic elements of rare earths? There still seems to be a view that there will be an ex-
China premium, but I can't see it happening until we get an ex-China supply chain developed, and I think that's a 
much longer-dated phenomenon to play out," he said.
Hancock Prospecting - the private company controlled by Mrs Rinehart, Australia's richest person - is the largest 
shareholder in Arafura with an 8.6 per cent stake.
Industry Minister Ed Husic acknowledged the current low price of rare earths, but said the Nolans project would 
create hundreds of jobs and give Australia a strategic foothold in the industry.
"At this point in time, prices aren't anything to brag about. If they change, then [Nolans] is something that puts us in 
a position to meet global demand," he said.
Arafura has signed offtake agreements that account for roughly half the expected production from the first phase of 
the Nolans ramp-up, Mr Cuzzubbo said. Customers include South Korean electric vehicle maker Hyundai and 
European wind turbine group Siemens Gamesa.

The sharemarket closed higher yesterday as a bumper day for technology stocks outweighed steep losses in 
Australian mining companies.
The S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.3 per cent, or 27.4 points, to 8429.8, with seven of the sharemarket's 11 sectors 
closing higher. The All Ordinaries climbed by a similar amount.
Technology stocks were set for a good day after Netflix posted its biggest quarterly subscription gain in history in 
after-hours US trading, sending the shares soaring 15.8 per cent.
That risk-on sentiment for tech accelerated in afternoon trading after US President Donald Trump announced a joint 
venture to fund artificial intelligence infrastructure worth billions of dollars, in a bid to strengthen the country's 
development of the emerging technology.
"Stocks, crypto assets and gold have continued to float higher after Donald Trump's first day," Moomoo market 
strategist Jessica Amir said. "Netflix showed its biggest gain in history ... zooming out, this suggests perhaps 
wonderful things to come from big tech stocks reporting next week."
On the ASX, WiseTech leapt 2 per cent to $122.46, NextDC 2.2 per cent to $16.09 and Technology One 2 per cent 
to $29.80. The ASX's technology sector closed 2.4 per cent higher.
Meanwhile, news that US officials were considering a 10 per cent tariff on China triggered a sell-off in iron ore 
giants, which are reliant on Chinese sales. In Singapore, the benchmark iron ore futures contract fell 1 per cent to 
$US103.75 a tonne. BHP dropped 2 per cent to $39.80 and Fortescue lost 1.8 per cent at $19.03.
Paladin Energy and Boss Energy were the index's biggest gainers. The uranium miners extended gains after Trump 
signalled on Tuesday that he would move quickly to impose tariffs on Canada - the US' largest foreign supplier of 
uranium. Paladin jumped 10.1 per cent to $9.19 and Boss gained 14.2 per cent to $3.22.
Iluka Resources posted the biggest loss, falling 7 per cent to $4.95, as the tariff news prompted a sell-off in mined 
metals. This is despite Iluka reporting a 23.7 per cent increase in output in the December quarter.

Bubs Australia soared 22.5 per cent to 12¢ after the company reported a turnaround in first-half earnings, with 
EBITDA hitting $2.9 million after a $6.8 million loss in the same period last year.
Woodside fell 1.9 per cent to $25.25, dragging the energy sector lower. The oil and gas producer reported record 
output for 2024 but said production in the most recent quarter fell 3 per cent due to seasonal demand.
Qantas rallied 3.7 per cent to $9.38 after the airline announced a shake-up of its loyalty scheme - leading to more 
expensive flights for frequent flyers.
West African Resources rose 1.5 per cent to $1.66 after the gold producer posted a quarter-on-quarter increase in 
production, with output meeting full-year expectations.
And Generation Development advanced 5.2 per cent after the superannuation provider reported a 22 per cent rise 
in net inflows.

Highlight: Australian firms are within a few years of refining most of the rare minerals used in the world's critical 
defence systems, electric vehicles and clean energy transition.
Body
Australian firms are edging closer to breaking China's production stranglehold on the rare minerals used in the 
world's critical defence systems, electric vehicles and clean energy transition.
Companies like Iluka Resources, Lynas Rare Earths, and several lithium miners are already refining, or close to 
producing, the minerals needed for the batteries, electric circuitry and high-strength magnets that underpin the 
globe's green energy transition.
Light rare earth oxides, such as neodymium and praseodymium, are used in aircraft engines, electronics, wind 
turbines and electric vehicles. Heavy rare earths, like the dysprosium and terbium over which China has a 
stranglehold, are a crucial element in the permanent high-strength magnets used in robotics, defence technology 
and ocean wind turbines, where they require little maintenance to generate electricity far from the coastline.
The minerals refined by Australian companies are now a strategic asset as America swings sharply towards a more 
transactional trade stance under US President Donald Trump, and Beijing counters US tariffs by clamping down on 
supply of scarce metals.
If Australia is dragged into a trade war with the US and China, "heavy rare earths could serve as a bargaining chip," 
said Neha Mukherjee, a senior analyst in rare earths at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.
Within hours of Trump imposing a 10 per cent tariff on China last week, Beijing introduced export controls on a raft 
of key minerals such as tungsten, tellurium, molybdenum, bismuth and indium that are critical to a range of high-
tech goods. China's Commerce Ministry said the controls were to "safeguard national security interests."
The clampdown exposes a fault line running through the global economy.
China has invested heavily for decades in refining production of critical minerals and rare earths and accounts for 
90 per cent of all rare earth oxides used in global manufacturing, effectively controlling all supply of key heavy rare 
earths. Governments around the world are scrambling to secure supplies of the key minerals, as a result.

"Rare earths are among very few metals where China has demonstrated a preparedness to withhold supply to 
achieve unrelated political or other objectives. We've also seen China previously implement restrictions on the 
export of rare earth processing technology," Iluka managing director Tom O'Leary said.
"We've all seen the perils of concentrated supply chain over the last several years, and so there's much greater 
awareness now of the importance of security of supply," O'Leary said.
Iluka is building a fully integrated rare earths refinery at Eneabba in Western Australia with the help of a $1.65 
billion federal government loan. Within a decade of firing up the plant in 2027, it will account for 10 per cent the 
world's rare earth oxide supply, and refine more than a third of globe's strategically important heavy rare earth 
oxides, the company says.
We're seeing critical minerals being used more and more as bargaining chips in trade negotiations, with countries 
leveraging their control over supply chains to get a better deal
Cameron Perks, analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.
Meanwhile, ASX-listed Lynas - valued at $6.5 billion - late last year turned on production at its newly built $800 
million mixed rare-earth processing plant in Kalgoorlie. It will ship the carbonate output from Kalgoorlie for further 
refining in Malaysia where it operates the world's largest single rare earths processing plant producing separated 
rare earths for export.
Lynas is also building a heavy rare earths refinery in Texas, backed by $384 million in Defence Department funding 
from the Biden administration, in a bid to accelerate America's access to supplies of rare earths.
Another Benchmark analyst, Cameron Perks, said if the US-China trade war escalates, combined with new tariffs 
and export controls, it's going to have a significant impact on the critical minerals sector as a whole.
"We're seeing critical minerals being used more and more as bargaining chips in trade negotiations, with countries 
leveraging their control over supply chains to get a better deal," Perks said.
"Clients in South Korea and Japan have been reaching out to Australia a lot lately, wanting insights on supply, 
demand, pricing, and cost curves as they try to figure out the impact of Trump's policies. They're trying to figure out 
if this is an opportunity or if they should be backing out," he said.
Australia's current heavy rare earth output accounts for just 1 per cent of global mined production, Mukherjee said. 
But it's projected to jump significantly, reaching 14 per cent by 2029 - the fastest growth outside of China.
Ramping up refining capacity is costly, technically challenging and time-consuming. Few have gained the foothold 
required to compete with China, even on more basic materials like lithium.
ASX-listed IGO began producing battery-grade lithium hydroxide with joint venture partner China's Tianqi Lithium 
from its Kwinana Refinery in Western Australia in 2022, only to shutter parts of the operation in January this year as 
sluggish demand for electric vehicles and slumping prices slowed sales and created a global stockpile of the white 
battery metal.

Lottery Corp revenue earnings, slide
Falling revenue and earnings for The Lottery Corporation nevertheless indicated "resilient" financial performance in 
a period of below-average jackpot outcomes, the company said. The lottery operator's revenue fell 5.6 per cent to 
$1.8 billion, while earnings (before significant items) were down 7.4 per cent year-on-year to $369.7 million. Profit 
before significant items fell 9.9 per cent to $175.7 million. Significant items detracted $22 million. The company 
retained its interim dividend of 8¢ per share, fully franked.
Iluka profit dives
Iluka Resources' profit fell by a third to $343 million in the first half, as falling earnings from the group's Mineral 
Sands division and cost pressures weighed. Revenue from the Mineral Sands division hit $1.1 billion, while its 
earnings margin was 42 per cent. Across the business, underlying earnings fell by more than a quarter, 27 per cent, 
to $356 million. The critical minerals miner said persistent inflation had continued to impact costs. Iluka's final 
dividend was unchanged at 4¢ per share.
James Hardie slides
Building products group James Hardie suffered a drop in profits for the three months ended December 31 because 
of declines in volumes in a tough market. CEO Aaron Erter said net profit after tax was down 15 per cent to $US154 
million, with sales down 3 per cent to$US953 million. Earnings before interest and tax came in at $US206.1 million, 
down 9 per cent.
Cleanaway lifts div
Australia's largest waste management group, Cleanaway, has increased its interim dividend after generating a 12.2 
per cent rise in earnings before interest and tax to $195.2 million for the first half of 2024-25. The company will pay 
out a 2.8¢ per share dividend to shareholders, up from 2.45¢. Net profit after was flat, up 0.1 per cent to $74.2 
million.
Corporate Travel falls

Corporate Travel first-half profit plunged after it flagged issues with its European division's travel booking and 
accommodation business. Underlying net profit sank by a third to $38.7 million on a 6 per cent decline in revenue to 
$342.8 million. Corporate Travel will pay an unfranked 10¢ interim dividend - down from 17¢ - and said it has

Just before the last election, Iluka Resources chief executive Tom O'Leary persuaded the Morrison government to 
take a big bet on the future of rare earths processing in Australia. The then prime minister sanctioned a $1.25 billion 
loan from Export Finance Australia for the construction of a rare earths refinery in Western Australia.
A new Labor government was even more enthused about the potential for another resources boom in critical 
minerals processing, including rare earths, as Western countries and customers belatedly recognised the risks of 
relying on China's domination of the industry.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and West Australian Premier Roger Cook promoted Australia's potential in 
advanced chemical processing and "value-added" manufacturing, including batteries and other complex products, 
rather than just selling its raw resources to China.
But as the next election looms, there's been a hard reckoning in the difficulties in developing new mines or new 
processing and manufacturing projects aimed at escaping China's firm grip on the market.
This doesn't mean the strategic imperative to develop alternatives to China's control of critical minerals, especially 
the 17 rare earth element minerals, has reduced. Instead, the sense of urgency has only grown as China has 
repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to turn supply on and off.
In some areas, China has dramatically increased and assisted production of minerals like lithium, including making 
use of Chinese stakes and financing in developing countries. This is an effective way to depress prices and ensure 
competing projects in Western countries are financially unviable.
At other times, China has restricted or banned exports of key rare earth elements required for advanced 
technology, including energy transition and defence needs.
That's particularly significant when China accounts for 70 per cent of global extraction of rare earths, 87 per cent of 
global processing and 100 per cent of processing of "heavy" rare earths like dysprosium and terbium crucial for 
defence, robotics and electric vehicles.

Hard reckoning for a critical future; PAGE TWO
Rare earths aren't actually that rare. Some are not really valuable in themselves, while small volumes for others 
make them commercially challenging to process, given the need for complex chemical technology.
Australia has still been a strong advocate of the role it can play in addressing the West's belated concerns about 
the control China has developed over decades.
That's despite the Donald Trump presidency leaving the fate of the "climate, critical minerals and clean energy 
transformation compact" signed with the US in the Biden era unclear.
Trump's suggestion of a "minerals for aid" deal to Ukraine and a takeover of Greenland and its rare earths 
resources reflects his willingness to trash any concept of alliance relationships that goes well beyond cutting China 
out of supply chains.
Yet most major customers of critical minerals have been reluctant to pay any "non-China" or "green" premium to 
make replacement projects profitable or investible on normal commercial terms.
That's compounded by the cost of construction accelerating across the world, particularly obvious in sharp price 
increases in Australia.
The result is a dismal record of indefinite deferrals, delays or shuttering of a range of critical minerals projects and 
processing as companies struggle to survive let alone expand.
The Albanese government has more than doubled financial assistance available from its predecessor's $2 billion 
critical minerals facility, including taking minor equity stakes and providing a range of grants and loans.
In most cases, the finances still don't stack up.
But Iluka Resources has stockpiled rare earths from its own mineral sands operations since 1991 on the 
presumption these would one day be valuable. It now wants to use this supply and other potential feedstocks to 
produce light and heavy rare earth oxides required for the permanent magnets and metals needed for 
electrification, defence and other advanced technology.
The company and the government still had a stand-off for more than 12 months after Iluka insisted it needed an 
additional loan to build its refinery at Eneabba north of Perth.
This was only resolved after Canberra agreed to lend Iluka an extra $400 million to help cover the increased costs, 
with Iluka providing another $214 million.
The extra government commitment is contingent on the company signing off-take agreements "satisfactory" to the 
Commonwealth.
The refinery is now due to start operations in 2027.
The federal government has also just made a $200 million equity investment in Arafura Rare Earths.
That's in addition to an earlier $840 million in government loans to Arafura to develop a mine and refinery in the 
Northern Territory to produce neodymium and praseodymium.
There's still plenty of market scepticism about whether such projects will ever be profitable despite company 
assurances that customers in countries including South Korea, Japan and European nations will be willing to pay 
more over time to guarantee security and diversity of supply.
As Iluka announced a 33 per cent decline in full-year net profit from its other mineral sands and mining operations 
yesterday, its chief executive sounded optimistic about higher prices to come.
"Neither we nor the customers are focused on the current prices that are published by the Asian Metals Index," 
O'Leary said.Page 3 of 3
Hard reckoning for a critical future; PAGE TWO
"Our customers are pretty focused on diversity of supply sources and security of supply. We are engaging with 
them on a price framework and I think we are getting good traction on that.
"There's a growing acceptance by the industry that there is need for change ... It clearly takes time to evolve and 
develop the market for products that have hitherto been completely controlled almost by the Chinese."
O'Leary was still careful to remind analysts that the government loans allowing Iluka "an opportunity to build a 
terrific business and diversify the company" are strictly non-recourse.
That's bottom-line business.
