## Stakeholder Perspectives

| Stakeholder Name | Role/Position | Opinion and Sentiment Analysis |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| Tom O'Leary [7 quotes] | CEO of Iluka Resources | Tom O'Leary's overall position towards Iluka is strongly supportive, emphasizing the company's strategic role in securing a Western rare earths supply chain and its alignment with government objectives. His views have remained consistent, particularly in highlighting the geopolitical risks posed by China's dominance in the rare earths market and the need for Iluka to maintain financial discipline. While he acknowledges the increasing importance of Iluka's Eneabba project, he also expresses concerns about Australia's vulnerability in the rare earths sector. His statements about China "weaponizing" its control and "manipulating" pricing reflect a negative sentiment towards external market forces, which could heighten industry and investor concerns. However, his emphasis on Iluka's role in establishing an independent rare earths industry and contributing to global electrification presents a positive outlook for the company's future. This mix of caution and optimism suggests a balanced approach, reinforcing Iluka's strategic importance while acknowledging external risks. His strong stance on China's influence may enhance Iluka's reputation as a key player in securing critical mineral supply chains but could also increase scrutiny from geopolitical stakeholders. Overall, his sentiment alternates between positive and negative, with a clear focus on positioning Iluka as a leader in a more resilient and independent rare earths industry. |
