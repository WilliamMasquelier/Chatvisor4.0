1. Iluka has secured an additional $400 million loan from the government to address cost overruns on its Eneabba rare earths refinery project, which has seen its budget balloon from an initial $1.2 billion to an undisclosed higher amount due to delays and financial challenges.

2. Following the announcement of the loan, Iluka's shares plummeted nearly 11%, reaching a four-year low, as investors expressed concerns over the company's ability to manage its financial obligations and the profitability of the Eneabba refinery amid weak rare earth prices.

3. The financing agreement stipulates that Iluka must establish offtake agreements with customers approved by the federal government, emphasizing a strategic shift towards sourcing from "like-minded" nations to reduce reliance on Chinese processing of rare earths.

4. Despite current low prices for neodymium and praseodymium, Iluka's management remains optimistic about future demand, projecting significant price increases by 2034, which they believe will justify the investment in the refinery and support a resilient supply chain independent of China.

5. The timeline for the Eneabba refinery's first production has been pushed back to 2027, with Iluka planning to supplement its feedstock from third-party sources, indicating a strategic approach to ensure operational sustainability and meet growing global demand for critical minerals.
