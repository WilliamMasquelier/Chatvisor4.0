1. Iluka Resources has decided to terminate its 33-year relationship with PwC, opting to replace them with KPMG as its external auditor, indicating a significant shift in trust and confidence in PwC's services amidst ongoing scandals.
   
2. The decision by Iluka to change auditors comes in the wake of a broader trend where multiple companies, including major players like Westpac and Super Retail Group, are distancing themselves from PwC due to reputational damage stemming from the tax leak scandal.

3. The fallout from the tax scandal has not only affected PwC's client base but also raises concerns about the integrity and reliability of audit services in the Australian market, which could impact investor confidence in companies like Iluka that rely on these services for financial transparency.

4. The ongoing scrutiny and investigations into PwC's practices, including a Senate inquiry and multiple investigations by the Tax Practitioners Board, suggest that the repercussions of the scandal will continue to unfold, potentially affecting Iluka's operations and market perception in the near future.
