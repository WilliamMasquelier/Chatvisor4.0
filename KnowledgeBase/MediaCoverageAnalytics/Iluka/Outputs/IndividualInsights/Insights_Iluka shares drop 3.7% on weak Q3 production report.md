1. Iluka Resources experienced a 3.7% drop in share price, reaching a four-month low of A$5.97, following a disappointing Q3 production report that revealed mineral sands revenue significantly below market expectations.

2. The company's Q3 mineral sands revenue was reported at A$232 million, falling short of analyst forecasts by A$74 million, primarily due to lower sales volumes and declining prices for zircon and synthetic rutile.

3. Production challenges were highlighted at the Jacinth-Ambrosia mine, where heavy mineral concentrate output decreased to 52,000 tonnes, attributed to processing lower-grade ore, impacting overall production efficiency.

4. Iluka's Eneabba refinery project, aimed at producing separated rare earth oxides, remains in a funding negotiation phase with the Australian Government, with no recent updates on financing despite a secured $1.25 billion loan under the Critical Minerals Facility.

5. Anticipated zircon sales in Q4 are expected to be negatively affected by seasonal weakness, with price forecasts indicating a potential decline of US$40 to US$50 per tonne, further complicating the company's revenue outlook.
