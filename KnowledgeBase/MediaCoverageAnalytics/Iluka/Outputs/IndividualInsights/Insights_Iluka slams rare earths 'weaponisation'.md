1. Iluka Resources CEO Tom O'Leary has expressed concerns over China's strategic manipulation of the rare earths market, highlighting that Chinese state-owned entities are driving down prices to suppress competition and maintain their dominance in the industry.

2. The company is in the process of constructing a rare earths refinery at its former Eneabba mineral sands site, but is facing financial challenges due to a construction cost increase, necessitating negotiations for an extension of a $1.25 billion government loan.

3. O'Leary emphasized the critical role of heavy rare earths, such as dysprosium and terbium, in both commercial applications like electric vehicles and in national security, underscoring the need for Australia to establish independent supply chains to counteract Chinese influence.

4. Iluka has called for a domestic reservation policy for Australian-mined critical minerals and for Western governments to create a pricing structure for rare earths that is independent of Chinese market control, warning that failure to do so could lead to increased reliance on China for electric vehicle production and defense capabilities.
