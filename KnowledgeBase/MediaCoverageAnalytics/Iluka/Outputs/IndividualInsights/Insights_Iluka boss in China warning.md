1. Iluka Resources CEO Tom O'Leary highlighted that China is leveraging its dominance in the rare earths market to suppress prices, thereby hindering competition from alternative producers, particularly in Australia.

2. O'Leary expressed concerns over the pervasive influence of Chinese state-owned entities on rare earth pricing, indicating that they are willing to incur losses to maintain their market control.

3. Iluka is in the process of constructing a rare earth refinery at its former Eneabba minerals sands site, but is facing financial challenges due to a construction cost increase from $1.25 billion to an estimated $1.8 billion, necessitating negotiations for an extension of government funding.

4. The CEO pointed out a recent Chinese government ban on the export of technology related to rare earth processing, which he views as a strategic move to reinforce China's dominance in the industry for both commercial and defense purposes.

5. O'Leary has advocated for a domestic reservation policy for Australian-mined critical minerals, emphasizing the importance of heavy rare earths like dysprosium and terbium for national security applications.
