1. Iluka Resources has faced significant challenges in the construction of its rare earths refinery at Eneabba, with delays and budget overruns prompting a stalemate with the Albanese government regarding additional funding.

2. The Australian government has agreed to provide Iluka with a $400 million loan, contingent upon the company securing offtake agreements with customers from "like-minded nations," effectively excluding China from its customer base.

3. The rare earths refinery's opening has been postponed until 2027, reflecting broader industry hesitations and the difficulties in attracting investment for critical minerals projects in Australia, particularly in light of reduced market prices.

4. The Australian government's strategic interest in supporting Iluka's refinery is driven by a desire to reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains for rare earths, amidst growing geopolitical tensions and China's dominance in critical minerals processing. 

5. Despite the government's backing, there is skepticism about the market's willingness to pay a premium for non-Chinese sourced critical minerals, which complicates the financial viability of Iluka's refinery and similar projects in the sector.
