1. Iluka Resources experienced a significant decline in its share price, falling 7% to $4.95, which was attributed to a broader sell-off in mining stocks following news of potential tariffs on China.
   
2. Despite the drop in share price, Iluka reported a notable 23.7% increase in output during the December quarter, indicating strong operational performance amidst market volatility.

3. The overall market sentiment was influenced by developments in the technology sector, which overshadowed the negative impact on mining companies, including Iluka, highlighting the contrasting performance between sectors.
