1. Iluka Resources has indicated that the future of its $1.8 billion Eneabba mineral sands refinery project is uncertain without additional federal support, emphasizing its importance for national security and energy transition.

2. The initial budget for the Eneabba project was estimated at $1 billion to $1.2 billion, but costs have escalated significantly, now projected to reach between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion.

3. Iluka's managing director, Tom O'Leary, has stated the necessity for a risk-sharing partnership with the Australian government to ensure the continuation of the refinery's development.

4. The federal government's Export Finance Australia (EFA) has previously committed a loan of up to $1.25 billion for the project, but ongoing assessments are being conducted regarding its viability.
