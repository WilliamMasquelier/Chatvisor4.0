1. Iluka Resources reported a significant decline in first-half net profit, down 34% to $134 million, attributed to global economic uncertainty impacting demand for mineral sands, particularly in the construction sector in China.

2. The company is considering an expansion into rare earths, with a capital estimate for the Eneabba project set between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, indicating a strategic shift amidst declining mineral sands revenue.

3. Iluka is in advanced discussions with the federal government regarding "appropriate risk-sharing" for the Eneabba project, which aligns with the government's critical minerals strategy, highlighting the importance of government support in the company's expansion plans.

4. Despite the downturn in global construction demand, Iluka's zircon products have maintained stable prices, and contracts for synthetic rutile are providing revenue certainty, suggesting resilience in certain product lines amidst broader market challenges. 

5. The company declared an interim dividend of four cents per share, fully franked, reflecting a commitment to shareholder returns even in a challenging economic environment.
