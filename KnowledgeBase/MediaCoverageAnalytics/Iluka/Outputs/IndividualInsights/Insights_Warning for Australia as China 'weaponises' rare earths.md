1. Iluka Resources has raised concerns about China's strategy to "weaponise" its control over rare earth materials, which poses a significant threat to Australia's progress in the sector, according to CEO Tom O'Leary.

2. The company is developing Australia's first fully integrated refinery for rare earth oxides in Eneabba, Western Australia, but has faced a cost increase from an initial estimate of $1.5 billion to a new range of $1.7-$1.8 billion, raising shareholder concerns about potential financial overruns.

3. O'Leary emphasized the urgency of establishing an independent Australian rare earths industry, particularly for heavy rare earths, which are critical for applications in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and national security.

4. Iluka is in discussions with the federal government regarding its capital structure, but O'Leary indicated that it is unlikely the government will provide all necessary funding for the increased capital requirements of the refinery project.

5. The article highlights China's tactics to maintain its monopoly over rare earths, including binding offtake agreements and restrictions on technology exports, which could hinder local development of Australian refineries and further complicate Iluka's efforts in the market.
