1. Lynas Rare Earths is advocating for government funding to establish a sulphuric acid plant, which is crucial for its new $800 million rare earths processing facility in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, especially after BHP's nickel operations cease, impacting acid supply.

2. The company has highlighted the need for improved infrastructure in Kalgoorlie, including power supply, to support the critical minerals industry, emphasizing that government support is essential for successful operations.

3. Lynas is facing significant challenges, including a drop in rare earths production and prices at a five-year low, which could impact its competitive position against other rare earth projects, including those by Iluka Resources.

4. Iluka Resources is currently in discussions with the government regarding additional funding for its rare earths refinery project in WA, which has experienced cost overruns, indicating potential financial pressures within the industry.

5. The competitive landscape is intensifying, as over $2 billion in taxpayer funds have already been allocated to Iluka and Arafura Resources, which may affect Lynas's market position as the largest non-China supplier of rare earths.
