1. Iluka is facing challenges in securing a premium for its rare earths products, as analysts express skepticism about the viability of a "non-China" premium, which is crucial for the company's profitability and market positioning.

2. The Australian government has provided significant financial backing to Iluka, including a recent $400 million loan to support the development of the country's first rare earths refinery, indicating a strategic push to enhance local production capabilities.

3. Despite the government's support, the current low prices of rare earths are a concern for Iluka, with industry experts noting that the market is depressed due to China's dominance, which complicates the outlook for Australian producers.

4. Analysts have pointed out that Iluka, like its competitor Arafura, is reliant on government assistance to navigate the challenging market conditions, highlighting the broader struggles within the Australian rare earths sector.
