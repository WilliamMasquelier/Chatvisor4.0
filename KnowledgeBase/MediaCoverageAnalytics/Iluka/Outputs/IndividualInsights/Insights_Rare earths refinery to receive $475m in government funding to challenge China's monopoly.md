1. Iluka Resources has secured $475 million in government funding to develop a rare earths refinery at its Eneabba facility, aimed at establishing a domestic supply chain for critical minerals independent of China.

2. The funding, primarily in the form of a loan from the government's $4 billion Critical Minerals Facility, is part of a broader strategy to enhance Australia's capabilities in processing critical minerals, which are essential for advanced manufacturing and green technologies.

3. Iluka's CEO, Tom O'Leary, emphasized that the funding aligns the company's commercial goals with the Australian government's policy objectives, highlighting a shift towards increasing local value addition in mineral processing.

4. Resources Minister Madeleine King noted that the Eneabba refinery will create local jobs and contribute to Australia's sovereign manufacturing capabilities, positioning it as part of a network of rare earth refineries across the country to reduce reliance on single supply chains.

5. The announcement reflects a recognition of China's dominance in the critical minerals sector, with Australian officials acknowledging the need for significant investment to catch up in the development of rare earths and related technologies.
