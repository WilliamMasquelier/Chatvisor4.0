1. Iluka Resources is in a dispute with the federal government regarding additional funding needed to complete a rare earths refinery in Western Australia, which has led to a halt in construction.

2. The cost of the refinery has escalated to between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, prompting Iluka to seek more taxpayer funding beyond the existing $1.25 billion loan from Export Finance Australia.

3. The funding impasse has significant implications for Iluka's future mining projects in New South Wales and Victoria, creating uncertainty for investors and stakeholders.

4. Following disappointing revenue results from its core mineral sands operations in the September quarter, Iluka's share price dropped over 3%, reaching a four-month low, indicating investor concern over the refinery situation and overall company performance.
