1. Iluka Resources is urging the Albanese government for additional taxpayer funding to complete Australia's first fully integrated rare earths refinery, emphasizing its importance for national security and energy transition.

2. The project at Eneabba, Western Australia, faces uncertainty as Iluka has reported a significant cost increase for the refinery, now estimated between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, up from initial projections.

3. Iluka's managing director, Tom O'Leary, stated that the refinery's completion is contingent on securing more government funding, highlighting the need for a risk-sharing partnership with the government.

4. The company has not provided guidance on further spending for the second half of the year, raising concerns among shareholders about the implications of potential funding shortfalls.

5. Iluka plans to source heavy rare earths from Northern Minerals for refining at Eneabba, aiming to reduce reliance on China for downstream processing, while also benefiting from a production tax credit scheme if the refinery is completed.
