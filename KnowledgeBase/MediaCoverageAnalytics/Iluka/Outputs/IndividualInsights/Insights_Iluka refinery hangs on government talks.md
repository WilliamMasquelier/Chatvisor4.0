1. Iluka Resources has revised the estimated cost of its Australian rare earth refinery to between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, indicating a significant increase from previous estimates and highlighting financial pressures on the company.

2. The company has reduced its final dividend to 4 cents per share, a stark decrease from 20 cents the previous year, reflecting the impact of inflation, subdued demand, and rising costs on its financial performance.

3. Iluka's net profit for the year fell by 42% to $342.6 million, with mineral sands revenue down 19% to $1.24 billion, suggesting ongoing challenges in its core markets despite beating analyst expectations.

4. The refinery project is being funded by a $1.25 billion federal government lending facility, but Iluka is still in discussions with the government regarding additional funding options, indicating uncertainty about the project's financial viability.

5. The strategic importance of the refinery is underscored by its potential to reduce reliance on Chinese rare earth production, yet Iluka's management emphasizes the need for price incentives and careful capital allocation to mitigate risks associated with the project.
