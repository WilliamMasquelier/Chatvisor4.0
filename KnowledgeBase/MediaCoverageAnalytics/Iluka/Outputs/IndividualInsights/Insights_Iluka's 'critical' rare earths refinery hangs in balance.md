1. Iluka Resources has indicated that the development of its $1.8 billion Eneabba mineral sands refinery is contingent on receiving additional federal support, emphasizing the project's significance for national security and the energy transition.

2. The initial cost estimate for the Eneabba project has escalated from $1 billion-$1.2 billion to between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion, prompting Iluka to seek a risk-sharing partnership with the government to mitigate financial burdens.

3. Discussions between Iluka and the Australian government regarding financial support are reportedly "well-advanced," with the government recognizing the strategic importance of the Eneabba refinery in the context of critical minerals policy.

4. Iluka's first-half profit fell by 34.4% to $133.7 million, attributed to global economic uncertainty affecting customer behavior in the titanium and zircon markets, alongside a strategic decision to build ilmenite inventory.

5. The company is on track to commission its Balranald rutile deposit in western New South Wales in the second half of 2025, despite current challenges in the market and ongoing discussions about the future of its rare earths business.
