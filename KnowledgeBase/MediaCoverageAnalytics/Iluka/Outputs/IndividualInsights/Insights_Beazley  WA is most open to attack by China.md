1. Former Defence Minister Kim Beazley emphasized the strategic importance of Western Australia (WA) in the context of potential geopolitical conflicts, highlighting the need for enhanced military presence, particularly nuclear submarines, to protect critical resources, including those related to rare earth elements.

2. Beazley urged the Albanese government to adopt a more stringent approach towards Chinese investments in critical minerals, specifically advocating for increased funding to support Iluka Resources in developing a fully integrated rare earths refinery at Eneabba, which is crucial for Australia's self-sufficiency in this sector.

3. Iluka Resources has been in negotiations with the federal government for additional taxpayer support to complete the construction of Australia's first rare earths refinery, which has faced significant cost overruns, now estimated at $1.8 billion.

4. Beazley supported claims from Iluka's CEO, Tom O'Leary, regarding China's manipulation of rare earth prices, indicating a broader concern about China's control over the supply chain and its implications for Australian industries reliant on these materials.
