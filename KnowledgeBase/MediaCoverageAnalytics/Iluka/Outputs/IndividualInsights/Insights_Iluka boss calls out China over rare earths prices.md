1. Iluka Resources' managing director, Tom O'Leary, has accused China of manipulating rare earths prices, claiming that this practice is detrimental to producers' profitability and is part of a broader strategy to control mineral deposits in Australia.

2. The company is facing pressure from shareholders to sell a stockpile of rare earths material valued at over $1 billion, which could complicate its ongoing negotiations with the Australian government for additional funding to complete a rare earths refinery in Western Australia.

3. O'Leary expressed concerns that the pricing mechanisms used by Asian Metal indices are biased, further entrenching China's dominance in the rare earths market, and stated that no industry participant is currently making a profit at the prevailing prices.

4. Iluka is in discussions with the Australian government regarding taxpayer support for its $1.8 billion rare earths refinery project, acknowledging that full funding is unlikely to be secured, which raises questions about the project's future viability. 

5. The company remains committed to diversifying into rare earths despite the challenges, indicating confidence in the long-term value of this strategic shift, while also highlighting the broader implications of China's influence on critical minerals beyond just rare earths.
