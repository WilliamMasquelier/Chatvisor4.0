1. The Avonbank mineral sands project, backed by WIM Resource, has raised significant concerns among local farmers regarding land acquisition and potential environmental impacts, echoing past issues experienced with Iluka Resources' Douglas mine, where rehabilitation promises were not met.

2. Farmers have expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of mining rehabilitation efforts, citing Iluka's previous failures in backfilling and soil management, which have led to long-term agricultural damage and loss of trust in regulatory assurances.

3. The project is expected to generate substantial state revenue, with WIM Resource planning to extract 12.75 million tonnes of heavy mineral concentrate, indicating a growing demand for mineral sands in industries such as electric vehicles and renewable energy, which may impact Iluka's market positioning.

4. Local agricultural representatives have voiced concerns about the potential contamination of crops and the long-term viability of farming in the region, drawing parallels to the negative experiences with Iluka's past operations, which have left lasting scars on the land.

5. The regulatory environment surrounding mining operations in Victoria is under scrutiny, with farmers advocating for greater empowerment and transparency in the approval process, reflecting a broader distrust in the system that has previously allowed companies like Iluka to operate with perceived impunity.
