1. Iluka Resources' managing director, Tom O'Leary, expressed frustration over the challenges faced in completing the company's rare earths refinery at Eneabba, highlighting a significant cost blowout in construction that necessitates additional funding amid a contracting market.

2. O'Leary noted that no participant in the rare earths sector is currently making profits at existing prices, emphasizing the impact of China's dominance in the industry, particularly in heavy rare earths, which is achieved through production supremacy and pricing influence.
