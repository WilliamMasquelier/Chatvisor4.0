1. Iluka Resources is strategically positioned to significantly increase its share of the global rare earth oxide supply, with plans to account for 10% of the market by 2037 through its new refinery in Eneabba, Western Australia, supported by a $1.65 billion federal loan.

2. The companyâ€™s managing director, Tom O'Leary, highlighted the geopolitical risks associated with concentrated supply chains, noting that China's history of withholding rare earth supplies for political leverage underscores the importance of securing alternative sources.

3. As Australia ramps up its rare earth production, currently at just 1% of global output but projected to rise to 14% by 2029, Iluka is poised to play a crucial role in diversifying the supply chain away from China, which currently dominates the market.

4. The increasing use of critical minerals as bargaining chips in international trade negotiations could impact Iluka's operations, as the company navigates the complexities of a potential trade war between the US and China, which may affect demand and pricing for rare earths.
