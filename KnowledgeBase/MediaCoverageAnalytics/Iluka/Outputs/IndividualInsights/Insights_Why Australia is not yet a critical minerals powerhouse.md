1. Iluka Resources' CEO, Tom O'Leary, highlighted the vulnerability of Australian rare-earth miners, including Iluka, due to China's dominance in the market, which has led to a significant drop in rare-earth prices, making profitability challenging.

2. The Australian government provided Iluka with A$1.25 billion ($850 million) in 2022 to support the establishment of a rare-earths refinery, but Iluka has since indicated a need for additional funding to complete the facility, underscoring ongoing financial challenges.

3. The competitive landscape for Iluka is further complicated by China's strategic investments in global supply chains and its ability to manipulate prices, which poses a significant risk to Australian producers' market position and security of supply.

4. Despite government support through loans and tax breaks, the reliance on China for critical minerals remains a pressing issue for Iluka and the broader Australian mining sector, indicating a long road ahead to achieve supply chain independence.
