1. Iluka Resources is constructing a refinery in Western Australia, which is expected to process rare earths from Northern Minerals' Browns Range project, highlighting its strategic role in the domestic rare earths supply chain.

2. The refinery project has received $1.25 billion in loans from the government, but Iluka is currently seeking additional funding due to rising costs and declining prices in the critical minerals market.

3. CEO Tom O'Leary has raised concerns about China's price manipulation tactics, which threaten the competitiveness of Australian rare earths producers, including Iluka, amidst a global decline in critical mineral prices.

4. The Australian government is exploring production tax credits for critical minerals processing, but the eligibility criteria regarding Chinese investment levels remain uncertain, potentially impacting Iluka's operations and partnerships.
