# 1. China’s Influence on the Rare Earths Market  

<a name="1-1-overview-"></a>

## 1.1. Overview  

The media coverage on China's influence on the rare earths market has consistently highlighted concerns over China's dominance in the sector, its price manipulation strategies, and the geopolitical implications of its control over critical minerals. Iluka Resources, a key Australian player in rare earths, has been at the forefront of discussions, with its CEO, Tom O'Leary, repeatedly warning about China's tactics to suppress competition and maintain its monopoly. The Australian government has provided financial support to Iluka’s refinery project in an effort to establish an independent supply chain, but challenges such as rising costs, market volatility, and foreign investment scrutiny have complicated the industry's progress. Over time, the media coverage has evolved from initial warnings about China's market control to more detailed discussions on financial struggles, government interventions, and the broader geopolitical ramifications of rare earths supply chain dependencies.

<a name="1-2-1-early-coverage-"></a>

### 1.2.1 Early Coverage  

The initial media coverage in May 2024 focused on Iluka Resources' warnings about China's "weaponization" of rare earths and its impact on Australia's efforts to establish an independent supply chain. Tom O'Leary accused China of manipulating rare earths prices to suppress competition, making it difficult for non-Chinese producers to remain profitable [AAP Newsfeed, May 07, 2024; Australian Financial Review, May 08, 2024]. Iluka was in the process of constructing Australia's first fully integrated rare earths refinery in Eneabba, Western Australia, but faced rising costs, with the project’s budget increasing from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, raising concerns among shareholders [The Australian, May 08, 2024].  

Additionally, O'Leary highlighted China's restrictions on technology exports and binding offtake agreements as key strategies to maintain its dominance, warning that these tactics could hinder the development of Australian refineries [The Daily Telegraph, May 08, 2024]. Calls for a domestic reservation policy for Australian-mined critical minerals and the establishment of a Western pricing structure independent of Chinese influence were also emphasized [The Australian, May 08, 2024].

### 1.2.2 Developing Trends  

By mid-2024, the media coverage expanded to include discussions on the broader geopolitical and financial challenges facing the rare earths sector. Reports in May and June 2024 highlighted the volatility in rare earths prices, with O'Leary attributing much of it to China's manipulation through the Asian Metals Index, which he claimed undermined profitability for all producers, including Iluka [Australian Financial Review, May 23, 2024].  

The Australian government’s scrutiny of foreign investments, particularly Chinese stakes in Northern Minerals, became a focal point, as concerns grew over potential Chinese influence on Iluka’s supply chain [Australian Financial Review, June 04, 2024]. Treasurer Jim Chalmers intervened to limit Chinese ownership in Northern Minerals, reflecting a broader effort to reduce reliance on Chinese capital in the critical minerals sector [The Australian, June 07, 2024].  

Despite government support, analysts raised concerns about the financial viability of Iluka’s refinery project, warning that taxpayers might ultimately bear the cost of competing against China’s established supply chain [Brisbane Times, June 23, 2024]. The Australian government explored production tax credits for critical minerals processing, but uncertainty remained regarding eligibility criteria, particularly concerning Chinese investment levels [Australian Financial Review, June 04, 2024].

### 1.2.3 Recent Developments  

By late 2024 and early 2025, the media coverage shifted towards the financial and strategic challenges facing Iluka and the broader Australian rare earths sector. Reports in August and September 2024 highlighted Iluka’s ongoing financial struggles, with the company indicating that it might halt work on its refinery unless additional funding was secured [Australian Financial Review, September 04, 2024].  

The Australian government continued to scrutinize foreign investments, particularly in Northern Minerals, which had implications for Iluka’s supply chain and refinery project [The Australian, December 03, 2024]. The government’s intervention in Northern Minerals' shareholder structure underscored the growing tension between national security concerns and foreign investment in critical minerals [The Australian, November 30, 2024].  

By January 2025, doubts were raised over the viability of Iluka’s rare earths refinery, with analysts questioning whether a "non-China" premium could be achieved to justify the investment [Australian Financial Review, January 16, 2025]. Despite receiving a $400 million loan from the government, Iluka continued to face challenges due to low rare earths prices and China’s market dominance, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of Australia’s rare earths ambitions [Australian Financial Review, January 16, 2025].

### 1.3.1 Iluka Resources and Tom O'Leary  

Iluka Resources, led by CEO Tom O'Leary, has been one of the most vocal critics of China's influence on the rare earths market. O'Leary has repeatedly accused China of manipulating prices to suppress competition and maintain its monopoly, warning that this strategy threatens the viability of Australian producers [Australian Financial Review, May 08, 2024]. He has also emphasized the importance of establishing an independent Australian supply chain, particularly for heavy rare earths like dysprosium and terbium, which are critical for electric vehicles and defense applications [The Australian, May 08, 2024].  

Despite receiving significant government support, Iluka has struggled with rising costs and market volatility, leading O'Leary to advocate for additional funding and policy measures to support domestic rare earths production [Australian Financial Review, September 04, 2024].

### 1.3.2 Australian Government  

The Australian government has played a crucial role in supporting Iluka’s refinery project, providing a $1.25 billion loan to help establish the country’s first fully integrated rare earths processing facility [The Australian, June 07, 2024]. However, the government has also been cautious about foreign investment, particularly from China, intervening to limit Chinese ownership in Northern Minerals to protect national security interests [The Australian, December 03, 2024].  

Additionally, the government has explored production tax credits and other financial incentives to support the critical minerals sector, though concerns remain about the long-term economic viability of competing with China’s established supply chain [Brisbane Times, June 23, 2024].

### 1.3.3 Industry Analysts and Investors  

Industry analysts have expressed skepticism about the financial sustainability of Iluka’s refinery project, warning that the current low prices of rare earths make profitability challenging [Australian Financial Review, January 16, 2025]. Some analysts have also questioned whether a "non-China" premium can be achieved, raising doubts about the long-term viability of Australia’s rare earths ambitions [Australian Financial Review, January 16, 2025].  

Investors have pressured Iluka to sell its stockpile of rare earths material, valued at over $1 billion, which could complicate its negotiations with the government for additional funding [Australian Financial Review, May 08, 2024].

## 1.4. Implications and Future Outlook  

The media coverage suggests that Australia’s efforts to establish an independent rare earths supply chain face significant challenges, including financial constraints, market volatility, and geopolitical tensions. While government support has been crucial, the long-term viability of Iluka’s refinery project remains uncertain, particularly given China’s continued dominance in the market and its ability to manipulate prices [Australian Financial Review, January 16, 2025].  

Moving forward, Australia may need to implement additional policy measures, such as production tax credits and domestic reservation policies, to support its rare earths industry. However, the success of these initiatives will depend on whether Australian producers can achieve profitability in a market heavily influenced by China [The Australian, June 07, 2024].  

If Iluka successfully completes its refinery and secures a stable supply chain, it could significantly reduce Western dependence on Chinese rare earths, potentially reshaping the global market. However, ongoing financial and geopolitical challenges suggest that achieving this goal will require sustained government support and strategic industry partnerships [Sydney Morning Herald, June 24, 2024].
