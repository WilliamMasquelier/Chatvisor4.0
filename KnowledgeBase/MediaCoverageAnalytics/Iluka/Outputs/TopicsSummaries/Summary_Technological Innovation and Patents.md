### 5.2.3 Recent Developments  

By September 2024, Iluka Resources had expanded its patent filings to the international stage, with two new applications under the International Patent Classification system [US Fed News, September 02, 2024]. The first patent, titled "Process and Apparatus," focused on improving the processing of mineral sand particulates, particularly zircon, while addressing contaminants such as uranium and thorium. The method involved heating mineral sand particulates with specific chemicals, potentially enhancing efficiency and safety in zircon processing. The described processing apparatus featured a sophisticated heating device with predefined zones, emphasizing precision and control in mineral processing [US Fed News, September 02, 2024].  

Simultaneously, Iluka filed another international patent application for a "Processing Apparatus," which included advanced features such as predefined heating zones and a gas recycling mechanism. This innovation suggested a shift towards more efficient and environmentally friendly processing methods. The involvement of multiple inventors from Iluka’s Perth office in both applications highlighted the company’s internal research and development efforts, reinforcing its commitment to technological leadership in the mineral sands industry [US Fed News, September 02, 2024].
