1. Ørsted, a major offshore wind farm developer, reported a staggering loss of nearly €3 billion last year, prompting significant operational changes within the company.

2. The company's CEO, Thonas Thune Andersen, is stepping down after a decade, coinciding with a downward revision of Ørsted's 2030 production target from 50 gigawatts to 38 gigawatts.

3. The financial losses were primarily attributed to the cancellation of two offshore wind projects in New Jersey, which resulted in a €3.7 billion loss due to rising costs, delays in material delivery, and increased interest rates.

4. In response to its financial difficulties, Ørsted is withdrawing from markets in Norway, Spain, and Portugal, and is laying off approximately 700 employees, while also suspending dividend payments to shareholders until 2025.

5. The broader wind energy sector is facing challenges, with rising costs and rapid technological advancements leading to concerns about project viability, as evidenced by Siemens' wind energy division also reporting significant losses.
