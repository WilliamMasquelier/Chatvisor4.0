1. Orsted has secured a significant contract for the Hornsea 4 wind farm, with a strike price of £58.90 per megawatt hour, which is expected to rise to £74 when adjusted for inflation based on 2012 prices.

2. The UK government has allocated £10 billion for offshore wind contracts, with Orsted being a key player among the nine awarded projects, highlighting its critical role in the country's renewable energy strategy.

3. The funding for Orsted's projects is set to be inflation-indexed over a 15-year term, indicating a long-term commitment to offshore wind development, but also raising concerns about the potential financial burden on consumers if wholesale prices fluctuate.

4. Industry experts express mixed feelings about the government's offshore wind strategy, with some cautioning that the ambitious funding may be "reckless" due to existing grid constraints, which could impact Orsted's ability to deliver on its commitments.

5. The Renewable Energy Foundation has raised concerns about the sustainability of the spending on offshore wind, suggesting that while Orsted's projects are crucial for energy security, the overall approach may need reevaluation to ensure it aligns with grid capabilities and market realities.
