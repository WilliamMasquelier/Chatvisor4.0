1. Ørsted reported a significant net loss of €2.7 billion for 2023, leading to the decision to suspend dividend payments for both the current and next year, reflecting a stark contrast to the profitability seen in major oil companies.

2. The company's operational cash flow to net debt ratio dropped from 42.7% to 28.6%, primarily due to rising costs for components and materials, as well as increased financing costs, which rendered several previously committed wind farm projects unviable.

3. In response to financial setbacks, Ørsted is scaling back its ambitions for new wind farms, cutting hundreds of jobs, and reducing investments, while also planning to sell wind farms or stakes in them to raise capital.

4. Despite the suspension of dividends, investor sentiment improved as Ørsted focused on cost-saving measures and asset sales rather than issuing new shares, indicating a preference for financial discipline among investors.

5. The stock of Ørsted has lost 70% of its value over the past three years but has recently shown signs of recovery, suggesting that the company may be reaching a turning point after a challenging year.
