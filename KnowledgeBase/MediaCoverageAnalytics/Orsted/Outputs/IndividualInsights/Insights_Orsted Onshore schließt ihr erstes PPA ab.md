1. Orsted Onshore Deutschland has signed its first long-term Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Stadtwerke Wunsiedel, marking a significant milestone for the company in the German renewable energy market.

2. The PPA will supply a total of 167 million kWh of electricity from newly established solar parks in East Bavaria, which is expected to meet the energy needs of approximately 5,600 households.

3. This agreement represents a shift for Orsted Onshore, previously known as Ostwind, as it begins to independently market its own onshore wind and solar parks, distinguishing its operations from the larger Orsted group that has historically handled larger PPA volumes.

4. The collaboration with Stadtwerke Wunsiedel is part of a broader partnership in wind energy project development, indicating Orsted's commitment to local renewable energy initiatives and community engagement in the region. 

5. The PPA is crucial for Stadtwerke Wunsiedel to maintain its 100% CO2-neutral energy supply, highlighting the importance of such agreements in supporting sustainability goals within local municipalities.
