1. Orsted has implemented a new foundation installation method at the Gode Wind 3 offshore wind farm, utilizing jetting technology that significantly reduces noise levels to approximately 140 decibels, which is below the German regulatory limit of 160 decibels.

2. The jetting technology eliminates the need for traditional noise reduction systems, such as bubble curtains, by using high-pressure water jets to decrease soil resistance, allowing the monopile foundations to sink into the seabed more quietly.

3. Orsted plans to apply this innovative installation method to more complex soil conditions in the future, with the potential to make foundation installation cheaper, faster, and quieter than existing technologies.

4. The company is currently seeking additional regulatory approvals before expanding the use of this technology to other markets, and it is receiving funding under the Wind Energy at Sea Act (WindSeeG) from the Federal Network Agency for its installation efforts.
