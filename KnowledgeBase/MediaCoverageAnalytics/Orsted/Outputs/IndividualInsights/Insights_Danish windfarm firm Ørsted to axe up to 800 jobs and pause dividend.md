1. Ørsted plans to cut up to 800 jobs and suspend dividend payments for the 2023-25 financial years as part of a "reset plan" aimed at making the company more efficient following a tumultuous year marked by high inflation and supply chain disruptions.

2. The company has reduced its renewable energy capacity target for 2030 from 50 gigawatts to 35-38 gigawatts, indicating a significant shift in its growth strategy amidst ongoing financial challenges.

3. Ørsted's chair, Thomas Thune Andersen, will step down, following the departure of two senior executives, highlighting potential leadership instability during a critical period for the company.

4. The firm has faced setbacks in the US market, including the cancellation of two major offshore wind projects, Ocean Wind I and II, due to rising costs, resulting in a substantial financial loss of 28.4 billion Danish kroner (£3.3 billion). 

5. Analysts suggest that Ørsted's decision to pause dividend payments and cut jobs may be a response to market expectations for the company to seek additional funding to stabilize its financial position and mitigate future risks.
