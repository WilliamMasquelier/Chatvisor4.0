1. Ørsted's CEO Mads Nipper has resigned amid financial struggles, particularly due to the company's expansion into the U.S. market, which has turned out to be a costly miscalculation as the U.S. government under Trump has halted new wind energy permits.

2. The company has faced significant financial setbacks, including a €1.6 billion write-down related to offshore leases, and concerns from investors about the viability of ongoing projects like Sunrise Wind and Revolution, which may never be completed.

3. Ørsted's stock has plummeted by 80% from its peak in 2021, driven by rising inflation, increased interest rates, and supply chain issues that have adversely affected the renewable energy sector in both the U.S. and Europe.

4. The company has made strategic cuts, including suspending dividends until 2025 and laying off 800 employees, as it seeks to navigate the challenging market conditions exacerbated by the U.S. political landscape and economic factors.
