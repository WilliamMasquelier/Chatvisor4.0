1. Orsted's CEO, Mads Nipper, has been dismissed due to poor performance over recent years, particularly following the company's transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy, which has not yielded the expected financial results.

2. The company's stock has plummeted by 83% since its peak in 2021, reflecting significant challenges faced by Orsted and the broader European wind sector, including high interest rates and rising costs for materials and labor.

3. Orsted has incurred a substantial loss of $1.7 billion in its American operations, attributed to external factors such as the U.S. government's stance on offshore wind energy, which has further exacerbated the company's financial difficulties.

4. The company has halted its plans for $20 billion in investments in the U.S. wind sector, indicating a strategic shift in response to the current market challenges and uncertainty surrounding future offshore wind projects. 

5. Following Nipper's departure, Orsted has not clarified its new strategic direction, leaving stakeholders uncertain about the company's future focus in the renewable energy landscape.
