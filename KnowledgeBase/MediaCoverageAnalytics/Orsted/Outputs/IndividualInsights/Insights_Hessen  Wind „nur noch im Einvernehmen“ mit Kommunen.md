1. Orsted is facing significant opposition from the local government of Bad Orb, which has launched a media campaign against the proposed wind park, claiming it threatens the area's natural landscape and community values.

2. The mayor of Bad Orb, Tobias Weisbecker, has accused Orsted of disregarding democratic processes and the concerns of local citizens, indicating a strong sentiment against the company's plans.

3. Despite the backlash, Orsted maintains that it has legally secured the rights to develop the wind park and sees no reason to abandon the project, emphasizing that there are no new facts that would alter the situation.

4. The Hessian government is planning to change its approach to wind energy projects by requiring future developments to have the consent of local municipalities, which could impact Orsted's operations and project approvals in the region. 

5. The local community is exploring legal avenues to halt the project, highlighting the potential for ongoing conflict between renewable energy initiatives and local interests, which could affect Orsted's reputation and operational strategy in the Netherlands.
