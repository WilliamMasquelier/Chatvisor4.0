1. Ørsted has successfully implemented the use of a Heavy Lift Cargo Drone for the first time in its offshore wind farm operations near Zeeland, significantly reducing the time required to transport heavy materials to the turbines.

2. The drone can transport safety boxes to each of the 94 turbines in just 15 minutes, compared to the traditional method which takes approximately six hours and requires three technicians for each turbine.

3. This operational trial follows a previous test at the Hornsea wind farm in England, indicating Ørsted's commitment to innovative solutions in enhancing operational efficiency in renewable energy projects.

4. While the drone is currently being used for this specific task, Ørsted has not committed to permanent drone operations, suggesting that future applications may be explored but are not yet defined.

5. Despite the advancements in drone technology, Ørsted emphasizes that maintenance of wind turbines will continue to rely on human technicians, highlighting the importance of skilled labor in the renewable energy sector.
