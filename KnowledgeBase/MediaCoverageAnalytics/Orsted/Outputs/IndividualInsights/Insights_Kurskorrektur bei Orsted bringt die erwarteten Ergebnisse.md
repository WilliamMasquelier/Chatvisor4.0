1. Orsted has returned to profitability in 2024, reporting a profit of approximately €2.2 billion after suffering a significant loss of €2.7 billion in 2023, indicating a successful recovery strategy following a challenging year.

2. The company's operational earnings (EBITDA) for 2024 reached €4.3 billion, which is an increase of €1.8 billion compared to the previous year, driven by positive performance in its operational business despite prior losses attributed to project write-offs.

3. Revenue from Orsted's offshore segment showed a slight increase to €3.2 billion, largely due to the commissioning of new offshore wind farms in Taiwan, the USA, and the German North Sea, highlighting the company's ongoing expansion in renewable energy.

4. Orsted has made significant adjustments to its growth strategy, reducing its 2030 renewable energy target from an installed capacity of 50,000 MW to 38,000 MW, reflecting challenges in the offshore wind sector, including project cancellations and delays in the USA.

5. The company’s recent management changes, including the appointment of CEO Rasmus Errboe, have been pivotal in steering Orsted back to a positive financial trajectory, emphasizing the importance of leadership in navigating the renewable energy landscape.
