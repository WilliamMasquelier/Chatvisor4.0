1. Ørsted is collaborating with Van Oord on a project named Ocean Health, aimed at reintroducing European flat oysters to the North Sea, which were once abundant but have nearly disappeared due to various environmental factors.

2. The project utilizes innovative tetrapod structures to facilitate the attachment of oysters, making the process more efficient and cost-effective compared to previous methods that required heavy machinery.

3. The wind farm Borssele 1 and 2, operated by Ørsted, provides an ideal environment for the oyster reintroduction due to its relatively undisturbed conditions, low shipping traffic, and absence of fishing activities.

4. An eight-year monitoring program will assess the health and reproductive success of the oysters, with the goal of establishing new oyster reefs that contribute to ecosystem health by filtering pollutants and enhancing biodiversity. 

5. The success of the project hinges on the oysters' ability to attach to the tetrapods and produce larvae, which will be closely monitored to determine the project's overall effectiveness in restoring oyster populations in the North Sea.
