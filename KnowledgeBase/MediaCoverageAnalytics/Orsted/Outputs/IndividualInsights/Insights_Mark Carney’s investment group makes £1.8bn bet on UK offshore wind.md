1. Ørsted is divesting a 12.45% stake in four major UK wind farms to Brookfield Group for £1.8 billion, as part of a strategy to restore investor confidence following a period of poor performance and a review of its investment and capacity targets.

2. The deal allows Ørsted to retain a 37.55% ownership interest in the wind farms, which will continue to be operated and maintained by the company, indicating a strategic shift towards partnerships to manage its assets effectively.

3. Ørsted's recent challenges include pausing dividend payouts and trimming investment targets, highlighting the company's need to stabilize its financial position while still pursuing significant projects like the Hornsea 3 wind farm.

4. The transaction is part of Ørsted's broader "farm-down programme," which aims to raise capital for new projects, reflecting the company's ongoing efforts to balance investment in growth with financial prudence amidst market pressures.
