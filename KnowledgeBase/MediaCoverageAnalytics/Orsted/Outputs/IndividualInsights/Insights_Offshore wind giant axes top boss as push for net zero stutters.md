1. Orsted has replaced its CEO, Mads Nipper, amid significant challenges in the offshore wind sector, including rising costs and project delays, which have hindered the company's transition to renewable energy.

2. The company has experienced a drastic decline in its stock value, with shares plummeting over 80% since their peak in 2021, prompting a strategic shift in leadership to address ongoing financial difficulties.

3. Orsted has announced substantial writedowns of 12.1 billion Danish krone (Â£1.4 billion) related to its US operations, attributing these losses to increasing interest rates and market uncertainties exacerbated by political changes in the US.

4. The company is facing operational setbacks, including a projected reduction in wind farm output, which could result in the construction of 1,500 fewer turbines, highlighting the impact of supply chain issues and regulatory challenges on its projects.
