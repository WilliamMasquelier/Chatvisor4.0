1. Orsted's stock experienced a significant decline of up to 17.6% following the announcement of a â‚¬1.62 billion impairment related to delays and increased costs for the Sunrise Wind project, which is touted as the largest offshore wind farm in the United States.

2. The new U.S. administration's moratorium on offshore wind projects poses a substantial risk to Orsted, as it may affect not only future projects but also existing contracts, leading to potential legal challenges and uncertainties in the renewable energy sector.

3. Analysts have expressed concerns that Orsted's U.S. assets may have lost their value due to the changing political landscape and regulatory environment, which could hinder the company's growth prospects in the American market.

4. The rapid implementation of new decrees by the U.S. government targeting wind energy has created a challenging environment for European energy companies, including Orsted, which are heavily invested in renewable energy projects in the U.S.
