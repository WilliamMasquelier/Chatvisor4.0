1. Orsted has abandoned its plans for a mega plant aimed at developing green fuels, marking a significant retreat from its commitment to cleaner energy initiatives, including hydrogen production.

2. The decision to halt the project, which was intended to produce 55,000 tons of e-methane annually, was influenced by deteriorating business conditions, including challenges in securing long-term offtake contracts at sustainable prices and rising project costs.

3. The cancellation of the green fuels project has resulted in a financial loss of £172 million for Orsted, highlighting the economic risks associated with large-scale renewable energy investments.

4. Despite this setback, Orsted remains a key player in the renewable energy sector, with plans to construct an £8 billion offshore wind farm in the North Sea, expected to power over 3.3 million homes in the UK by 2027.
