1. Orsted is collaborating with the University of Essex and other academic institutions to study the environmental impacts of offshore wind farms, particularly focusing on biodiversity, carbon storage, and seabed composition.

2. The research aims to provide critical data that will inform policy decisions regarding offshore wind farm development, emphasizing the urgency of understanding environmental effects as the demand for renewable energy increases.

3. Orsted's commitment to developing renewable energy in harmony with nature is highlighted, with the company advocating for a science-led approach to ensure sustainable deployment of offshore wind projects.

4. The study also aims to compare the environmental impacts of offshore wind farms with those of decommissioned oil platforms, indicating a broader effort to learn from the oil and gas industry to improve practices in renewable energy.
