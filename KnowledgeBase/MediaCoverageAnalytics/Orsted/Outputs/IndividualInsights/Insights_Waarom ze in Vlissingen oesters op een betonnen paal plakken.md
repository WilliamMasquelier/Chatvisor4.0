1. Ørsted is collaborating with Van Oord on the Ocean Health project, which aims to reintroduce European flat oysters to the North Sea, addressing the decline of oyster reefs that previously covered a significant portion of the seabed.

2. The project utilizes tetrapods—concrete structures designed to facilitate the attachment of oysters—making the deployment process more efficient and cost-effective compared to previous methods that required cranes.

3. The initiative is part of Ørsted's broader commitment to enhancing marine ecosystems, as the reintroduction of oysters is expected to improve water quality and biodiversity in the North Sea.

4. An eight-year monitoring program will assess the success of the oyster reintroduction, focusing on the survival of the oysters and their ability to produce larvae that can establish new reefs, which is crucial for the project's long-term viability.
