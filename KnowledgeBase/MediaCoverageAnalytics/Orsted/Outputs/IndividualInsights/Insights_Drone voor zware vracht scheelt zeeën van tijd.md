1. Ørsted has successfully implemented the use of a Heavy Lift Cargo Drone for the first time in its offshore wind farm operations, specifically at Windpark Borssele, significantly reducing the time required for transporting safety boxes to the turbines.

2. The drone can transport safety boxes weighing up to 100 kilograms directly to the tops of wind turbines in just 15 minutes, compared to the traditional method which takes about six hours and requires multiple technicians.

3. This operational trial follows a previous test at the Hornsea wind farm in England, indicating Ørsted's commitment to innovative solutions in enhancing operational efficiency in renewable energy projects.

4. While the drone is currently being used for a specific task, Ørsted has not committed to permanent drone operations, although there is potential for future applications in other areas of their wind farm operations.

5. Ørsted emphasizes that the use of drones will not replace human workers; instead, it allows technicians to focus on essential maintenance tasks, thereby improving overall productivity and safety in wind farm operations.
