1. Orsted has received approval from the Hessen-Forst state agency to proceed with the planning of a wind farm near Bad Orb, which is located in a designated wind priority area, despite facing significant local opposition.

2. Local stakeholders, including the mayor and prominent business figures, have publicly opposed Orsted's wind project, arguing that it threatens the region's wellness tourism and disregards democratic processes by not adequately consulting the community.

3. The opposition has launched a costly media campaign against Orsted, spending hundreds of thousands of euros on advertisements that portray the company as a threat to the local environment and community, labeling the area as a "fairy tale forest."

4. Orsted's representatives have countered the opposition's claims by emphasizing that their actions comply with legal frameworks and regional planning goals, asserting that the land in question is designated for economic use, including wind energy.

5. The company anticipates ongoing resistance from local citizen initiatives, indicating a broader trend of pushback against wind energy expansion in the Spessart region, which may complicate future developments for Orsted in the area.
