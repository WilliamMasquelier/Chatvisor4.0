1. Orsted has announced a significant shift in its business strategy, suspending dividend payments until 2025 and implementing austerity measures due to rising costs in its key projects, particularly in the United States.

2. The company has revised its renewable energy deployment targets down from 50 GW to a new goal of 35 to 38 GW of installed capacity by 2030, indicating a more cautious approach to growth in the sector.

3. Orsted plans to cut 800 jobs globally, with immediate layoffs of 250 employees, and is withdrawing from several promising offshore wind markets, including Spain, Portugal, and Norway, while deprioritizing activities in Japan.

4. The company aims to save 35 billion Danish crowns (approximately 4.7 billion euros) in capital expenditures by 2026, reflecting a strategic pivot to reduce development costs and risks associated with its projects.
