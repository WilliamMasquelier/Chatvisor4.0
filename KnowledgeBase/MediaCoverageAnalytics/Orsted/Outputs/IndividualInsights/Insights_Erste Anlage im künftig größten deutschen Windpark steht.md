1. Orsted is making significant progress on the "Borkum Riffgrund 3" offshore wind farm, which will be the largest in Germany, with a total capacity of 913 MW and the first to be built without a guaranteed feed-in tariff.

2. The project is notable for being the first offshore wind project globally to be awarded without a subsidy, indicating a shift towards market-driven renewable energy solutions.

3. Orsted has secured long-term Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs) with major companies such as Amazon and BASF, which are essential for the financial viability of the wind farm, given the absence of guaranteed revenue.

4. The innovative connection design of "Borkum Riffgrund 3" eliminates the need for an offshore substation, showcasing Orsted's commitment to advancing technology in offshore wind energy.

5. The project is co-owned by Orsted and Nuveen Infrastructure, reflecting a collaborative approach in the renewable energy sector to achieve large-scale developments.
