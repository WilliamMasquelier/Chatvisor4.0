1. Orsted has appointed Trond Westlie as CFO and Patrick Harnett as COO, effective April 1, 2024, following a tumultuous financial year that resulted in a loss of €2.7 billion due to significant write-downs on abandoned offshore wind projects in the U.S.

2. The leadership changes come after the dismissal of previous executives Daniel Lerup and Richard Hunter, indicating a strategic shift aimed at reversing the company's recent financial downturn.

3. Patrick Harnett, the new COO, is expected to implement a new project operational model that emphasizes improved risk management, emergency planning, and better project oversight, reflecting the company's need for a more robust operational strategy.

4. The interim leadership structure, which included Rasmus Errboe and Andrew Brown, was a temporary measure to manage the company's operations during the transition, highlighting the urgency of stabilizing Orsted's leadership amidst ongoing challenges.

5. Trond Westlie's previous experience in financial management at various international companies, including Möller-Maersk and Telenor, is anticipated to bring valuable expertise to Orsted as it seeks to navigate its recovery in the renewable energy sector.
