1. Orsted has registered its first wind energy installations from the "Gode Wind 3" offshore wind farm for direct marketing, marking a significant step in the expansion of renewable energy in the Netherlands.

2. The "Gode Wind 3" project will feature ten 11.5 MW wind turbines, making them the most powerful wind turbines in Germany upon their commissioning, which is scheduled between April 18 and April 29, 2024.

3. Orsted secured the area for "Gode Wind 3" in 2017 at a guaranteed electricity purchase price of 6 cents/kWh, which is now under scrutiny as the market value of offshore wind power has fallen below this threshold.

4. The company faces a financial dynamic where if it averages more than 6 cents/kWh in a month, it will lose the market premium but retain any excess revenue, highlighting the risks associated with market fluctuations in renewable energy pricing.
