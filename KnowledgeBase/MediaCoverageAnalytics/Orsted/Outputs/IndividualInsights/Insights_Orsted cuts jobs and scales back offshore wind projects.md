1. Ørsted has announced significant job cuts, affecting up to 800 roles, as part of a broader strategy to address financial losses amounting to approximately £2.2 billion for the year 2023.

2. The company is scaling back its offshore wind project ambitions, with expected output decreasing from 50 gigawatts to 38 gigawatts by 2030, which translates to the potential construction of 1,500 fewer turbines.

3. Ørsted is withdrawing from several international markets, including Norway, Spain, and Portugal, and has halted dividend payments until 2025, indicating a severe cash crunch and a shift in strategic focus.

4. The company has written off £3.3 billion from its wind farm business, primarily due to impairments related to uncompleted offshore projects in the US, highlighting the financial strain and operational challenges faced by Ørsted.

5. The chairman, Thomas Thune Andersen, is set to step down in March 2024, following a challenging year for the company, which has prompted a reassessment of its growth ambitions and business strategy moving forward.
