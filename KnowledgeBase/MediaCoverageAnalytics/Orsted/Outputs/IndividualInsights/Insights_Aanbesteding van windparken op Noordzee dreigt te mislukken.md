1. Ørsted has expressed significant concerns regarding the viability of upcoming offshore wind tenders in the Netherlands, indicating that the current market conditions do not support a profitable investment in new wind farms.

2. The company, along with other major energy firms, is advocating for a slower release of wind farm plots to the market, emphasizing the need for increased demand for electricity in the Netherlands before proceeding with new projects.

3. Ørsted has highlighted the challenges posed by the Dutch government's requirement for energy companies to pay for permits, a practice that has been abandoned in many other countries, which they argue exacerbates the financial risks in the current market.

4. The lack of long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) is a critical issue for Ørsted, as the company struggles to secure contracts that would ensure a stable revenue stream necessary for justifying investments in new wind projects.
