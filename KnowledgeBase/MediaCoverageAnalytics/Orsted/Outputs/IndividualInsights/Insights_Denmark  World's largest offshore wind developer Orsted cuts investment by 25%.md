1. Orsted has announced a significant reduction in planned investments, cutting them by 25% by 2030, as part of a strategic shift under new management aimed at stabilizing the company's financial performance.

2. The company is facing challenges in recovering from its expansion efforts in the US, which encountered major issues in 2023, contributing to the decision to scale back investments.

3. Under the previous leadership of Mads Nipper, Orsted's stock value plummeted by nearly 80%, primarily due to rising interest rates and the decline of the green stock market, highlighting the financial pressures the company is under.

4. Orsted has also been forced to abandon several projects in recent years due to global supply chain disruptions, indicating operational difficulties that may affect its future growth in the renewable energy sector.

5. The trend of lowering renewable energy targets is not isolated to Orsted; other companies, such as Equinor, are also adjusting their strategies by increasing oil and gas production, reflecting a broader shift in the renewable energy landscape.
