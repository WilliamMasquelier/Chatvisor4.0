1. Ørsted has halted the development of its FlagshipONE e-methanol plant in Sweden due to insufficient demand for e-fuels, resulting in a financial loss of 1.5 billion Danish kroner (£172 million).

2. The company is experiencing significant impairments across its projects, totaling 3.9 billion DKK, indicating challenges in its expansion into new technologies and markets.

3. Ørsted's CEO, Mads Nipper, stated that the European liquid e-fuel market is developing slower than anticipated, prompting a strategic shift away from e-methanol projects to focus on renewable hydrogen, which is deemed essential for decarbonizing key industries.

4. The company is also facing delays in its Revolution Wind project in the US, pushing back its commercial operation date from 2025 to 2026, which has contributed to additional financial impairments.

5. Ørsted's recent decisions reflect a broader trend among energy majors, including Shell, to scale back renewable energy projects in response to unfavorable market conditions.
