1. Orsted, in collaboration with Elia Group, is advocating for the development of hybrid offshore projects in Europe, aiming to overcome existing barriers through a proposal that emphasizes regional planning at the sea basin level.

2. The joint proposal presented at the Wind-Europe conference highlights the need for innovative solutions to harness the full renewable potential of European seas, suggesting that hybrid interconnections could facilitate better distribution of green electricity across countries, including non-EU partners like the UK and Norway.

3. Orsted's Regional Head for Europe, Olivia Breese, emphasized the urgency of collaborative efforts to address the challenges of the energy transition, indicating that national solutions alone will not suffice to meet societal energy goals.

4. The proposal outlines four key strategies to promote offshore wind energy development, including prioritizing projects with high economic and ecological potential, establishing regional offshore investment banks, and encouraging private investor participation to streamline financing.

5. The timing of the proposal is strategic, coinciding with upcoming European elections and new legislative initiatives aimed at advancing the Green Deal, reflecting Orsted's proactive approach in shaping the renewable energy landscape in Europe.
