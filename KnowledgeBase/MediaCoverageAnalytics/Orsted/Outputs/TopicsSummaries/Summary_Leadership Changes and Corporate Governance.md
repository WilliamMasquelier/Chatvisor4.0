# 5. Leadership Changes and Corporate Governance

<a name="5-1-overview"></a>

## 5.1. Overview

The media coverage of Ørsted's leadership changes and corporate governance highlights a period of significant turbulence for the company, driven by financial struggles, strategic missteps, and external market pressures. The company underwent multiple executive changes, including the appointment of a new CFO and COO in early 2024, followed by the abrupt departure of CEO Mads Nipper in early 2025. These leadership shifts were largely a response to Ørsted's deteriorating financial position, marked by massive write-downs on U.S. offshore wind projects, an 80% decline in share price, and a reduction in investment plans. The coverage reflects a broader crisis in the offshore wind sector, exacerbated by rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and shifting political landscapes, particularly in the U.S. under the Trump administration. The appointment of Rasmus Errboe as the new CEO signals an attempt to stabilize the company and restore investor confidence, though the long-term strategic direction remains uncertain.

## 5.2. Chronological Analysis

### 5.2.1 Early Coverage

The first major leadership changes at Ørsted occurred in early 2024, when the company appointed Trond Westlie as CFO and Patrick Harnett as COO, effective April 1, 2024. These appointments followed a tumultuous financial year in which Ørsted reported a €2.7 billion loss due to significant write-downs on abandoned offshore wind projects in the U.S. [Energie & Management, February 27, 2024]. The leadership shake-up was a direct response to the dismissal of previous executives Daniel Lerup and Richard Hunter, signaling a strategic shift aimed at improving financial oversight and operational efficiency. Harnett was tasked with implementing a new project operational model focused on risk management and emergency planning, while Westlie brought extensive financial management experience from companies like Möller-Maersk and Telenor [Energie & Management, February 27, 2024].

### 5.2.2 Developing Trends

By early 2025, Ørsted's financial situation had worsened, leading to the resignation of CEO Mads Nipper on January 31, 2025. His departure was attributed to mounting financial losses, including a $1.7 billion write-down on a major U.S. offshore wind project, and an 80% decline in the company's stock price since its peak in 2021 [De Telegraaf, January 31, 2025]. The company faced increasing operational challenges, such as supply chain bottlenecks, rising interest rates, and political opposition in the U.S., particularly under the Trump administration, which had halted offshore wind project approvals [Lefigaro, January 31, 2025]. 

In response to these challenges, Ørsted announced a 25% reduction in its investment plans, suspended its dividend, and implemented job cuts to streamline operations [The Independent, March 2, 2025]. The company also faced criticism from shareholders over its performance, further eroding confidence in its leadership [De Telegraaf, January 31, 2025].

### 5.2.3 Recent Developments

Following Nipper's departure, Ørsted appointed Rasmus Errboe as the new Group President and CEO, effective February 1, 2025 [Energie & Management, January 31, 2025]. Errboe, who had been with the company since 2012, was seen as a stabilizing internal choice, having played a key role in Ørsted's IPO in 2016 and the divestment of its oil and gas business in 2017 [Energie & Management, January 31, 2025]. However, the company’s future strategy remains unclear, as it has halted $20 billion in planned U.S. wind investments and continues to grapple with financial instability [de Volkskrant, February 1, 2025].

## 5.3. Stakeholder Perspectives

### 5.3.1 Ørsted Leadership

Ørsted’s leadership, particularly Chairman Lene Skole, justified the decision to replace Mads Nipper by citing the increasingly difficult landscape of the offshore wind sector and the need for a strategic shift [The Daily Mail, February 1, 2025]. The company’s leadership acknowledged the financial difficulties but emphasized that the transition to renewable energy remains a priority, despite the setbacks [The Daily Telegraph, February 1, 2025].

### 5.3.2 Investors and Shareholders

Investors and shareholders expressed significant concerns over Ørsted’s financial performance, particularly the 80% decline in share price and the massive write-downs on U.S. projects [The Independent, March 2, 2025]. The decision to suspend dividends and cut jobs was seen as a drastic but necessary measure to stabilize the company [The Daily Mail, February 1, 2025]. Some shareholders reportedly lost confidence in Ørsted’s ability to maintain its leadership position in the renewable energy market, given the increasing competition and technological advancements abroad [De Telegraaf, January 31, 2025].

### 5.3.3 Political and Regulatory Bodies

The political climate, particularly in the U.S., played a significant role in Ørsted’s struggles. The Trump administration’s decision to freeze offshore wind project approvals created additional regulatory hurdles, leading to the abandonment of projects such as Ocean Wind 1 and 2 off the New Jersey coast [Lefigaro, January 31, 2025]. This policy shift contributed to Ørsted’s financial losses and forced the company to reconsider its U.S. expansion strategy [The Daily Telegraph, February 1, 2025].

### 5.3.4 Industry Analysts

Industry analysts pointed to broader challenges in the offshore wind sector, including rising costs, supply chain disruptions, and high interest rates, as key factors behind Ørsted’s financial struggles [The Daily Telegraph, February 1, 2025]. Some analysts suggested that Ørsted’s aggressive expansion strategy, particularly in the U.S., may have been overly ambitious given the market uncertainties [de Volkskrant, February 1, 2025].

## 5.4. Implications and Future Outlook

The leadership changes at Ørsted reflect a broader crisis in the offshore wind sector, with financial instability, regulatory challenges, and market uncertainties forcing companies to reassess their strategies. The appointment of Rasmus Errboe as CEO signals an attempt to stabilize the company, but Ørsted’s long-term direction remains uncertain, particularly given its decision to halt major U.S. investments [de Volkskrant, February 1, 2025]. 

The company’s ability to recover will depend on several factors, including its capacity to manage costs, navigate regulatory challenges, and restore investor confidence. The suspension of dividends and job cuts indicate a focus on financial consolidation, but whether these measures will be sufficient to reverse the company’s decline remains to be seen [The Independent, March 2, 2025]. 

Additionally, the political landscape in the U.S. will play a crucial role in Ørsted’s future prospects. If the Trump administration continues to oppose offshore wind projects, Ørsted may need to shift its focus to other markets or explore alternative strategies for growth [Lefigaro, January 31, 2025]. 

Overall, Ørsted’s leadership changes highlight the volatility of the renewable energy sector and the challenges companies face in balancing ambitious sustainability goals with financial viability. The coming months will be critical in determining whether the company can successfully navigate its current crisis and regain its position as a leader in offshore wind energy.
