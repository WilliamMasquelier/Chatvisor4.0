<a name="6-2-1-early-coverage"></a>

### 6.2.1 Early Coverage

The initial media coverage in March 2024 focused on Ørsted's efforts to attract young technicians to Zeeland through the 'Break Out' campaign, addressing workforce shortages in the renewable energy sector [PZC, March 28, 2024]. The company emphasized employee satisfaction and work-life balance, particularly in offshore wind turbine maintenance, which was presented as a high-tech and appealing career path [PZC, March 28, 2024]. However, challenges related to employee integration in Zeeland were also noted, indicating potential social barriers to workforce stability [PZC, March 28, 2024].

In April 2024, Ørsted's decarbonization initiatives gained attention, with the company aiming for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 [Energie & Management, April 15, 2024]. A key milestone was that two-thirds of its strategic suppliers had transitioned to using green energy, demonstrating Ørsted's influence on the renewable energy supply chain [Energie & Management, April 15, 2024]. Additionally, the company collaborated with Dillinger to reduce CO2 emissions from monopile production by up to 60% by 2027/2028, showcasing its commitment to sustainable offshore wind infrastructure [Energie & Management, April 15, 2024].

### 6.2.2 Developing Trends

By mid-2024, Ørsted's focus on technological advancements in offshore wind farm construction became more prominent. In July, the company introduced a new foundation installation method at the Gode Wind 3 offshore wind farm, utilizing jetting technology to reduce noise levels below German regulatory limits [Energie & Management, July 12, 2024]. This innovation eliminated the need for traditional noise reduction systems, such as bubble curtains, and had the potential to make foundation installation cheaper, faster, and quieter [Energie & Management, July 12, 2024]. Ørsted was seeking additional regulatory approvals to expand the use of this technology to other markets [Energie & Management, July 12, 2024].

In August, Ørsted successfully implemented a Heavy Lift Cargo Drone for offshore wind farm operations near Zeeland, significantly reducing the time required to transport heavy materials to turbines [PZC, August 06, 2024]. The drone could deliver safety boxes to 94 turbines in just 15 minutes, compared to the traditional six-hour process requiring three technicians per turbine [PZC, August 06, 2024]. This trial followed a previous test at the Hornsea wind farm in England, reinforcing Ørsted's commitment to operational efficiency [BN/DeStem, August 07, 2024]. However, the company had not yet committed to permanent drone operations, indicating that further evaluations were needed [BN/DeStem, August 07, 2024].

### 6.2.3 Recent Developments

By September 2024, Ørsted's environmental research efforts gained media attention, particularly its collaboration with the University of Essex to study the impact of offshore wind farms on biodiversity, carbon storage, and seabed composition [The Independent, September 01, 2024]. The research aimed to provide critical data for policy decisions and ensure that offshore wind development aligns with environmental sustainability [The Independent, September 01, 2024]. Additionally, the study sought to compare the environmental effects of offshore wind farms with decommissioned oil platforms, highlighting a broader effort to learn from past industrial practices [The Independent, September 01, 2024].

In October 2024, Ørsted's marine ecosystem restoration initiatives were highlighted through its collaboration with Van Oord on the Ocean Health project, which aimed to reintroduce European flat oysters to the North Sea [PZC, October 29, 2024]. The project utilized innovative tetrapod structures to facilitate oyster attachment, making the process more efficient and cost-effective [BN/DeStem, October 31, 2024]. The wind farm Borssele 1 and 2 provided an ideal environment for the oyster reintroduction due to its undisturbed conditions and absence of fishing activities [BN/DeStem, October 31, 2024]. An eight-year monitoring program was established to assess the success of the oyster reefs in improving water quality and biodiversity [PZC, October 29, 2024].
