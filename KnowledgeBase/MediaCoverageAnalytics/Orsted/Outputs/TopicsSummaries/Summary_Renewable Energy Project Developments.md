<a name="2-1-overview"></a>

## 2.1. Overview

The media coverage of Ørsted's renewable energy project developments in 2024 and early 2025 highlights the company's aggressive expansion in offshore wind, solar, and energy storage projects across multiple regions, including the United States, Europe, and the UK. Ørsted has been at the forefront of large-scale offshore wind projects, securing major contracts and partnerships while also facing financial, regulatory, and public opposition challenges. The company has demonstrated a strong commitment to innovation, particularly in hybrid offshore projects, energy storage solutions, and advanced wind turbine technology. However, concerns over financial feasibility, market fluctuations, and local opposition have also been prominent themes in the coverage.

<a name="2-2-1-early-coverage"></a>

### 2.2.1 Early Coverage

In early 2024, Ørsted marked a significant milestone with the launch of the South Fork Wind farm, the first commercial-scale offshore wind project in the United States, developed in partnership with Eversource [The Independent, March 14, 2024]. This project set the stage for further expansion, with Ørsted preparing to commence work on the much larger Revolution Wind project, aimed at powering over 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut [The Independent, March 14, 2024]. Additionally, the company was negotiating contracts for the Sunrise Wind project in New York, which would have an even greater capacity of 600,000 homes [The Independent, March 14, 2024].

At the same time, Ørsted was expanding its presence in the U.S. solar and energy storage market with the construction of the Eleven Mile Solar Center in Arizona, a project integrating solar power with battery storage to enhance energy reliability [The Independent, March 15, 2024]. This project, developed in collaboration with the Salt River Project utility, was designed to supply power to Meta’s data center while also supporting local energy needs [The Independent, March 15, 2024].

### 2.2.2 Developing Trends

By mid-2024, Ørsted had intensified its focus on offshore wind expansion in Europe. The company, in collaboration with Elia Group, advocated for hybrid offshore projects to optimize the wind potential of European seas, emphasizing regional planning and cross-border electricity distribution [Energie & Management, March 22, 2024]. This proposal was strategically timed to align with upcoming European elections and legislative initiatives under the Green Deal [Energie & Management, March 22, 2024].

In Germany, Ørsted made significant progress with the "Gode Wind 3" offshore wind farm, which featured the most powerful wind turbines in the country at 11.5 MW each [Energie & Management, April 9, 2024]. The company also secured investment from Nuveen Infrastructure for half of the project, reflecting a strategic approach to financing large-scale developments [Energie & Management, May 10, 2024]. Following this, Ørsted began work on the 913-MW "Borkum Riffgrund 3" wind farm, the largest in Germany and the first to be built without a guaranteed feed-in tariff, relying instead on long-term Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs) with companies like Amazon and BASF [Energie & Management, June 20, 2024].

In the UK, Ørsted announced the installation of a Tesla-made energy storage system in East Anglia, one of the largest in Europe, to stabilize the energy supply and mitigate price fluctuations [The Daily Telegraph, June 13, 2024]. This project was integrated with the Hornsea 3 offshore wind farm, demonstrating Ørsted’s commitment to combining wind energy with storage solutions [The Daily Telegraph, June 13, 2024].

### 2.2.3 Recent Developments

In the latter half of 2024 and early 2025, Ørsted continued to expand its offshore wind portfolio while facing new challenges. The company secured major contracts in the UK’s renewable energy auction for its Hornsea 3 and Hornsea 4 offshore wind projects, benefiting from revised government policies that increased guaranteed electricity resale prices [The Telegraph, September 3, 2024]. However, this raised concerns about rising energy costs for consumers, with critics arguing that foreign energy firms like Ørsted were profiting at the expense of UK households [The Telegraph, September 4, 2024].

In Poland, Ørsted, in partnership with PGE, was awarded the Baltica 2 offshore wind farm project, valued at €7.15 billion, marking a significant step in Poland’s goal of reaching 18 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2040 [La Libre, January 30, 2025]. The project, featuring 170 wind turbines with a total capacity of 1.5 GW, was financed through Ørsted’s own funds, reflecting the company’s strong financial position [Le Figaro, January 30, 2025].

Meanwhile, Ørsted faced local opposition in Germany, where its planned wind farm near Bad Orb encountered resistance from local stakeholders who argued that it threatened the region’s wellness tourism industry [Energie & Management, January 20, 2025]. The opposition launched a media campaign against the project, portraying Ørsted as a threat to the local environment [Energie & Management, January 20, 2025].

## 2.3. Stakeholder Perspectives

<a name="2-3-1-ørsted-leadership"></a>

### 2.3.1 Ørsted Leadership

Ørsted’s CEO, Mads Nipper, has emphasized the importance of energy storage solutions in maximizing the availability of renewable energy, particularly in projects like the Eleven Mile Solar Center in Arizona [The Independent, March 15, 2024]. Duncan Clark, Ørsted’s UK boss, highlighted the role of battery storage in optimizing renewable energy use, particularly in the Hornsea 3 project [The Daily Telegraph, June 13, 2024]. David Hardy, CEO for Ørsted Americas, underscored the significance of the Sunrise Wind project in helping New York meet its clean energy targets while strengthening the local workforce [The Independent, July 17, 2024].

<a name="2-3-2-government-and-regulatory-bodies"></a>

### 2.3.2 Government and Regulatory Bodies

The UK government, under Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, has supported offshore wind expansion, awarding Ørsted major contracts in the latest renewable energy auction [The Telegraph, September 3, 2024]. However, critics have raised concerns about the financial implications for consumers, arguing that increased subsidies for offshore wind projects could lead to higher household energy bills [The Telegraph, September 4, 2024]. In Poland, the government has positioned the Baltica 2 project as a key component of its long-term energy strategy, aiming to reduce reliance on fossil fuels [La Libre, January 30, 2025].

### 2.3.3 Local Communities and Environmental Groups

Local opposition to Ørsted’s wind farm near Bad Orb, Germany, has been vocal, with stakeholders arguing that the project threatens the region’s tourism industry and was approved without sufficient community consultation [Energie & Management, January 20, 2025]. In the U.S., environmental groups like Protect Our Coast-NJ have used incidents such as the Nantucket turbine blade collapse to advocate against offshore wind projects, potentially influencing public perception and regulatory decisions [The Independent, July 17, 2024].

<a name="2-4-implications-and-future-outlook"></a>

## 2.4. Implications and Future Outlook

Ørsted’s continued expansion in offshore wind and energy storage positions it as a global leader in renewable energy. However, financial feasibility remains a key challenge, as seen in the company’s withdrawal from two offshore wind projects in New Jersey due to economic concerns [The Independent, July 17, 2024]. The increasing reliance on Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs) and market-driven projects, such as "Borkum Riffgrund 3," suggests a shift away from government subsidies towards private sector financing [Energie & Management, June 20, 2024].

The company’s involvement in large-scale projects like Baltica 2 in Poland and Hornsea 3 in the UK indicates strong growth potential, but rising energy costs and public opposition could impact future developments. Ørsted’s focus on hybrid offshore projects and energy storage solutions reflects an effort to address grid stability challenges, which will be crucial as renewable energy adoption increases [Energie & Management, March 22, 2024; The Daily Telegraph, June 13, 2024].

Looking ahead, Ørsted’s ability to navigate regulatory landscapes, secure financing, and address public concerns will determine the success of its renewable energy initiatives. The company’s proactive approach in shaping policy discussions, as seen in its advocacy for hybrid offshore projects in Europe, suggests that it will continue to play a leading role in the global energy transition [Energie & Management, March 22, 2024].
