This unexpected write-down has led to an 11% drop in its stock price, following an initial plunge of 18%. Investors had hoped that the worst was over after the company’s 2023 financial struggles, but these new impairments have further eroded confidence in Ørsted’s financial stability. The company’s stock has already lost around 80% of its value since its peak in January 2021, representing a market capitalization loss of approximately €65 billion, half of which is borne by the Danish government, which holds a significant stake in the company. This continued financial deterioration raises concerns about Ørsted’s ability to maintain its leadership in the renewable energy sector. [Les Echos, Sylvie Ramadier, January 21, 2025]
- Ørsted’s stock price plummeted by 18% after the company announced significant asset write-downs totaling approximately €1.7 billion. The company cited rising interest rates in the U.S. as a key factor negatively impacting its capital costs, leading to a devaluation of its American assets. Additionally, Ørsted has had to write down further due to difficulties in developing several large offshore wind farms in the U.S. This financial hit has alarmed investors, further damaging Ørsted’s already struggling stock performance and raising concerns about the viability of its U.S. expansion strategy.

Opponents have launched an expensive media campaign, including full-page ads in major German and Danish newspapers, accusing Ørsted of disregarding local interests and threatening the region’s identity as a health and wellness destination. This resistance could lead to legal challenges and delays, complicating Ørsted’s efforts to expand its onshore wind portfolio in Germany. [Energie & Management, Manfred Fischer, January 20, 2025]
