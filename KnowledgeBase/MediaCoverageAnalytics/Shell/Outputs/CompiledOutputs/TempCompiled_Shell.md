Shell said its fourth-quarter earnings took a hit of between $US2.5bn and $US4.5bn ($7.7bn) in impairments, offset 
by significantly higher gas trading, while its overall production volumes are on track to meet targets.
The London-based energy giant said the impairments were primarily driven by macro developments as well as 
portfolio choices, including its Singapore chemicals and products assets, which it has been trying to sell.
The FTSE 100 leader by market capitalisation also said it expected cash flow from operations to take a hit from a 
$US900m charge related to timing of payments of emissions.
Shell expects to report integrated gas production between 880,000 and 920,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day for the 
fourth quarter, which would be in line with its guided range of 870,000-930,000 BOE a day, and compares with 
third-quarter production of 900,000 BOE a day.
Fourth-quarter volumes of liquefied natural gas are expected to be between 6.9 million and 7.3 million tonnes 
compared with 6.9 million tonnes in the preceding quarter. Shell previously expected LNG volumes of 6.7 million-
7.3 million tonnes.
Gains from integrated gas trading are expected to be significantly higher quarter-on-quarter, while the trading result 
from chemicals and crude oil refineries is seen to be significantly lower. The former segment was expected to make 
an adjusted earnings loss, the company said.
However, the expected uptick in fourth-quarter gas trading comes despite declining oil and gas prices throughout 
the period, with oil hitting a five-month low in early December, reflecting supply and demand concerns despite 
support from geopolitical uncertainty.
Upstream production - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - is expected to meet the guided range of 1.75 
million to 1.95 million BOE a day at 1.83 million to 1.93 million a day. It reported 1.75 million BOE a day in the third 
quarter.

Elsewhere, Saudi Aramco said it would cut crude prices to all regions, including its largest market in Asia - a move 
that comes amid weaker global oil prices and increased production by producers outside the Organisation of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries.
After a summer rally attributed in large part to Saudi Arabia's decision to implement a production cut of one million 
barrels a day on top of existing cuts by other members of OPEC and its allies, including Russia, crude fell sharply in 
the fourth quarter. Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ have extended cuts into 2023.
West Texas Intermediate crude, the US benchmark, fell more than 21 per cent in the fourth quarter of the calendar 
year to post a 2023 decline of 10.7 per cent. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell around 19 per cent in the fourth 
quarter to lose 10.3 per cent in 2023. Dow Jones newswires

British oil major Shell has suspended all shipments through the Red Sea indefinitely after US and UK strikes on 
Yemen's Houthi rebels triggered fears of further escalation, according to sources.
The West's targeting of the Iranian-ally militia came after the Houthis launched dozens of missiles and drones at 
commercial vessels around the Red Sea and the nearby Bab el-Mandeb. The militia has said the attacks are in 
response to the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip.
About 12 per cent of total global seaborne oil trade goes through the Red Sea. Last month, a tanker chartered by 
Shell to move Indian jet fuel was targeted by a drone in the Red Sea and harassed by Houthi boats, according to 
shipping officials.
Shell declined to comment on the suspension of transit and the attack. But the company last week halted all 
crossings over concerns that a successful -attack could trigger a massive spill in the region, as well as present risks 
to the safety of crews on the ships, sources said.
Shell joins other global shippers in deciding to avoid the Red Sea, including other energy companies.
BP last month said it would pause all shipments through the key shipping lane, and Qatar Energy did the same this 
week.
Qatar, which has acted as a mediator for the Houthis in the past, halted the use of the Red Sea route for its 
liquefied natural gas exports for fear of being caught in the conflict, according to a Qatari energy official and 
shipping trackers.
Recent Houthi attacks, initially directed against Israeli-linked vessels, have rattled global markets, upended 
international shipping routes and become more indiscriminate. The rebels have attacked vessels from 
containerships to tankers moving sanctioned Russian oil, as the global shipping nexus complicates their ability to 
identify specific targets.

They have vowed to continue their campaign against US and international targets in the region in response to 
Israel's actions in Gaza. "Anyone attempting to hinder us from doing so will fail," a Houthi official said on Monday. 
After the US-led strike, several captains of chartered vessels heading for Europe via the Suez Canal have refused 
to enter the Red Sea, forcing them to sail through a lengthy route around southern Africa. The Singapore ship 
registry and Intertanko, an industry lobby group, said the waterway should be avoided.

Leaders Paul Keating reserves special praise for visionary change-makers in banking, mining and 
entrepreneurship, writes Michael Stutchbury.
When asked to name the business people who impressed him the most during his long political career, Paul 
Keating starts with Keith Campbell, former head of the Hooker real estate company. Campbell's landmark financial 
system review in the late 1970s laid out the intellectual case for Labor's financial deregulation and the floating of the 
dollar.
Rod Carnegie, now 91, also draws praise from Keating in an exclusive interview with The Australian Financial 
Review to mark his 80th birthday. Carnegie set up McKinsey in Australia and sought to Australianise CRA, now 
known as Rio Tinto, as CEO in the 1980s. "He was a progressive thinking guy and an economic nationalist," 
Keating says.
On the other hand, it's hard to pick a banker given the banks hold public licences, Keating says.
Another on Keating's list of business greats is former BHP boss Marius Kloppers, who "broke the back" of 
negotiating contract pricing in 2010 in favour of using market spot prices for Australia's iron ore exports. "You've got 
to give him big, big marks for that," Keating says.
Pressed about his complaint about a lack of outward-looking entrepreneurs in the modern Australian economy that 
he helped create, Keating accepts there are some. He points to Fortescue Minerals' Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest, 
along with Atlassian founders Mike Cannon-Brookes and Scott Farquhar, and Canva founders Melanie Perkins and 
Cliff Obrecht.
But the business person that merits a story is Ian McLennan, general manager and chairman of BHP between 1967 
and 1977. McLennan helped drive the company's search for oil in Bass Strait and gas in the North West Shelf.
The story takes place in 1975 - just after the defeat of the Whitlam government - when Keating was appointed 
shadow minister for minerals and resources.
Page 2 of 2
Movers, shakers caught PM's eye
McLennan caught a train to Keating's electorate office in Bankstown, a suburb in south-west Sydney, on a Saturday 
morning. He told the young Labor frontbencher that BHP had a chance of buying the exploration leases of the 
troubled British oil company, Burmah, in the highly prospective North West Shelf.
But with the prospect of a very long lead time for the major gas development, McLennan said BHP would not make 
the investment if the Labor opposition held to the policy of its previous resources minister, Rex Connor, that the gas 
should be controlled by the government and used for local industry rather than be exported to Japan.
"I said, 'Sir Ian, you will be very pleased with my answer'," Keating said. "I thought that Rex had made huge 
mistakes in this because this is a gas-prone continent. And anyone who puts a contract before us, we should sign 
and anyone who wants to capitalise on it, we should grab in a foot tackle and get their signature on the page."
That convinced BHP to buy part of Burmah's stake in what became Australia's biggest ever resource project. And 
so began the nation's liquefied natural gas export industry.
Keating then wrote support for the North West Shelf project into the Labor Party's policy platform at its 1977 
conference in Perth. The other part of the stake was bought by Shell, which played a big role in building the project. 
Keating recalls travelling to Tokyo three times with Shell's Ric Charlton to talk to Japanese bankers and gas 
buyers. And he was impressed with Shell Australia boss and International Olympic Committee member Kevan 
Gosper. AFR

Highlight: Fossil fuel majors are choosing profits over plans to bring a clean future closer.
Body
This month, Shell made its move. The world's second-largest oil and gas company and largest LNG producer 
announced it was watering down its climate targets, its chief executive Wael Sawan fretting to Reuters that it was 
"perilous" for Shell to set 2035 emission reduction targets because, "there is too much uncertainty at the moment in 
the energy transition trajectory".
Voicing his confidence that fossils would remain integral to the global energy mix in the longer-term Sawan added 
that, "there is going to be a multidimensional energy system in the future, [and] oil and gas will continue to have an 
important role in stabilising that system for a long, long, long time to come".

"We are trying to focus our company, our organisation, and our shareholders on a waypoint that's much clearer ... 
which is 2030," Sawan said. He also announced a reduction in the company's 2030 targets.
In 2020, as oil prices plunged towards zero, BP was at the forefront of a push by the oil and gas majors to remake 
themselves as "diversified energy" companies and drive faster into a renewable future.
Its then chief executive Bernard Looney announced that the company would not only reach net zero by 2050, but 
that it would actively lobby for international carbon taxes.
But a lot has changed since then. Looney was moved on, fairly unceremoniously, by his board in September 2023.
More significantly, Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022, effectively knocking the second-largest fossil 
fuel exporter on earth out of the West's oil and gas market. By 2022 crude oil prices had surged to more than 
US$120 ($184) a barrel, and it remains healthily above $80 a barrel today.
In February last year, BP backtracked. During a quarterly earnings report BP announced that it had made a record 
profit of US$27.7 billion over the previous year, more than double its 2021 profit, and that it was reducing its goals 
to cut oil production.

In March last year, ExxonMobil abandoned its research to create low emissions fuel from algae. Since 2009 the 
company had spent US$350 million on the effort, which it had used extensively in marketing to burnish its green 
credentials.
"The dirty secret nobody talks about is how much all this is going to cost and who's willing to pay for it,"  chief 
executive Darren Woods told Fortune last month of the world's quest to decarbonise. "The people who are 
generating those emissions need to be aware of and pay the price for generating those emissions. That is ultimately 
how you solve the problem."
That might be the case, but climate observers were unimpressed, particularly because ExxonMobil was already 
infamous for doing accurate cutting edge early research into climate change, only to downplay the science publicly.
"It's like a drug lord blaming everyone but himself for drug problems," Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at 
Columbia Business School, told The Guardian.
Then, as though to clarify the fossil sector's position, or perhaps to take its gloves off, the chief executive of the 
biggest of them all, Saudi Aramco, spoke even more bluntly during a panel discussion at a global energy 
conference in Texas earlier this month.
"We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas," Amin Nasser said, to applause from the audience.
"A transition strategy reset is urgently needed, and my proposal is this: We should abandon the fantasy of phasing 
out oil and gas and instead invest in them adequately reflecting realistic demand assumptions."
Nasser spoke of "hard realities" and said that "in the real world, the current transition strategy is visibly failing on 
most fronts". He said alternative energy sources had failed to displace hydrocarbons at scale, noting that oil 
demand had increased by 100 million barrels of oil equivalent a day this century and would reach an all-time high 
this year.
The increasing energy needs of developing nations would see demand remain high, and grow until 2045, he said.
"We should phase in new energy sources and technologies when they are genuinely ready, economically 
competitive and with the right infrastructure," Nasser said.
"All this strengthens the view that peak oil and gas is unlikely for some time to come, let alone 2030," he said. "No 
one is betting the farm on that."
For governments and policy-makers the problem with Nasser's real world is it conflicts with the other one, which 
has just sweltered through its hottest year in history due to carbon dioxide emissions, 70 per cent of which come 
from the burning of fossil fuels.
In this real world, global leaders gathered in Dubai in December for climate talks and after two weeks of hard fought 
negotiations agreed to begin "transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable 
manner ... so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science".
The language was significant because fossil fuels have never before been explicitly referred to in a declaration of 
the UN climate talks, but talk of "transitioning away" fell far short of the language that around 130 of the 198 
countries represented at the talks had called for. Those countries wanted fossil fuel companies and their invested 
to be put on notice with an agreement to "phase out" oil and gas.

"We have made an incremental advancement over business as usual when what we really needed is an 
exponential step change in our actions," said Anne Rasmussen from Samoa, the lead negotiator for the Alliance of Page 3 of 4

Small Islands States, to a standing ovation on the floor of the plenary session. "It is not enough for us to reference 
the science and then make agreements that ignore what the science is telling us we need to do."
The US climate envoy, John Kerry, who pushed hard to secure the compromise, was more upbeat. "For the very 
first time at a COP, fossil fuels have been on the table as a major part of our negotiations," he said. "And the 
decision that came out of this clearly embraces transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, so as to 
achieve net zero by 2050."
Nasser's position also contradicts that of the International Energy Agency, an intergovernmental organisation that 
has traditionally been closely identified with the fossil fuel industry.
More recently in its analysis the IEA has been blunt about the need for the world to transition, and about its capacity 
to do so.
In its annual World Energy Outlook report last year the IEA predicted that fossil fuel demand would peak by 2030, 
before entering a plateau and slow decline.
"The transition to clean energy is happening worldwide, and it's unstoppable," IEA chief Fatih Birol said in a 
statement at the time. "Claims that oil and gas represent safe or secure choices for the world's energy and climate 
future look weaker than ever."
As the IEA's position on fossils has drifted from that of the industry, criticism of it has ramped up. In Dubai the 
OPEC Secretary General Haitham Al Ghais  accused Birol of "unjustly vilifying" the industry as being behind the 
climate crisis.
But the IEA's analysis of the industry remains world leading, and its data suggest that whatever the fossil majors 
are saying about long-term demand, their shareholders might not hold the same confidence.
An IEA report on energy investment showed a significant decline in the amount of cash the industry was reinvesting 
in its production. Between 2008 and 2017 the figure hovered between 80 and 100 per cent, then it declines. Last 
year the sector ploughed just 50 per cent of its cash back into the business, with the rest being doled out to 
shareholders.
"Uncertainties over longer-term demand, worries about costs, and pressure from many investors and owners to 
focus on returns rather than production growth mean only large Middle Eastern national oil companies are 
spending much more in 2023 than they did in 2022, and they are the only subset of the industry spending more 
than pre-pandemic levels," read the IEA's analysis.
This is significant because the energy industry typically outlays vast amounts of capital exploiting a resource - say a 
new oil or gas field - and then uses the bulk of the return to develop the next one. Now it appears shareholders are 
demanding more of the cash is diverted to them rather than reinvested in future production.
"It looks like an industry that is enjoying a very profitable but ultimately terminal decline," says the energy analyst 
Tim Buckley, an advocate of renewables.
"We are still addicted to fossil fuels, we can't stop overnight, but we are stopping," he says.
It also brings us back to those climate talks in Dubai. When the deal was struck the COP28 president Sultan Ahmed 
al-Jaber, himself an oil executive, celebrated it as historic, but added that it would be judged on its 
implementation."We are what we do, not what we say," he told the crowded final session of the summit.

May 2nd, 2024 ( International Business Times Australia  - Delivered by  Newstex )
British oil and gas giant Shell announced Thursday that first-quarter earnings fell but beat expectations in a 
"strong" performance, and unveiled another bumper stock buyback.
Adjusted earnings sank almost a fifth to $7.7 billion from a year earlier but this smashed market expectations of 
$6.5 billion, while cash flow from operating activities hit $13.3 billion.
Adjusted profit stood at $9.6 billion a year earlier when Shell saw a derivative inflow that was not repeated in the 
first quarter of 2024 due to lower prices in commodity derivatives, according to the company.
The energy major, which is investing heavily in renewables, insisted it remained on track to become a net zero 
emissions company by 2050, but its results sparked fresh anger from the green lobby.
Shell also unveiled a fresh $3.5-billion stock buyback and forecast capital expenditure this year would reach 
between $22 billion and $24 billion, it added in a results statement.
"Shell delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial performance, demonstrating our continued 
focus on delivering more value with less emissions," said chief executive Wael Sawan.
"We continue to deliver on our... targets, giving us the confidence to commence another $3.5-billion buyback 
programme for the next three months."
Thursday's news sent its share price one percent higher in late morning deals on the rising London stock market.
Shell added that net profit, or profit after taxation, declined about 15 percent to $7.4 billion in the reporting period.
Revenues slid 16 percent to $74.7 billion following a sharp drop in gas prices, which had spiked following key 
producer Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Shell had already warned last month that it expected lower natural gas sales in the first quarter after a particularly 
strong performance in the final three months of 2023.

Shell Logs 'Strong' Quarter As Earnings Fall But Top Expectations
"Shell's produced yet another quarter of staggering cash flows," said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at 
stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, in response to the results.
"Higher margins and uptime at its refineries more than offset lower earnings in the upstream and integrated gas 
divisions.
"The strong cash generation is enabling Shell to reduce debt, reward shareholders and continue investing into the 
business."
The company was, however, slammed by climate campaigners over its huge profit from fossil fuels.
"On a day where climate leaders are negotiating in Abu Dhabi how to help the world's poorest meet the 
skyrocketing costs of climate loss and damage, Shell continues to bank billions from flogging the fuels that are 
driving the crisis," said Charlie Kronick, senior climate advisor at Greenpeace UK.
"With countries experiencing the worst impacts of climate change among those least responsible for it, the case for 
making polluters pay for the damage their industry is causing could not be clearer."
A Shell spokesperson responded that the company was seeking to help the world transition to low-carbon energy.
"We agree the world needs urgent climate action. Shell is playing an important role in the energy transition by 
providing the energy needed today while helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future," a 
spokesperson told AFP.
"We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making Shell a 
significant investor in the energy transition."

Highlight: The oil super majors are eyeing shifting their primary stock exchange listings to New York as a stronger 
push to reduce fossil fuels in their home markets weighs on their share prices.
Body
There's a yawning gap between the valuations of US oil and gas majors and their UK and European counterparts. 
That's prompted a debate over whether the more lowly rated energy giants should switch their primary stock 
exchange listing to New York.
The discussion was given a sharper edge late last month when the chief executive of France's Total Energies, 
Patrick Pouyanné, said the century-old super major, founded by the French government, was seriously considering 
a shift of its listing, albeit not its headquarters.
Shell, which shifted its headquarters from The Hague and unwound its dual listing to base itself and its shares in 
London in 2022, is known to have also seriously pondered a shift in its primary listing three years ago.
BP has said a move is not on its agenda but would inevitably have done some analysis on it. There's also been 
speculation that its relatively low sharemarket valuation could make it a target for one of the more highly rated oil 
giants, which could effectively produce a transfer of its listing.
The driver of the discussion is a significant disparity in the sharemarket valuations of European and UK energy 
companies relative to their US counterparts like Exxon and Chevron, which trade on cashflow multiples up to 50 per 
cent higher than their transatlantic rivals.
Not only does that make their shareholders happier, but it lowers the US majors' cost of equity, enables them to 
invest more productively and makes acquisitions more attractive. Exxon bought Pioneer Natural Resources for 
$US60 billion ($91 billion) last year, while Chevron announced an agreed all-share $US53 billion for Hess Corp.
The smaller strand in the explanation for the varying valuations relates to the markets themselves.
The New York stock market is much bigger and deeper than London and the fragmented European exchanges and 
is supported by a far larger pool of institutional and retail investors. Historically, that has produced higher valuations 
relative to European peer companies.
With the US being the world's largest producer and exporter of oil and gas, there is also stronger interest in the 
sector there and better support from US and international investors.
Page 2 of 3
It's not easy being green for UK and European oil giants
While the market dynamics have seen some UK and European companies, particularly (but not exclusively) tech 
and biotech companies, shift their listings to the US, they are not the primary reason energy companies have 
considered the move.
Nor is the post-Brexit decline in the status of London's market a major factor, although what was once the global 
hub for resources investment has been fading as some of its larger listings, like BHP's UK listing, have disappeared 
or - as will happen if BHP succeeds with its Anglo-American bid -- London-listed miners have been acquired.
The US companies are pursuing growth strategies. Their trans-Atlantic competitors aren't.
The more material influence on the oil majors' valuations than the nature of their domestic markets is the extent to 
which policymakers and investors in the UK and Europe have responded to climate change and the way that has, 
and is, shaping the growth strategies of companies like TotalEnergies, Shell and BP.
Exxon and Chevron are aggressively growing their oil and gas production volumes and investing in increasing their 
output even as, across the Atlantic, TotalEnergies, Shell and BP are pursuing carbon emissions reduction-related 
strategies that will eventually see their volumes decline.
The US companies are pursuing growth strategies. Their transatlantic competitors aren't.
Shell and BP have received significant criticism recently for slowing the rate at which their fossil fuel volumes are 
scheduled to fall.
BP, for instance, had a 2020 plan to cut its oil and gas production by 40 per cent by 2030 from 2019. Last year, the 
target was shifted to 25 per cent by 2030, with the 35 to 40 per cent target for its own carbon emissions revised to 
between 20 and 30 per cent.
Shell, which had said it would reduce its output by 1 or 2 per cent a year through to the end of the decade, last year 
restated its plan.
It now expects flat volumes through to 2030 and, where it had planned to reduce investment in oil and gas and 
increase its spending on low-carbon products, it will now invest $US40 billion in oil and gas by 2035, against the 
$US10 to $US15 billion it will spend in those low-carbon products.
The backlash against BP and Shell was strong because European and UK fund managers, retail investors and their 
governments are far more committed to environmental, social and governance policies than most US fund 
managers and other investors.
In the US, where President Joe Biden has presided over a massive increase in US oil and gas production and 
Donald Trump is promising to "drill, baby, drill" if he regains the presidency, there has recently been something of a 
backlash against ESG investment policies.
The stronger emissions reduction frameworks in Europe and the UK (and successful legal actions by environmental 
activists) have forced their oil and gas companies to pursue strategies that have resulted in them constraining their 
oil and gas investment and production while building a presence in greener technologies and fuels.
From the companies' perspective - and that of prospective investors less concerned about fossil fuels - the pressure 
to reduce their oil and gas production and invest in renewables and hydrogen will deliver lower returns than the 
more aggressively pro-fossil fuel strategies pursued by Exxon and Chevron.
When BP unveiled its new timetable for responding to climate change, it said that it generated returns on 
investment of 15 to 20 per cent from its fossil fuel projects. The returns from bioenergy were about 15 per cent, but 
they were only 6 to 8 per cent from renewables like solar and wind. It's not surprising that it decided to invest more 
in oil and gas and biofuels than in renewables.Page 3 of 3
It's not easy being green for UK and European oil giants
There's a relatively recent view among the majors, one that arguably was held earlier and more strongly by the US 
companies, that the transition to cleaner energy is going to take longer and, if it is to be relatively smooth, will 
require more investment in fossil fuels to maintain energy supply than was once projected.
That view doesn't sit well with ESG-sensitive European or British investors. At the same time, the significant and 
still-growing presence of lower-returning assets in their portfolios and the absence of the production growth 
strategies of Exxon and Chevron deter those investors less fussed about investing in fossil fuels.
TotalEnergies, which has far more US investors than Europeans and whose biggest exposure to oil and gas is in 
the US, has less of a discount relative to Exxon and Chevron than the UK companies. But it believes that, if it were 
valued in line with them, there would be a very substantial uplift.
But as a French national champion, TotalEnergies would face significant obstacles to moving its listing - as might 
Shell and BP - from governments determined to retain their flagship companies, retain their corporate offices and 
maintain the size and relevance of their equity markets.

Body
The biggest company traded on the London Stock Exchange, Shell, is pushing an Australian court to clear it of $99 
million in allegedly unpaid taxes that stem from its $3.5 billion exit from the former Woodside Petroleum.
The 2017 share sale ended Shell's more than 30-year investment in Woodside, completing a near decade-long 
effort to reduce its 35 per cent shareholding to nil. The sale of its final 13.3 per cent stake netted Shell about $3.5 
billion, but the commissioner of taxation ruled in February it had understated its profits from the sell-down.
Federal Court filings obtained by The Australian Financial Review show the Tax Office believes the company 
should have declared a capital gain $193.9 million higher than first flagged in the 2017 sale. It also took aim at a 
2014 share sale where it found the gain was $135.7 million higher than declared.
Shell has appealed the ruling, with a spokeswoman saying Shell "complies with all its legal and taxation obligations 
and is committed to paying the right amount of tax in all countries in which we operate".
"Shell has a co-operative relationship with the ATO, where we discuss business activity and taxation matters on a 
proactive, transparent basis," she said. "It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time."
The nearly $330 million in additional capital gains would, at the company tax rate of 30 per cent, mean Shell owes 
at face value $99 million to the Tax Office for the disputed years.
The major oil and gas producers are "now among the largest taxpayers in Australia", the ATO said last November.
"Payments from this sector have grown markedly in the 2022-23 income tax year to in excess of $11 billion," the 
ATO said at the time. Receipts from the energy sector made up more than two-thirds of the $6.4 billion paid by 
multinational companies in the period.
An ATO spokeswoman said: "The ATO cannot comment on any current matter before the Federal Court," in 
response to Shell's appeal.

The Financial Review understands that Shell thinks its shares in Woodside should be treated at the lower amount 
due to transitional changes to the capital gains regime that were introduced in 1997 following the acquisition of its 
stake in 1985. The matter is set for a case management hearing on July 29.
Shell is one of the world's largest oil and gas producers, and is involved in seven major domestic projects, 
including the Gorgon natural gas project off the coast of Western Australia.
The Australian outpost posted a profit of $US632.7 million ($947 million) in the 2023 calendar year, filings to the 
corporate regulator show, less than a third of the $US2.7 billion reported only a year prior.
The accounts also show Shell Australia paid $US37 million in tax last year.

Highlight: Shell's head of strategy says the chances of meeting the global carbon emissions targets depend on 
two crucial factors.
Body
To meet global carbon emissions goals, domestic and geopolitical policies have to align to create a pathway to net-
zero emissions by 2050. In the world in which we currently live, that looks unlikely.
Global emissions targets are already being missed, the mix of geopolitical tensions and domestic policies is muffling 
the impact that China's dominant clean energy technologies could have, and in the wake of the pandemic and 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, energy security has been prioritised over emissions, particularly in Europe.
It's not all doom and gloom though. Shell's international vice president for strategy, insights and scenarios, Laszlo 
Varro, says the transition to net zero will succeed or fail depending on how well two "global cleavage points" are 
managed.
One is the financial gap between the Western world, which is investing heavily in clean energy technologies - about 
90 per cent of the global investment in those technologies is being made by the West and China - and the 
developing world.
The other is what Varro refers to as the "technology interface," or being able to leverage China's "unique 
capabilities" within a "challenging" geopolitical context.
Varro, who's in Australia to speak at an Australian Energy Producers conference in Perth this week, says there has 
been a surge in clean energy investment in China and a remarkable inflow of investment in the sustainable finance 
sector in the Western world. About 85 per cent of that money, however, stays in the Western world.
Canadian pension fund buying a Swedish wind farm, " he said. "Whereas last year, green bonds in Africa were 0.1 
per cent of the total green bond deployment."
The developing world, where populations are growing even as those in developed economies and China are 
flatlining or shrinking, doesn't have the funds to finance a transition to clean energy and, Varro says, there is no 
time and no carbon budget (if net zero is to be achieved as targeted) for it to have a conventional industrialisation 
and then make that transition.
The good news, he said, is that the technology that makes a transition plausible is solar and most developing 
countries are close to the equator. Scale "leapfrogging" - largely bypassing fossil fuel-based energy systems and 
Page 2 of 3
The two major threats to a 'net zero' world
jumping straight to solar or hydro while using natural gas as the reserve - is already occurring in Africa and 
elsewhere.
A two-thirds renewables, one-third natural gas combination produces roughly 100 kg of carbon dioxide per 
megawatt of power, or less than half the current European or US average, Varro said.
(Varro and his team at Shell, a major gas producer, see the impact of electric cars resulting in peak oil demand 
somewhere between 2025 and 2035, but see a significant future for natural gas - for use in heavy industry or as 
reserve power for renewable systems that are weather dependent - even in a net-zero environment, with carbon 
capture and storage or removal playing a role).
'A London every quarter'
Unfortunately, while the developing world might be leapfrogging its way towards cleaner energy, it is also rapidly 
urbanising and building the infrastructure to accommodate the large shifts in populations towards urban centres.
"Urbanisation is currently running at the speed of a London every quarter," Varro said.
"This is the people who live in their villages and move to Cairo, or Nairobi or Jakarta or Karachi. That's a London 
every quarter and that is concrete and steel and glass and plastics and aluminium. All these are very energy-
intensive commodities; altogether representing around 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions."
There's also that paucity of investment for clean energy in the developing world. Varro says Shell's best estimate is 
that the developing world needs about seven times the level of clean energy investment that is occurring within the 
developed world.
And that is difficult to imagine, he said, given the segmentation of the global financial system - which makes it a 
factor that could cause the transition to net-zero emissions to fail.
The maths of net zero are quite daunting. In 2021, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that to 
achieve the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees by 2050 the carbon budget - the cumulative emissions - 
would be 500 gigatonnes (Gt).
From the starting point of January 1, 2020 to the end of 2022, however, there has already been about 120 Gt of 
emissions. With annual global emissions of more than 40 Gt in 2023, you don't have to be Einstein to see how 
challenging keeping within, or anywhere close to, that emissions budget will be and how significant a role 
developing economies - and China - will have in the success or failure of the transition.
Geopolitics, therefore, represents the other major threat.
China leads the world in the mass production of clean-energy technologies, whether it's EVs, batteries, solar 
panels, wind turbines or the processing of the critical minerals required.
Its economy is also still heavily dependent on coal, despite a massive state-directed and subsidised deployment of 
clean-power technologies. Varro said China's domestic coal-mining output last year increased by more than 
Australia's entire exports of LNG.
China is, however, the largest EV manufacturer in the world and the EV market share in its domestic market is 
approaching 50 per cent. That will affect its own emissions and, to the extent that it is able to export its EVs, those 
of third countries.
This month's announcement of new punitive tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, batteries, solar cells and critical 
miners by the Biden administration - made to protect the massive investments in green technologies sparked by 
America's Inflation Reduction Act and also influenced by the domestic political sensitivity of the US auto industry in 
an election year - is being criticised outside America because of the impact it will have on the takeup of EVs and 
other clean energy technologies, and therefore on the rate at which carbon emissions are reduced.Page 3 of 3
The two major threats to a 'net zero' world
The higher prices for electric cars built in the US or Europe (which is close to imposing its own tariffs on Chinese 
EVs) and the need to develop their own critical minerals and battery supply chains will slow the takeup of EVs in the 
US and Europe.
'Predictable surprise'
The "next predictable surprise" is a flood of cheap Chinese EVs into developing economies, says Varro.
China's clean energy "cluster" has, he said, genuinely unique capabilities and, given the challenging geopolitical 
context, how the tensions are resolved is one of the key uncertainties, with the potential to facilitate or slow down 
the global energy transition.
How the financial gap between the Western world and the developing world, and China's unique capabilities are 
managed can therefore "make a difference between success or failure," says Varro.
While he thinks there are plausible routes to net zero, they will involve massive and disruptive government 
interventions in energy systems, economies and societies and a reduction in geopolitical tensions that have been 
intensifying rather than waning.
Today, those outcomes do seem unlikely.

Body
Shell has dragged resources giants Woodside and Paladin Resources to court after being lumped with an $86.5 
million clean-up bill for the Northern Endeavour oil platform, claiming the bill should never have been its to pay.
According to a writ lodged in the WA Supreme Court, Shell claims it was forced to pay assessment notices issued 
by the Australian Taxation Office in 2023 and 2024 totalling $86.5 million in February 2024.
The payment demand was made under an offshore petroleum levy enacted by the federal government in 2022 in 
direct response to the costs associated with the unmanned vessel.
But Shell claims it should never have been saddled with that clean-up bill, pointing to a clause allegedly buried in 
the share purchase deal it inked with Woodside and Paladin more than a decade ago it argues rendered the two 
companies liable.
Shell claims both Woodside and Paladin were to reimburse Shell for any claims arising from or in connection with 
the venture.
Woodside, Shell and BHP established a joint venture in the late 1990s after being granted exploration and 
petroleum production licenses over the Corallina and Laminaria oil fields in the Timor Sea, about 550 kilometres 
west north-west of Darwin.
Under the joint venture, led by Woodside as majority owner and operator, the trio built the Northern Endeavour 
floating production vessel, which was permanently moored to the seabed.
Woodside and Paladin bought Shell out before handing the floating rig to Perth-based company Northern Oil and 
Gas Australia (NOGA) in 2015.
But within four years that rig was shut down amid saftey warnings from the regulator, National Offshore Petroleum 
Safety and Environmental Management Authority, and NOGA collapsed just months later.
The collapse coupled with environmental concerns prompted the federal government to take the decommissioning 
of the vessel into its own hands - an exercise which has cost hundreds of millions of dollars since 2020.

Resources giants headed to court over $86 million clean-up bill
That eye-watering clean-up bill is now at the centre of a Supreme Court battle between Shell, Woodside and 
Paladin Resources.
In the writ, Shell claims it penned two letters between February 2023 and March 2024 demanding payment from 
Woodside and Paladin Resources, but that the pair both denied liability.
Now Shell wants the Supreme Court to intervene by forcing Woodside and Paladin to reimburse it to the tune of 
$86.5 million.
It also wants a declaration that Woodside and Paladin Resources are to compensate it for all future costs it may 
incur as part of the decommissioning, which is only in the first of three stages.
Woodside has been contacted for comment.

Energy giant Shell is suing Woodside Energy and Paladin Resources for $86.6m for the clean-up bill for the 
Northern Endeavour oil platform, saying it struck agreements almost two decades ago which absolved it of any 
responsibility to pay remediation costs.
The question of who should pay to remediate Northern Endeavour, on Western Australia's North West Shelf, and 
abandoned oil and gas projects more broadly, prompted the previous government to introduce laws to protect 
taxpayers from having to foot the bill, should operators not be able to meet their obligations.
Woodside sold the platform to junior operator Timor Sea Oil and Gas Australia in July 2015, however TSOGA was 
forced to shut down production over a safety issue and subsequently went into voluntary administration.
There were fears the federal government would have to step in and bear the cost of the clean-up. Instead new rules 
around trailing liability provisions were introduced, which could slug former owners of the licence areas with the bill, 
thereby putting the onus on them to do adequate due diligence should the assets change hands.
The exploration permit in the current matter was granted to Woodside, Shell and BHP Billiton Petroleum in 1997, 
with Woodside owning a half share and the other two companies one quarter each.
Production from the Laminaria and Corallina oilfields began in 1999. The writ filed with WA's Supreme Court says 
Shell then sold two-thirds of its interest to Woodside in March 2005, and one-third to British company Paladin.
Shell says in its claim that the agreement with each company "expressly provided ... that Woodside/Paladin is liable 
for all environmental, abandonment, reclamation, remediation and restoration claims". The claim says following the 
failure of TSOGA, neither that company nor its liquidator made any efforts to remediate the platform. Woodside was 
contacted for comment.

Energy giant Shell is suing Woodside Energy and Paladin Resources for $86.6m for the clean-up bill for the

responsibility to pay for remediation costs.
The question of who should pay to remediate Northern Endeavour, on Western Australia's North West Shelf, and 
abandoned oil and gas projects more broadly, prompted the Morrison government to introduce new laws to protect 
taxpayers from having to foot the bill, should operators not be able to meet their obligations.
Woodside had sold the platform to junior operator Timor Sea Oil and Gas Australia (TSOGA) in July 2015. The 
junior operator was forced to shut down production over a safety issue and subsequently went into voluntary 
administration.
There were fears the federal government would have to step in and bear the cost of the clean-up, with the Morrison 
government at one point floating the idea of a $250m-plus industry levy to pay for it.
Instead new rules around trailing liability provisions were introduced. These could slug former owners of the licence 
areas with the bills, thereby putting the onus on them to do adequate due diligence should the assets change 
hands.
"The trailing liability provisions will be an action of last resort when all other safeguards have been exhausted and 
will reduce the risk that the financial costs of decommissioning will be left to Australian taxpayers," the then-
resources minister Keith Pitt said at the time.
"It also sets the expectation that sellers will undertake appropriate due diligence before selling assets, titles and 
infrastructure, so they can avoid being called back to decommission and remediate title areas." The exploration 
permit in the current matter was granted to Woodside, Shell and BHP Billiton Petroleum in 1997, with Woodside 
owning a half-share and the other two companies one-quarter each.

The claim says following the failure of TSOGA, neither that company nor its liquidator made any efforts to remediate 
the platform.
"Thereafter the Commonwealth has commenced the process of decommissioning the Northern Endeavour and 
seabed infrastructure," the claim says.
Shell says it received notices of assessment in January 2023 and 2024, for $42.3m and $44.3m respectively, but 
says Woodside and Paladin are liable for those payments under the agreements struck in 2005.
Shell says it wrote to both companies in February last year and March this year, but Woodside denied liability for 
both payments via letter, while Paladin also refused to pay.
Shell is seeking the $86.6m in accrued payments to date, and "A declaration that Woodside/Paladin must 
indemnify Shell for, and hold it harmless against, any or all of the amounts for which Shell is in the future held to be 
liable to the Australian Taxation Office under the Offshore Petroleum Levy Act, plus all costs reasonably incurred by 
Shell with respect to that liability, including legal costs of and associated with this action." Woodside has been 
contacted for comment.

Shell, one of Australia's largest foreign investors, has urged the federal government to remove duplication and 
inconsistency across state and national energy regimes to create a "single front door" across all energy projects in 
Australia.
Shell's country chair Cecile Wake told The Australian's Energy Nation Forum a more streamlined process should 
apply beyond renewable energy projects.
Her comments come amid growing concerns around regulatory bottlenecks and environment planning delays that 
can stymie and delay energy project timelines.
"The renewable energy agreements that minister (Chris) Bowen was speaking about between himself and the state 
energy ministers, let's broaden them so that we deliver successful projects across the length and breadth of our 
economy," Ms Wake said.
"Energy is the economy. Energy is the future. And we've got a great opportunity, but we mustn't â€¦ squander our 
traditional strengths." She said an agreement covering business, government and consumers was required to 
traverse the complex energy transition, which wouldn't happen without trade-offs, costs and difficult choices.
"We just need to have that clear-eyed, transparent dialogue." Ms Wake also noted the energy policy debate would 
need to broach subjects including incentives, subsidies and production credits.
Shell is one of the dominant players in Australia's -energy sector, operating the QCLNG export plant in 
Queensland, the Prelude floating LNG project off northern Australia and also has stakes in WA's North West Shelf 
and Gorgon LNG ventures and gas business Arrow.
Ms Wake called for a pragmatic approach and a "shared vision" among stakeholders for the nation to best navigate 
and capitalise on the energy transition happening across markets globally.

"We need to stop demonising gas, we need to look more broadly than simply the â€¦ renewable penetration in the 
electricity mix, we need to look to biofuels. We need to at least have a conversation around nuclear," she said, 
noting Shell did not operate in the nuclear space as it wasn't a competitive strength.
Wednesday's forum was held amid rising speculation of an early election and a flare-up in the energy and climate 
wars.
Large Australian and offshore-based companies are also positioning to benefit from burgeoning industries and 
policies that emerge as a result of the changes. GrainCorp chief executive Robert Spurway told the forum it was up 
to government to get policy settings right, for industries such as biofuels, that would allow Australia to leverage its 
"natural advantage".

and policies that emerge as a result of the changes.
GrainCorp chief executive Robert Spurway told the forum it was up to government to get policy settings right, for 
industries such as biofuels, that would allow Australia to leverage its "natural advantage".
"If you take the canola seed we produce here, it has a carbon intensity benefit about 41 per cent better than the 
global average," he said. "There'll be efficiencies of scale at the right policy settings, but also some real natural 
advantage benefits that Australia can bring to this future industry." GrainCorp last week backed the federal 
government's launch of a consultation process assessing the incentives needed to develop an Australian renewable 
fuels industry.
Mr Spurway last week outlined that the nation's growers produce a surplus average up to 5 million tonnes of the 
oilseed exported annually over the last three years, with more than 60 per cent of that refined into biofuels.
GrainCorp is forging ahead with plans to expand its oilseed crush capacity and has aligned with IFM Investors, who 
are focused on establishing a domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sector as a significant manager of 
investments in Australian and global airports.
Ampol CEO Matt Halliday agreed with Mr Spurway on getting policy settings right for the biofuel sector.
"It's fair to say that what we're talking about from an advanced biofuels and a renewable fuels perspective, will not 
happen without the appropriate policy," he said. "Most of this feedstock today, from an agricultural point of view is 
exported, and that is largely because there is government policy support elsewhere." Mr Halliday noted production 
incentives were one measure that could level the playing field, as he also reiterated his view that government 
policies needed to encourage demand and stamp out additional cost to consumers.

Shell chairman Sir Andrew Mackenzie says tackling climate change is harder than he realised when he was 
running BHP, and the world must now focus on a few "winning" solutions and invest in them strongly.
In an exclusive interview with the Tech Zero podcast, Sir Andrew said he believed the world could still cut 
greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, but may have a better chance if the problem was tackled "sector by 
sector" across international borders, rather than "country by country" as required by international climate 
agreements.
Sir Andrew's six-year term as BHP chief executive was marked by a simplification of its portfolio and an embrace of 
social issues like gender balance and the "Scope 3" emissions of customers.
He exited Australia's biggest company in December 2019 and became Shell chairman in May 2021; a move he 
said provided a different perspective on the world's carbon challenge.
"The one thing that has struck me, since moving from BHP to Shell, is it is quite a lot harder than I expected," he 
told the Tech Zero podcast.
"At BHP, to some extent, we were not quite in the thick of it in the way that we are at Shell, and you were able to 
talk about a lot of things that made sense to me, technically, that I assumed could happen more easily than actually, 
when you are having to deal with it in a much more full on way, as you are at Shell."
Sir Andrew said he "strongly believed" the world needed to focus on the best solutions rather than be distracted by 
the wide range of potential decarbonisation technologies.
Sir Andrew said he was a "huge advocate" for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in places where renewable 
electricity was incapable of providing the solution. He said electric vehicle adoption needed to be pushed "hard" and 
liquefied natural gas would be "critical" in supporting the roll-out of renewables.
"Because of the urgency, we have to make our choices and decide where we're really going to put our emphasis," 
he said.

"We shouldn't be adding and adding and adding, if at the same time, we're not finding the things that are winning 
and getting behind that with a lot more investment and more focused investment, and just deciding this is going to 
work in this sector, and let's get behind that because we don't have a lot of time."
Shell's business was built on selling oil and petrol for traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, but the 
company has also invested in electric vehicle charging stations, and Sir Andrew said the world needed to push 
"hard" on electric vehicles, and "maybe harder than we're pushing it".
But despite the rise of electric vehicles, he said the internal combustion engines that consume petrol were here to 
stay, and would enjoy longevity as the world embraced "biofuels" from agricultural waste and synthetically created 
"e-fuels".
"In looking at the future of oil, you look at the future of the internal combustion engine, and some would imagine 
that the internal combustion engine would just kind of disappear. That won't happen," he said.
"Even in a world of very successful decarbonisation ... the internal combustion engine will continue, but it will be 
fuelled by biofuels, maybe by hydrogen or indeed e-fuels."
The comments come as big diesel consumers like Rio Tinto are urging the federal government to ramp up support 
for biofuels, in the belief biofuels are the best way to reduce the emissions of iron ore trucks and trains in the 
decade before batteries are expected to be a viable alternative.
Sir Andrew said liquefied natural gas would be "critical" to the energy transition.
"It is available now, it can be shipped everywhere, it is possible to increase its supply, and it is the lowest carbon 
fossil fuel," he said.
International climate agreements were built on "nationally determined contributions", where each nation set a target 
for emission reductions and attempts to deliver on it, he said. But the problem might be better tackled by industry 
sectors that worked collaboratively across borders.
"That's how some of the issues to do with the ozone hole were sorted in the end, trying to move away from CFCs."

Shell expects to book up to $US2bn ($3bn) in post-tax impairments after delaying construction of a major biofuels 
plant as European energy majors grapple with weak market conditions, while trading in its core gas division is set to 
fall on quarter.
The British energy giant on Friday said it expected to book an impairment after tax of between $US1.5bn and 
$US2bn mainly due to pausing construction of its biofuels facility in Rotterdam as well as the divestment of its 
chemicals refinery in Singapore.
The paused construction of the Dutch biofuels plant - one of Europe's largest, set to produce 820,000 tonnes of 
biofuels a year - was largely due to weak European market conditions, with profit margins squeezed by a large drop 
in US renewable fuel-credits prices.
Shares in biofuels market leader Neste have shed nearly half their value this year, with the Finnish company in May 
cutting its renewable-fuel margin forecast. Shell's rival BP similarly paused biofuels investment at US and German 
oil refineries recently.
Shell expects to write down between $US600m and $US1bn on the asset, while the impairment after the sale of its 
Singapore refinery is expected to be $US600m-$US800m.
In addition, Europe's largest energy company expects trading results from its integrated-gas segment, usually its 
largest profit centre, to be lower than in the first quarter, when the unit booked $US3.68bn in adjusted earnings, due 
to seasonality.
However, it expects the unit's results to match those of the second quarter last year, when it booked $US2.5bn in 
adjusted earnings - a metric that strips certain commodity price adjustments and one-time charges.
The company also narrowed the segment's liquids and natural-gas production outlook slightly upward to 940,000- 
980,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day for the quarter, from a previously guided range of 920,000- 980,000 BOE a 
day.

Shell warns of $3bn impairment
Shell, the world's largest liquefied natural gas trader, expects its quarterly LNG volumes to be between 6.8 million 
and 7.2 million tonnes, compared with the prior-year's 7.2 million tonnes.
This would mean a decline from the first quarter's 7.6 million tonnes. However, gas prices in Europe have rallied in 
recent months on strong demand in Asia amid heatwaves and outages limiting supply, potentially providing a boon 
to Shell's quarterly results.
On the upstream side - the extraction of crude oil and natural gas - Shell is expecting the unit to produce between 
1.72 million and 1.82 million BOE a day ready for sale, versus 1.70 million a year prior and 1.87 million in the first 
quarter. In the first quarter, the segment garnered $US1.93bn in adjusted earnings.

Arrow Energy, the joint venture between Shell and PetroChina, will soon develop the second phase of Surat coal 
seam gas project (SGP) in Australia's Queensland.
According to Shell, the phase 2 development will produce 130 terajoules of additional gas per day at peak 
production. The first gas production is expected in 2026, as phase 1 was launched in 2020,  Reuters reported.
"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify 
Arrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast," Arrow CEO Zhengxin Peng said.
The announcement by Arrow Energy comes in the wake of calls for more investment to increase the local energy 
supply. Australia's energy market operator and competition watchdog, too, had urged oil and gas companies to 
invest more to increase the supply of energy.
"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to 
market,"  Energy Connects quoted Zo Yujnovich, Integrated Gas and Upstream Director at Shell. "QCLNG marked 
its 1000th cargo at the end of last year, reflecting its significance as a gas supplier for Australia and the region. This 
investment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a lower emissions 
alternative to options like coal."
The gas will flow to the Shell-operated QCLNG liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility on Curtis Island, near 
Gladstone. It is expected to  meet the requirements of long-term contracts and domestic market, as part of a 27-
year agreement between Arrow Energy and QGC.

Shell and PetroChina's joint venture Arrow Energy will expand its Surat Gas Project as it moves to capitalise on 
growing demand, a move likely to stoke opposition from environmentalists.
The expansion will be welcomed by Australia's energy industry, which is struggling to lock in supplies amid rapidly 
depleting stocks across the east coast.
Arrow said it would expand the project in Queensland's Western Downs to produce 4000PJ of gas for long-term 
contracts and to supply the domestic market.
The JV said 450 new gas production wells, a new field compression station, 27km pipeline, and road and 
infrastructure upgrades over two phases would be developed.
Arrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said first gas from the expansion was targeted for 2026.
"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify 
Arrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast," Mr Peng said.
"Natural gas is an important part of the energy transition, and the expansion demonstrates the faith our 
shareholders have in our ability to manage and deliver large-scale projects." Gas from the project will flow to the 
Shell-operated QCLNG liquefied natural gas facility on Curtis Island, near Gladstone, to meet long-term contracts 
and supply domestic customers, the joint venture partners said.
Zoe Yujnovich, Shell's integrated gas and upstream director, said the expansion underscored its commitment to

lower emissions alternative to options like coal." Shell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said the expansion would 
be boon for the local community.
"At its core, this project promotes stronger regional communities, and it also has wider benefits for Australian 
manufacturing and industry more broadly," she said.
The expansion will inflame environmentalists, who oppose any new gas drilling. But Australia's east coast faces a 
looming crisis as offshore gas from Victoria's Bass Strait - the traditional bedrock of the country's supplies - rapidly 
depletes.
The Australian Energy Market Operator has warned the country must urgently unlock new supplies to prevent a 
catastrophic shortfall but new developments are struggling to secure regulatory approvals and/or the support of 
local communities.
Analysts have warned the country's $2.5 trillion economy will be significant harmed by a shortfall. The 
manufacturing sector is particularly exposed with gas its only viable energy source, and any interruptions could 
threaten their viability.
Households could also be disrupted. Victoria is the most gas-dependent state, relying on the fuel source to heat 
homes, and a shortfall could make heating prohibitively expensive.
Other states will also be hit. Gas is used as a so-called peaker, burnt to provide electricity during periods of high 
demand or low supply from other fossil fuels or renewables. If Australia's National Electricity Market has insufficient 
gas on hand, the price of electricity will spike. Higher electricity bills was a key driver behind Australia's spike in 
inflation, which in turn forced the Reserve Bank of Australia to raise interest rates 13 times.
With a looming shortfall, gas developers have insisted governments fast-track applications, a request that the 
federal Labor government has refused - insisting it must properly assess each application. The gas industry has 
accused the government of slow walking, which indicates its support for gas - a claim denied by Labor.

Shell and PetroChina will expand the huge Surat coal seam gas project in Queensland, a decision that will be met 
with dismay from environmental activists but which should provide supply for an increasingly stretched market.
Gas from the project extension will supply both domestic and export customers through the Queensland Curtis LNG 
plant near Gladstone.
The project, the second phase of the Arrow Energy joint venture, is expected to supply 130 million cubic feet a day 
of gas at peak production, enough to power almost 1 million homes.
The first phase of the project, some 90 billion cubic feet a year, began in 2020 and is now in production. It is 
expected to cost about $2 billion. Shell did not give an estimated cost for the second phase, but it is also expected 
to reach into the billions of dollars.
The decision to proceed with the second phase of the Arrow project follows increasingly urgent warnings from the 
Australian Energy Market Operator about the need for investment in new gas supply to head off shortages 
expected later this decade on peak-demand winter days.
"Embarking on Phase 2 of the Surat Gas Project with Arrow is part of our commitment to bring more gas to 
market," said Zoe Yujnovich, director of integrated gas and upstream for Shell.
"This investment will enable us to sustain and grow this important, secure energy source that offers a lower-
emissions alternative."
Still, the drilling of the up to 450 new wells involved will only maintain existing supplies rather than increase 
production and does not address shortfalls that are looming because of declines in supplies in the southern states, 
said Rick Wilkinson, chief executive of consultancy EnergyQuest.
"This makes no change at all to the supply-demand balance and the requirement for new gas to come on for the 
east coast of Australia," he said.
Page 2 of 2
Shell, PetroChina plan to expand Surat gas project
Mr Wilkinson said that for the full development of the project, thousands of wells needed to be drilled, "so this is one 
step of many that are required for capital to be allocated to the project to maintain flat production".
Arrow, jointly owned by Shell and its Chinese state-owned partner, holds the largest reserve of undeveloped gas 
on the east coast, where elevated contract prices and a limited choice of supply have been sources of constant 
complaint among manufacturers.
Shell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said the project would support up to 400 jobs and create opportunities for 
contractors and local suppliers.
"At its core, this project promotes stronger regional communities, and it also has wider benefits for Australian 
manufacturing and industry more broadly," said Ms Wake.
Shell said the project was underpinned by a 27-year sales deal between Arrow and QGC, a division of the London-
based oil and gas giant. In investor briefings last year, the company flagged that it would secure additional gas for 
its LNG facilities in Queensland "to increase value for shareholders". The second phase of the project will require 
the construction of 27 kilometres of pipelines, as well as other infrastructure upgrades.
It is opposed by farming families and landholders in the Darling Downs, who said they were worried about the risk 
of damage to water and land. The project is also opposed by environmental groups, concerned about increased 
emissions from fossil fuel production.
The go-ahead comes despite years of annual losses by Arrow. The company had originally intended to develop four 
LNG export projects in Queensland but abandoned those plans after the first three plants were built.
Shell later took over BG Group in one of the biggest takeovers in the oil sector, giving it ownership of one of those 
three plants, Queensland Curtis LNG.
It opted to use gas from the Arrow project to instead supply that plant, a major facility near Gladstone, Queensland 
that was completed in 2014.
Arrow chief executive Zhengxin Peng said production from this second phase was expected to start in 2026. 
Construction will begin later this year. Surat is expected to comprise up to 2500 gas wells and produce 4000 
petajoules of gas in total.
"At a time when more gas is needed for homes, businesses and industries, the SGP North development will solidify 
Arrow's position as a major producer of natural gas on the east coast," Mr Peng said in a statement.

An apparent gas strike by energy giant Shell deep underground in onshore Queensland has fuelled industry hopes 
of a potential major new source of energy that could ease the threat of shortages in the tight east coast market.
Flames from a well drilled by Shell in the Taroom Trough at the southern edge of the Bowen Basin have stoked 
speculation that the little-known region could emerge as a new supply source that lies much closer to pipeline 
infrastructure than the Northern Territory's remote Beetaloo Basin.
The gas flare from the well, a photograph of which has been seen by The Australian Financial Review, signals one 
of the first instances of gas flowing to the surface in the region.
The Taroom Trough lies close to Queensland's gas hub at Wallumbilla, north-west of Brisbane, and wells being 
drilled are targeting unconventional gas at a depth of 2500-3500 metres, much deeper than coal seam gas wells.
While Shell declined to confirm the gas flow, MST Marquee energy analyst Saul Kavonic said the region, which he 
described as the most anticipated exploration play on the east coast over the next two years, held significant 
potential. "If they can prove horizontal wells work in this tight coal seam gas play, it could open up several more tcf 
[trillion cubic feet]) of gas for the east coast," Mr Kavonic said, noting ASX-listed juniors Elixir Energy and Omega 
Oil and Gas Ltd are also in the area.
"This is the only new exploration play with that potential, which is also close to infrastructure," he added, pointing to 
the greater infrastructure and funding constraints around large gas resources in the Beetaloo and the northern 
Bowen Basin.
Shell is drilling three appraisal wells in the area "as part of early-stage exploration in the Bowen Basin", a 
spokeswoman said. "The data will be analysed and will inform any further exploration."
The apparent early success comes as output from the east coast's biggest supply source for the domestic market, 
the mature Bass Strait petroleum fields held by ExxonMobil and Woodside Energy, has started to dive, risking 
shortfalls on gas on peak winter days, especially in Victoria.
Page 2 of 2
Shell well flare in Qld fuels east coast gas hopes
Production from the Longford plant that processes Bass Strait gas plunged 18.2 per cent in the June quarter, 
according to consultancy EnergyQuest, noting that peak supply shortfalls hit the east coast in 2022 and again this 
past winter.
The firm said that exploration and appraisal success by Elixir and Omega was raising hopes that the Taroom 
Trough could be "a genuine new source of material supply to the east coast gas market and even backfill for 
Queensland LNG projects".
EnergyQuest CEO Rick Wilkinson said the flare reported at the Shell site "seems to indicate more gas is flowing 
than the vertical well tested recently by Elixir", which he said was a "good sign" for the application of horizontal well 
technology.
Accessing gas held in such deep sands typically requires the use of horizontal drilling - as used in the US shale 
gas industry - and fracking, a controversial process that helps gas to flow.
Elixir and Omega, between them, have almost 3 trillion cubic feet of "contingent resources" - an uncertain measure 
of resource - in "tight" sandstones in the Trough, while Shell advised the Queensland government in 2021 that its 
own acreage in the area could hold three tcf of gas resource, EnergyQuest said.
It said Shell's investment in a program of multiple, stimulated horizontal wells costing between $100 million and 
$200 million "adds a lot of credibility". Elixir, chaired by coal seam gas entrepreneur Richard Cottee, late last month 
reported a successful flow of gas to the surface from its Daydream-2 well in the area.
Omega, which is backed by Queensland coal seam gas pioneer Tri-Star Group and Brian Flannery's Ilwella Group, 
is now moving the rig used by Shell for its wells to its Canyon site where it expects to start drilling a well on 
September 20 to test the flow of gas in its acreage for the first time.
"If we're successful here this could be the next big wave of development post the coal seam gas wave," said 
Omega CEO Trevor Brown, a former vice president geoscience at Santos.
He said that while the Beetaloo Basin was more advanced in terms of proving up the flow of gas, the Taroom 
Trough had several compelling reasons that gave it a quantifiable commercial advantage.

Highlight: Fossil fuel producers are buying large stakes in carbon companies and land to run their own carbon 
offset projects. Experts and insiders want that banned.
Body
Large fossil fuel companies are making multimillion-dollar investments in carbon companies and offset projects, 
raising concerns among industry insiders and experts that the sector is funding lowest-cost and lower-quality 
emission offsets, rather than tackling climate change as was intended.
An investigation by this masthead has found fossil fuel companies, including Shell and Woodside, are increasingly 
entering the supply chain of the Australian carbon offsets market, buying stakes in carbon companies, registering 
projects, trading credits or purchasing swathes of land to run their own carbon abatement projects.

Under the federal government's flagship policy for reducing industrial emissions, the country's top polluters can 
achieve all required emissions reductions through buying Australian carbon credits. Experts question allowing those 
polluters to have a role in the creation and sale of those credits.
"The guys who are doing the emitting, are now getting profits from the solution? It couldn't be more perverse. 
They're profiting from the problem they created," said Daryl Killin, who previously held senior roles at major carbon 
companies Select Carbon and Natural Carbon.
The criticisms came as an investigation by this masthead revealed allegations of carbon companies using long-term 
contracts to sign traditional owners into unfair deals, and of the industry watchdog, the Clean Energy Regulator 
(CER), having chronic problems managing conflicts of interest.
Global petroleum giant Shell's subsidiary, Shell Energy Environmental Products Australia, lists its primary activity 
as to "carry out trading" of Australian credits. Its profit in 2021 was $3.4 million, followed by losses of $2.8 million 
and $2.2 million in 2022 and 2023.
The Shell subsidiary also became a 25.1 per cent shareholder of Corporate Carbon last year in a $14 million deal 
that included a $7.25 million funding injection from its parent company, Shell Energy Holdings Australia. Its latest 
annual report said the acquisition would give Shell "significant influence over its business decisions".

'Perverse': Woodside, Shell spend millions getting into offset game
Corporate Carbon managing director Gary Wyatt said Shell converted an investment in its Queensland offset 
projects into the shareholding which allowed Shell to nominate one board director.
Wyatt, who previously ran ANZ Bank's energy trading desk, said carbon credits "fill a small bridging role" in climate 
policy and called for greater government regulation to reduce emissions across the broader economy. He said the 
fossil fuel industry should not be blamed for emissions.
"It's not a problem they [the fossil fuel industry] created," he said. "It's a problem that's been created by us choosing 
to live the lifestyle that we do, which has resulted in the consumption of a large amount of fossil fuels. We've all 
benefited from that lifestyle, but it's created a problem. But to point to the energy producers and say, you've created 
this problem, is a very narrow framing."
Wyatt was "not comfortable" answering questions about what benefits Shell's shareholding delivered for the petrol 
giant, but conceded the company may achieve "cheaper outcomes" and "secure volumes" of carbon credits.
A Shell spokesperson said "offsets are used only where emissions cannot be avoided" and that part-owning 
Corporate Carbon allowed it to "maximise quality and integrity" of projects that "deliver wider benefits to the 
environment and local communities".
Shell fully acquired another carbon company, Select Carbon, in 2020.
Land titles obtained by this masthead show ASX-listed oil and gas giant Woodside's subsidiary, Woodside Energy 
Carbon Services, owns 72 property titles in NSW and 41 titles in Western Australia to run offset projects.
It has nine carbon projects registered with the CER, using the reforestation method which involves planting native 
trees. These projects have been issued more than 840,000 carbon credits since 2013. Dozens of other polluters 
have registered carbon projects, including Santos, Inpex and Tokyo Gas Australia.
A spokesperson for Woodside said its carbon business was established in 2018 to "better manage the cost and 
integrity of our carbon credits" and it was "open to considering an investment in a carbon developer but is pleased 
with our carbon business's capability today".
"Woodside's priority is avoiding and reducing emissions," the spokesperson said.
However, Woodside's decarbonisation strategy has been routinely rejected by investors as undermining 
international climate agreements. A historic 58 per cent of shareholders voted against the plan in April over 
concerns the company was expanding gas projects, relying too heavily on offsets and failing to cut key emissions.
International conglomerates are also players in the local carbon market. Mitsubishi bought a 40 per cent stake in 
Australian Integrated Carbon in 2021, and Mitsui invested in Climate Friendly in 2022.
A former staff member at Climate Friendly, who declined to be named because they feared retribution, quit last year 
after becoming uncomfortable with the influence of Mitsui and private equity firm Adamantem.
"The shift went from mum and dad farmers, helping those people into the scheme, to maximising profits for 
shareholders ... How do we grow the business to make sure Adamantem are happy?"
The staff member questioned the company's leadership about the new investors and was told Mitsui helped Climate 
Friendly by establishing connections with fossil fuel industry customers, both in Australia and abroad.
"What does Climate Friendly get out of it? It's the relationships," they said. "Within the industry, you need to know 
who is buying and selling. To sell that volume of ACCUs you need the relationship. It was millions of dollars of 
trades."
The employee said these relationships paid off and there was an unprecedented rise in Climate Friendly's trading 
volumes after the Mitsui investment.Page 3 of 4

"The trades were massive, like nothing we had seen before ... That's fine for a one-off, then it started happening 
more frequently. And I was like: 'Is this going be the trajectory of the business?'"
Climate Friendly co-executive officers Skye Glenday and Josh Harris released a joint statement saying the 
company's purpose had not changed from "profit-for-purpose" and "tackling climate change" through supporting 
carbon farming.
They said Adamantem's investment had allowed staff to increase from 30 to 100 people and "scale up our positive 
climate change impacts" and said Mitsui had a "strong decarbonisation plan" that had no influence on the company 
strategy.
"Our driving purpose is to decarbonise Australia's land sector, which is responsible for about 20 per cent of the 
nation's greenhouse gas emissions," they said in a joint statement.
 "Our staff are clear on Climate Friendly's purpose and mission, and are united by the urgent need to scale up 
carbon farming in line with the International Panel on Climate Change's call for the world to rapidly expand carbon 
sequestration." 
This masthead can also reveal the Australian Academy of Sciences (AAS) raised concerns with the CER in 2022 
that the $4.5 billion taxpayer-backed Emissions Reduction Fund had become too focused on supporting the 
growing carbon industry rather than abating emissions.
"Over the decade of the [Emissions Reduction Fund] operation, the scheme has become less of a climate policy 
instrument and more of an industry policy mechanism," according to an internal CER email obtained by this 
masthead under freedom of information summarising "key take-outs" from the Academy's review.
"There is a need to reinforce that the ACCU [Australian Carbon Credit Unit] scheme is fundamentally for the 
removal, and avoidance, of greenhouse gas emissions."
The scientists identified "several concerns or limitations" with two of the most common methods, avoided 
deforestation and human-induced regeneration (HIR), which rely on "counterfactuals" and unreliable data that 
makes the scheme "vulnerable to integrity accusations" and "accusations of doing little to prevent carbon leakage".
Killin said these projects dominate the market because they were cheap to run, reducing costs for polluters while 
boosting profits for the carbon "gatekeepers" that own most projects and make money from trading credits.
"We've got a cartel running the industry in Australia," said Killin. "We've had fossil fuel companies running climate 
policy in this country for decades. Carbon is no different."
In an unpublished submission to the Chubb review, Killin said barriers to entry and poor policy had made it 
"excruciatingly painful" to run small-scale projects that use robust methods, such as tree planting and savannah 
burning. He called for carbon companies to split up and for fossil fuel investment in supply to be banned.
"I am a well-informed industry insider who knows how the market really runs, rather than the 'sweetness and light' 
that are regularly portrayed to the public," the submission states.
"We need real carbon abatement policy and actual carbon market development that encourages direct participation 
and minimises intermediary benefits."
Killin called for a "complete overhaul" to address the "market failure" where vested interests had suppressed the 
price of carbon and resulted in low transparency for participants and poor quality projects.
"All of this has conspired to create a cosy 'Carbon Club' in Australia. Voices of dissent and other internal criticism 
that do not fit the industry's vacuous view of itself are ignored repeatedly," he said.Page 4 of 4
'Perverse': Woodside, Shell spend millions getting into offset game
Killin was critical of government interventions to reduce the cost of carbon credits, pointing to the government's 
"cost containment" policy that caps credits at $70 for companies captured by the safeguard mechanism, when 
robust tree planting projects can cost up to $100 per credit.
"It's not a real market. If there is high demand, the price should go up. But every time the price goes up, the 
government intervenes to bring the price down," he said. "The polluters should be made to pay."
University of Sydney chair of political economy Dr Gareth Bryant said governments globally had intervened in 
carbon offset markets because high prices were "political poison".
Bryant said the "elegant economic reasoning" of market-based emissions reduction always came second to 
industry interests, and politicians were quick to "carve out special consideration policies" to avoid hurting fossil fuel 
profits.
"That's the contradiction of carbon offsetting. Attempts to create a profitable industry around carbon offsetting are 
always coming up against interests which see carbon offsets as a get out of jail free card for the fossil fuel industry. 
In that battle, usually it's the fossil fuel industry that has won, globally."
Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen declined an interview request and did not answer detailed 
questions on record, but a spokesperson highlighted the government's increased and legislated emissions 
reduction target, and said the safeguard mechanism and renewable energy plan meant Australia was "now on track 
for at least 42 per cent emissions reduction by 2030".

Body
Shell, the oil and gas giant with billions of dollars invested in Australia, says a dysfunctional and enormously 
complicated system of regulations is putting the transition to clean energy at risk even as it readies to spend big on 
renewables.
Shell Australia chairwoman Cecile Wake said obstacles for gas developments and large renewables projects 
threatened to derail progress towards 2030 climate targets.
Labor wants to cut carbon emissions by 43 per cent on 2005 levels by the end of the decade, a goal that appears 
increasingly unreachable.
"Right now, what we have is a dysfunctional, deharmonised patchwork quilt of regulations that really make it difficult 
to have successful investments," Ms Wake said in an interview.
"Many of the headwinds that we're seeing across our gas business, we are seeing replicated in the large-scale 
renewable part of the business."
The transition away from fossil fuels coal, oil and gas is heading towards another political brawl - like the one that 
consumed former Coalition and Labor governments. Delays in approvals and higher costs of construction have 
slowed the rollout of big renewable energy projects despite plenty of interest from global investors.
The Coalition has proposed a network of nuclear power stations as the best way to move away from fossil fuel as 
coal plants shut. Opposition Leader Peter Dutton will use a speech in Sydney today to again pitch nuclear power as 
a long-term renewable energy solution, hitting back at an attack on the plan last week by Energy Minister Chris 
Bowen.
While conceding nuclear power will have a "significant upfront cost", Mr Dutton will claim that the 80-year lifespan of 
each plant means they will outlast renewable electricity sources many times over. He will not, however, release any 
costings.

Rules put transition at risk: Shell; Exclusive
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, however, is banking on mechanisms which incentivise the development of wind 
and solar projects to hit targets. That, the government says, can be supported by gas to ensure supply if demand 
surges.
Shell has long criticised the investment climate for gas. Ms Wake pointed to duplication between state and federal 
environmental approvals and "ambiguous" requirements on Indigenous consultation as some of the reasons for 
delays and higher costs.
But she said similar hurdles were now evident for wind and solar projects, putting at risk private investment needed 
to underpin the move away from fossil fuels.
"If we're going to reach net zero by 2050, for Australia to really thrive through the energy transition, we're going to 
need not one wave of investment, but a second, a third, a fourth, multiple waves of investment and what that 
requires is successful delivery of projects," she said. "We need a really harmonised set of regulatory settings so that 
we can deliver projects - whether they're in the gas or the renewables or firming space - predictably and deliver the 
lowest cost, most reliable, lowest-emissions energy."
London-listed Shell is one of the country's biggest energy players. It owns the Queensland Curtis LNG venture at 
Gladstone, one of the state's three large gas export projects. It owns gas power and solar plants, the ERM Power 
electricity retailer, which sells to business, and household energy retailer Powershop.
In the west, its portfolio includes the Prelude floating LNG plant, a stake in Chevron's Gorgon LNG venture, and a 
small holding in Woodside Energy's North West Shelf.
Ms Wake said the Australian business represented "quite a powerful microcosm" of a "balanced" energy transition, 
but added that funders of these projects had "choices on where to go", signalling Shell could look elsewhere if 
investing became too difficult.
These issues were raised by Clean Energy Council chief executive Kane Thornton in a speech earlier this month, 
when he described environmental and planning rules for wind farm development as "not fit for purpose" and one 
reason for a difficult year in 2023, when few decisions were made on whether to proceed with big projects.
The Clean Energy Council, which represents major renewable energy developers, has warned that a big increase in 
commitments for generation projects will be needed by the end of December to reach the level of work needed to 
hit government targets.
"We should have big expectations for the second half of this year," said Mr Thornton. "As a nation, we didn't do a 
great job of preparing for this complex transition. So we now need to draw on every ounce of tenacity to confront 
these challenges."
Ms Wake said the transition away from fossil fuel needed plenty of capital, urging governments to "leave the 
populism and the ideology and the party politics to one side and really get behind what is in Australia's best 
interests".
Ms Wake pointed to Shell's Crux LNG project in Western Australia as one that suffered from the fallout from the 
litigation over Indigenous consultation at Santos' Barossa gas project in the Timor Sea and Woodside's 
Scarborough LNG project.
The $3.6 billion Crux project, which was approved in 2022, is intended to supply replacement gas for Prelude LNG 
off the north-west coast. She said Shell had had to significantly broaden and lengthen consultation, taking in talks 
with 18 traditional owner groups even though none of the project infrastructure will come onshore.
"It felt to me like an example of additional complexity that added delay and costs to projects without delivering a 
significantly better outcome for traditional owner groups, and in fact, put a huge burden on them," she said of the 
project.Page 3 of 3

Shell's clean energy portfolio in Australia has almost 1.5 gigawatts of renewable generation and storage, including 
a 49 per cent interest in developer WestWind Energy, the Gangarri solar farm in Queensland, a battery in the NSW 
Riverina, and the Rangebank battery south-east of Melbourne, which is due online later this year.
But it has a bigger pipeline of projects, including a big battery at Wallerawang in NSW and a smaller storage project 
in WA's Wheatbelt region.
"There's another bit over a gigawatt of other battery projects that are there in the pipeline, so if we hit a permitting or 
a contracting roadblock on one of them, we can shuffle the deck in terms of the sequence," Ms Wake said.
In all, Shell aims to have 4GW of renewables and storage operating by 2032.

Highlight: Oil giant Shell wins a landmark case at The Hague, overturning an earlier court ruling ordering it to cut 
its carbon emissions by 45 per cent. 
Body
A Dutch court has accepted Shell's appeal against a landmark climate ruling, dismissing the order for the oil and 
gas company to sharply reduce emissions.
The appeals court in The Hague said on Tuesday that Shell had a responsibility to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions to protect people from global warming.
But it dismissed the 2021 ruling that ordered Shell to cut its absolute carbon emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 
compared to 2019 levels, including those caused by the use of its products.
The Dutch court said Shell was already on its way to meet required targets for its own emissions, and it was 
unclear if demands to also reduce emissions caused by the use of its products would help the fight against climate 
change.
"Even though Shell bears a special responsibility as a large oil and gas company, that does not mean we can 
apply a general reduction goal of 45 per cent," presiding judge Carla Joustra said.
In a written summary of the ruling, the court said: "There is currently insufficient consensus in climate science on a 
specific reduction percentage to which an individual company like Shell should adhere."
Shell's chief executive officer, Wael Sawan, welcomed the ruling.
“We are pleased with the court’s decision, which we believe is the right one for the global energy transition, the 
Netherlands and our company,” he said.

"Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of Shell's strategy and is 
transforming our business."
Climate mitigation debate
The ruling coincides with the COP29 UN climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, where building on a decision at last 
year's talks to transition away from fossil fuels is set to be debated.
Climate activist group Friends of the Earth Netherlands, which brought the case forward in 2019, said it would 
continue its fight against large polluters.
"This hurts," the group's director Donald Pols said. 
"At the same time, we see that this case has ensured that major polluters are not immune and has further 
stimulated the debate about their responsibility in combating dangerous climate change.
"That is why we continue to tackle major polluters, such as Shell."
Friends of the Earth did not say whether it would launch a further appeal at the Netherlands' Supreme Court.
The case in the Hague, where Shell was headquartered until it completed its move to London in 2022, was viewed 
as pivotal for both sides of the emissions divide and helped to inspire other lawsuits.
In appeal hearings earlier this year, Shell said demands for companies to reduce emissions could not be made by 
courts, but only by states.
The court agreed with Shell that an absolute order to reduce emissions from its products could have an adverse 
effect worldwide, as it could lead customers to switch from using Shell's gas to more polluting coal.
"In general, any reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is positive to mitigate climate change," Judge Joustra said.
"But that does not mean that a reduction order for Shell has that same effect."
Shell shares traded down 0.2 per cent in Amsterdam early on Tuesday, broadly in line with the wider index.

Body
Shell has won its appeal against a 2021 landmark decision that said it was partially responsible for climate change 
and must sharply cut its carbon emissions, delivering a major court victory to the oil giant in a closely watched 
case.
The ruling in a Dutch court is a setback for efforts by non-profits and other groups to hold energy companies and 
other multinationals responsible for the effects of climate change.
But experts warned the issues raised in the case remain far from settled. They said the judgment signalled a 
willingness by the court to mandate emissions curbs, while leaving wide latitude for the mechanisms to be worked 
out in future litigation.
The 2021 decision by The Hague district court ordered Shell - at the time based in the Netherlands - to reduce its 
carbon emissions by 45 per cent by the end of 2030 from 2019 levels.
The Hague Court of Appeal on Tuesday ruled that while Shell is obliged to reduce its emissions, the court was 
unable to determine which percentage should apply.
"There is insufficient consensus in climate science on a specific reduction percentage to which an individual 
company like Shell should adhere," it said.
It said it therefore rejected the claims of Milieudefensie, the Dutch arm of environmental group Friends of the Earth.
The court added that Shell was already working to reduce its emissions and that an obligation for the company to 
reduce emissions caused by buyers of its products would be ineffective.
Milieudefensie called the appeals court decision a shocking setback, but said that it showed companies were under 
pressure to reduce carbon emissions, even if targets aren't legally binding. "Large polluters are powerful. But 
united, we as people have the power to change them," said Donald Pols, its director.
Page 2 of 2

The group didn't say whether it planned an appeal to the Dutch supreme court, a process that could extend the 
legal fight for years. Lawyers expect the group to appeal.
Its statement included a plea for financial support, adding, "This judgment will change nothing about our eagerness 
to keep fighting." The decision comes as world leaders meet in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku to discuss global 
warming at the United Nations COP29 summit. The mood in many circles has been gloomy in part due to 
expectations that Donald Trump's victory will pull the US further back from a leading role in global climate efforts.
In a response to the Dutch court's ruling, Shell reiterated that it believed a court ruling would do little to reduce 
emissions as it wouldn't dent demand for petrol, diesel and gas. The clear view in Tuesday's judgment is that the 
court felt empowered to order a company to abide by absolute carbon emissions targets, a novel development that 
could have wide ripple effects even while specifics are debated in different countries and courtrooms.

Highlight: BP and Shell led Big Oil's push into renewable energy. Now they are leading the retreat.
Body
BP and Shell led Big Oil's push into renewable energy. Now they are leading the retreat.
Last week BP announced that it had sold its offshore wind assets into a joint venture with Japan's JERA, itself a 
joint venture between Tokyo Electric Power and Chubu Electric Power, to create one of the world's largest offshore 
wind businesses.
That followed an earlier BP announcement, in September, that it planned to sell its US onshore wind farms.
Under former chief executive, Bernard Looney, BP had been building its wind farm portfolio as part of an ambitious 
strategy to cut its hydrocarbon production by 40 per cent by 2030, reduce its emissions and those of its customers 
by 35 to 40 per cent by the end of this decade and become a "net zero"-emissions company by 2050.
Last year it started backing away from those commitments, saying it would cut production by only 25 per cent by 
2030 and its emissions by 20 to 30 per cent.
This year, under a new chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, it now appears even those reduced targets are being 
wound back.
It's not just BP.
Shell has scaled back its investment in renewables, including offshore wind and hydrogen; it has reduced its 
emissions' intensity targets and it has abandoned its objective of becoming the world's largest electricity company. 
Norway's energy giant, Equinor, has also announced plans to shrink its renewable energy division.
As they retreat from their push into renewable energy and downgrade their ambitions to build major exposures to 
electricity generation, the UK and European oil companies are refocusing on their traditional oil and gas 
businesses.
Where previously they planned to cap or reduce their production, now they are planning and investing to increase it.
Page 2 of 3
Big Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare
Last year BP raised its forecast of oil equivalent production from 1.5 billion barrels a day by 2030 to 2 million 
barrels a day, planning to invest $US8 billion ($12.6 billion) more than previously budgeted on new oil and gas 
investments. Since Auchincloss became CEO, that focus on lifting hydrocarbon production has intensified.
The commercial logic in what they are doing is clear. BP generates returns of 15 to 20 per cent on its fossil fuel 
investments but only 6 to 8 per cent from its renewable assets, with wind's returns inferior to solar's.
Ploughing billions each year into wind, solar and hydrogen dilutes the overall returns on capital and reduces the 
returns to shareholders, making them most unhappy. Having invested about $US18 billion over the past five years 
in lower-returning renewables between them, BP and Shell investors have become increasingly unhappy.
Moreover, the UK and European energy majors are always compared with their US counterparts.
Exxon and Chevron haven't been anywhere near as committed to lowering the carbon intensity of their portfolios as 
their transatlantic rivals. The US majors were committed to the "drill, baby, drill" mantra before Donald Trump and 
saw that reflected in their share price relativities with their UK and European counterparts.
Where, over the past five years, Exxon's share price has risen 54 per cent and Chevron's 23 per cent, BP's has 
fallen 22 per cent and Shell's more than 6 per cent. That kind of disparity in performance tends to galvanise 
shareholders, along with executives motivated by their remuneration.
By moving its offshore wind assets into a joint venture vehicle and off its own balance sheet BP will keep an 
exposure to wind but significantly reduce the amounts of capital devoted to it and the levels of debt supporting it.
Between them, BP and JERA plan to spend up to $US5.8 billion on their combined portfolios (which includes the 
proposed Blue Mackerel offshore wind farm in Bass Strait) by the end of 2030. With shared investment and non-
recourse funding, BP's capital commitment will be modest relative to what it would otherwise have been.
Both BP and Shell still seem committed to solar, which is less capital intensive than wind, but that won't help them 
escape the criticism from climate activist groups and ESG (environmental, social and governance) investors, who 
are particularly vocal and litigious in Europe and the UK.
The problem, of course, is that the companies can't satisfy both constituencies and in a contest between emissions 
and returns is one that ultimately shareholders will always win.
With Trump about to return to the White House and open up US federal lands to more drilling for oil and gas, and 
the incoming Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, having a "3-3-3" plan that includes lifting US energy production by 
three million barrels of oil equivalent a day, the contrast between the environment for the US producers and their 
competitors elsewhere will only become starker and the pressure from shareholders on companies like BP and 
Shell will only intensify.
Trump also plans to remove the generous 10-year tax credits for renewables within Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction 
Act, which, if he is successful, would make the returns from investment in US renewables even less competitive 
with those from fossil fuels.
Any increase in US oil production would add to the existing glut in the oil market and depress prices that are 
already under pressure, despite the withdrawal of about six million barrels a day of supply by the OPEC+ cartel.
The lower prices being experienced now and likely to continue into at least the first half of next year, however, 
aren't an argument for the oil majors to invest in renewables.
Returns from oil and gas will still be superior to those from renewables and, if oil and gas prices and profits are 
under pressure, there will be even more of an incentive to invest only in the highest-returning assets.
Those who invest purely in renewables appear unconcerned about the gradual withdrawal of the oil majors who 
gatecrashed their sector and, seeking to gain scale rapidly, drove up the costs of developing greenfields projects.Page 3 of 3
Big Oil's green dream has turned into a multibillion-dollar nightmare
Ploughing billions each year into wind, solar and hydrogen dilutes the overall returns on capital and reduces the 
returns to shareholders, making them most unhappy.
There are a lot of environmentally-sensitive and patient investment funds available from sources other than the oil 
majors that are willing to trade off returns for their convictions and/or consistent long-term returns, so losing some 
investment from the oil companies shouldn't retard renewables developments.
It was always going to be difficult for BP and Shell to try to produce a balance of their traditional oil and gas 
businesses and renewable energy portfolios while satisfying both financially-motivated and ESG-driven investors.
It has been particularly difficult for the UK and Europeans, with their lower returns but better environmental 
credentials, to attract investors in the US. There's been a backlash against ESG investing in the US where, 
because there is no significant stigma associated with the oil and gas industry, valuation metrics tend to be higher.
If BP and Shell want better access to those more attractive metrics, improved share price performances and 
access to cheaper capital, they have no realistic option but to shed, and invest less in, low-returning assets. That's 
what they are now doing.

January 30th, 2025 ( International Business Times Australia  - Delivered by  Newstex )
British energy giant Shell on Thursday announced a 17-percent drop in annual net profit owing to weaker oil and 
gas prices as well as asset write-offs.
Profit after tax fell to $16.1 billion in 2024, the company said in an earnings statement.
Revenue dropped nearly 11 percent to $289 billion in a year that saw Shell backtrack on some key climate targets.
Oil prices came under pressure from weakness in the Chinese economy while the cost of gas has fallen heavily 
since soaring after the invasion of Ukraine by energy producer Russia.
In late 2024, Shell announced it was cutting hundreds of jobs from its oil and gas exploration division to reduce 
costs.
Chief executive Wael Sawan described last year's financial performance as "strong" despite "a lower price 
environment", causing Shell to increase its dividend by four percent and repurchase $3.5 billion of company 
shares.
Shell, whose share price rose slightly in reaction, "remains at a crossroads torn between the seemingly inevitable 
pull of the energy transition and the demands of shareholders", noted Derren Nathan, head of equity research at 
Hargreaves Lansdown.
"Its financial strength gives it the firepower to invest for the future as well as make generous distributions, but there 
are still some major doubts as to how the company plans to adapt to changing shifts in the energy mix."
Sawan said Shell will in March update its "strategy to deliver more value with less emissions".
The company last year booked a significant write-down owing to a shelved biofuels project in the Netherlands.

Along with rival BP, Shell has scaled back various climate objectives to focus more on oil and gas in order to raise 
profits, drawing criticism from environmental activists.
"Shell and its shareholders again raked in tens of billions from fuelling the climate crisis last year," Elena Polisano, 
head of Greenpeace UK's Stop Drilling campaign, said in reaction to the latest results.
Shell has watered down key targets on cutting carbon emissions but has kept its pledge for net zero by 2050.
The group had said net carbon intensity would be cut 15-20 percent by 2030 compared to 2016 levels. That marked 
a dilution from its previous 20-percent target.
In a more recent announcement, the company in December said it would no longer lead development of new 
offshore wind projects.
Offshore wind is one of the major sources of renewable energy that Europe is counting on to decarbonise electricity 
production, but in recent years projects have been mired by soaring costs and supply chain issues.
Gas is being touted by energy companies as cleaner than other fossil fuels as countries around the world strive to 
reduce their emissions and slow global warming.

The Norwegian state-backed oil company that is attempting to develop one of the largest untapped oil fields in 
British waters has dramatically scaled back its investment in renewables and raised its fossil fuel production 
targets, becoming the latest of the world's energy giants to resist the push towards green power.
Equinor, which changed its name from Statoil in 2018, has said it will halve its spending on renewable energy 
projects to $US5bn between this year and 2027, excluding project financing, and has cut its target to grow clean 
power capacity from 7 gigawatts to 10-12GW by 2030, from a previous goal of 12-16GW.
It aims to produce 2.2 million barrels of oil a day by the end of the decade, up from about 2 million barrels 
previously forecast.
The decision makes the Oslo-based group the latest of the world's oil and gas giants to dilute renewables 
ambitions. BP, the FTSE 100 constituent, is set to unwind 2030 targets to cut oil and gas production targets and 
drop its low-carbon deployment goal when it updates its capital allocation strategy later this month.
Equinor chief executive Anders Opedal said that cutting capital expenditure on renewables would help address 
challenges in the offshore wind industry, and increase "value creation". The company expects to produce free 
cashflow of $US23bn by 2027, $US11n of which will be returned to shareholders as dividends.
In December, Equinor combined its British oil and gas assets with Shell under a new 50-50 joint venture, which 
they claimed would create the largest independent producer in the maturing North Sea.
However, its ambitions in the North Sea were dealt a blow last week when the Scottish courts quashed consent for 
Rosebank, which is co-owned by Ithaca Energy, and Shell's Jackdaw field after a legal challenge brought by the 
campaign groups Greenpeace and Uplift against the government's decision in 2023 to greenlight the projects.
Shell's Jackdaw gas field and Equinor's Rosebank oilfield must now reapply for government permission because 
their original approvals failed to consider the emissions that will be generated when the oil and gas is burnt.

However, the companies have been allowed to continue development work in the meantime. Equinor has spent 
Ã‚Â£2.2bn on Rosebank so far.
Philippe Mathieu, executive vice-president for exploration and production international, said that the project would 
contribute to Britain's growth agenda and create about 2000 jobs in the construction phase.
The fate of the fields will be a test of the government's approach to the North Sea. British Energy Secretary Ed 
Miliband has vowed to stop issuing new North Sea oil and gas licences and described Rosebank as a "colossal 
waste of taxpayer money and climate vandalism" while in opposition.
Mr Mathieu said the project would boost domestically produced oil and gas and reduce reliance on imports.
"If you don't have Rosebank oil for the UK, then you have to import it from somewhere else â€¦ how much CO2 is 
that going to cost?" he said. The Times

Highlight: Australia's top gas shippers forecast a huge lift in demand over the next decade, even as debate 
continues about the role of gas in the clean energy shift.
Body
Australia's biggest oil and gas exporters forecast a significant lift in demand for liquefied gas over the next decade, 
even as debate continues about the role of the fossil fuel in the transition to cleaner energy.
Shell, which produces natural gas off the coast of Western Australia and in Queensland, bumped up its long-term 
demand predictions last week, saying it now expects the world's consumption of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to 
increase 60 per cent by 2040 amid faster economic growth in Asia.
The energy giant's revised outlook for LNG is 10 percentage points higher than at the same time last year
"China is significantly increasing its LNG import capacity and aims to add piped gas connections for 150 million 
people by 2030 to meet increasing demand," Shell said. "India is also moving ahead with building natural gas 
infrastructure and adding gas connections to 30 million people over the next five years."
Woodside, the largest Australian LNG producer, said Asian population growth, economic development and rising 
living standards would underpin a demand increase of at least 50 per cent by 2034. At the same time, a wave of 
new LNG projects threatening to cause a glut in coming years was unlikely to materialise as quickly as first thought 
because of delays faced by developers, the company said.
"Asia is going to be the engine room for LNG growth," Woodside chief executive Meg O'Neill said.
LNG - natural gas super-chilled down to a liquid so it can be loaded onto special ships - is one of Australia's biggest 
exports, raking in at least $64 billion in revenue this financial year. Demand and prices for Australia's LNG, which is 
mainly sold to Japan, China, Taiwan and South Korea, surged following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 as 
efforts to replace Russian piped gas to Europe unleashed a global scramble for spare shipments of the fuel to keep 
lights and heaters on.
While gas remains widely used in electricity generation, heating and manufacturing, its longer-term demand could 
vary significantly depending on how aggressively the world decides to ratchet up goals to slash planet-heating 
greenhouse gas emissions.

Asia wants to cut emissions, so why is it still buying so much Australian gas?
According to some forecasts of how the energy transition could play out, gas demand may be driven sharply higher 
for its use as a "transition" fuel - one that's cleaner than coal, but can still be used to back up intermittent 
renewables during periods of low wind and sunlight.
But other pathways suggest the role of gas could be limited, especially if Asian nations pursue plans to reduce the 
use of fossil fuels in their electrical grids and if the world doubles down on efforts to electrify the economy as much 
as possible.
Woodside said it believed LNG, rather than being negatively affected by the shift to lower-carbon energy, would be 
increasingly needed to decarbonise Asia, as governments and utilities stepped up efforts to cut emissions by 
replacing coal-fired generators with gas-powered plants, which are less-emitting.
"If just 20 per cent of Asia's coal-fired power stations switched to gas, it would reduce carbon emissions by 680 
million tonnes a year," O'Neill said. "That's more than one-and-a-half times Australia's annual net greenhouse gas 
emissions."
But forecasts of significant growth overlook the risk of several "tangible barriers", said Christopher Doleman, an 
analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, which discourages further investment in LNG.
While Shell identifies coal-to-gas switching as a key driver of LNG demand growth, Doleman said the cost of LNG 
was likely to limit its ability to displace coal across Asia. One-off deliveries of LNG cargoes in Asia are selling for 
around $US13 per million British thermal units today.
"LNG prices would likely need to fall into the $US4-5 range to compete with coal, a level that is too low for LNG 
facilities to earn an adequate rate of return," Doleman said.
Vietnam had reduced the scale of its LNG-to-power plans in a recent update, he said. Meanwhile, LNG demand in 
Japan, the biggest customer of Australian cargoes, had fallen 20 per cent since 2018 and could fall further under its 
plans to cut thermal electricity generation from 70 per cent of the energy mix to a range of 30-40 per cent by 2040, 
he said.
Although demand remains uncertain, investment analysts expect an influx of new LNG to hit the market later this 
decade as new projects come online in the US and Qatar, and raise the risk of an oversupply.
"We expect a tight LNG market in 2025 with global balances estimated to be in deficit ... before moving into balance 
in 2026 and an accelerating surplus from 2027," UBS analyst Tom Allen said.

Shell is exploring a potential sale of its chemicals assets in Europe and the US, part of a continuing drive to refocus 
the company's business on its most profitable operations.
The oil and gas company is working with bankers at Morgan Stanley on a strategic review of its chemicals 
operations. The process is in the early stages and Shell has yet to commit to any final decisions.
Among the assets included in the review is Shell's Deer Park -facility in Texas. The site produces a range of 
chemicals such as light and heavy olefins, which can be used to make pharmaceuticals, detergents, adhesives and 
wire coating. The operation is -located adjacent to a refinery, which Shell previously sold its stake in. Shell also has 
chemical facilities in Pennsylvania and Louisiana in the US, and in -Europe it has plants in the UK, Germany and 
The Netherlands.
Potential bidders for the assets could range from private-equity firms to Middle Eastern buyers wanting to expand 
into the West.
Since chief executive Wael Sawan took the helm of Shell at the start of 2023, the company has worked to focus 
more on its most profitable operations. To that end, the company has rolled back some of its green-energy targets 
and pledged to pump more oil and gas. Shell's chemicals business has been seen as lagging behind for years. It is 
capital-heavy and subject to cyclical ups and downs, resulting in losses in recent years that have weighed on the 
company's overall performance. Anaemic gas prices and rising capacity in chemical manufacturing have caused 
the petrochemical market to languish recently. The company has already signalled its willingness to shed lower-
margin chemicals operations. Last year, it struck a deal to sell its chemicals park in Singapore to a joint venture that 
includes Glencore, the mining company, and Chandra Asri, an Indonesia-based chemicals producer.
