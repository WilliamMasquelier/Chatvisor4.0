1. Shell reported a 17% decline in annual net profit to $16.1 billion for 2024, primarily due to falling oil and gas prices and significant asset write-offs, indicating a challenging financial environment for the company.

2. The company's revenue decreased by nearly 11% to $289 billion, reflecting the impact of weakened demand, particularly influenced by economic conditions in China and the aftermath of the Ukraine conflict.

3. Despite the profit drop, Shell's CEO Wael Sawan described the financial performance as "strong," leading to a 4% increase in dividends and a $3.5 billion share buyback, showcasing a commitment to shareholder returns amidst financial pressures.

4. Shell has faced criticism for backtracking on key climate targets, diluting its carbon emission reduction goals and halting new offshore wind projects, which raises concerns about its long-term sustainability strategy and alignment with global energy transition efforts.

5. The company is at a strategic crossroads, balancing the need for immediate profitability from oil and gas against the pressures of transitioning to a lower-carbon future, as highlighted by analysts and environmental activists.
