1. Shell has revised its long-term demand predictions for liquefied natural gas (LNG), now expecting a 60% increase in global consumption by 2040, driven by economic growth in Asia, particularly in China and India.

2. The company emphasizes that LNG will play a crucial role in decarbonizing Asia, suggesting that a significant switch from coal to gas could substantially reduce carbon emissions in the region.

3. Despite optimistic forecasts, analysts warn of tangible barriers to LNG demand growth, including high prices that may hinder its competitiveness against coal, which could limit Shell's market expansion in Asia.

4. Shell's outlook is contrasted by concerns over potential oversupply in the LNG market due to new projects coming online in the US and Qatar, which could impact pricing and demand for Australian LNG in the coming years.
