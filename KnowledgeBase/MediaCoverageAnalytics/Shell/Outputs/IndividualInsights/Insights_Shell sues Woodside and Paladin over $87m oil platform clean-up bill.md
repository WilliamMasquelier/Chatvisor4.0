1. Shell is pursuing legal action against Woodside Energy and Paladin Resources for $86.6 million, claiming that previous agreements exempted it from responsibility for the clean-up costs of the Northern Endeavour oil platform.

2. The lawsuit highlights the ongoing issue of liability for abandoned oil and gas projects in Australia, particularly in light of new regulations aimed at protecting taxpayers from remediation costs if operators fail to meet their obligations.

3. The Northern Endeavour platform, previously owned by Woodside, was sold to Timor Sea Oil and Gas Australia, which subsequently went into administration after safety concerns halted production, raising fears of government intervention for clean-up costs.

4. Shell's claim asserts that agreements made during the sale of its interests in the Northern Endeavour explicitly place the responsibility for environmental remediation on Woodside and Paladin, indicating a potential shift in liability dynamics within the industry.
