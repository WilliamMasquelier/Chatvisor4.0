1. Shell is contesting a $99 million tax bill from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), which claims the company understated its profits from a $3.5 billion exit from Woodside Petroleum, leading to a significant capital gains tax dispute.

2. The ATO has determined that Shell should have reported a capital gain of $193.9 million more than it initially declared from the 2017 sale of its Woodside shares, as well as an additional $135.7 million from a previous share sale in 2014.

3. Despite the ongoing legal battle, Shell maintains that it complies with all legal and taxation obligations, emphasizing its cooperative relationship with the ATO regarding business and taxation discussions.

4. The case highlights the broader context of the oil and gas sector in Australia, which has become a significant contributor to the national tax revenue, with major producers like Shell being among the largest taxpayers, contributing over $11 billion in the 2022-23 income tax year. 

5. Shell's Australian operations reported a profit of $US632.7 million in 2023, a substantial decrease from the previous year's $US2.7 billion, raising concerns about the company's financial performance in the region amidst the tax dispute.
