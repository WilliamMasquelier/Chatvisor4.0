1. Shell's chairwoman, Cecile Wake, highlighted that a "dysfunctional and enormously complicated" regulatory system in Australia is hindering the transition to clean energy, jeopardizing the country's ability to meet its 2030 climate targets.

2. The company faces significant challenges in both gas and renewable energy sectors due to overlapping state and federal regulations, which have led to delays and increased costs for major projects, including Shell's own Crux LNG project.

3. Shell's investment strategy in Australia is at risk as the company may consider redirecting its capital elsewhere if the regulatory environment does not improve, indicating a potential shift in focus for future energy investments.

4. The Clean Energy Council has echoed Shell's concerns, stating that current environmental and planning rules for renewable energy projects are inadequate, which has resulted in a lack of progress on large-scale developments necessary to meet government targets.

5. Shell aims to expand its renewable energy portfolio to 4GW by 2032, but the company emphasizes the need for a harmonized regulatory framework to facilitate multiple waves of investment across both gas and renewable sectors to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.
