1. Shell has made significant investments in the Australian carbon offsets market, including a $14 million stake in Corporate Carbon, raising concerns about the integrity of emissions reduction efforts as fossil fuel companies profit from their own emissions.

2. The subsidiary Shell Energy Environmental Products Australia reported a profit of $3.4 million in 2021, followed by losses in subsequent years, indicating volatility in its carbon trading operations and raising questions about the effectiveness of its carbon offset strategies.

3. Critics argue that allowing fossil fuel companies like Shell to participate in the creation and sale of carbon credits is "perverse," as it enables them to profit from the very emissions they generate, undermining genuine climate change mitigation efforts.

4. Shell's involvement in carbon offset projects has faced scrutiny from industry experts who call for stricter regulations to ensure that emissions reductions are not merely a financial strategy for polluters but a genuine effort to combat climate change.

5. The broader carbon market in Australia is criticized for being dominated by large fossil fuel companies, with allegations of conflicts of interest and low-quality emission offsets, which could diminish the credibility of Shell's carbon initiatives.
