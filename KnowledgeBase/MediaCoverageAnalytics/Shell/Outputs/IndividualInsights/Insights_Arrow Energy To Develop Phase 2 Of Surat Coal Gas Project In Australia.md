1. Arrow Energy, a joint venture between Shell and PetroChina, is set to initiate the second phase of the Surat coal seam gas project in Queensland, which is expected to produce an additional 130 terajoules of gas per day at peak production, with the first gas anticipated in 2026.

2. The development of Phase 2 is positioned as a strategic response to increasing demands for gas in Australia, highlighting Shell's commitment to enhancing local energy supply amidst calls from regulatory bodies for more investment in the sector.

3. Shell's Integrated Gas and Upstream Director, Zo Yujnovich, emphasized that this investment is part of their broader strategy to provide a secure energy source with lower emissions compared to coal, reinforcing Shell's focus on sustainability in energy production.

4. The gas produced from the Surat project will be directed to the Shell-operated QCLNG liquefied natural gas facility, ensuring compliance with long-term contracts and contributing to the domestic market, which underscores Shell's integral role in Australia's energy landscape.
