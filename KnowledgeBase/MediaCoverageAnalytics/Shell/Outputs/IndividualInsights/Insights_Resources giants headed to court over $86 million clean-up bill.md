1. Shell is pursuing legal action against Woodside and Paladin Resources in the WA Supreme Court, contesting an $86.5 million clean-up bill associated with the Northern Endeavour oil platform, which Shell argues should not be its responsibility.

2. The clean-up costs stem from an offshore petroleum levy introduced by the federal government in 2022, aimed at addressing the financial burdens of decommissioning the unmanned Northern Endeavour vessel, which has faced safety and environmental concerns.

3. Shell claims that a clause in the original share purchase agreement with Woodside and Paladin makes them liable for any claims related to the venture, and it is seeking reimbursement for the clean-up costs as well as compensation for future expenses related to the decommissioning process.

4. The Northern Endeavour, which was part of a joint venture established in the late 1990s, was sold to Northern Oil and Gas Australia (NOGA) in 2015, but was shut down within four years due to safety issues, leading to significant financial and environmental repercussions.
