When \nrenewable electricity is passed through the solution, the pure iron plates on to a cathode, from where it can be \ncollected for sale.\nElement Zero is commissioning a green iron pilot plant in the Perth suburb of Malaga, where 100 kilograms of iron \nore will be fed into the process each day.\nMr Kolodziejczyk received an Order of Australia in 2022 for services to hydrogen energy science.\nBut he said the lack of hydrogen in Element Zero's process was an advantage because it lowered capital costs and \nallowed for a more direct and efficient use of renewable power.\nFortescue announced last February that it had developed a method for making green iron without requiring \nhydrogen, but Dr Forrest said that breakthrough was based on Fortescue's secret membrane technology.\nMr Masterman said he believed technologies reliant on membranes would be hard to scale up, and stressed that \nElement Zero did not use membranes.\n\"If you want to build a plant that is say 5 million tonnes per year, you can't pass 5 million tonnes a year through a \nvery expensive piece of plastic,\" he said, in reference to membranes.\nMr Masterman's association with Dr Forrest goes back to the late 1990s when he was the finance boss at troubled \nminer Anaconda Nickel.\nHe later held senior roles at Fortescue, including as international projects boss, before serving as chief financial \nofficer and chief investment officer within Fortescue's Future Industries division between 2020 and 2022.\nHe was also chairman of Dr Forrest's private company Squadron Energy until late 2021; Squadron is now \nAustralia's biggest owner of renewable power assets.\nDuring their time at FFI, Mr Masterman and Mr Kolodziejczyk were among the small group that spent most of 2020 \ntravelling on Dr Forrest's private jet to more than 30 nations on the hunt for clean energy projects.\nMr Masterman said leaving Fortescue better enabled him to focus on a smaller number of projects.\n\"There became a point in time where, for me, [there were] too many time zones; let's come back and focus,\" he \nsaid. \"So I stepped back in 2022 and focused on where there are opportunities for very, very large-scale \ndecarbonisation.\"\nSome of the green iron technologies being pursued by Fortescue were developed by Mr Kolodziejczyk during his \ntime at the company, and his name is still on some Fortescue patents.Page 3 of 3\nEx-Fortescue duo's green-iron play\nAsked why he did not pursue Element Zero's electro-reduction method while working at Fortescue, Mr \nKolodziejczyk said the idea had not dawned on him until later. \"You actually had to step out of Fortescue to \nbrainstorm, ideate and develop a pathway,\" he said. \"We tested it in our garage initially to make sure it works.\n\"We can move significantly faster being a small start-up company.\"\nMr Masterman said he hoped Element Zero could have a good working relationship with Fortescue in the future.\n\"We need a broad church to be successful here,\" he said.\n\"There are enormous incentives for the major iron ore companies to solve this problem and enormous incentives for \nthe major steel companies to solve this problem.\n\"We want to be in a position, with the support of the full industry, to be able to deploy at scale quickly.\"\nElement Zero was registered with ASIC in December 2022 and raised $9 million from US venture capital fund \nPlayground Global in August.\nThe money was part of a $10 million raising that will help fund studies on a larger plant that would consume a tonne \nof iron ore per day.\nLoad-Date: January 19, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 21\nLength: 1208 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nBarely three years ago, hydrogen seemed to be the panacea for all the world's problems.\nIt was touted as the next clean fuel for passenger cars, the chemical catalyst that would decarbonise the steel and \nalumina industries, an ingredient for clean fertiliser and maybe even the replacement for methane gas in kitchen \nstoves.\n\"People thought it was a floor wax and a dessert topping, and it was good for everything,\" recalls Peter Barrett, the \nfounder of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Playground Global.\n\"But it ain't.\"\nBarrett isn't a hydrogen sceptic; as a director of Californian company Universal Hydrogen, he believes the \n\"incredibly useful\" molecule can cure the carbon footprint of the aviation and maritime industries plus work for \nfertiliser. But he doesn't hesitate to use the \"b\" word - bubble - when asked to explain the capitulation in most listed \nhydrogen stocks over the past three years.\n\"Some of the valuations were chasing applications that didn't necessarily make sense,\" he says. \"We see bubbles \nlike that, we are seeing one in AI today. People pile in, and they put money into silly shit.\"\nThe euphoria in hydrogen stocks peaked between Joe Biden winning the Democratic Party nomination in mid-2020 \nand his inauguration as president in January 2021.\nThe prospect of a green political wave at a time of ultra-low interest rates led investors toward riskier investments, \nparticularly those with a decarbonisation theme.\nBut three years on, the hydrogen tide has receded.\nThe 97-year-old Norwegian company Nel belongs to the \"sensible\" end of the hydrogen spectrum; it has \nmanufactured the electrolysers that turn water into hydrogen for decades, and Australian companies like Woodside \nand Viva Energy have its order book bursting at the seams.\nPage 2 of 3\nShould Fortescue buy its way to supremacy in hydrogen? Due Diligence\nBut Nel shares are down 86 per cent over the past three years as it endures short-term pain (investment in extra \nmanufacturing capacity) to underwrite a long-term strategy.\nThe silly end of the hydrogen spectrum was best represented by Nikola Motors, the hydrogen truck aspirant that, \namong other sins, was forced to admit to US regulators that it had rolled its prototype truck down a hill to make it \nappear functional for promotional videos.\nThe incident was one of several lies or exaggerations told to investors about Nikola's progress, and late last year its \ntalismanic founder Trevor Milton was sentenced to jail for fraud.\nNikola shares peaked at $US65.90 in 2020 but were just US62\u00a2 last week.\nAnother hydrogen truck aspirant, Hyzon, has lost 96.5 per cent of its value since February 2021 after it, too, fell foul \nof regulators for misleading investors over its sales performance.\nThe irregularities found by US regulators in the accounts of Plug Power - a manufacturer of hydrogen-powered \nforklifts, electrolysers and other components - were less serious than those at Nikola and Hyzon.\nBut they haven't helped investor confidence; Plug shares are down 96 per cent over the past three years, and the \ncash-strapped stock lost almost 12 per cent on Thursday when it revealed plans to issue $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) \nof new shares.\nWhile each stock is affected by individual factors, David Tuckwell from GlobalX says the common thread has been \nhigher interest rates making future cash flows seem less attractive; a painful blow for a sector where almost all cash \nflows are far from being realised.\nTuckwell manages a hydrogen exchange-traded fund.\nAside from interest rates, he says investors have been scared away from the hydrogen sector by frequent dilutive \nshare issuances and the threat that Donald Trump could scrap President Joe Biden's hydrogen incentives if he \nregains power.\nAmid this market carnage, the International Energy Agency still reckons global demand for hydrogen will more than \ntriple by 2050 if nations keep to their \"announced pledges\". The IEA believes demand for \"low-emissions\" hydrogen \nwill rise 25-fold by 2030 if those announced pledges are kept intact, and 246-fold by 2050.\nThe hard part is determining which of hydrogen's many uses will be adopted at scale, and then how to invest in \nthose applications.\nAsset manager Mirova's sustainability equity fund took its first cautious steps into hydrogen last year when it \npurchased shares in Euronext company Air Liquide.\nAir Liquide makes a range of industrial gases, and its hydrogen is made from both fossil fuels and renewable \npower.\nMirova analyst Cindy Huang reckons investing in incumbents like Air Liquide is the best way to get insights into how \nthe hydrogen sector will evolve, even if that means investing in a stock that currently has a big carbon footprint and \ndoes not offer pure exposure to hydrogen.\n\"We try to learn first from the individual company, and then through that company understand that part of the value \nchain,\" she says.\nAir Liquide and the other industrial gas producers that dabble in hydrogen, like Linde and US company Air \nProducts, have delivered much better returns for investors over the past three years than pure hydrogen stocks.\n\"Hopefully over time [we can] expand downwards through the value chain and hopefully identify more investment \ntargets,\" says Huang, adding that electrolyser makers could offer exciting, medium term growth.Page 3 of 3\nShould Fortescue buy its way to supremacy in hydrogen? Due Diligence\nBut Huang believes companies producing hydrogen fuel cells, or hydrogen for power generation, will require much \nmore patience and risk tolerance from investors.\nA separate Mirova fund has bypassed stocks to make direct investments in hydrogen businesses like Parisian taxi \ncompany Hype, which runs 400 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles refuelling at Hype's own stations.\nNo conversation about hydrogen is complete - in Australia at least - without mentioning Fortescue, the iron ore \nminer whose founder Andrew Forrest is the nation's biggest hydrogen bull.\nFortescue has built an electrolyser factory in Gladstone and has sanctioned its first green hydrogen project, a \n$US550 million hub in Arizona that will make low carbon hydrogen and offer refuelling services to hydrogen trucks.\nFortescue would need 1363 projects the size of that $US550 million hub to achieve its goal of producing 15 million \ntonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030.\nThe hub was acquired from Nikola and the two companies are working on a long-term supply agreement. \nFortescue's North America boss and former AGL chief executive Andy Vesey is now a director of Nikola.\nFortescue is also close to Hyzon, having acquired hydrogen-powered buses from the struggling company.\nBut Fortescue's most interesting relationship is with Plug; the iron ore miner has ordered electrolysers from Plug, \nand has floated the idea of giving Plug a stake in its Arizona hub under an equity swap that would give Fortescue a \nshareholding in one of Plug's projects in Texas.\nWhen Plug boss Andy Marsh updates investors on Tuesday, it will be exactly one year since he bruised Fortescue \nby suggesting the economics of the Gladstone electrolyser factory were not attractive enough for him to invest.\nPlug shares have since slumped 84 per cent for a market capitalisation of $US1.46 billion. Fortescue's shares \nhave risen 22 per cent over the same period for an $85 billion valuation.\nWith a power imbalance like that, perhaps it is time for Fortescue to consider buying its way to hydrogen \nsupremacy, rather than building.\nLoad-Date: January 24, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 21\nLength: 938 words\nByline: Hans van Leeuwen\nBody\nAt the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, only one Australian company had its own office in the \njamboree's central hotel, sitting cheek-by-jowl with those of the big global banks and accounting firms.\nOccupying a prime corner, with a big placard warning about lethal humidity at the door, is Fortescue Metals Group. \nAndrew Forrest has become a highly visible Davos regular, and for the past two years has been joined by \nFortescue Future Industries chief Mark \"Hutch\" Hutchinson.\nThis year, though, they brought a third Fortescue exec with them: Robert Tichio, who has been part of Team \nTwiggy for all of eight weeks.\nIt wasn't the Wall Street financier's first time at Davos, but on this trip he had a new mission: to speed-date \ninstitutional investors, educating them about Forrest's latest initiative: Fortescue Capital, which Tichio has been \nrecruited to run.\nTaking a breather in the Fortescue office, he describes to The Australian Financial Review what the Fortescue \nmaster schedule might look like on a given day at Davos.\n\"Andrew Forrest is Andrew Forrest - his calendar is like nobody else's, and it involves extraordinary visits with \npeople who are shaping the way that, frankly, the world will move over the next decade,\" he says.\n\"Hutch will spend an incredible amount of time working with project partners and large corporates - whose identities \nwouldn't surprise you - who may be partners, who may be suppliers, who may be governments, who are going to be \ninstrumental in helping Fortescue projects achieve escape velocity. And then I've been spending my time entirely \nwith allocators ... sovereigns, pensions, endowments, global investment banks.\"\nA lot of northern hemisphere financial giants don't really know Fortescue well. And even if they do, they certainly \nneed a steer on Fortescue Capital - because Forrest, Hutchinson and Tichio are trying to do something that \nnobody else has quite done before.\nPage 2 of 3\nDavos speed-dating for Forrest recruit Analysis\nEssentially, not everything in Forrest's vastly ambitious slate of green energy projects can be funded from the iron \nore miner's balance sheet. But rather than send Fortescue Metals Group to the private markets, Forrest has \ndelegated the job of finding the funds to Tichio and his rapidly growing team.\nFortescue Capital has a foot in both camps: it works inside the company to get projects ready to pitch for external \nfunding; and then it raises and manages those funds. It's like an in-house asset manager or investment bank.\nBut this puts Tichio in an interesting position. From the outside, it looks very much like Forrest exercises pretty \nunfettered authority inside Fortescue. Shareholders can either like that or lump it.\nThose shareholders who have stuck with Forrest have been amply rewarded. But he can't take that attitude with the \nprivate markets. Institutional investors, running the risk-o-meter over specific Fortescue projects, will demand a \ntighter straitjacket.\nAnd Fortescue Capital, as the middle man, serves two masters. It raises the capital for its parent company, but it \nhas fiduciary duties to its investors. It looks as if Tichio is a man who might sometimes have to say \"no\" to Forrest. \nOr at least \"yes, but\".\nIt's a role he acknowledges is \"delicate\". \"No one will unmoor the chairman, he's an extraordinary visionary. I \nwouldn't have come to do this if I didn't believe in the way that he sets out a vision, particularly in categories that are \nunmarked, that are uncharted,\" Tichio says.\n\"He has an extraordinary ability to see long-term vision and make decisions that oftentimes really require the \neducation of the market versus the other way around. And we're not going to change that.\"\nHe rejects the idea that he will be some kind of Dr No. He describes Fortescue Capital as \"a voice in the room \nabout what third-party capital will want to see in a project\", helping decide whether a project is best suited to \nexternal or internal funding.\n\"Those are conversations we're having now daily. And I think it has been a really remarkable early series of \nexchanges, robust exchanges, on this,\" he says.\nTichio has spent his early weeks visiting various parts of the Fortescue empire, learning about the projects that \nmight ultimately come to his unit for funding. He was in Norway before Davos, and heads to the WAE operation in \nBritain afterwards.\n\"This has been a ramp period for us to work with the industrial teams, particularly on the energy side, to ensure that \ndecisions that are getting made around how these projects are being framed, sized, de-risked ... [are made] with \nthird-party equity investors in mind,\" he says.\nAlthough, of course, not every project will end up going externally for funding - some \"just may not be ready or \nappropriate\".\nMeanwhile, back at Fortescue Capital in New York, his colleagues are assembling \"a Wall-Street-deep team\" of \npeople from the likes of JPMorgan, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs.\nThe plan is not to raise capital for a pooled fund, in the style of Brookfield or Macquarie Asset Management, where \nthe money manager gets wide discretion about what to do with the cash.\nInstead, Tichio and his team will hawk \"diligenced, ringfenced assets or investment offerings\" for investors to \nconsider on an individual basis. Those offerings will come in the next three years, although probably not in 2024.\n\"If you were a fly on the wall of this room in Davos, there have been a lot of conversations with allocators to start to \nintroduce to them what they might expect to see from us, because of what we know is coming in the pipeline.\"Page 3 of 3\nDavos speed-dating for Forrest recruit Analysis\nIf Tichio can navigate his tricky job successfully, it sounds like he will be finding his way back to Davos again next \nyear.\nLoad-Date: January 25, 2024\nEnd of Document",

That forecast has now been cut to 2 to 4 million \ntonnes due to continual leaks in the higher pressure section of a 240-kilometre pipeline that supplies water to the \nprocessing plant.\nFortescue's first move into complex processing of the ore it mines has been dogged with problems since three \nsenior executives exited three years ago when news of cost blowouts first surfaced.\nFortescue's guidance for total production of both types of iron ore for the 12 months to June remains unchanged at \n192 million to 197 million tonnes.\nFortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said it was a strong quarter from the iron ore operation that included \nthe company's second shipment of magnetite and the initial export from its Belinga project in Gabon.\n\"We achieved this while continuing to grow our green technology, energy and metals businesses, keeping costs low \nand maintaining our safety performance,\" he said.\nFortescue aims for its mining operation to be emissions-free by 2030, a far more aggressive target than any other \nAustralian miner.

Fortescue wrote $US1bn off its valuation of the project in its last annual report.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue nears green hydrogen call\nFortescue shipped 48.6 million tonnes of iron ore in the December quarter, slightly below the 49.4 million tonnes \nshipped in the same period in 2022.\nThe company said its C1 cash cost for the period averaged $US17.62 a wet metric tonne, and it received an \naverage $US116.18 a dry metric tonne for its sales in the December period.\nFortescue closed December with net debt of $US600m, the company said. The company has said it still expects to \nship 192-197 million tonnes for the full year, despite the impact of the troubles at Iron Bridge and a derailment on its \niron ore line in the Pilbara that stopped trains for four days over the New Year weekend.\nFortescue said it was implementing an \"operational recovery plan\" to optimise rail loading and shipments for the \nsecond half of the year.\nFortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said he believed the company would still meet its full-year \nshipments guidance for the year, despite the setbacks at Iron Bridge and through the derailment.\n\"The rest of the supply chain is performing exceptionally well. The bottleneck for our operations is rail, so we expect \nany specific recovery plan just to be focused on that, but we're in a pretty good position,\" Mr Otranto said.\nAfter falling short of its promise to reach a final investment decision on as many as five green energy projects in \n2024, the company was likely to make a call on its biggest planned hydrogen project in Australia, Mr Hutchinson \nsaid.\nFortescue announced the -approval of two projects from its energy division in November, ticking off plans for small \nhydrogen production plants in Phoenix in the US and at Gladstone in Queensland.\nAt the time, Fortescue said it would fast-track a decision on larger projects in Norway, Kenya and Brazil.\nBut the company put off any decision on its Gibson Island proposal in Brisbane, where For-tescue has been \nworking with Incitec Pivot on a green hydrogen feed for Incitec's mothballed fertiliser plant. At the time, Fortescue \ncited high Australian energy costs for the deferral.\nLate last month, Genex Power told the market it had extended a deadline for Fortescue to close a deal for power \nfrom its proposed Bulli Creek solar farm - first -announced in October - by two months until the end of February.\nMr Hutchinson told reporters and analysts that a final decision on the plant was likely at Fortescue's board \nmeeting.\n\"We're working hard to get this project over the line,\" Mr Hutchinson said. \"We have a board meeting coming up \nlater in February and I would imagine there will be a 'go or no go' decision made at that board meeting.\" Fortescue \nshares rose 2 per cent to $28.97 in a higher market on Thursday.\nLoad-Date: January 25, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The scale of the projects we are doing now is 10-fold bigger than they were \neven five years ago.\"\nQuinbrook remains agnostic about the cable side of Sun Cable - a 4200-kilometre undersea transmission cable that \nwould connect Darwin and Singapore - and is focused on delivering its end of the bargain in the form of giant solar \nfarms and onshore transmission infrastructure. It is working with potential customers within the NT government's \nMiddle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct adjacent to the port, where Fortescue and French oil and gas major \nTotal have been allocated land for green hydrogen projects. Mr Scaysbrook said if Mr Cannon-Brookes' Grok \nVentures succeeded with the cable component to Sun Cable, Quinbrook would build more solar capacity to meet \nthe extra demand.\n\"Our job is to lead the development, and then we have an option to invest equity in the onshore component.\n\"Once we can prove up the delivered cost of renewable power into the MASDP, and we're getting closer to being \nable to do that, then we can say to industry that wants to locate there, 'this is what your power cost is going to be', \nremembering that just one of these factories will consume two to three times more power than the NT currently \nproduces.\"\nLast year, the NT government set aside land at the Middle Arm precinct for Fortescue and Total as well as \nBeetaloo Basin gas field developer Tamboran Resources, vanadium play Tivan and phosphate-focused Avenira.\nMr Scaysbrook said Quinbrook was focused on the NT and north Queensland, where it's looking for backers for a \n$10 billion polysilicon plant at the Lansdown eco-industrial precinct in Townsville that would supply solar panel \nmanufacturers.\nLoad-Date: February 11, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Mr Lange was appointed as the president of \nFortescue Energy's European operations in March 2023, tasked with helping Fortescue make good on its big \npromises about the production of green energy and hydrogen across Europe.\nAt the same time long-term company secretary Cameron Wilson is set to take a step back from Fortescue, initially \nshifting to a part-time role as he hands over duties at the company. Mr Wilson's decision comes only a few months \nafter the departure of co-company secretary and Fortescue general counsel Gemma Tually, who stepped down \nfrom the role in November 2023.\n\"We are delighted that (Cameron) has agreed to continue with the company on a part-time basis to ensure a \nsmooth transition,\" a Fortescue spokesman said.\nBoth of those moves come amid a fresh wave of senior executive losses at Fortescue.\nFormer Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner quit the company earlier this month, after only 15 months \nwith Fortescue's Energy arm. Initially appointed as Fortescue Energy's Head of Northern Australia in late 2022, Mr \nGunner finished his period with Fortescue as the head of business development for Australia and New Zealand.\nThis year Fortescue Energy also lost the services of chief financial officer Deborah Caudle, less than five months \nafter she was appointed to the role, with former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also formally severing ties with the \ncompany, and external affairs boss Fiona Sugden leaving to join the office of current Prime Minister Anthony \nAlbanese.\nThe departure of Mr Lange - also once an executive director of Fortescue's WAE arm in Britain - extends the \nuncertainty around the company's progress in establishing a hydrogen and green energy production hub in Europe.\nIn 2022 Fortescue committed to delivering as much as five million tonnes of green hydrogen a year to German \ngiant E. ON, one of Europe's largest power companies, with the start of deliveries around 2030.\nThe company also bought into a German import terminal in late 2022, and has said its first European green \nhydrogen plant is likely to be in Norway.\nBut the company also missed a self-imposed deadline to make a final investment decision on up to five green \nenergy projects by the end of 2023, instead saying it had \"fast-tracked\" an investment decision on its Holmaset \nproject in Norway.\nShipping news As blockbuster names go for decisions at next week's High Court sittings, you couldn't do much \nbetter than a showdown between Indian billionaire Gautam Adani and British metals magnate Sanjeev Gupta.\nOn a first glance, the prospect of a High Court call on a gloves-off stoush in the nation's top court between the \nAdani Group's Carmichael coal mine and Gupta's Whyalla steelworks should have security guards wedging them \ninto the aisles with crowbars in Court No 1 in Canberra on Wednesday.\nSadly, the reality falls far short of Margin Call's hopes, expectations and sensationalist attempts to fool our loyal \nreaders into reading the last third of this column.\nWhile the case does indeed involve companies associated with both men - along with a shipping line - the actual \ndispute troubling the court appears to be the most pointless pile of guff to ever be billed in eight-minute increments \nby King's Counsel.\nEssentially, the dispute is this: Carmichael commissioned Gupta's South Australian steelworks to manufacture 8669 \nindividual steel rails for its railway line.\nWhyalla did so, and bunged them onto a ship in South Australia - owned by BBC Chartering Carriers GmbH - \nbound for Queensland's Galilee basin.Page 3 of 3\nNew chief executive pays price\nAs it turns out, somebody failed to tie them down properly in the ship's hold, so the rails apparently got bounced \naround a bit in transit, rendering them unfit for use as railway lines when they finally arrived in Mackay.\nAs a result Carmichael was forced to flog the lot off for scrap, fetching $656,998.51. The Adani group now, not \nunreasonably, wants someone to cough up for the difference in what it paid for the rails and what it received from \nthe scrap merchants.\nAlthough the court documents don't make it clear exactly how much is at stake, the total sum is likely to be a fair bit \nsouth of $10m, steel industry sources suggest.\nOn the face of it, a pretty simple commercial dispute, with only one likely outcome. But, no! As the matter \napproached hearings in the Federal Court over who should pay, shipping line BBC launched a bid to move the case \nto arbitration in London.\nAnd, as is known by all close followers of admiralty and maritime law (may God protect their eternal souls), the \nAustralian and British laws on the subject may read the same, but are interpreted very differently - with the British \ninterpretation likely to reduce the liability of the shipping company.\nThe issue now facing the High Court is whether to allow this type of jurisdiction shopping, or not. Lawyers of our \nacquaintance insist it could be an immensely important point of law at some other point, or the High Court wouldn't \nbother hearing it. Irrespective, Margin Call is betting the legal teams will make more money than the cargo was \nworth by the time the case is done.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Billionaires battle it out in High Court clash\nLoad-Date: February 9, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 698 words\nHighlight: The health of China's economy will be a key focus for investors when big miners BHP, Rio Tinto and \nFortescue report their results this week.\nBody\nInvestors will this week be seeking reassurance from Australia's largest miners that there are no shocks in store \nfrom China's economy as it kicks back into gear following a week-long holiday for the Lunar New Year.\nThese issues will come under intense scrutiny when BHP reports its half-year results on Tuesday, followed by Rio \nTinto on Wednesday and then Fortescue.\nThe share prices of all three miners started 2024 at record highs, with iron ore prices soaring through the $US140-\nmark on the promise of fresh stimulus measures in China. But these stocks retreated over the past month as \nworries returned about China's economic malaise and its impact on iron ore demand.\nIt is a significant issue for BHP and Rio, which both count on China for more than half of their revenue. For \nFortescue, the figure is closer to 90 per cent.\nAnd it will be of significance in Canberra as well, with iron ore accounting for around 60 per cent of the value of \nAustralian exports to China in recent years.\n\"The first dark cloud is growing concerns about the Chinese property markets and Chinese economy,\" investment \nbanking group Jefferies said in a recent report.\nJeffries also flagged concerns about non-residential construction outside China, including the US commercial real \nestate market, which is buckling under significant debt and low valuations.\n\"The problem, in each case, is that things are more likely to get worse before they get better,\" the banking group's \nanalysts said.\nOne bright spot for China's economy is that travel and spending patterns during China's most important holiday \nbreak indicate that domestic consumption has rebounded, despite the economic struggle with deflation and a \nproperty crisis. It has primed China's sharemarkets for a strong opening this week.\nANZ senior commodity strategist Daniel Hynes doubted even a potential stimulus package from the Chinese \ngovernment - something that investors have been discussing for months - would cure the country's economic woes.\nPage 2 of 2\nMining giants BHP , Rio and Fortescue to watch China as they post results\n\"I think the stimulus will help stem the fall that we've seen in property investment and construction activity, but that \nwon't ignite another rally like we've seen in the past,\" he said.\nThis is crucial for Australian miners, as property and construction account for half of the 1 billion tonnes of steel \nChina produces annually. But Hynes said iron ore miners were helping their own cause by recognising that growth \nin steel demand is reaching its limits.\n\"They're now talking about peak steel demand and that did instigate a bit of a review of their projects,\" he said.\nHynes said he expected this to pay off over the medium term as miners balance supply and demand.\n\"We actually have the iron ore market, remaining relatively tight over the next two to three years. On the back of \nthat lower growth in supply.\"\nAccording to Macquarie Equities, consensus estimates expected a $US6.5 billion ($10 billion) underlying profit from \nBHP for the half year, a full-year profit of $US11.6 billion from Rio for the year ending December 31, and $US3.3 \nbillion from Fortescue's half year.\nWhile BHP is a diversified miner, iron ore dwarfs the contribution of the other businesses.\nMacquarie forecasts that iron ore earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will reach $US9.8 \nbillion, followed by copper with $US3.1 billion and coal at $US1.1 billion.\nBHP confirmed last week that its nickel business would make no contribution to earnings, after writing down the \nvalue of the loss-making business to zero.\nThe Albanese government subsequently added nickel to its critical minerals list, which opens access to potentially \nbillions of dollars in government funding, and the West Australian government has also offered royalty relief for the \nnickel industry.\n\"The nickel industry supported almost 10,000 jobs, and generated sales of more than $5 billion last financial year,\" \nWA Premier Roger Cook said on Saturday while announcing the package.\n\"It is also an essential component of the state's vision of becoming a global hub for the downstream processing of \nbattery metals.\"\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

Softer shipments or ore in January because of bad weather and a train derailment meant \nFortescue will need a stronger second half to meet its shipping forecasts.\n\"This is not unusual seasonally, but we will need to monitor for disruptions over coming months,\" Shaw said.\nAt Iron Bridge, Fortescue had planned to produce five million tonnes of high-grade magnetite ore this financial year \nas it ramped up the $5.9 billion project to its full capacity of 22 million tonnes a year. The project hit a snag recently \nfrom continual leaks in the higher pressure section of a 240-kilometre pipeline that supplies water to the processing \nplant.\nNevertheless, the company said it reached six million tonnes of mined ore over the first half at Iron Bridge and \nshipped 84 thousand tonnes.

Fortescue has promised to end its use of fossil fuels by the end of the decade and \nbecome a \"real zero\" emitter of carbon. But to do that the company has said it needs 2 to 3 gigawatt of renewable \nenergy generation, along with battery firming.\nSo far Fortescue has only committed to a 100 megawatt solar farm at its Iron Bridge magnetite operation and a \n60MW solar farm at its Chichester iron ore mine. But last year, as part of an investor tour of its operations, \nFortescue flagged plans to build a gigawatt of both solar and wind generation around its mines, as well as up to \n4GWh of battery storage.\nSpeaking to analysts on Thursday, however, Mr Hutchinson said the company had held discussions with the \nproponents of AREH, as well as other potential renewable energy providers in the region.\nAREH is 48 per cent owned by fossil fuel giant BP, and includes Macquarie, CWP Global and Intercontinental \nEnergy as joint venture partners. The consortium plans to build a giant 26GW of combined solar and wind power on \na 6500 sq km site north east of the Port Hedland iron ore export hub.\n\"We are talking to many parties including the BP and Intercontinental Energy team and will continue to do so,\" Mr \nHutchinson said. \"This is one ecosystem which we want to make sure gets developed in Australia. And we want to \nmake sure we also have the most efficient energy for our own use.

He said: \"Change is necessary if you're going to improve. You cannot \nimprove without change.\n\"I think we're settling it down now.

It's a tough decision.\n\"So we're working very closely with the Queensland government and federal government to figure out a way to \nmake it happen because it's a bit of a litmus test for the rest of the hydrogen industry in Australia, to be honest.\nPage 2 of 2\nHydrogen's half price challenge Clean energy\n\"We're very keen to get it up.\"\n\"Green\" hydrogen can be made with zero or low carbon emissions if renewable electricity is passed through water \nto separate the fluid into its constituent parts, oxygen and hydrogen.\nFortescue has travelled the world over the past five years searching for the cheapest sources of clean power to \ngenerate affordable green hydrogen.\nThe company expects to approve a green hydrogen project in Norway this year which would be powered by carbon-\nfree hydroelectricity.\n\"If you look around the world where you can get cheap renewable power, competitive renewable power is below \n$US30 a megawatt hour,\" he said.\n\"That should really be the target and particularly when you're looking at really what will be a global market to supply \ngreen ammonia, green hydrogen. So that's kind of the goal.\"\nAverage annual power prices were above $100 per megawatt hour in NSW, Queensland and South Australia in \n2023, according to data published by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER).\nThe same AER data found average annual power prices in Tasmania were $56 per megawatt hour while Victorian \nprices averaged slightly higher than Tasmania.\nAsked about the large number of departures from Fortescue's executive ranks over the past four years, Mr \nHutchinson said new recruits needed to fit into the company's unique culture, not vice versa.\n\"Some people come in and think they [have to] fix it,\" he said. \"That's just not Fortescue.

Our population is hard- working. Our population is \nsmart. Our population is determined. We just happen to have all the resources which China doesn't,\" he said.\nThe iron ore and clean energy entrepreneur was speaking from Beijing, where he has been meeting with China's \nleaders. Over the weekend, along with BHP CEO Mike Henry and Rio Tinto's Jakob Stausholm, he was at the \nChina Development Forum, an event held in Beijing as many international businesses have been debating their \nfuture in the world's second-biggest economy.\nDr Forrest said Beijing was being \"very welcoming\" of international businesses, but the tense geopolitical \nenvironment posed challenges. \"It's becoming more difficult because of bellicose North American attitudes. And \nChina kicks an own goal through these cyber activities into democratic institutions. That is just intolerable,\" he told \nThe Australian.\nPage 2 of 3\nChalmers right on economy: Forrest\nOn Tuesday, Foreign Minister Penny Wong joined her counterparts from Britain, the US and New Zealand in calling \nout \"China state-backed actors\" that had targeted democratic institutions and parliamentarians in Britain.\nDr Forrest said that China's cyber interference \"might not be an act of war, but it's hostile\".\n\"I feel that China is such a huge and vast organisation that, generally, it's attitude is to be very friendly with the rest \nof the world. But it does trip up,\" he said.\nBeijing never interfered with supplies of iron ore during its economic coercion campaign on Australia, but the tense \nrelationship raised anxiety among all China-exposed businesses. Later this week, Beijing is expected to remove the \npunitive tariffs it imposed on the Australian wine industry in November 2020.\nDr Forrest welcomed the improvement in the relationship, which he said had gone from \"childish and politically \nmotivated\" to \"maturity\".\n\"I see a real consolidation of the relationship and trust building back into the Australia-China bilateral relationship. \nAnd that is necessary to continue the growth of the economies of both countries,\" he said.\nChina-reliant miners BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue are -Australia's three biggest taxpayers. A fall in iron ore prices \nby almost 25 per cent this year to just over $US105 a tonne ($160 a tonne) is being closely watched by the \nTreasury in Canberra.\nThe founder of Fortescue, the \"third force\" of Australia's iron ore export trade, said he remained confident about \nthe \"constant demand\" from China's steelmaking industry.\n\"Ebbs and flows, for sure, you see that. But the big mega trends are unchanged,\" he said.\nHe said a private dinner on Sunday night with Yi Gang, the former governor of the People's Bank of China, had \nreaffirmed that confidence.\nThe country's former central bank chief, who stood down last July, detailed various fiscal stimulus measures Beijing \nwas using to support housing, car ownership and the purchase of other big consumer items.\nDr Forrest said China's latest growth target of \"about 5 per cent\" announced by Premier Li Qiang earlier this month \nwould have been \"a bit of a yawn\" a decade ago. But he said growth at that rate for an economy as \"massive\" as \nChina's now would lead to \"a serious increase in goods and services \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 from around the world\".\nOn Thursday, the Fortescue founder will speak at the Boao Forum, another business forum held on China's \nHainan island.\nDr Forrest's address will focus on the clean energy transition and China's role in it.\nSince last year's Boao Forum, Beijing has built and installed 260 to 300 gigawatts of renewable energy generation, \naccording to analysts at Bloomberg.\nThat \"huge uptick\" has supported Fortescue's iron ore business, which is being used in \"all the infrastructure it \ntakes to create green energy and connect it to the grid,\" Dr Forrest said.\nLast week, industry leaders at an oil and gas conference in Houston said the huge infrastructure rollout to support \nenergy grids, along with power-hungry artificial intelligence data centres and world population increases, were \nextending the commercial viability of fossil fuels.\nDr Forrest said those comments had been useful for exposing the \"lip service\" of the fossil fuel industry only months \nafter climate scientists declared 2023 the hottest year on record.Page 3 of 3\nChalmers right on economy: Forrest\n\"The climate is going to hell in a handbag unless we turn it around,\" he told The Australian. \"The fossil fuel \nindustry's lip service to the energy transition is no more than that. It's like carbon sequestration. It's literally the \nsame old lie but waiting for the next new idiot to come along and believe it,\" he said.\nLoad-Date: March 26, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The deal was to underpin the first 450MW stage of the solar farm's \nconstruction, allowing Genex to look for additional contracts to upsize its construction to 775MW and target an \neventual 2GW of solar and battery capacity.\nBut, despite long having flagged plans to make a final investment decision by the end of 2023 - along with partner \nIncitec Pivot - Fortescue dropped Gibson Island from its top priority list only six weeks after signing on with Genex, \nsaying it was still working on front-end engineering and design studies \"as Australia struggles to shed its petrostate \nstatus and still suffers structurally high green electricity costs\".\nIn December, Genex extended Fortescue's deadline to make a final investment decision until the end of February, \nthen tacked on an additional month.\nThat deadline has also lapsed and, while Genex said on Tuesday a path was still open for Fortescue to buy power \nfrom the proposed 5000ha solar farm, the company also flagged talks with alternative buyers for the energy.\nPage 2 of 2\nGenex seeks new solar buyers\nGenex said Fortescue had -neither satisfied or waived the construction by the new March 31 deadline, leaving the \ndoor ajar for the iron ore and would-be renewable energy major to make good on the October power purchase \nagreement.\nIncitec declined to comment on Tuesday, but a Fortescue spokeswoman said the company was still \"progressing\" \nthe Gibson Island project, but \"we have more work to do\". She said: \"We are approaching this project with the same \nfinancial discipline Fortescue has shown for 20 years.\" But Genex said it was also involved in ongoing talks over \nadditional power contracts, and Fortescue's failure to meet the latest deadline \"has no material impact on the \nproject timeline or such discussions\" - despite confirming that it believed the agreement was on foot, and must be \nconfirmed or terminated before the company could close financing for Bulli Creek.\n\"Genex is continuing discussions with external parties for further solar offtake which would allow the initial capacity \nof the project to be increased to up to 775MW to become the largest grid-connected solar farm in Australia,\" the \ncompany said.\n\"Genex continues to expect that such discussions will conclude and the size of Bulli Creek confirmed by mid-2024, \nwhich will support the target of a final investment decision for the first-stage project in the second half of the year.\" \nHydrogen produced at Gibson Island was to have been used to produce ammonia at Incitec's mothballed fertiliser \nplant nearby.\nThe Australian understands a key factor in the decision to put the project on the backburner last year was \nFortescue's failure to find an external buyer for ammonia from the plant, with Incitec rival Orica believed to have \nturned down an offtake agreement unless Fortescue guaranteed it would then buy explosives produced using the \nplant's ammonia for use at its own mines.\nAnalysts have long doubted the viability of Gibson Island, with Goldman analysts last year tipping construction costs \nof $US1.5bn ($2.3bn) and production costs of about $US5.50-$US6 a kilogram of hydrogen.\nGenex shares closed up 1c at $25.5c on Tuesday, with Fortescue down 28c at $25.42.\nA month ago Genex received a $381m takeover bid from Japan's Electric Power Development, known as J-Power, \none of Japan's largest electricity companies, sending shares in the pure-play renewable energy developer up more \n30 per cent. Genex said on Tuesday the exclusivity period had been extended to April 8 with a view to reaching a \ndeal.\nJ-Power has also offered a back-up offer to secure Genex in the event that not enough of Genex's shareholders \nvote in favour of the bid. J-Power is offering a slightly lower amount of 27c in cash that is conditional on support \nfrom Genex shareholders owning at least 50.1 per cent of the Australian renewable energy company. The \nalternative structure comes amid concerns that a one-time suitor for Genex, Skip Capital, could block the deal.\nLoad-Date: April 2, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The Yindjibarndi were found to be native \ntitleholders of the land in 2017.\nOne of the traditional owners' claims for compensation, previously untested, is around social disharmony based on \nFortescue opting to throw its support behind a breakaway group, Wirlu-murra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation, \nwhich has separately struck deals with the miner.\nGriff Ranson SC, the silk for the state of Western Australia, played the court a recording of a conversation between \nDr Nelson with the leader of YAC, Michael Woodley, to suggest he was biased towards the YAC's interests.\n\"A fair-minded listener could reasonably conclude from listening to this audio recording that your evidence is not \nimpartial, but that you've become an advocate for the cause of the party that's retained you,\" he said.\nDr Nelson refuted the suggestions that he was biased and that his report was one-sided.\n\"The excerpts of the tape may have presented me in a particular way and I make no apology for interacting with him \non level that they are comfortable with,\" he told the court when re-examined by YAC's counsel Tina Jowett. \"I am \nnot an advocate for one person ...

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1465 words\nHighlight: Two former Fortescue executives want to reduce the enormous carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's \nmost lucrative export industry. It'll cost at least $3 billion.\nBody\nThe lofty ambitions of two former Fortescue executives, who want to build a $US2.1 billion ($3.2 billion) green iron \nore processing plant in the Pilbara within five years, will require a gigantic infusion of money.\nMichael Masterman and Bart Kolodziejczyk formed Element Zero at the end of 2022, which aims to reduce the \ncarbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry. It's a big step up from the $US10 million the \ngroup raised at the start of this year in seed funding, and there are plans to undertake another capital raising later in \nthe year, targeting $US50 million to $US100 million.\nIron is the key ingredient in steel production, which the world depends on for construction and manufacturing. \nHowever, production of iron and steel emits a combined 3.4 billion tonnes of carbon annually, or 7 per cent of global \nemissions, according to energy analysts Wood Mackenzie.\nIf the international agreement to limit global warming is to be achieved, emissions must reach net-zero by 2050. To \ndecarbonise the iron ore and steel industries, Wood Mackenzie has estimated it would require a mind-bending \n$US1.4 trillion in global investment - almost equivalent to Australia's total annual gross domestic product.\nThis makes the capital needs of Element Zero seem less of a tall order.\n\"There is so much interest in what we do both in Australia and globally, in particular in the US, that we believe that \nwe can make it,\" said Kolodziejczyk, Element Zero's co-founder and chief technology officer.\nElement Zero, which employs about two dozen staff, has developed and patented a technology to reduce iron ore \nto pure iron through an electrochemical process.\nAn alkaline solution and electric current are used to separate pure iron from silica, alumina and oxygen. Iron ore is \ndissolved into the solution and when electricity - from a renewable source - passes through it, the pure iron collects \non a cathode.\nThe group said it had also made progress on decarbonising silicon.\nElement Zero has pitched itself to investors as a platform company, its technology aimed at converting metal ores \nto metals, not only iron ore, with zero carbon emissions.\nPage 2 of 3\nThe iron men with a $3 billion plan to save the planet\nElement Zero is seeking West Australian government approval for its green iron processing plant on 25 hectares in \nthe Boodarie strategic industrial estate near Port Hedland. Kolodziejczyk said the group was also seeking a \nseparate site to build a wind and solar farm to power the plant.\nHe said the plant would be capable of processing 5 million tonnes of iron ore feed into 2.7 million tonnes of green \niron per year within five years, with plans to scale up to processing 50 million tonnes.\nElement Zero's pilot plant in Perth is still a long way from industrial scale. It is processing 100 kg of iron ore daily, \nbought from major iron ore producers.\nA process known as direct reduction uses natural gas, or methane, in a furnace to extract pure iron from iron ore. \nSome companies such as Fortescue have explored replacing methane with green hydrogen.\nKolodziejczyk, once Fortescue's chief scientist, led a push to develop green hydrogen to decarbonise the \ncompany's mining operations and shipping fleet.\nMasterman, Element Zero's chief executive, has had a long career in the energy industry, including in Europe and \nalso worked as Fortescue Future Industries' chief financial officer. He was chairman of renewable energy group \nSquadron Energy, part of the Tattarang group of companies, which are linked to Fortescue founder Andrew \nForrest.\n\"The entire industry has enormous commercial pressures, shareholder pressures and goodwill to find technology \nsolutions that can reduce the carbon emissions from converting iron ore into iron,\" said Masterman. \"We can \nsignificantly move the dial.\"\nAbout 560 million tonnes of iron ore are shipped through Port Hedland annually.\n\"If we can move to converting the vast, exceptional natural resources we have in Australia to metals, rather than \njust exporting the raw ore, that's going to have two impacts. It's going to help significantly reduce carbon emissions \nand ... substantially strengthen Australia.\"\nElement Zero faces strong competition from other companies that have or are developing technology to make \ngreen iron and steel, among them Fortescue Future Industries, which last year claimed it had built a pilot plant that \ncould turn iron ore into green iron using a membrane.\nElement Zero is exploring converting other metal ores to metals with zero carbon emissions, including lithium, nickel \nand silicon.\nKolodziejczyk acknowledges the challenges but remains confident, predicting that eventually some of the major iron \nore producers, among them BHP, Rio Tinto, Fortescue, Vale, and Roy Hill, could become investors in Element \nZero. \"We believe that some of those majors will come and invest in us.\"\nCompanies such as BHP and Vale have invested in clean tech groups such as Boston Metal, which is working on \ndecarbonising steelmaking. BHP also has a stake in Electra, a start-up focused on decarbonising iron making.\nIn January, H2 Green Steel, which has technology that it says will help to decarbonise European steel, raised \n(EURO)4.2 billion ($6.9 billion) in debt financing. The start-up was founded in 2020.\nKolodziejczyk said Element Zero was also holding discussions with potential customers in Japan and South Korea \nfor its green iron.\n\"Given how quickly we are moving with the technology scale-up, and also with the project in the Pilbara, we believe \nit's a good time to secure those initial agreements,\" he said. \"That's what we're going to do in the next couple of \nmonths. We believe the first offtake will come from Japan. Obviously having those agreements in place will help us \nwith the next fund raise.\"Page 3 of 3\nThe iron men with a $3 billion plan to save the planet\nMasterman said Element Zero was providing potential customers with samples of its green iron so they \"can test it \nto understand any adjustments they might need to make in their systems to be able to utilise it in their processing \nplants\".\nKolodziejczyk said Element Zero's next fundraising could be as much as $US100 million. Masterman declined to \nprovide a figure, saying instead the group was focused on proving its technology in stages to secure funding.\nElement Zero is also exploring potential grants from the United States through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). \nThe IRA has directed hundreds of billions of dollars to clean energy projects, including electric vehicles, to \naccelerate the country's transition to net-zero.\nThe IRA has fuelled a manufacturing boom in the US but that rapid growth in cleantech manufacturing has come at \na cost. It has driven a huge increase in electricity demand, as has the development of artificial intelligence and \ndigital currencies, which threaten to slow the path to net-zero, as renewable energy companies struggle to keep \npace.\nLast week, the Australian government announced a new industrial policy - the Future Made in Australia Act - that \nwas immediately dubbed a mini-version of the IRA, although details of the policy are yet to be released. It will target \nadvanced manufacturing and clean energy projects with government-funded incentives.\nThe push to decarbonise the iron ore sector comes amid pressure on exports. Vivek Dhar, director of the \nCommonwealth Bank's mining and energy commodities research team, has forecast that iron ore prices will \naverage between $US100-$110 a tonne for the remainder of the year, after hitting $US140 in January.\nHe said there were risks the price could fall below those forecasts if growth slowed in China, as a result of a slump \nin its property sector. China imports almost 75 per cent of the world's iron ore.\nElement Zero is exploring converting other metal ores to metals with zero carbon emissions, including lithium, nickel \nand silicon.\nKolodziejczyk said the group had made good progress with silicon. \"We are trying to refine the process. The team is \nworking towards that, and we believe that could be our second offering.\"\nSilicon is used in the manufacturing of solar cells and microchips. The US has also introduced the CHIPS and \nScience Act that aims to boost investment, manufacturing and research and development in semiconductors.\n\"If we're able to take literally sand and convert it into silicon metal, with very little carbon emissions, that makes a \nmajor difference to the supply source of silicon metal and the carbon emissions that come from producing it,\" said \nMasterman.\n\"Silicon is a very exciting one for us and one in which we might be able to move more quickly. We could accelerate \nparts of the silicon plant in parallel with the work we're doing in iron ore. There are some significant opportunities in \nthe United States we're considering.\"\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

We are committed to seeing this matter settled so \nthe Yindjibarndi people can receive the benefits they deserve,\" a Fortescue spokeswoman said.\n\"Fortescue has offered compensation to the Yindjibarndi people in the past, and we continue to be ready to settle \nthis by paying compensation.\"\nThe company refused to answer questions about why Dr Forrest opted to meet Mr Woodley in a public park, and \nwould not discuss whether it had put forward a settlement offer that varied from its standard compensation \nagreements with other traditional owner groups in the Pilbara.\nFortescue, valued at $79 billion, also declined to comment on whether its settlement offer diverged from its legal \narguments made in the Federal Court.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest's meetings in park with YAC over $1b claim\nFortescue has argued any compensation should be funded by the State of Western Australia because it granted \nthe mining tenements covering the traditional lands of the Yindjibarndi. The WA government maintains Fortescue \nshould pay.\nThe Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation is arguing it is entitled to compensation for economic losses estimated by \none expert witness at more than $500 million, and more because it alleges Fortescue destroyed more than 240 \nculturally significant sites - including rock shelters - for which it is also seeking around $500 million.\nIt is also arguing Fortescue divided the community by backing a breakaway group known as the Wirlu-Murra \nYindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation in a novel third element to its legal fight.\nThe scope of potential damages is $1 billion.\nFortescue was left exposed to the compensation claim in 2020 after the High Court denied the company special \nleave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings that in effect meant a large part of its Solomon iron ore mining hub was \nbuilt without permission of traditional owners.\nThe Federal Court had granted exclusive native title over 2700 square kilometres in the iron ore-rich Pilbara. This in \neffect recognises the Yindjibarndi as private owners of the highest legal standing with a spiritual connection that \nallows them to decide who mines the land.\nYindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation previously rejected Fortescue's offer of a $4 million annual payment over the \nanticipated life of the Solomon project, worth around $120 million.\nFortescue pays capped compensation as part of seven native title agreements with other traditional owner groups.\nIn court yesterday, lawyers for WA questioned mining economist Murray Meaton about his assertion that exclusive \npossession under native title entitled the claimant to a 1 per cent annual royalty on iron ore mined at Solomon, \nwhich would be double the royalty paid to some traditional owners with non-exclusive possession.\nMr Meaton estimated last year that the economic loss suffered by YAC from not having an agreement with \nFortescue was $502 million. The court has asked him to update his figures based on the latest Fortescue \nproduction forecasts. A ruling in the case is expected next year, with the parties not due to deliver closing \narguments until around October.\nLoad-Date: April 19, 2024\nEnd of Document",

You have a similar cost structure and a higher-grade product, \nwhich generally fares through the cycle - even if you sometimes get supercharged earnings from Fortescue, like \nwe've seen in the last 12 months.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nBig investors steer clear of Fortescue, and miss major rally Commodities\nEven so, many fund managers missed out on an almost 50 per cent surge in the share price between September \nand February, after earnings were boosted by higher iron ore prices and lower than expected discounts on its \nexports. That compares to a mere 5 per cent rise for BHP and 16 per cent for Rio Tinto over the same period.\nBrokers have also been bearish for some time. Most analysts have slapped a sell or equivalent rating on the stock \nsince November 2022. In contrast, BHP and Rio Tinto have never held a majority sell rating from brokers since at \nleast 2009.\nMorningstar mining equity analyst Jon Mills said the stock had become too expensive compared to its peers.\n\"Fortescue has been really benefiting recently from a higher iron ore price and lower discounts on it products,\" he \nsaid. \"If you go back a few years, it was the exact opposite. It's in a great situation now, but is iron ore going to stay \nwhere it is? We don't think so.\n\"It's not generally liked by the wider market, but retail investors love it because it's made them a fortune over the \nyears.\"\nThe company lost its final buy rating in January after JPMorgan's head of Australian resources, Lyndon Fagan, told \ninvestors to take profits. The call proved well-timed: shares in the company fell more than 10 per cent since peaking \nin early February.\nAustralian Eagle Asset Management chief investment officer Sean Sequeira said investors had remained sceptical \nof Fortescue's prospects since its earliest days.\n\"When Andrew first put Fortescue together, it all seemed quite haphazard,\" Mr Sequeira said. \"It was the \nentrepreneurial spirit that drove the company, not standard management.\"\nMr Sequeira's fund was among the few to back the stock in 2016, when looming debt repayments and a poor iron \nore market raised fears that Fortescue was close to broke.\n\"It was an extremely contrarian investment at the time. Everyone said it was going under,\" he said, adding that the \nfund had wound down its interest in Fortescue since that time in favour of gaining exposure to copper through BHP \nand Rio.\nShares in the miner have recovered strongly since its nadir in 2016, rising 1500 per cent. BHP and Rio have risen \n150 per cent and 200 per cent respectively since then.\nMr Sequeira said Dr Forrest's unconventional approach to management had often left the investment community \nbaffled.\n\"Andrew is the type of person who goes into areas and tries to execute new methods of doing things,\" he said.\n\"That does result in the market finding it very difficult to see how these things will be pulled off because they haven't \nseen them done before.\"\nLoad-Date: April 19, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 19\nLength: 500 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue says the proposed design of the Biden administration's green incentives scheme could triple the cost of \nlow-carbon hydrogen projects and stifle growth in the sector.\nThe iron ore group has an ambitious strategy to become a major force in hydrogen and renewable energy, and has \npreviously outlined plans to build a $US550 million ($857 million) green hydrogen project in Arizona.\nIts criticisms of the draft eligibility rules come ahead of Fortescue's quarterly update on Wednesday, when it is \nexpected to outline whether they will force changes to the Arizona plant.\nHydrogen can be made with zero carbon emissions if renewable electricity is passed through water by a machine \ncalled an electrolyser.\nFortescue was hoping to use tax credits delivered as part of the $US369 billion Inflation Reduction Act, which is \nexpected would almost halve the cost of some projects in the United States.\nBut Fortescue's enthusiasm has waned since the US Treasury issued draft regulations known as \"45V\" which \nprovide the detail on eligibility for the tax credits. Fortescue's biggest problem is the requirement that companies \nmatch each hour of production to an hour of renewable power generation and consumption to be eligible.\nThe rule is designed to ensure that subsidies are not given to hydrogen made from fossil fuels when solar and wind \npower are not available.\nThe \"hourly matching\" rule will force hydrogen producers to either cease production when renewables are not \navailable - undermining productivity and viability - or sign up for excess renewable power from diverse sources to \nimprove the chances of having clean energy available at all times.\nFortescue has urged the government to instead consider \"annual matching\" - a system that would allow a producer \nto rely on non-renewable power at times, so long as it sourced extra renewable power at other times and ultimately \nconsumed as much power as it generated over the course of a year.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue slams Biden hydrogen incentive rules\nIn submissions to Treasury, Fortescue has warned that \"hourly matching\" would increase the cost of an 80-\nmegawatt green hydrogen facility by \"between 140 and 200 per cent\". The comment appears to be a reference to \nFortescue's Arizona project, which will be an 80-megawatt plant that makes green hydrogen for refuelling trucks.\nAsked by The Australian Financial Review whether the unfavourable draft rules would force Fortescue to alter the \nscope of the approved Arizona project, a spokesman signalled there were unlikely to be changes until the eligibility \nrules were finalised.\n\"When 45V guidelines are finalised, we will assess how they impact our US operations and make the decisions \nnecessary to ensure our green energy projects are economic and profitable,\" he said. \"Fortescue believes with or \nwithout government incentives there will be a place for green hydrogen and green ammonia projects in the US.\"\nThe questions about eligibility are an example of how the details of the IRA are still being thrashed out, almost two \nyears after legislation passed Congress.\nLoad-Date: April 24, 2024\nEnd of Document",

It marks the first time Minderoo has been Australia's biggest-spending foundation since the Philanthropy 50, \ncompiled by JB Were's John McLeod, was first published in 2017.\nMinderoo chief executive John Hartman said yesterday that it was humbling to reflect on how far the foundation had \ncome since it was founded by the Forrests as the Australian Children's Trust in 2001.\nThe Forrests signed up to Bill Gates' and Warren Buffett's The Giving Pledge in 2013, making a commitment to give \naway most of their wealth in their lifetimes. The first big step came in June when they handed over 220 million \nshares in Fortescue to the not-for-profit charity they founded and control. The shares represented about a fifth of \ntheir total shareholding in the Andrew Forrest-led Fortescue and were worth about $5 billion at the time, making \nMinderoo one of the world's largest philanthropic organisations.\nMinderoo shed about 100 jobs last week - roughly a third of its workforce - in a major reset that Mr Hartman said \nwas aimed at ensuring more of the money provided by the Forrests reached intended beneficiaries.\nHe has signalled Minderoo's annual expenditure could more than double in the next few years, with more money \ndirected into collaborations and partnerships as part of a focus on environmental protection and inequality.\n\"Minderoo's capacity to affect meaningful change dramatically increased when the Forrests became the first \nAustralians to sign The Giving Pledge, and generously donated an historic $5 billion to the foundation (last June),\" \nMr Hartman said. \"Such a generous flow of philanthropic capital alone does not guarantee results nor impact. We \nPage 2 of 2\nMinderoo charity heads for $40b as Forrests stump up Fortescue shares\nhave made a tangible difference in the lives of countless Australians and people around the world in the past 23 \nyears (and) we must continue to rigorously hold ourselves to account.\"\nIn making the giving pledge, the Forrests said: \"As a family we agreed many years ago to give away the majority of \nour wealth. We felt that if our children (Grace, Sophia and Sydney) were to inherit considerable wealth, it would only \nget in the way of them striving for and achieving their best, and truly making a positive difference in other people's \nlives.\"\nLast year's share donation took Minderoo's endowment to about $7.6 billion. The total endowment now stands at \nabout $10 billion based on increases in the Fortescue share price, dividends and other investments.\nMinderoo has in recent times focused its efforts on helping vulnerable communities, gender and equality, and \nprotecting oceans. Last year, the biggest-ever grant - $US100 million over nine years - went to a gender fund run by \nUS-registered public charity, Co-Impact, for work aimed at achieving a fairer world for women and girls.\nMr Hartman said Minderoo was going through a transformation as it tried to expose problems to the world and \nprovide solutions. \"It is part of our DNA to hold those responsible to account and use our platform to enable agency \nfor disempowered voices.\"\nThe Financial Review Philanthropy 50 appears in the May issue of AFR Magazine, inside Friday's newspaper.\nLoad-Date: April 26, 2024\nEnd of Document",

It now has three electric excavators operating and says converting its entire excavator fleet to electric will \ncut diesel use by 95 million litres every year.\nThe miner's iron ore shipments slowed over three months to March, down six per cent to 43.3 million tonnes due to \na derailment late in December and weather disruptions in January and February, Fortescue Metals chief Dino \nOtranto said in a quarterly update on Wednesday.\nHowever, he said shipments hit a record level in March as the company focused on recovering its output. Guidance \nfor total financial-year shipments remains unchanged, but will be at the lower end of the expected 192 to 197 million \ntonne range.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue takes 'milestone step towards green shipping' amid iron ore hit\nThe company's crucial high-quality Iron Bridge project is facing significant problems with a faulty water pipeline and \nplant teething issues slowing its output. Work is under way to replace a high-pressure section of the pipeline and \nimprove its performance. The mine's process plan was reconfigured to deal with the water supply issues. \"We've \ngot a process under way, I won't get into too many details of it,\" Otranto said.\nHe said China's steel demand was becoming increasingly diversified, with strong growth across infrastructure, \nmanufacturing and renewable energy sectors. \"China's rollout of wind and solar capacity blew my mind,\" Otranto \nsaid after a recent visit to the Asian powerhouse. \"Renewable energy infrastructure needs a lot of steel.\"\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

The slip in exports also pushed up \naverage C1 cash costs by 7 per cent, to $US18.93 a tonne.\nAnd, while Fortescue said it still expected to meet its annual export guidance, the company said it would probably \ncome in -towards the bottom of its 192-197 million-tonne range.\nBut the company will need a heroic performance to meet even that expectation, needing to export 53.5 million \ntonnes in the June quarter, given it has only shipped 138.5 million tonnes in the first half of the financial year.\nFortescue Metals CEO Dino Otranto said Fortescue was confident it could hit that rate, despite needing to ship at \nnear record rates of about 18 million tonnes a month for the June quarter, after shipping 18.7 million tonnes in \nMarch.\n\"You can hold a lot of confidence in the performance that we've had over the last six weeks - March was an all-time \nrecord. So we're looking pretty good for the remainder of this quarter,\" Mr Otranto said.\nFortescue again downgraded expectations from its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project, saying it now only \nexpected to ship 2 million tonnes of high-grade concentrate from the massive mine and processing operations, \ndown from previous - and already substantially revised - guidance of 2-4 million tonnes.\nThe company shipped only 500,000 tonnes of concentrate from Iron Bridge in the March quarter as it struggles with \nwater supply to the operation. Fortescue is spending about $US100m ($140m) to fix flaws in the water pipeline, \nwhich is leaking in high-pressure sections.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue confident on export guidance\nThe Iron Bridge processing plant is water-hungry as it grinds hard magnetite ore into a fine paste, before separating \niron from waste rock using revolving magnetic drums. When running at its full rate, Iron Bridge will need 20 \ngigalitres of water a year to support its full production rate of 22 million tonnes of concentrate.\nMr Otranto blamed the pipeline issue on quality control issues with a 65km section of the pipeline that now leaks \nunder pressure.\nHe said Fortescue had elected to replace the pipeline section, but declined to comment on whether Fortescue \nwould be able to make an insurance claim for the replacement work or business interruption, or the status of any \nlegal claims against the manufacturer.\nMr Otranto said Fortescue expected to be able to replace the pipeline this year, and said he was confident the \ncompany would still be able to ramp Iron Bridge up to its nameplate capacity by September next year, as previously \nforecast.\n\"All our focus is on getting the water supply back. And our September quarter 2025 guidance that we gave before is \nstill unchanged,\" he said.\n\"However, it does depend on getting that water solution in play. \"The good news is that we've been able to identify \nsome other source of water - we're using our tailings facility to store some of the downpour that we have seen.\" \nFortescue also cut its capital spending guidance by $US300m-$US500m for the current financial year for its metals \ngroup, to $US2.5bn-$US2.7bn, and cut capital spending forecasts for its energy division by $US100m to $US700m. \nFortescue shares closed up 16c at $24.76 on Wednesday.\nLoad-Date: April 24, 2024\nEnd of Document",

How would Australia compete against the US, Canada, \nChina and other countries that are aspiring to be global leaders in green manufacturing? \"By getting on with it,\" \nreplied the Prime Minister. Some 20 months later, the question remains unanswered: Getting on with what?\nThe two examples of promising green businesses the PM cited on that day have hardly stood the test of time. Sun \nCable, Mike Cannon-Brookes's proposal to build the world's largest solar farm and link it by an undersea cable to \nSingapore, seems less likely to come to fruition than Clive Palmer's plan to rebuild the Titanic. As for Tritium, the \nAustralian company that promised to build the world's fastest electric vehicle chargers in southeast Queensland, the \nless said the better. Tritium's future won't be built in Australia. It will be built in Tennessee, where the company has \nreceived generous assistance from President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, securing a sweetheart deal to \nbuild a giant manufacturing plant.\nThe $15bn National Reconstruction Fund Albanese promised would kickstart the industries of the future has been in \nplace for well over a year but has yet to issue a single grant.\nThe PM plans to break the impasse with the National Reconstruction Fund 2.0, optimistically named the Future \nMade in Australia Act. Underpinning the government's green superpower ambition is a breathtaking complacency \nthat assumes Australia's natural advantages in the fossil fuel-based economy can be seamlessly swapped out for \nascendancy in the brave new carbon-free world. They cannot be. Our primacy in resources was based on merely \nhaving stuff. Green manufacturing is about making stuff, which is a different game altogether.\nThe Albanese government has placed a speculative bet on green hydrogen as the key to our export success. It \nmakes the fatuous claim that Australia has an abundance of sunshine that can be turned into cheap renewable \nenergy.\nPage 2 of 3\nPM's subsidy crusade stirs ghosts of Labor's past\nIn October 2022, Energy Minister Chris Bowen announced a $13.7m grant to Andrew Forrest's company, \nFortescue Future Industries, to scope the construction of a 500MW electrolyser at Gibson Island near Brisbane. \nBowen described the project's success as \"critical\" to Australia'a ambition to be a green energy superpower.\nLast month, Fortescue boss Mark Hutchinson reinforced the project's importance, describing it as \"a litmus test for \nthe rest of the hydrogen industry in Australia\". Yet when Fortescue announced financial approval for a string of \ngreen hydrogen projects at the end of last year, Gibson Island was not one of them. \"We've been working very, very \nhard on it,\" Hutchinson told The Australian Financial Review Business Summit last month. \"But it's tough based on \nthe current power prices when we're looking at competing globally.\" To judge from Fortescue's investment portfolio \nright now, the future may be built in Norway, northern Patagonia, Brazil and British Columbia before it is built in \nAustralia. It may even be built in Kenya and Congo. The future is already being built in Buckeye, Arizona, where \nFortescue is investing $US500m ($765m) in a green hydrogen plant it says will be up and running by 2026.\nIt turns out abundant sun was not such a competitive advantage in the manufacture of green hydrogen. Low taxes, \nfiscally responsible government and cheap and reliable carbon-free energy are far more appealing drawcards for \ninvestors.\nIn 2023, manufacturing in Arizona grew faster than in any other state. It includes energy and water-intensive \nindustries such as silicon chip manufacturing, with Arizona coming from nowhere to fourth place among US states. \nApologists for the Albanese government might look for excuses in the global subsidy arms race unleashed by the \nBiden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. They might claim Arizona has easy access to a much bigger market.\nYet Arizona's hi-tech manufacturing boom started before Biden came to power and came at the expense of \nneighbouring California, where manufacturing is declining.\nIt isn't hard to work out why. Arizona's top state income tax rate is 2.98 per cent. California's is 13.3 per cent. \nCorporate tax in Arizona is 6.96 per cent compared to 8.84 per cent in California. For energy-hungry industries such \nas hydrogen and the IT sector, however, the biggest attraction is the industrial electricity price: 7.47 cents a kWh in \nArizona compared to 18 cents in California.\nAlbanese continues to talk a big game, promising jobs, industry and prosperity will flourish under the Future Made \nin Australia Act. Details are scarce, but the PM told ABC's 7.30 this month there would be new government \nprograms attached to the Act, as well as a recalibration of old ones.\nYet the long history of manufacturing decline in the past 50 years is a story of broken promises and failed industry \nwelfare programs. The Hawke government's generosity in granting $36m to the Kodak film factory in Victoria in \n1988 (roughly $100m in today's money) failed to stop the introduction of digital cameras or development of the \nsmartphone. Hundreds of millions of dollars thrown at the car industry failed to save the Holden Commodore. \nIndeed, evidence that industry assistance programs work as intended is difficult to find.\nIt's more than three decades since Bob Hawke's Labor government eschewed industry protectionism as a means to \nmake Australia globally competitive. Yet governments, state and federal, of both political persuasions, have found it \ndifficult to go cold turkey. The federal government's guide to grants lists 330 different types of industry assistance. \nIn 2019, the last year before Covid-19, the Productivity Commission calculated total government assistance to \nbusinesses at $13.9bn in tariff assistance, tax concessions and direct grants.\nThat is why we can say with some certainty that more government grants are no substitute for the economic \ndiscipline practised by the Republican administrations of governors Jan Brewer and Doug Ducey or the far-sighted \ndecision of the Arizona government in the 1980s in overseeing the construction of the second-largest nuclear \nreactor in the US. The 3.9GW Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station remains the backbone of the Arizona \nelectricity grid, producing some of the cheapest power in the country.\nAlbanese is hardly the first prime minister to enter office who has failed to learn from King Canute, instead suffering \nfrom the delusion that getting your hand on the levers of state gives you the power to alter the tides. The outgoing \ntide of deindustrialisation shows no sign of abating.

However, \n45V, in its current form, is a straitjacket on the industry and works against the Biden administration's own climate \ngoals,\" he said. Dr Forrest said the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act was helping the US make serious \nstrides towards decarbonising its economy, but said the proposed rules were \"fine print shoved into the IRA \nlegislation to do everything it can to kill off what is the saviour in energy for humanity and every organic life on \nEarth\".\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest slams US hydrogen regime\n\"You deserve much better than faceless people wandering around with chequebooks full of lobbying money, putting \nin a landmine into the law which is getting green hydrogen off the ground,\" he said.\n\"That landmine is put in by fossil fuel lobbyists - they masquerade as environmentalists and I can tell you they're \nnot, I can tell you that they're paid for by the fossil fuel sector.\" Fortescue ticked off on the development of the \nArizona hydrogen project late last year. The company plans to spend $US550m ($837m) building a plant capable of \nproducing 11,000 tonnes of liquid hydrogen a year for sale to the heavy transport -industry.\nScheduled to begin production in 2026, Fortescue has said the plant will be supplied by utility Arizona Public \nService with \"new sources of wind and solar generation under its regulated extra high load factor tariff, together with \ngreen attributes under its Green Power Partners program\".\nThe Arizona grid was still dominated by fossil fuel generation in 2022, however, according to the US Energy \nInformation Administration.\nAbout 42 per cent of the state's net energy generation came from natural gas plants, with 12 per cent from coal-\nfired power stations. Another 29 per cent came from nuclear generation, and 16 per cent coming from solar, wind \nand hydro-electric sources.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 11\nLength: 630 words\nByline: Aaron Patrick\nBody\nIn February 2023, businessman Andrew Forrest decided to shame his home state newspaper, The West Australian, \nfor engaging in what he said was commercial retaliation over a missed contract.\nThe move didn't work.\nSince Dr Forrest recorded a video that criticised reporting in The West, the Kerry Stokes-controlled paper has \npublished 78 articles about him or his company, Fortescue Metals Group, according to the paper's website. Sixty-\nfive had a negative slant.\nThey included coverage of job cuts and executive departures (\"The list of those walking away from Forrest keeps \ngrowing\"), business problems (\"Andrew Forrest the new victim of nickel price agony\"), and Dr Forrest's separation \nfrom his wife, Nicola Forrest (\"Shock twist in Andrew Forrest's marriage breakdown\").\nOne of the few articles about Dr Forrest available free on the paper's website reports a denial, which Dr Forrest \nmade to another paper, that he fathered three illegitimate children. Another wrote that Dr Forrest had described \nhimself as his staff's \"humble servant\" - and was published with a photo of him wearing a cravat.\nThe latest, two weeks ago, suggested Fortescue's dividends might be cut. Fortescue shares have risen 80 per \ncent since October 2022, when the paper's reporting seemed to turn negative.\nThe coverage raises a question: is Mr Stokes' power in Western Australia so great that it cannot be challenged, \neven by a billionaire five times as rich?\nMr Stokes, who denies giving his newspaper instructions, was Australia's 12th-richest person last year, according to \nthe Financial Review Rich List. Dr Forrest was second.\n\"Editorial decisions have nothing to do with Kerry Stokes,\" a spokesman for the billionaire said. \"To put that \nproposition to him would be totally misguided.\"\nA spokeswoman for Dr Forrest, who was in Washington yesterday, said he would not comment.\nPage 2 of 2\nAfter losing a deal, Stokes' newspaper pursued Forrest Business dispute\nDr Forrest has asserted that the coverage was triggered by Fortescue's decision to buy a hydrogen-powered fleet \nof trucks from a Swiss-German manufacturer instead of WesTrac, a construction equipment business owned by \nSeven Group Holdings, which is controlled by Mr Stokes. Dr Forrest had received mostly positive coverage in the \npaper, which lasted until a few months after Fortescue struck the truck deal in June 2022, after negotiations with \nWesTrac stalled over the vehicles' fuel systems.\n\"I made it really clear if they don't change that stance, I don't bluff,\" he said in February last year when asked about \nthe contract.\nSome of the critical stories appeared on the front page, hurting Dr Forrest's reputation and likely damaging morale \nat Fortescue.\nThe West Australian does not have a state-based competitor, and Mr Stokes controls the Seven television network, \nwhich broadcasts the most popular news bulletin in Perth. Facing off against a local media monopolist, Dr Forrest \ndecided to record the video for his staff to present his side of the story.\n\"Everyone loves positive disruption and improvement in technology and in society, except perhaps when it happens \nto them,\" he said. \"This, I believe, is the case and what has inspired the biased, inaccurate reporting of The West.\"\nMr Stokes, 83, comes from an era when media proprietors freely used their outlets to help their business interests. \nHe feels that he is unfairly criticised by bigger media companies based on the east coast, according to a person \nwho knows him.\nSeven West Media, which owns The West Australian, is worth $310 million. Nine Entertainment Co, which owns \nThe Australian Financial Review, is worth $2.5 billion.\nLast month, Seven West Media said it had decided to terminate a contract to print the Financial Review in Perth. \nThe print edition of the paper won't be available in the city from May 22, further strengthening the power of Mr \nStokes' paper.\nLoad-Date: May 12, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 18\nLength: 620 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nFortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest and oil and gas producer Woodside Energy have emerged as \nunlikely allies in the fight over legislative changes they say are threatening hydrogen projects in the United States.\nThe two biggest Perth-based companies on the ASX have found common ground in lobbying against plans by US \nTreasury officials to restrict the availability of tax credits for hydrogen developments through the Biden \nadministration's Inflation Reduction Act. Both companies had counted on access to those incentives to underpin \ntheir US hydrogen ventures.\nDr Forrest has warned the provisions, known as 45V, threaten to \"kill off\" Fortescue's $US550 million ($836 million) \nhydrogen project in Arizona. Woodside has similar concerns about its H2OK project in Oklahoma, a key plank in the \ncompany's decarbonisation strategy.\nIn a submission to officials in the US, Woodside has warned that instead of incentivising hydrogen production, 45V \nwould add costly requirements that are \"virtually impossible to meet\". Woodside has committed more than $100 \nmillion in procuring equipment for H2OK.\nOf particular concern for Woodside and Fortescue is a requirement that requires companies accessing tax credits \nto match each hour of production to an hour of renewable power consumption. The rule is designed to ensure \nsubsidies are not given to hydrogen made from fossil fuel power during times when solar and wind power are \nunavailable.\nWoodside's H2OK plan involves using electricity from Oklahoma's power grid to run electrolysers to produce liquid \nhydrogen. It would source renewable energy certificates to offset the emissions from the non-renewable power \nincluded in that supply.\nFortescue also plans to use renewable energy certificates in Arizona.\nWoodside wants the US to instead offer annual - rather than hourly - matching. Hourly matching raises the spectre \nof having to shut down plants when wind and solar power is unavailable to maintain tax credit status.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue, Woodside allies on green hydrogen\nIn a submission to the government, Woodside said: \"Switching to hourly matching would require the procurement of \nthe type of electrolyser that can ramp up and down in response to intermittent renewable electricity. These issues \nwill increase costs, resulting in an increased levelised cost hydrogen in an already challenging macroeconomic \nenvironment.\"\nWoodside is pushing for annual matching to apply to hydrogen projects that start construction before the end of \n2027 and 10-year grandfathering of annual matching for first-movers.\nIn a similar submission, Fortescue is pushing for annual matching to apply for projects that start production before \nthe end of 2028 and 10-year grandfathering. Fortescue says it is \"difficult to have confidence\" in the feasibility of its \nproject without changes to the 45V proposal.\nSpeaking this month in Buckeye, Arizona, where Fortescue plans to build its hydrogen project, Dr Forrest claimed \nthat lobbyists for big oil and gas producers were behind the draft provisions in 45V.\nHe has previously criticised Woodside, Australia's biggest oil and gas producer, and its chief executive Meg O'Neill, \ndescribing her as \"hard-edge trained by the biggest liar we've ever seen around climate change over the last 40 \nyears, and that's ExxonMobil\".\n\"Can we please look at the fact that Meg is driving an agenda to get carbon bombs going as quickly as possible,\" \nhe said in an incendiary interview last year. He separately told the ABC that fossil fuel executives should have their \nheads \"put on spikes\", and said Ms O'Neill was \"peddling poison\".\nWoodside accused Dr Forrest of using \"violent imagery\" and resorting to \"personal vitriol\". \"Such language sets a \nterrible example for public debate and should be condemned,\" it said.\nLoad-Date: May 16, 2024\nEnd of Document",

But he warned to beware of white-anting of \nthe production credit rules by fossil fuel companies.\n\"It will also lower the cost of energy for every single Australian by making green hydrogen competitive with fossil \nfuels, spurring massive renewable energy projects in sparsely populated regions where employment is needed \nmost,\" Mr Forrest said.\nThe iron ore billionaire, whose company has taken investment decisions on $1.15 billion of green hydrogen and \nammonia projects in Queensland, Western Australia and Arizona, said fossil fuel companies were preparing to \nundermine the production credits program to foil the development of a low-cost competitor.\n\"The government has sent a clear message - business-as-usual for the fossil fuel monopoly driving up the cost of \nliving and trashing our environment is over.\nPage 2 of 2\nHydrogen credit could blow its $6.7b allocation Development\n\"Of course, the fossil fuel sector which, relative to the rest of us in heavy industry, is not a big employer, yet are \nexpert at shifting income around so they don't pay fair taxes in Australia, will use profits to try to complicate this \nlegislation to make it unworkable.\n\"The government should be fully prepared for this lobbying effort, one which will attempt to stop a cheaper \ncompetitor for fossil fuels being made right here in Australia, taxed right here in Australia, and enjoyed by Australian \nmums and dads and jobseekers.\"\nFortescue's projects include a $US550 million ($828 million) Phoenix Hydrogen Hub where it plans to build an 80 \nmegawatt electrolyser and liquefaction plant producing up to 11,000 tonnes a year of liquid green hydrogen, a \n$US150 million ($226 million), 50 MW green hydrogen project at Gladstone in Queensland, and a $US50 million \n($75 million) green iron trial plant at Christmas Creek iron ore mine in WA.\nWoodside and Fortescue are among multinationals chasing green hydrogen projects in Australia.\nGlobal oil and gas giant BP is the operator of the proposed 26 gigawatt Asian Renewable Energy Hub in the Pilbara \nregion of WA, and Queensland's Stanwell Corp is backing a large hydrogen project.\nLoad-Date: May 18, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The \"green hydrogen production credit will be \nbeneficial for project economics no doubt, but our current cost estimates are $US8.30 per kilogram for green \nhydrogen in Australia, and falling comparatively slowly to 2030,\" Mr Griffin said. \"So $2/kg won't immediately move \nthe needle when we expect prices of maximum $3 to allow green hydrogen to compete into steel for example.\"\nLoad-Date: May 16, 2024\nEnd of Document",

As a Forrest spox told us, the Rabat visit involves meetings with Fortescue's joint-venture partner OCP \n(Benali being one of its directors along with half the Moroccan cabinet, although Chairman Twiggy only deals with \nChairman Mostafa Terrab, we're informed), plus an event at the Australian embassy, a -speaking gig at the Africa -\nBusiness School and meetings with \"key ministers and local ambassadors\".\nLocal media was reporting on Tuesday that Forrest - \"surnomme par la presse australienne 'Twiggy' \" - had been \ndue to meet Moroccan Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch (apparently false, not happening, never was) and Industry \nMinister (and OCP director) Ryad Mezzour.\nNo pre-arranged business commitments with Benali either - who was doorstopped by a press pack and didn't want \nto comment on all the fuss - but nothing to stop the Twig from finding a corner table at Rick's Cafe in Casablanca. \nIt's only an hour's drive from the capital. Bah, even if she doesn't turn up - they'll always have Paris.\nIsraeli interlude Meanwhile, we note Twiggy's Bombardier Global Express 7500 had been in Tel Aviv just prior to \ndeparting for Morocco. We asked what Forrest was doing in Israel but his people would only say it was personal, \nrather than Fortescue-related. No doubt he met with a few Knesset members. The visit didn't sound so much like a \nsolidarity visit post-October 7 and more like an opportunity to cut a few deals. On what? TBC, we hear. Stay tuned.\nKing's share play A panicked Phil King appears to have tried to play the market over his holding in luxury goods \nmerchant Cettire, led by reclusive rich-lister Dean Mintz. Cettire has been the subject of ongoing prodding by this \nmasthead and we hear King was on the phone to News Corp journalists last Monday sniffing about for details of an \nimpending scoop - one that he knew would be hardly flattering to the business. On that basis, King's Regal Funds \nPage 2 of 2\nBusy Forrest on the job in Morocco\nManagement tried to beat the news (and the serious risk of a price drop, which ended up happening), selling 25,300 \nshares in Cettire for about $635,000 the very next day, well before any article had been printed.\nWe can't explain why he then bought back roughly one-third of those shares hours later. Did he suddenly think \nbetter of acting on the whiff of a rumour? In any case, once Joyce Moullakis and John Stensholt's yarn was \npublished exactly one week later King immediately scrambled to buy more Cettire, purchasing nearly $1.1m worth \nof stock - and not all of it at a discount. We put questions to King about this mischief but didn't receive a reply.\nCars in reverse Wretched news for investors in Peter Warren Automotive on Tuesday, the company announcing a \n20 per cent profit downgrade, with projections coming in somewhere between $52m and $57m.\nThat set off a share price crash to a low of $1.84, a cliff drop from the $2.21 and $2.40 that directors Niran Peiris \nand Paul Warren have been paying, respectively, to buy up shares in recent months. Peiris acquired 90,000 shares \nfrom March to mid-April; Warren, eldest son of company founder Peter Warren, bought 122,000-odd shares at the \nend of February.\nThe timing of these purchases could reflect some crappy judgment. Peiris and Warren would be well across the \ndeclining customer demand for vehicles, the higher costs of holding them, the discounting, the thin margin on sales. \nThere's also the big, billowing red flag of CEO Mark Weaver announcing his exit from the company in March, a \nsignal of doom and decay for any company right before the release of their results. Peiris didn't care, it seems, and \nbought more than $100,000 a week later, followed by another tranche a fortnight afterwards for a total of $200,000.\nNot that either of them are alone in making oddly miscalculated stock purchases in this sector. Two years ago the \nSutton family paid a premium for Quadrant Capital's remaining post-IPO stake in Peter Warren, a $50m deal that \npriced the shares at roughly $3.18, well above the market price of $2.99 at the time, and far higher than the $1.87 at \nwhich the shares closed on Tuesday.\nWe asked Peiris and Warren for some reasoning behind their purchases, to which CFO Victor Cuthell replied, \ntelling us both directors are \"strong supporters of the Peter Warren strategy, its long-term outlook and its prospects \nin general,\" and adding that they still hold those views post-trading update and even consider the investments \"well-\nmade\". Surely all said through gritted teeth. An alternative take is they've been sleep-walking through board \nmeetings - or maybe auto execs are generally in denial about the turmoil of their industry?\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Peter Warren executives mis-time their share buys\nLoad-Date: May 28, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Its initial plans for a green ammonia production centre were centred around the \nsmall fishing town of Tarfaya in southwest Morocco - once best known for the treacherous waters off its coast, a \n19th-century British fortress now crumbling into the sea, and for being the closest mainland town to the surfing \nresorts of the Canary Islands, about 80km to the west.\nOCP planned to build a -3.8 gigawatt wind and solar farm in the region, with an eventual production capacity of one \nmillion tonnes of green ammonia a year from 2027 and three million tonnes from 2032.\nBut, in addition to its isolation, Tarfaya is also disputed territory. It is only 35km north of the disputed regional border \nof the Western Sahara - a Spanish colony until 1975, but since occupied by Morocco.\nMoroccan control of the -region is disputed by the traditional Sahrawi people. Their separatist movement has this \nyear launched attacks on Moroccan troops in the region - which already hosts large wind farms built by companies \nowned by the country's royal family.\nIt is unclear whether Fortescue's joint venture with OCP will focus on the Moroccan company's original plans, and \nthe Australian mining and energy giant has not elaborated further on their work in the region.\n\"The Fortescue team is working with key stakeholders as we continue to develop our ambitious strategy with OCP, \ndeveloped over more than two years, to develop green energy, hydrogen and ammonia in Morocco,\" a spokesman \nsaid on Tuesday.\nFortescue's African plans have already suffered one major setback this month, after it was - replaced as the \npreferred developer of the giant Grand Inga hydro-electric project in the Democratic Republic of Congo by Nigerian \noil company Natural Oilfield Services.\nThe Grand Inga, estimated to come with a total cost of more than $US80bn ($120bn), was a favoured project of Dr \nForrest, and Fortescue's involvement was announced with fanfare in mid-2021, during the first flush of \nannouncements around the company's plans to become a green energy giant by the end of the decade.\nMARGIN CALL P13\nLoad-Date: May 28, 2024\nEnd of Document",

In fact, the terms of the separation make Nicola wealthier than her husband, given she now \nowns 50 million more shares than Andrew does in Fortescue, the iron ore miner he founded in 2003. But such \nintricacies are a moot point - the pair remain in furious agreement on their commitment to the Giving Pledge, set up \nby American billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, under which they have agreed to give away the \"vast \nmajority\" of their wealth.\nIt was to this end that last June the couple transferred one-fi fth of their Fortescue holding worth $5b to their \ncharitable Minderoo Foundation, knocking their combined wealth at the time down to $28b. Their fortune has since \nrebounded on a climbing share price for Fortescue, which ships about 180 million tonnes of hematite iron ore per \nyear from its Chichester, Solomon and Western mines in the Pilbara. Fortescue's fi rst mine for higher-grade \nmagnetite iron ore, the Iron Bridge operation 145km south of Port Hedland, had a slower-than-expected start but \nthe company remains confi dent it will eventually ship 22 million tonnes a year.\nFortescue also shipped its fi rst iron ore mined outside Australia, from the Belinga mine in Gabon, which Andrew \nhopes will eventually become globally signifi cant. However, Andrew is more likely to be heard discussing green \nenergy than iron ore these days. His dreams of making Fortescue a clean energy superpower are starting to take \nmaterial shape - this year Fortescue conducted the world's fi rst use of ammonia as a marine fuel onboard the \nSingapore-fl agged ammoniapowered vessel Fortescue Green Pioneer. Nicola is driving investment in Australian \nfashion with her half of the Forrest family's Tattarang investment vehicle. In April, she unveiled an $8m women's-\nboot-only production line at the Adelaide factory of R.M. Williams, the iconic footwear brand Tattarang bought in \n2020.

The iron ore miner, led by executive chairman Andrew Forrest, has \nalleged they copied and took information when they left Fortescue that helped them build Element Zero's own \ngreen iron project.\n\"It is alleged that this has been utilised in the designing, engineering and construction and operation by the first \nrespondent of an industrial pilot plant for an electrochemical reduction process,\" said Federal Court judge John \nLogan in a summary of the claim.\nElement Zero has asked the court to set aside the search request, which Justice Logan said could become an \n\"industrial-scale forensic debacle\".\nDuring their time in Fortescue's clean energy division, Mr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk were among the small \ngroup that spent most of 2020 travelling on Dr Forrest's private jet to more than 30 nations on the hunt for clean \nenergy projects.\nMr Masterman had worked closely with Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest for close to a quarter of a century, both \nat Fortescue and at Dr Forrest's private companies.\nFortescue's claim has been lodged against Element Zero, Mr Masterman, Dr Kolodziejczyk and a third man, Bjorn \nWinther-Jensen. Justice Logan's summary is the only document from the case that is publicly available, and a \nspokesman for Element Zero said it would contest the search request.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue takes former execs to court over IP\n\"Element Zero believes this legal action is entirely without merit and welcomes the opportunity to respond to \nFortescue's spurious claims.\nOur response will include an application to vary or set aside the original search orders,\" he said.\n\"As Element Zero will demonstrate, its green metals technology was developed independently of and is very \ndifferent from anything that Fortescue is doing or has done in this space.\nWe continue to rapidly advance our technology.\n\"As the matter is now before the court, we will not be making further comment at this time.\"\nA spokesman for Fortescue said yesterday that it was developing cutting-edge solutions to help the world fight \nclimate change and protecting intellectual property was crucial.\n\"As a first mover, our intellectual property is critical to our ongoing success in this pursuit and must be protected at \nall times,\" he said.\n\"Protecting our IP helps to protect the substantial investment of time and effort made by our innovative employees \nand stakeholders every day.\n\"We invest significant resources in creating IP and are committed to vigorously managing and enforcing its \nprotection. As the matter is the subject of legal proceedings, we do not intend to comment further at this stage.\"\nHearings into the case are scheduled to resume later this month.\nThe stoush comes as all the major Australian iron ore miners are ramping up efforts to reduce the carbon emissions \nfootprint of the nation's most lucrative commodity export.\nEarlier this week, Rio Tinto announced plans to spend $215 million building a giant microwave heating system \nsouth of Perth for its BioIron method of making metallic iron, with up to 95 per cent lower emissions.\nHancock Prospecting and Fortescue are also pushing more into a form of iron ore known as magnetite \nconcentrate, which can lower the carbon footprint of the entire steel value chain compared to traditional iron ores.\nLoad-Date: June 9, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Fortescue Zero brings together all the green technologies to accelerate commercial \ndecarbonisation rapidly, profitably and globally. This includes haul trucks, batteries, electrolysers, power \nconversion, intelligence software, trains, green shipping and green iron,\" he said.\n\"While Western Australia remains Fortescue's home, Perth is not the centre of gravity for our energy business. \nFortescue Energy's executive team reflects the global nature of the company.\" In addition to the fresh upheaval \nwithin Fortescue's energy division, the company is still to announce the appointment of a permanent chief financial \nofficer, 10 months after the sudden departure of Christine Morris from the role. Ms Morris quit after only two months \nin the job, following the exit of metals boss Fiona Hick, who herself lasted only a few months at the company.\nPage 2 of 3\nFortescue in reshuffle of green team\nThe latest restructure within Fortescue's energy division was partly triggered by the recent departure from \nFortescue Zero of Judith Judson, appointed only 10 months ago. Ms Judson remains a Fortescue employee but is \nunderstood to have elected to return to live and work in the US for family reasons.\nFortescue Europe president Bruh Terfie has also just handed in his notice. Mr Terfie previously ran the company's \nAfrican section and was made the acting president for Europe in February, when Carlos Lange quit the job after \nonly 10 months.\nMr Hutchinson will now replace Ms Judson as the interim CEO of Fortescue Zero, the former technology company \nfounded to back the Williams Formula One racing car team.\nMr Hutchinson joined Fortescue only two years ago, tasked with turning the results of Dr Forrest's grand green \nenergy ambitions into reality.\nBut from the hundreds of billions of dollars in green energy projects earmarked by the iron ore billionaire's whirlwind \nglobal tour in 2020 and 2021, Fortescue's energy division has only managed to advance three relatively minor \nprojects to the point of a final investment decision.\nThe restructure positions Mr Pichot as the clear heir to the top job within Fortescue's Energy division should Mr \nHutchinson, who has just turned 64, part ways with the iron ore and energy giant.\nThe executive reshuffle may only be the tip of more sweeping changes at Fortescue Energy, sources say, with \nstaff on edge over talk the company is drafting plans to \"reset\" its ambitions as major planned projects fall by the \nwayside and Fortescue factors in a lower iron ore price outlook.\nFortescue recently lost out to a Nigerian company in the race to be nominated to lead the development of the giant \nGrand Inga hydro power project in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nAnd sources say the company is also cooling on other planned African projects, including a geothermal and green \nhydrogen play in Kenya once slated as a key project for the company that failed to make the cut in the round of final \ninvestment decisions in late 2023.\nThe shift comes amid a wave of other senior executive departures. Long-serving executive Julie Shuttleworth, Mr \nHutchinson's predecessor as Fortescue Energy CEO, called time on her 11 years with Fortescue this week.\nMs Shuttleworth's most recent role was leading the development of the company's Belinga iron ore project in \nGabon. Fortescue's president of African operations, Ed Kalajzic, will now take charge in Gabon.\nThe past year has also seen the loss of Fortescue's global director of people, Matt Brady, along with Allard Nooy, \npresident of Asian operations, global government relations boss Todd Clewett, and Michael Gunner, the ex-\nNorthern Territory chief minister.\nDr Forrest last year said executives who had left the iron ore major had struggled to cope with the -\"boiler room\" \nconditions of the company and were not following his green vision.\nHowever, Dr Forrest said in February that a degree of turnover was expected as the company transitioned from a \npure iron ore producer to a green energy company with lofty global renewable hydrogen ambitions.\nHopes for both hydrogen and critical minerals in particular remain high given recent stimulus from the Albanese \ngovernment.\nMajor miners and investors, including Dr Forrest, in May toasted a $15bn cash splash for hydrogen production and \ncritical minerals processing, a major push the Albanese government hopes will unlock $50bn in private spending to \nfurther turbocharge the sector.Page 3 of 3\nFortescue in reshuffle of green team\nDr Forrest personally welcomed the federal government's commitment to green hydrogen in the budget, predicting \nit could drive a \"massive employment boom\" in the sector.\nHe said in May the $2 per kilo tax credit for green hydrogen would help drive a green hydrogen, green ammonia \nand green iron industry which would \"create economic opportunities of historical scale\". Mr Forrest has long been a \nsupporter of encouraging the development of a green hydrogen sector in Australia, urging the federal government \nto take action to follow the green energy incentives in the Biden Administration's Inflation Reduction Act.\nLoad-Date: June 14, 2024\nEnd of Document",

It is also working on green iron technology.\nDr Forrest and other business leaders are due to meet Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Perth on Tuesday. The mining \nbillionaire will also host Mr Li and Mr Albanese on a visit to a Fortescue hydrogen research and development \ncentre, where the company is working on electric haul trucks.\nMs Judson is the latest in a long line of Fortescue executives to leave or step back from senior roles at the \ncompany in recent times.\nJulie Shuttleworth, who was in charge of Fortescue's iron ore operations in Gabon, and the inaugural leader of the \ngreen energy division, departed this week. In the green energy division, chief financial officer Deborah Caudle \nexited in January after less than five months as part of what Fortescue described as a restructure.\nFormer Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle lasted just five months as CFO of the division before quitting.\nFortescue said in November that it would proceed with its first three projects under ambitious plans to become a \nmajor force in hydrogen and renewable energy, committing to investments worth $US750 million in Australia and \nthe US.\nThe company said at the time that it was allocating $US550 million to a hydrogen project in Arizona, but Dr Forrest \nsubsequently hit out at revisions attached to the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act that threatened \nFortescue's tax credit eligibility.\nLoad-Date: June 17, 2024\nEnd of Document",

To get out \nof that awkward era as soon as possible is the responsibility for any good government,\" Dr Forrest said.\n\"Any government of Australia which goes out of its way to annoy its biggest customer is probably going to stop \nbeing that customer's favourite supplier.\n\"You can't run around kicking your customers and still expect to sell a lot of boots.\" Dr Forrest's stake in his iron ore \nminer Fortescue Metals, whose main customer is China, has made him one of the richest men in Australia. He is \nnow driving the company to push into hydrogen and the production of \"green steel\".\nHe was also critical of Peter Dutton's recent decision to flag that he would abandon Australia's 2030 carbon-\nreduction targets if he came to power.\nHe said maintaining the goal was critical for business planning, and warned that scrapping the target could lead to \nAustralia missing out on the enormous economic opportunity around the global -energy transition.\n\"Barnaby Joyce and others know I am likely to call out behaviour which is going to be directly against the standard \nof living, the national interest, the economic growth of Australia,\" he said.\n\"Causing fear and division or claiming you can run a business, let alone a country, without targets just says to me \nyou've obviously never employed anyone, you've never created value from scratch.\" Slowing down the energy \nPage 2 of 2\n'Awkward': Forrest hails an end to 'puerile' politics\ntransition by scrapping the target, he said, would mean slowing down the economic growth opportunities associated \nwith the transition.\n\"The reason why we can drive potentially the next big economic wave, the biggest economic growth, the highest \nemployment multiplier and economic multiplier in Australia's recent history is thanks to the necessity to address \nclimate change,\" he said.\n\"There is a serious economic opportunity here for every single Australian. You wouldn't want to stand in the road of \nthat.\" The Chinese Premier's visit to Fortescue's Perth facility will centre on the efforts the company is putting into \ndeveloping hydrogen-fuelled trucks and a battery-powered locomotive it has named \"the infinity train\".\nDr Forrest will also detail Fortescue's plans to develop an Australia-China green iron supply chain. \"We have the \nleading tech in the world now,\" he said. \"I see this as a really key historical step to creating the next wave of major \neconomic growth and employment for Australia.\" Dr Forrest said this week's visit showed China too had shifted its \ndiplomatic approach. \"You can see wolf diplomacy failed, and the dip-lomacy of Premier Li is absolutely the right \nstep,\" he said. \"We've always been able to export and drive the standard of living we have in Australia. Now the last \nthing we want to do is start hurting that standard of living, hurting that economic growth, and a strong relationship \nbetween China and Australia is absolutely necessary to continue the growth of the economies of both countries.\"\nLoad-Date: June 17, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Shares fell $1.19 in trade yesterday to \nclose at $21.78. It is their lowest point since October. Fortescue shares have fallen more than a quarter since the \nstart of the year. It has been a tumultuous period for the Andrew Forrest-chaired iron ore and energy group, with a \nstring of executive departures over the last year. Last week, Julie Shuttleworth, one of Dr Forrest's most trusted \nlieutenants and the executive in charge of Fortescue's fledgling iron ore operations in Gabon, announced her \ndeparture.

So \nthe industrial logic is there, the cost structures are there, and we believe in rapidly advancing technology to be able \nto scale up and really take emissions in this space \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to zero in a way that just cannot be done with the other \ntechnologies.\" Element Zero's technology, developed by Mr Masterman and former Fortescue chief scientist Bart \nKolodziejczyk, involves removing many of the impurities in iron ore by running renewable electricity through a \nchemical -solution.\nPage 2 of 2\nEx-Fortescue exec blasts hydrogen claims\nMr Masterman said such an approach would require less renewable energy than rival plans involving hydrogen DRI \n(direct reduced ironmaking), which require using renewable energy to produce hydrogen that is then used to \nprocess the iron ore.\n\"The reason why this technology is superior to, say, hydrogen DRI is that we don't have a loss associated with \nmaking hydrogen in the first place,\" he said.\n\"At the moment, hydrogen DRI takes green electrons, which as everybody has said is scarce, and loses 25 per cent \nwhen -converting to hydrogen \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Our technology uses the green electrons directly and it can use them on an \nintermittent basis.\" Mr Masterman had a long -association with Fortescue and Dr Forrest, having previously worked \nas the chief financial officer of the company's green energy arm Fortescue Future Industries and chairing Dr \nForrest's privately owned renewable energy group Squadron Energy.\nFortescue earlier this year won court orders authorising searches of Element Zero's offices after accusing the \nformer Fortescue employees at the company of taking its intellectual property with them when they quit. Element \nZero has described the claims as \"spurious\" and \"entirely without merit\".\nElement Zero has been testing its technologies on iron ores from across Australia, and the company is now \nplanning to build a plant in Port Hedland that will process five million tonnes a year of iron ore into 2.6 million tonnes \nof green iron. Mr Masterman says the technology is scalable so can be easily expanded over time.\nThe output, he said, would be \"vastly superior\" to that currently produced in blast furnaces around the world. \"The \nkey to actually making this business chain or supply chain work is being able to harness the great amounts of iron \nore produced out of Port Hedland with the vast renewable -assets that are available and -deployable in the Pilbara \nof Western Australia, through our manufacturing plants to produce high-quality green iron that can go to all the \nmajor steel mills of the world, and they can then save 70 per cent of their carbon emissions by taking our green \niron,\" he said.\nLoad-Date: June 18, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Masterman, who is Element Zero's chief executive, has called Fortescue's \nclaims \"spurious\" and said that their \"green metals technology was developed independently of and is very different \nfrom anything that Fortescue is doing or has done in this space\".\nFortescue secured court orders to raid the offices and homes of the men from mid-May. An independent lawyer \nwas present, and a computer expert was allowed to search and copy any electronic devices, including family \nmembers' computers, while also being required to hand over all passwords and passcodes.\nDocuments released by the Federal Court late on Wednesday, which were previously suppressed, revealed that a \npsychologist was required to attend if a child was present during the raids.\nIn the weeks before those raids, which stretched from Victoria to Western Australia, private investigators were hired \nto spy on and trail Kolodziejczyk and also Winther-Jensen, and provide a report to independent lawyers. The \nlawyers required that report before a search warrant from the Federal Court could be obtained.\nThe extent of that spying in the investigator's report included photographs and Google Maps images of both men's \nprivate residences, floor plans, and also photographs of their wives and children.\nKolodziejczyk, a former hydrogen specialist at Fortescue Future Industries, who lives in Melbourne with his wife \nand five-year-old child, travels frequently to Perth, where Element Zero is headquartered.\nPage 2 of 2\nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue spied on former staff and their families\nPrivate investigators reported observing him at home with his family, noting where his home office was, and \nfollowed him on one occasion to Melbourne airport when he departed on a business trip.\nThe investigators, unable to ascertain Kolodziejczyk's destination, deployed a team to pick up the trail at Perth \nairport, expecting that was where Kolodziejczyk was headed. They were wrong.\nWhile Kolodziejczyk was away on that trip the investigators continued to spy on his family. \"In the meantime, \nsurveillance continues at the Hadfield, Victoria residence, where Dr Kolodziejczyk's wife and child are permanently \nresiding,\" investigators noted.\nKolodziejczyk is a co-founder and chief technology officer of Element Zero.\nWinther-Jensen, who ceased being a director at Element Zero in January, was observed by investigators going to \nthe gym, shopping and watering plants. There were also photographs of his wife and 16-year-old daughter in the \ninvestigator's reports, as well as records of when his daughter left and arrived home from school.\nWinther-Jensen continues to work with Kolodziejczyk and Masterman at another company.\nElement Zero was formed by Kolodziejczyk and Masterman at the end of 2022. Masterman has had a long career \nin the energy industry, including as Fortescue Future Industries' chief financial officer.\nElement Zero said it wants to reduce the carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry. It \nhas patented a technology that aims to convert metal ores to metals, not only iron ore, with zero carbon emissions.\nFortescue said it would \"vigorously\" defend its intellectual property in the development of cutting-edge solutions to \ndecarbonise its Australian iron ore operations by the end of the decade.\n\"As a first mover, our intellectual property is critical to our ongoing success in this pursuit and must be protected at \nall times,\" a Fortescue spokesperson said.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 17\nLength: 770 words\nByline: Yolanda Redrup\nBody\nA Fortescue-backed hydrogen-powered plane start-up has collapsed, burning through almost $150 million in \ninvestor capital but unable to secure additional funding amid the global challenging venture capital environment.\nThe closure of Universal Hydrogen comes despite the California-based start-up successfully completing a test flight \nlast year, which made it the largest hydrogen fuel cell-powered plane to take to the skies.\nThe company, founded in 2020 by former Airbus chief technology officer Paul Eremenko, raised $US62 million in a \nSeries B round at the height of the venture capital boom in 2021.\nIts previous $US20.5 million Series A raise was led by Silicon Valley-based Australian Peter Barrett's early-stage \ndeep tech fund Playground Global, while Rich Lister Andrew Forrest's Fortescue was also an early-stage minority \ninvestor. Other investors include American Airlines, Toyota, Airbus and General Electric.\nSpeaking to The Australian Financial Review, Mr Barrett said the start-up, led by former chief technology officer \nMark Collins - who stepped into the CEO role after Mr Eremenko left earlier this year - had been trying to raise \nfunds since last year.\n\"Last year wasn't a good time to raise money, we had a lead for a very significant round, but that lead [investor] was \nunable to fund it,\" said Mr Barrett, who was also Universal Hydrogen director.\n\"There were dynamics that had nothing to do with the market or technology. There were a number of unfortunate \ntiming coincidences ... It's a really underappreciated determinant of success for these companies.\n\"We were very close to getting through this crisis. We were less than six months of runway from being in a very \nstrong position.\"\nMr Barrett, who co-founded video game developer Rocket Science Games in the 1990s and gave Elon Musk his \nfirst job, said the US government had approached Universal Hydrogen since the news of the collapse with offers to \ninject capital into the start-up to keep it afloat, but he believed it was too late to save it. However, he backed the \nteam and the technology, saying he hoped the company would \"find another home\" for its hydrogen fuel cell tech.\nPage 2 of 2\nCash headwinds ground Fortescue, Playground-backed hydrogen plane\n\"We have test aircraft flying, certification basis, we know the economics of the hydrogen plane are favourable, but \nthere is still a two-year path for certification ... That means you have to keep the development program fed and \nthere's a very small quorum of money that's in the middle,\" Mr Barrett said.\n\"It's not the $5 million cheque, or the $500 million cheque, it's the $50 million cheque that's really hard.\"\nPlayground Global, which Street Talk reports is raising a new fund, is also an investor in federal government-\nbacked PsiQuantum, Agility Robotics, Atomic AI and Ultima Genomics. More than 20 per cent of its portfolio \ncompanies have already hit $US1 billion valuations.\nA statement from Fortescue on yesterday on the collapse of Universal Hydrogen suggested the company was \nundeterred by the the venture's demise.\n\"There remains significant interest in our green energy projects and the prospect of green hydrogen and its \nderivatives,\" the spokesperson said.\n\"We are proud to have some of the first green energy projects in the world at final investment decision including our \nArizona Hydrogen project in the United States and our Gladstone PEM50 project in Queensland.\"\nThe Seattle Times reported Universal Hydrogen's funding negotiations had been with a Saudi investment fund, and \nthe business had then tried to merge with Florida-based regional airline Silver Airways to stay afloat.\nWhile companies such as Universal Hydrogen have made leaps forward in developing hydrogen fuel cells to power \nplanes, there are still limitations being worked through, including storing sufficient hydrogen for long flights, given \neven in liquid form it contains about a quarter of the energy of a similar volume of jet fuel. On its test flight last year, \nonly one engine of the retrofitted aircraft was powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, the other by regular jet fuel.\nAs well as developing the propulsion system, Universal Hydrogen faced other challenges, including developing the \ninfrastructure at airports to support hydrogen-powered planes, and securing sufficient green hydrogen.\nHydrogen-powered long-haul flights are still some way off, but Mr Barrett said it was time for regional airlines to \nconvert to the fuel, with the technology already there to support short flights.\nAs well as being an early investor in Universal Hydrogen, Fortescue Future Industries had signed a memorandum \nof understanding with the US start-up in 2021 to negotiate a global offtake arrangement.\nLoad-Date: July 6, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 22\nLength: 854 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nDispute A bitter falling out reveals pressure behind the transition.\nBillionaire Andrew Forrest has the Chinese Communist Party to thank for holding up the iron ore price.\nIn the 12 months since The Australian Financial Review lifted the lid on his separation from wife Nicola and the \ndivvying up of their Fortescue wealth, it appears the life of Australia's eighth-richest person has become more \ncomplicated.\nThrough all this, the iron ore price has defied forecasts: trading above $US110 ($163) a tonne in a low-growth \nworld. Iron ore's outlier status hinges on optimism about what China's leadership might do in response to its growth \ndilemma.\nThe Fortescue executive chairman's judgment is in question over revelations that private investigators hired by the \ncompany watched and photographed the families of former employees. The spying reveals a dark side to the noble \nquest to produce so-called green iron by Fortescue, which makes nearly all its money from selling iron ore to \nChinese steel mills.\nFortescue has accused key figures behind its leap into clean energy of copying and taking the company's \nintellectual property when they left to start a rival green iron business, Element Zero.\nFortescue hired private investigators to trail Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen in \nthe lead-up to raids on homes and Element Zero premises.\nThe actions, which included photographing Winther-Jensen, his wife and teenage daughter at their home in the \nPerth suburb of Scarborough, and Kolodzijczyk's wife at their Melbourne home, were revealed in an affidavit \nreleased by the Federal Court this week.\nCameras are everywhere these days but even WA premier Roger Cook has questioned if Fortescue went too far. \nForrest himself was photographed planting a kiss on the streets of Paris in May. Moroccan energy minister Leila \nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue 's green iron dreams sullied by surveillance tactics in tech row\nBenali, who is on the board of one of Fortescue's joint venture partners in a green ammonia project, later denied \nthat she was the woman in the picture.\nUnder Federal Court rules, an independent lawyer must carry out raids under privately obtained search warrants of \nthe kind granted to Fortescue.\nLawyers acting for Element Zero will seek to have the Fortescue claim they stole intellectual property thrown out. \nThey have also pointed to reputational damage suffered by the three men and say the search and seizure orders \nwere improperly obtained.\nFortescue is making no apologies and is standing by its allegations of \"industrial-scale misuse\" of its work on green \niron. Element Zero says its technology was developed independently and is very different from anything Fortescue \nhas done.\nOne-time trusted Forrest lieutenant Masterman and former Fortescue chief scientist Kolodziejczyk founded \nElement Zero in December 2022; they were part of the Fortescue team that travelled the world with Forrest in 2020 \nin the hunt for clean energy projects.\nThe green hydrogen dream remains elusive. Throughout most of last year, Fortescue maintained it would make \nfinal investment decisions on five green energy projects by December 31.\nThree were announced at the company's annual general meeting in November, and Fortescue said at the time that \nit still hoped to hit the target by the year-end. Seven months later, Fortescue remains stuck at three.\nIt was due to host Cook, other officials and the media on a site tour of its clean energy hub at Christmas Creek on \nJune 21 but cancelled the event because of heavy rain.\nThe heavens opened up days earlier when Forrest hosted Chinese premier Li Qiang at a Fortescue research hub \non the outskirts of Perth, where it is trialling hydrogen, ammonia and battery power for use in its mining machinery.\nSpeaking in May at a JP Morgan forum, Forrest talked up the prospect of a fully integrated Australia-China green \niron supply chain. He said Fortescue would produce 200 million tonnes of green iron ore annually through its \nefforts to achieve zero emissions, and Chinese manufacturers would supply the equipment and electrolysers. In the \nsame presentation, Forrest predicted Morocco would become the \"leading green molecule and green electron \nprovider\" in a transformation of the global fertiliser industry.\nMeanwhile, his US interests are getting expensive. Forrest has warned that plans by US Treasury officials to restrict \nthe availability of tax credits for hydrogen developments through the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act \nthreaten the viability of the $US550 million Arizona project, one of the three big bets. Fortescue has counted on \naccess to those incentives to underpin the US hydrogen venture.\nIn WA, where Fortescue still makes all its money, the $US3.9 billion Iron Bridge magnetite operations remain in \nneed of fixing. It was slated to produce just 2 million tonnes in 2023-24, and it remains unclear if it will ever hit a \nnameplate capacity of 22 million tonnes a year.\nAmong its issues, Iron Bridge has been plagued with high turnover. This week, Fiona Hick joined the board of gold \nand copper producer Evolution Mining in her first major move since leaving Fortescue after just six months as chief \nexecutive of its iron ore division.\nLoad-Date: July 8, 2024\nEnd of Document",

More specifically, discussions are well advanced with two green energy projects about \nland in the precinct which combined are expected to require slightly more land than what was previously proposed \nby Fortescue.\" The government said Not to Deal commitments for initial proponents TEH2, Tivan, Tamboran and \nAvenira remain in place.\nMiddle Arm is the Territory government's most consequential major project which, if successfully developed, could \ndeliver 20,000 direct and indirect jobs to the economy and millions in revenue and royalties. A visionary plan, \nMiddle Arm defies the historic challenge of securing major projects by offering developers the land, infrastructure \nand regulatory environment of a joint user facility to get hundred-million-dollar-plus developments off the ground.\nCanberra-focused anti-development activists including senators David Pocock and Lidia Thorpe have opposed the \ndevelopment, implying the Territory, unlike anywhere else in Australia, should be excluded from job-creating, \nwealth-generating projects.\nWhile the agreements are intended to provide proponents with confidence and certainty to continue developing their \nproposals, the government said, final land allocation within Middle Arm is subject to key project milestones and \napprovals, specific to each proponent project.\nThe Middle Arm peninsula is already home to the Santos Darwin LNG and the INPEX Ichthys LNG processing \nfacilities. Both companies are committed to net zero emissions. While the government attempts to secure \ndevelopment at Middle Arm, it's also wrestling with seemingly constant delays on its $500m ship lift project while \nwork continues on two other Top End major projects - the Tiger Brennan Drive overpass and the State Square art \ngallery.\nAfter almost a decade, the government said it was preparing to start work at the Alice Springs Indigenous art \ngallery. In the private sector Tamboran Resources and Empire Energy are continuing work in the Beetaloo Basin, \nhoping for first production next year, Grok is developing Sun Cable and in Central Australian Arafura Rare Earths \ncontinues to progress the Nolans project, underpinned with an $840m Commonwealth loan.\nLoad-Date: July 8, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Today though, Dr Forrest notes, Murrin \nMurrin has become an eventual success for its now owner Glencore, and he personally has since gone on to build \nFortescue Metals into an iron ore powerhouse.\nHe is now onto his next revolution, turning Fortescue into what he hopes will eventually be the world's biggest \nenergy company via his huge green hydrogen production ambitions.\nPage 2 of 2\nKeating our most influential Australian: Forrest\n\"I think, if I look back on anything with a semblance of pride, it will be switching off all fossil fuels of this huge \nindustrial hyper-successful company,\" Dr Forrest says of Fortescue, every move of which continues to be covered \nin detail by The Australian.\nDr Forrest is a notable member of this newspaper's annual The List - Australia's Richest 250 edition, and his trials \nand tribulations as Fortescue boss have been written about extensively.\nThat has included tracking Fortescue's incredible share price rise over the last decade, the huge amounts of \ndividends it has paid and that has also caused billions of dollars to flow to the Forrest family's Minderoo foundation, \nextensive executive and boardroom changes and much more.\nDr Forrest's personal battle against Meta, which he has claimed did nothing to stop thousands of scams being \npublished on its platforms such as Facebook that fleeced scores of Australians of their life savings, has also been \nwritten about in detail.\nThe mining billionaire has also attracted plenty of publicity for his backing of various causes, ranging from vowing to \nhelp rebuild Ukraine to saving the Western Force rugby union team, and more recently his separation from wife \nNicola. But it is Fortescue's push into green energy, firstly via its Fortescue Future Industries subsidiary and which \nhas more recently seen Dr Forrest return to the company as executive chairman, that has attracted the most -\nattention.\nIt is one that from a corporate point of view fills him with the most pride. \"This company which has proved to its \ninvestors all over the world that it's high performing yet it was the one, even being a heavy industry mining \ncompany, that switched off fossil fuels,\" Dr Forrest says.\n\"And it further cemented its position as the leading industry player by doing so, setting the example for the rest of \nthe industrial world that they can and must as well.\" See full video interview online at \ntheaustralian.com.au/60thanniversary\nLoad-Date: July 9, 2024\nEnd of Document",

But here's the problem: \nlaw firms act under instruction.\nSomebody at Fortescue instructed Davies Collison Cave Law to pursue the three men in the way that happened - \nor, at the very least, authorised the steps taken.\nThose, as a quick reminder, include: pictures of a teenager leaving school, following a family on a shopping trip to \nKmart, grubbing through their mail - and, given Fortescue is still trying to keep the actions of its spies secret, \nprobably a fair bit worse that is not yet in the public domain.\nIf Fortescue employees weren't overseeing the behaviour of their contractors, they should have been. Forrest's \ndisavowal of knowledge of their actions will only have meaning if there are internal consequences for those that \nauthorised them.\nOr, at the very least, a public apology to the families whose privacy has been violated. Until the court case is done, \nwe will not know whether Fortescue's underlying complaint is a reasonable one, and it would be foolish to prejudge \nthe outcome of the court case.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest 'surprised to learn of the investigations'\nBut the fact remains that the damage has been done. Start-up tech companies rely on investors to get them through \nearly stages of their commercialisation process. Any sniff that the intellectual property they are developing could be \nchallenged in court would scare off investors - a potentially fatal problem for a nascent business. Even if dropped \ntomorrow, Fortescue's legal action has already irreparably damaged the reputation of its former employees and \ntheir business. Justice should be done in public. The fact that Fortescue is still trying to keep its actions secret - so \nfar helped by the court - makes it difficult to see how that pillar of the Western judicial process can be upheld in the \nface of this case.\nLoad-Date: July 10, 2024\nEnd of Document",

All three quit the would-be green \nenergy giant to start their own green metal firm in 2022.\nAfter Fortescue accused them of stealing intellectual property relating to its carbon dioxide-free iron technology, it \nsuccessfully obtained orders from the Federal Court in May to search the offices and homes of Element Zero and \nits staff. Computers and electronic devices were seized in those raids.\nElement Zero denies the allegations and says its technology was developed independently to that of Fortescue's.\nSuch has been the veil of secrecy cast over the case that its existence was not revealed until two weeks after the \nsearch orders were granted (on May 14), and elements of the matter are still suppressed.\nDuring a brief case management hearing on Wednesday, Chris McMeniman, the barrister appearing for Element \nZero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman, told the court that for 19 days Fortescue's private investigators pursued \nhis clients, their families and Element Zero staff.\nHe said Fortescue claimed it was \"too difficult\" to redact residential addresses and photos of minors included in a \n600-page report completed for them, and therefore wanted the whole thing kept secret.\nThat report contains details about the extraordinary surveillance conducted by Fortescue, including that private \ninvestigators followed \"wives to Kmart\", sifted through mail \"and the like\" and that Element Zero staff beyond those \nlisted in the court filings were followed.\n\"They want the entirety of that redacted,\" he said.\nFortescue barrister Wen Wu told the court that since an interim suppression order was granted on May 9, the \ncompany had since lodged a further two applications.\n\"The reason \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 why a further suppression application was brought is because the initial suppression was to \nsuppress -material that was confidential to Fortescue and not known to the individual respondents,\" Mr Wu said.\n\"The second suppression -application made \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 covers confidential information which is known to individual \npersons but not to the world at large.\" Mr Wu agreed that Fortescue's bid for a suppression order covering the 600 \npages of private investigator reports was \"broader\" than Element Zero's.\nJustice Markovic described Element Zero's application as \"more nuanced or selective\".\nShe said she would need to \"sift through\" the vast amounts of material filed and examine what was sought to be \nredacted.\nIn relation to one of Mr Wu's suppression applications, Justice Markovic said: \"I would like your side to consider \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \nnarrow applications\".\nHall and Wilcox were hired by Fortescue's external lawyers Davies Collison Cave Law to act as independent \nsolicitors and carry out the raids in May.\nAccording to a letter sent from Davies Collison Cave Law to Hall and Wilcox that summarised Fortescue's \nallegations against Element Zero, Dr Winther-Jensen sent emails to his personal email address attaching \nconfidential Fortescue technical documents.\nAs well, Fortescue claimed Dr Kolodziejczyk accessed confidential technical documents on his work-issued laptop \nusing a USB and deleted a file shortly -before he left.\n\"Fortescue are unable to locate a substantial number of documents recording the research and development of the \nER (electrochemical reduction) process in the green iron project on its internal file systems,\" the letter read.Page 3 of 3\nFortescue 'spied on' wives, kids\nLawyers for Element Zero have previously flagged they would move to have Fortescue's case struck out, saying \nthe accusations had caused \"ongoing reputational damage\" to all three men, and the orders were improperly \nobtained by Fortescue.\nAt a hearing late last month, Dr Kolodziejczyk suggested he planned to introduce evidence he was allowed by \nFortescue to take some documents with him when he resigned.

It has accused the men of copying and taking the company's intellectual \nproperty when they left to start a rival green iron project, called Element Zero.\nElement Zero has rejected the allegations, and its chief executive, Masterman, has described the claims as \n\"spurious\". Fortescue's executive chairman, Forrest, has argued that protecting the company's intellectual property \nremains \"critical to its success\".\nA warrant was secured to conduct raids on Element Zero's offices and the homes of Kolodziejczyk and Winther-\nJensen. It is estimated that three terabits of data was gathered from personal computers, mobile phones and cloud \nstorage accounts.\nIncluded in the trove of data were the entire business records of Element Zero, including payroll data, budgets and \nforecasts, and all the personal emails sent and received by Kolodziejczyk since 2008. However, Kolodziejczyk only \nstarted at Fortescue Future Industries on July 1, 2020, and ceased working there on November 5, 2021, in his \nroles as chief scientist (energy) and later chief scientist.\nKolodziejczyk is now chief technology officer of Element Zero, a company he and Masterman founded at the end of \n2022.\nIn affidavits filed to the court, Gilbert + Tobin partner Michael Williams, who is representing Element Zero, said he \nhad \"serious concerns\" about the material that was relied on by Fortescue to secure the warrant from the Federal \nCourt.\nHe said the material \"omitted key information\" about the relationship between Fortescue and Element Zero, \nparticularly in the six months before the orders were executed.\nPage 2 of 3\nFortescue accused of keeping key meeting a secret in intellectual property case\nWilliams said the material relied on for the orders, which included affidavits, did not disclose a meeting that \noccurred on December 19 between Masterman, Fortescue's chief legal counsel, Phil McKeiver, and Paul Dewar of \nlaw firm Davies Collison Cave. Dewar is representing Fortescue in its case against Element Zero.\nWilliams said that in that meeting Masterman advised the men that Element Zero's technology was very different \nfrom Fortescue's green iron technology. He said this was because the technology did not use a membrane, \noperated at a different temperature range and used a non-aqueous alkaline solution.\nLink to Image\nAlex Ellinghausen\nMasterman told the men that Element Zero had completed freedom-to-operate searches, which cleared its \ntechnology and found no overlap with Fortescue.\nA freedom-to-operate search is undertaken when trying to establish that a new product or service offering will not \ninfringe on a third party's patents.\nIn January, there was a meeting as well as emails exchanged between the two companies that discussed the \ntesting of Fortescue's iron ore, sharing of information, and future commercial opportunities, Williams said. A non-\ndisclosure agreement between the companies was also signed.\nIn 2023, Element Zero received iron ore samples from Fortescue, which allowed it to test its technology. It had \nprovided Fortescue with information about the results. Element Zero was also testing iron ore samples from other \ncompanies such as BHP and Rio Tinto.\nMany companies are researching and developing ways to produce green iron ore. Green iron technology is a \ntechnology for processing iron ore into metallic iron without burning fossil fuels that produce carbon dioxide.\nThis court case focuses on the technology that uses electrochemical reduction of the iron oxides found in iron ore to \nproduce metallic iron.\nIn his affidavits, Williams also argued that the warrant secured by Fortescue allowed for the collection of \"highly \nconfidential and privileged material\" and \"the indiscriminate capture of material entirely unrelated to Fortescue's \npleaded claim\".\nHe said the volume of material taken was an \"extraordinary invasion of the privacy\", which exceeded what is \n\"usually contemplated\" in civil proceedings. He said the invasion of privacy also extended to spying on Element \nZero staff that had occurred before the warrant was issued.\nThe Federal Court has heard how Fortescue hired a private investigation firm to trail the three men, their family \nmembers and other Element Zero staff, for 19 days.\nA 600-page report was compiled. Fortescue lawyers said the investigation and report was required so that it could \nsecure the warrant.\nForrest has since said he was \"surprised\" to learn of the spying.\nFortescue is seeking loss and damages in the case.

The entire contents of Dr Kolodziejczyk's mobile was downloaded, including photos \nand videos, and about 3TB of data was captured, which Mr Williams said was \"an extremely large volume\" to be \ncaught under Anton Piller search orders in his experience.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue 'seized personal details'\nFurther, he said there were grounds for the search orders to be scrapped based on \"the apparent extraordinary \ninvasion of the privacy of the respondents\".\n\"I am informed by Mr Masterman and believe that, as a result of how the search orders are drafted and executed \nthey will have captured a very large amount of information that is confidential, privileged, and not likely to be \nrelevant to these proceedings,\" Mr Williams said.\n\"The search orders will have captured material that is ... highly confidential to third parties including competitors of \nFortescue.\" As well, Mr William said he believed images taken of Dr Kolodziejczyk's phone would have captured \ndata including passwords for online banking and superannuation.\nAccording to a summary of Fortescue's arguments, staff became suspicious about the activities of the three men \nafter they realised Mr Masterman was working with Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen in September, that \nthey incorporated Element Zero, which was \"potentially developing technology that is similar to technology \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \ndeveloped for Fortescue\", and that Element Zero was \"seeking the supply of iron ore samples from Fortescue to \nhelp test (Element Zero's) technology\".\nA story published in the Australian Financial Review on January 17 kicked off their concerns.\n\"The AFR article set in train a line of inquiry at Fortescue, which involved reviewing the projects that Dr \nKolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen had been working on, and investigating their Fortescue email inboxes, group \nSharePoint folder and two laptops on suspicion of IP leakage,\" the summary read.\nAfter Dr Kolodziejczyk resigned in October 2021, he attended a meeting at which he was told he could not work at \nFortescue's office to finish his notice period.

And so in his early 40s, Calder discovered not only his son, but also himself to be autistic, as \nare one in 150 Australians.\n\"It's possibly the best thing I've ever done,\" the Fortescue worker says, of seeking the diagnosis. \"It helped me fully \nunderstand myself.\"\nCalder is clear, however, that his experiences are his alone. \"If you meet one person with autism, you've met \nexactly one person with autism,\" he says.\n\"For me, I have challenges around social interaction, communication [and] repetitive behaviours that I can't get out \nof.\"\nHe likes a plan - and is good at making them - but deals poorly with surprises.\nHe must park in the same spot every day, take the same path from the car to the same lift, and then walk to the \nsame desk - only possible because Fortescue exempted him from its hot-desking policy.\n\"I can't use these toilets,\" he says while being interviewed at the miner's Perth headquarters, \"this is how stupid it is \n- I use the toilets out there.\"\nWithout his own desk, Calder says he would be overwhelmed by dealing with different screens, different lights and \nglare, the mouse and charger in different spots, and an unfamiliar coworker beside him.\nPage 2 of 3\n'Best thing I've ever done': How a chance diagnosis transformed this WA mining worker's life\n\"These little triggers build up slowly,\" he says.\nLink to Image\nColin Murty\n\"Your body doesn't filter any of this out, so it's taking all this sensory input and ... it's all rattling around in here.\"\nCalder got his own desk because he was willing to share his diagnosis with his supervisor and say what he needed. \nTo him, having a corporate culture where workers feel comfortable sharing their concerns is key.\n\"I don't want people to start to pigeonhole people and think 'he might be autistic,'\" he says.\n\"The only way you can help an autistic person is for them to approach you.\"\nCalder says he got more than his own desk when he shared his diagnosis: he got a ticket to be himself.\nBecause of the stigma attached to neurodiversity - a non-medical term for those who experience the world \ndifferently, including ADHD, dyslexia and various other conditions as well as autism - Calder would previously \n\"mask\".\n\"Masking, in layman's terms, is cosplaying as a normal person,\" he says.\n\"You're suppressing your diagnosis ... and that comes with a massive emotional, physical and mental drain.\"\nStimming - repetitive behaviours used by people with autism to reduce stress - can look unprofessional to \nneurotypical co-workers.\nFortescue head of healthy safety and risk Zara Fisher says she has seen workers get incredibly poor performance \nfeedback for actions such as fiddling at meetings, which can be interpreted as a sign of not concentrating.\n\"Things like that have nothing to do with the person's productivity or capacity, but more about how they present \nthemselves,\" she said.\nThe fortnightly 2\u00bd-hour team meeting was a particular ordeal for Calder. Now he can rock back and forth in his \nchair without explaining himself.\n\"They know that if I interject, or I talk loud, or I say something that might be perceived to be abrupt, I'm not just \nbeing an arsehole,\" he said.\n\"Weekends for me four or five years ago would be on the couch, zoned out, trying to recover from the week of work \nI've had because I've been masking.\"\nThe diagnosis has also led Calder to seek assistance from speech and occupational therapists and understand \nhimself better, causing life to improve at home as well as work.\nNow he understands his own triggers, and works around them with the help of his wife.\n\"That helps our relationship massively,\" he says.\nCalder is part of a network of neurodiverse employees at Fortescue who support each other. They also provide \n\"reverse mentoring\" for supervisors by letting them chat with a network member with a similar diagnosis to \nsomeone on their team who they are unsure how to support.\nFor Fisher, the key for supervisors is realising that everyone - both neurodiverse and neurotypical - is different.\n\"Every one of us functions best under certain circumstances, or we might just have other things going on in our \nlives,\" she says.Page 3 of 3\n'Best thing I've ever done': How a chance diagnosis transformed this WA mining worker's life\nThe trick is creating a \"safe space\" where workers will tell the boss they are struggling and what they need.\nAnd the prize for employers?

Energy users want cheap energy and hydrogen \nis not cheap. Having scoured the world for subsidies and customers, Forrest has learnt that any technological \nadvance to lower costs will be hard won.\nHe has instead launched a sweeping restructure of Fortescue with as many as 700 jobs going and the company's \ngoal of producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030 has been shelved. This leaves Fortescue, a \ncompany with one of the nation's largest carbon emissions footprints, looking for other ways to salve its eco-\nconscience. But it leaves the federal government with a much bigger hole to fill.\nBillions of public subsidy dollars are being directed towards getting hydrogen production down to a reasonable \nprice. In the Albanese government's mind, it is the nation's route to being a renewable energy superpower.\nIn the latest sign of what hydrogen means for the federal government, it has put forward draft plans that, unlike Joe \nBiden's hydrogen subsidy scheme, will allow green hydrogen producers to claim a credit for hydrogen that is \nactually made with fossil fuels.\nThe US refusal to count gas-fired hydrogen might explain why among the projects shelved as part of Fortescue's \nrestructure is a hydrogen play in the US state of Washington.\nFortescue has spent hundreds of millions of dollars examining potential green hydrogen and ammonia sites across \nthe world, but has so far delivered just three investment decisions across the would-be green energy portfolio. One \nof these is a small-scale pilot plant in Gladstone, Queensland.\nWithout hydrogen, Labor's renewables-only transition is left looking for a reliable long-term fuel that can firm the grid \nwhen wind and solar fail to produce. Grid-scale batteries will get you only so far.\nPage 2 of 2\nMinister left high and dry by sudden change of direction\nHydro is the obvious answer, but look at Snowy 2.0. On Wednesday, Energy Minister Chris Bowen remained full \nbore on a renewables-only plan. Without hydrogen, Labor has little choice but to go back to gas, something he \nironically described as a life insurance policy, and something he and those inside the energy industry know to be \ntrue.\nThe federal government has a lot of work to do persuading states to lift their bans on gas exploration and \ndevelopment.\nGas is also the clash of ideology that the Greens have been most anxious to have with Labor. The big picture is a \nre-elected Donald Trump as US president will reinvigorate the global energy picture as he strives to restore US \nenergy independence. Forrest has shown that private capital can quickly change course. Government must show it \ncan do so as well.\nLoad-Date: July 17, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 625 words\nHighlight: Mining billionaire Andrew Forrest's Fortescue will slash 700 jobs, as the company tempers its ambition \nto be a major producer of the clean fuel hydrogen.\nBody\nMining billionaire Andrew Forrest's Fortescue will slash 700 jobs and merge its mining and energy divisions, as the \ncompany tempers its ambition to be a major producer of the clean fuel hydrogen.\nThe $70 billion miner announced late on Wednesday - shortly after Forrest addressed its almost 16,000 staff - that \nthe cuts would mainly hit white-collar roles.\nLink to Image\nAlex Ellinghausen\nSince 2020, Forrest has toured the world promoting the virtues of green hydrogen as an emissions-free fuel and \nseeking to partner with governments that have areas suitable for producing the vast amounts of wind, solar or \nhydropower required.\nForrest defended the high-profile quest, which involved Fortescue assessing 150 projects across the world at one \nstage in the search for cheap electricity, as a targeted effort to ensure value for shareholders.\n\"The 'scattergun' critics obviously haven't gotten a lot of new industries off the ground,\" he said.\nHowever, Fortescue's reassessment on Wednesday highlights a realisation that producing the huge amount of \nenergy required to separate hydrogen from water is extraordinarily costly.\nIt now plans to switch its focus to reducing that cost. Forrest said it would enable the company to compete \"blow \nfor-blow\" with \"fossil fuel peddlers\".\nIn recent years, Forrest has set increasingly ambitious climate goals for the iron ore miner that made him Australia's \nrichest man.\nHe first charged the mine operations with the goal of emitting net zero carbon emissions by 2030, two decades \nahead of the two bigger Pilbara miners, Rio Tinto and BHP.\nPage 2 of 2\nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue slashes 700 jobs, tempers green hydrogen ambitions\nLater, Forrest demanded zero actual emissions, removing the option to buy carbon offsets for any emissions that \nwere technically difficult or prohibitively expensive to eliminate.\n\"We've got this unfolding miracle of Fortescue going fully green this decade,\" he said.\nInitially, Fortescue touted green hydrogen as vital to decarbonise its own operations but more recently its efforts \nhave almost exclusively focused on electrifying its operations, which are heavily dependent on diesel, and ensuring \nthat the electricity used is renewable.\nForrest's goals covered both Fortescue's own emissions - termed Scopes 1 and 2 - and the far greater carbon \npollution from the steel mills buying Fortescue iron ore, known as Scope 3 emissions.\nIn late 2021, Fortescue targeted zero Scope 3 emissions by 2040 and the production of 15 million tonnes a year of \ngreen hydrogen by 2030.\n\"That is what the world needed, and that's where we always start,\" he said, adding that the targets were set before \nthe \"massive spikes\" in energy prices in part caused by the market upheaval after Russia invaded Ukraine.\nIn early 2023, Fortescue committed to making final investment decisions on at least five green hydrogen projects \nby December 2023. It achieved two: a plant to make 30 tonnes of liquid hydrogen a day in Arizona and a $US150 \nmillion ($223 million) investment in a facility in Gladstone, Queensland.\nThere are no more commitments to investments, but Fortescue will keep investigating the feasibility of a project in \nNorway that is three times bigger than the Gladstone plant, and may also launch a study into an opportunity in \nBrazil.\nAs part of the restructure accompanying the job cuts, Fortescue will retain dual chief executives - Dino Otranto for \nmining and Mark Hutchinson in energy - but will merge other senior corporate roles.\nTwo executives who have been with Fortescue for 18 months or less have emerged as major winners. Chief \nfinancial officer for mining Apple Paget will take on that role for the entire company, and Shelley Robertson will \nmove from chief corporate officer to chief operating officer.\nThe Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day's trading.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 1\nLength: 1053 words\nByline: Peter Ker and Angela Macdonald-Smith\nBody\nFortescue will cut 700 jobs and slow its push into green hydrogen in a blow to the Albanese government's plan to \nmake Australia a hydrogen superpower, supported by more than $8 billion of taxpayer-funded incentives.\nFortescue chairman Andrew Forrest said low carbon \"green\" hydrogen still had a bright future, but his immediate \nfocus would shift to renewable electricity as he jettisoned a target for Fortescue to produce 15 million tonnes of \ngreen hydrogen by 2030.\nThe concession comes after a six-year period in which Dr Forrest was one of the world's leading advocates for \nhydrogen and as Fortescue works to break down a corporate structure that had previously treated its energy and \niron ore mining divisions as separate companies.\nThe decision out of Perth stokes speculation that the Albanese government's flagship Hydrogen Headstart program, \nwhich proposes a $2 per kilogram subsidy to hydrogen producers, could be insufficient to spur the industry into \ncommercial reality. Woodside Energy has struggled to get a US hydrogen project signed off without enough \ncustomers willing to pay a premium for low-carbon fuels.\nDr Forrest said lower energy prices were the priority for world leaders at a time when war in Ukraine and the Middle \nEast had roiled commodity markets, driven up the cost of energy and challenged the economics of hydrogen, which \nis more expensive than natural gas. \"In that environment, you're not going to bring in major sources of green \nhydrogen, which relies on cheap energy prices,\" he said. \"We are not going to swim against the tide.\"\nThe Albanese government promise of $6.7 billion of production tax credits for hydrogen arrived barely a year after \npumping $2 billion of taxpayers' funds into the Hydrogen Headstart policy.\nAnd energy sources say Japanese importers are increasingly looking at hydrogen only as a long-term alternative, \npreferring in the nearer term substitutes that are compatible with existing transport and utility infrastructure.\nGrattan Institute energy policy director Tony Wood said: \"The reality is that the queue of people being prepared to \npay Twiggy Forrest a lot of money for green hydrogen is not very long.\"\nPage 2 of 3\nLabor's hydrogen goal stalls as Fortescue trims ambitions\nGreen hydrogen is made by using renewable energy to split water into its constituent parts, and Fortescue had \nshaped as a likely beneficiary of those federal schemes.\nBut Dr Forrest said Fortescue would focus in the immediate future on generating and distributing clean power, \nrather than using that clean power to make hydrogen. \"We're going to stay where we know we can win, and that's \ngreen electricity. Nothing beats green electricity,\" he said.\nDr Forrest is already a big producer of renewable power in his private capacity through Squadron Energy, which \nowns many Australian wind farms.\nThe job cuts announced by Fortescue yesterday will continue efforts under way for close to 18 months to reduce \nduplication between the energy and mining divisions.\nOne layer of duplication will remain: energy boss Mark Hutchinson and mining boss Dino Otranto will continue to be \ndual chief executives of Fortescue and report to Dr Forrest as executive chairman.\nWhile the top three at Fortescue will remain in place, the rapid turnover of senior executives has continued, with \nenergy executive Eva Hanly and marketing director Vivienne Tieu leaving the company.\nDual company secretary-general counsel Phil McKeiver has lost the company secretary role, in a move that \nappears to be driven by his handling of a bitter legal dispute with green iron rival Element Zero.\nFortescue hired private investigators to follow and monitor the former executives behind the Element Zero start-up \nand their families as part of a lawsuit over an alleged intellectual property breach.\nYesterday, Dr Forrest said no member of the Fortescue board had been aware of the strategy and the board \n\"struggled\" to align the actions with Fortescue's values.\nMr McKeiver had offered his resignation, but it had been rejected, the iron ore billionaire said.\n\"I'm proud of the guy for taking full responsibility.\"\nFortescue appointed Mona Gill as company secretary; Mr McKeiver will continue as general counsel.\nIron ore prices are predicted to slide over the next five years as new supply from Africa and Western Australia \nenters the market, but Dr Forrest said the job cuts were not driven by this.\n\"We're going to sadly lose around 4.5 per cent of our direct workforce, 3 per cent of our indirect workforce,\" he said \nof the proposed cuts.\n\"It's not a big number in percentage terms, but we still don't like doing it. But it's not to jam operating costs down, it \nis to streamline this organisation and keep the genius of simplicity.\"\nThe job cuts will affect Fortescue staff around the world and also add to the thousands of job losses in the \nAustralian resources sector this year at loss-making nickel mines, lithium mines and Alcoa's Kwinana alumina \nrefinery.\nYesterday, Fortescue appointed Apple Paget as chief financial officer of the combined group, ending the previous \nstructure where the mining and energy divisions had their own CFOs, such as former Reserve Bank deputy Guy \nDebelle, who lasted just 143 days.\nFormer Mineral Resources executive Shelley Robertson was named as Fortescue's chief operating officer.\nFortescue will continue to push ahead with three green hydrogen projects that were the subject of final investment \ndecisions last year; one in Arizona, one in the Pilbara, and a $US150 million venture near Gladstone, which will \nstart construction this year.Page 3 of 3\nLabor's hydrogen goal stalls as Fortescue trims ambitions\nFortescue said two more hydrogen projects in Norway and Brazil remained under consideration, and the \nNorwegian project was close to a final investment decision.\nDespite abandoning the 2030 hydrogen goal, Dr Forrest said Fortescue would eventually get to 15 million tonnes \nof hydrogen production and would retain its promise to have zero greenhouse gas emissions globally by 2030 \nwithout relying on carbon offsets. It bills its hydrogen as zero carbon.\nDr Hutchinson said Fortescue would continue to make hydrogen electrolysers at its Gladstone factory at a time \nwhen many customers were enduring long waits for electrolysers to be delivered.\nBut Fortescue's plan to retrofit Incitec Pivot's Gibson Island fertiliser plant near Brisbane into a low-carbon version \nof itself is on the backburner because of high electricity costs in Australia.\nLoad-Date: July 20, 2024\nEnd of Document",

But because Andrew Forrest and his \nleadership team spent the past three years waving away genuine concerns about the plans that were being \nexpressed by investors, market analysts, hydrogen and energy experts, and even the company's own staff - many \nof whom left in frustration well ahead of Wednesday's announcement.\nIn that time Fortescue has become increasingly erratic in its strategy and less tolerant of criticism - both internally \nand from the media and the investment community, as the company embraced the new vision of its founder and the \n\"creative chaos\" that came with it.\nYou cannot fault Forrest for his ambition, his commitment to innovation, and his attempt to try to drive a shift to \ngreen energy by bringing the scale of Fortescue's resources to bear on a problem others have found too difficult to \ngrapple with.\nHopefully some good will eventually come of all that frenzied work. But belief alone cannot defy reality, and it has \nbeen clear for some time that Fortescue took on more than it could ever handle - perhaps to the detriment of \nprojects that could have been achieved.\nPlenty of voices inside Fortescue have been saying that along the journey, but have been told to get with the \nprogram or leave.\nPage 2 of 2\nHumiliating move raises serious fears for our reputation\nThe reputational damage brought about by the retreat from this green foray is enormous, both to Fortescue and to \nother Australian companies operating overseas.\nForrest has spent the past four years touring developing nations making big promises about the jobs that green \nhydrogen will bring, and the economic transformation his company could help deliver to some of the poorest \ncountries in the world, if they give Fortescue access to their resources.\nFew, if any, of those promises will now be delivered - and that will not be easily forgotten the next time an Australian \ncompany rolls into town looking for support for a mining or energy project.\nMany investors will welcome Wednesday's backdown as offering hope the company will return its focus to the \nmining arm where it makes its money. But real questions still need to be asked about how the rest of the Fortescue \nboard did not reign in Forrest's green ambitions well before now.\nLoad-Date: July 17, 2024\nEnd of Document",

This is something which I genuinely believe in,\" he said today.\n\"It's a bit like, I don't know \u2026 antibiotics or penicillin. The world has to have it.\n\"We just have to work out now how to produce it cheaply enough.\"\nBringing down energy prices was a key challenge to achieving that, Mr Forrest said, adding he was still committed \nto eliminating all fossil fuels from Fortescue's operations by the end of the decade, which would help lower costs.\n\"So what we're doing is investing upstream, investing now into the generation of green electricity, pushing down the \nprice of power for the benefit of every punter in Australia,\" he clarified later in the day.\n\"And of course at the end of it when power prices really do come off then we'll have a very commercial form of \ngreen hydrogen which is absolutely essential to get into the world.\"\nRoy Green from the University of Technology Sydney said he was not surprised by Fortescue's decision to scrap \nthe target.\n\"While hydrogen as a technology \u2026 ultimately will have commercial application, it will certainly be part of our \nenergy mix, it may have been hyped up too much in the beginning in the sense that its costs were underestimated,\" \nhe said.\nRenewable energy expert and founder of clean technology news website Renew Economy, Giles Parkinson, said \nthose factors could lead to shareholder pressure.\n\"This is one of the problems about the whole sort of green energy transition is that [shareholders] say, 'OK great, \nyou're a leader but don't go so far out in front that we can't see you anymore, because then we kind of get worried \nabout returns,'\" he said.\n\"Investors and institutional shareholders unfortunately are so obsessed with returns and profits over the short \ntimeframe.\"\nRenewables crucial\nSunshine Hydro executive chairman Michael Myer says producing green hydrogen can be viable when it's done \nwith low-cost renewable energy.\nHe's told The Business his company is producing green hydrogen from wind, solar and pumped hydro, which is \nviable without the need for tax credits the government has on offer.\n\"I noted the commentary from the chairman of Fortescue saying that they're focusing now on the production of \nrenewable and clean energy, and that's the right place to start,\" Mr Myer said.\n\"But what you need to do is you need to be able to produce 24/7 carbon free energy.\n\"If you do that first and then you use that energy to produce hydrogen you can produce it very competitively.\"\nLabor's energy plan attackedPage 3 of 3\nAndrew Forrest downplays hit from Fortescue job cuts, saying 'Twiggy is not walking back from hydrogen'\nLiberal MPs have used Fortescue's decision to attack the federal government's support for green hydrogen, with \nthe opposition's spokesperson for climate change and energy, Ted O'Brien, declaring it blew \"a massive hole in \nLabor's energy plan\".\n\"Labor isn't interested in hydrogen. They want only green hydrogen \u2026 which basically means all eggs in one \nbasket,\" he said.\n\"We cannot as a nation put all our eggs in one basket. We need to have a balanced energy mix.\n\"Today's decision also points to the need for more gas. Labor says 'green hydrogen it will do everything'.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: CHANTICLEER; Pg. 40\nLength: 1194 words\nByline: James Thomson\nBody\nAndrew Forrest insists his green hydrogen dream is not over. Far from it.\nBut in the biggest shake-up of Fortescue's structure and strategy in several years, Forrest has put Fortescue's \nlong-held target of 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 on the backburner, and \"de-prioritised\" several \ngreen hydrogen projects in the $70 billion giant's pipeline.\nIn a series of moves that will be welcomed by investors, but provide more evidence of how the global energy \ntransition is spluttering, Fortescue will also slash 700 jobs by bringing its mining and energy divisions under one \nroof, eliminating duplication of corporate functions, and some layers of management.\nForrest will not countenance the idea that this is some sort of retreat or even a pivot; his determination to turn \nFortescue into what he calls the world's go-to company for green solutions - green metals, green energy and green \ntechnology - remains as strong as ever.\nBut the changes announced yesterday speak to both the reality of an energy transition that has been stalled by \ncost-of-living worries and rising energy prices caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle \nEast, and caution among some Fortescue investors about the prospective returns from the company's green \nenergy strategy.\nIn June, US fund manager Capital Group sold more than $1.4 billion of Fortescue shares, ceasing to be a \nsubstantial shareholder in a move some read as a reaction to Fortescue's strategic shift.\nForrest insists that the 15 million-tonne green hydrogen target remains a big part of Fortescue's ultimate plan, and \nhe's personally disappointed that the rest of the world - particularly the \"weenies\" in the traditional energy sector - \nare \"not seeing as clearly what I am seeing, which is that the world must turn away from fossil fuels\".\nBut in what will be music to the ears of the market, Forrest says the company is determined to maintain financial \ndiscipline.\nPage 2 of 3\nReality bites for Forrest's dream\n\"We are not going to swim against the tide,\" he says. \"The tide is the Australian government, every government, \nevery leader, every president, every energy minister I've met around the world in the last three years saying 'we've \ngot to get energy prices down'.\n\"Now, in that environment, you're not going to bring on major sources of green hydrogen, which relies on cheap \nenergy prices.\n\"We're going to stay where we know we can win, and that's green electricity. We'll be producing 15 million tonnes \n[of green hydrogen] and more. But to get there, we're going to make sure that the supply chain's right.\"\nThe pressure on the global green hydrogen sector is building. On Tuesday night, the European Court of Auditors \nreleased a report that found despite the European Union pumping (EURO)18.8 billion ($30.45 billion) into the \nsector, its target of importing 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 was unrealistic and \"not really founded \nupon the capacity at hand\".\nForrest remains a believer in the ability of green hydrogen to replace fossil fuel, but says Fortescue will not \"put the \nhorse behind the cart\" by pushing ahead with green hydrogen projects where the economics don't stack up due to \npersistently high electricity prices.\nGreen hydrogen projects on Fortescue's books, including in the US, Canada, the Democratic Republic of Congo \nand South Australia, will now be put on hold while the company pushes ahead with five key projects. Three of these \n- a $US550 million ($817 billion) liquefied green hydrogen facility in Arizona; its $US150 million Queensland plant at \nGladstone, which is aiming to produce green hydrogen next year; and its $US50 million green iron project at \nChristmas Creek in the Pilbara, which seeks to produce 1500 tonnes of green iron from green hydrogen - have \nalready been approved by the board and are under way.\nTwo more - a green hydrogen project in Norway and another in Brazil - are in the feasibility phase, but have now \nbeen prioritised because both countries have access to abundant, cheap, renewable energy.\nNo changes to Fortescue's capital expenditure forecasts were announced yesterday.\nThe announcement of 700 jobs cuts will not make for a very happy birthday for some at the company, which \ncelebrates the 21st anniversary of its founding today.\nBut Forrest, who says no management team ever likes announcing job losses, is adamant the redundancies do not \nreflect pressure on iron ore prices or the spluttering energy transition, but are instead part of an evolution of the \ngroup.\nIt was necessary, he says, to originally set Fortescue Energy up as a sort of internal start-up, with its own \ninfrastructure and teams. This was, in part, because the miner was \"fat and happy\" and some inside the company \ncould not see the need to shake up its highly successful mining business.\nBut with the two sides of the business now working closely together - particularly on the push to decarbonise \nFortescue's existing iron ore operations by 2030, a target Forrest clearly hopes to beat - he says the need for two \nsilos is gone.\n\"This is not to jam operating costs down, it's to streamline this organisation and keep the genius of simplicity,\" he \nsays.\nDespite the embrace of a \"one Fortescue\" model, Forrest will continue with two chief executives: metals boss Dino \nOtranto, and energy boss Mark Hutchinson.\nForrest says the leaders will be able to access resources as needed from a reshuffled corporate team led by chief \nfinancial officer Apple Paget (who moves into the role permanently after acting in the position since last August); \nchief operating officer Shelley Robertson (who has been promoted from chief corporate officer); and Mona Gill, who \nassumes the role of company secretary from Phil McKeiver.Page 3 of 3\nReality bites for Forrest's dream\nMcKeiver will retain the role of general counsel, but only after offering to resign following revelations that a law firm \nemployed by Fortescue had hired private investigators to follow former Fortescue executives and their families as \npart of an ugly legal spat with a rival start-up called Element Zero.\nForrest says the Fortescue board was not aware of the tactic and had struggled to see how it aligned with the \ncompany's values, but he is proud of McKeiver for taking responsibility. Forrest says Fortescue will continue to \npursue the legal action.\nThe Fortescue restructure takes place against the backdrop of pressure on iron ore prices, which have fallen more \nthan 30 per cent since the start of the year as China's economy continues to struggle.\nBut Forrest says Fortescue is struggling to keep up with what he says are full order books. And while the industry \nfrets about the arrival of new iron ore production from the Simandou mine in the African nation of Guinea, Forrest \nremains sanguine, arguing that Fortescue's prospective project in Gabon gives it the ability to tap a deposit of \nbetter quality and scale.\nBut the company's ultimate trump card could be green iron; this is where low-carbon solutions such as green \nhydrogen and solar energy are used to remove waste elements from iron ore, leaving behind a product that is \nalmost pure iron.\nIndeed, Forrest is so bullish on the plan that he declares he's getting out of iron ore and into green iron.\nJAMES THOMSON\nj.thomson@afr.com\nLoad-Date: July 20, 2024\nEnd of Document",

But because Andrew Forrest and his \nleadership team spent the past three years waving away genuine concerns about the plans that were being \nexpressed by investors, market analysts, hydrogen and energy experts, and even the company's own staff - many \nof whom left in frustration well ahead of Wednesday's announcement.\nIn that time Fortescue has become increasingly erratic in its strategy and less tolerant of criticism - both internally \nand from the media and the investment community, as the company embraced the new vision of its founder and the \n\"creative chaos\" that came with it.\nYou cannot fault Forrest for his ambition, his commitment to innovation, and his attempt to try to drive a shift to \ngreen energy by bringing the scale of Fortescue's resources to bear on a problem others have found too difficult to \ngrapple with.\nHopefully some good will eventually come of all that frenzied work. But belief alone cannot defy reality, and it has \nbeen clear for some time that Fortescue took on more than it could ever handle - perhaps to the detriment of \nprojects that could have been achieved.\nPlenty of voices inside Fortescue have been saying that along the journey, but have been told to get with the \nprogram or leave the company.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest backdown raises fears for reputation\nThe reputational damage brought about by the retreat from this green foray is enormous, both to Fortescue and to \nother Australian companies operating overseas.\nForrest has spent the past four years touring developing nations making big promises about the jobs that green \nhydrogen will bring, and the economic transformation his company could help deliver to some of the poorest \ncountries in the world, if they give Fortescue access to their resources.\nFew, if any, of those promises will now be delivered - and that will not be easily forgotten the next time an Australian \ncompany rolls into town looking for support for a mining or energy project.\nMany investors will welcome Wednesday's backdown as offering hope the company will return its focus to the \nmining arm where it makes its money.\nBut real questions still need to be asked about how the rest of the Fortescue board did not reign in Forrest's green \nambitions well before now.\nFortescue changes   700 jobs to go across global operations   Redundancies to be finalised this month   \nStreamlined executive team, comprising nearly 50% women   Apple Paget is the new chief financial officer   Shelley \nRobertson is the new chief operating officer   Navdeep Gill is the new company secretary\nLoad-Date: July 17, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The approach worked on his iron ore bet two \ndecades ago. This time with green hydrogen, the story couldn't be more different.\nAfter refusing to acknowledge any internal warning signs and critics from the energy industry, Forrest was \ndetermined to keep crashing through. Now reality has hit and his green energy ambitions have crashed \nspectacularly. There is more than a financial cost - much of which is yet to be quantified.\nFirstly, there's the emotional toll on the 700 employees from across Fortescue - including those that bought into the \ngreen energy dream - who are now set to be sacked.\nThe second is Andrew Forrest's credibility has taken a major hit. For more than two years, Fortescue has been full \nthrottle trying to turn Forrest's promise of green hydrogen into a commercial reality within years.\nHe talked a big game and travelled the world meeting governments, while handing out green MoUs like calling \ncards.\nInstead, as the economics sank in, with electricity costs surging, deadlines were pushed back and back The \nmission changed. Then there was a revolving door of executives.\nWith all the optics of a rare defeat, Forrest has finally moved away from his centrepiece promise of developing a \ncommercial green hydrogen export business by the end of the decade.\nInstead, Fortescue is again looking more like its bigger rivals BHP and Rio Tinto, with plans to switch to \nconventional renewables like wind, solar and storage and in-house development to help it meet its net zero targets \nby 2030, while building up business lines.\nRunning two Fortescues in parallel - one for mining and another for energy - will end, saving hundreds of millions in \ncosts.\nPage 2 of 3\nForrest's credibility hit by green hydrogen collapse\nEven with the much-welcomed streamlining, investors are still in the dark about financials and whether key \nexecutives in the energy adventure are staying.\nForrest on Tuesday was firmly standing by green hydrogen as a technology and promised that Fortescue would \nbring it to market as the economics became more favourable. So too with his commitment to decarbonisation, \nwhere he has already spent more than $1bn. \"I am not giving up on hydrogen at all,\" Forrest tells The Australian. \n\"The green electricity price just keeps heading north, and it's been dragged up by the fossil fuel price. We're not \npivoting away. We're going upstream to get the green electrons at the right price.\" He says the benefits of the spend \nare spread through Fortescue, which now has a product division for battery-powered trucks, with trains and ships \npowered with green energy in development. He is developing inputs for green fertilizer as well as trialling a green \niron plant in the Pilbara to make purer ore.\n\"These are each multipliers of market cap. They're not adders to market cap. They're big movers, and that's all \ncome about because the company's pushing to hydrogen, and all of those are ripe.\" Still, the sheer chaos of the \nadventure was like watching a start-up burn bright and then implode, and Fortescue's board needs to remind itself \nit is a top 10 company with thousands of workers. Whether it likes it or not it has an army of stakeholders - \ngovernments, investors and customers.\nOut of corporate failure there usually come some valuable -lessons. But the Forrest show has likely put the global \nquest for green hydrogen back years. If Forrest, with all his substantial resources and connections, couldn't pull it \noff, others will think twice about investing in the technology.\nNo customers For Forrest, the problems were multi-faceted.\nHe was trying to develop an over-the-horizon technology for product that didn't have any customers ready to go.\nAnd as he discovered, it didn't have the green energy sources at the scale needed to make the raw material.\nThe rule of thumb is that more energy goes into producing hydrogen than what hydrogen offers. That's why Forrest \nneeded to pin down an energy source, and lots of it. Surging power prices made that even harder.\nEven if Forrest had a breakthrough on the technology of producing hydrogen from water, it simply wouldn't be \neconomical at today's prices.\nEssentially Forrest was solving the answer to a riddle that belonged to a different question.\nAt the peak of Forrest's hydrogen push, energy players were casting doubts, while Australia's biggest steelmaker, \nBlueScope, loudly warned that the technology was a long way from reality.\nBlueScope boss Mark Vassella had sweated the numbers as he was embarking on his own green steel road map \nahead of his $1.1bn upgrade of its Port Kembla blast furnace.\nBlueScope was a potential customer and here Vassella couldn't find a commercial case for hydrogen to be used in \nthe blast furnace.\nVassella's No.1 problem was the extremely high energy intensity needed to run the furnace, which he \nconservatively estimated to be 15 times BlueScope's existing energy needs.\nBlueScope is now joining with BHP and Rio Tinto to develop an electric smelting furnace - a process that also relies \non vast amounts of electricity but doesn't need hydrogen.\nBig promise Hydrogen is classic Forrest play - big ambition, and promising something that changes the world.\nBut we should ask whether the business of hydrogen fits the business of Forrest. It is methodical manufacturing and \nrequires buckets of patience. The Japanese government and electricity conglomerates have been working quietly \nbut seriously for decades at solving the hydrogen puzzle.Page 3 of 3\nForrest's credibility hit by green hydrogen collapse\nAll without fanfare.\nForrest promised he could do it and be a global exporter by the end of decade. A surprising number even believed \nhim.\nNo one knows the true financial cost of the green adventure, given transparency was sorely lacking, although next \nmonth's accounts release should shed some light.\nForrest still has dozens of green plans in train, with pilot plants under way and a push to build a green energy \nexpressway from Morocco into Europe.\nHe is also ready to hit \"real net zero\" emissions (without the buy in of carbon credits) for the end of the decade.\nThe promises are still big, but who is going to buy in?\nAI hype?\nInfluential stock picker David Paradice might have some leftover change - some $500,000 - aboard the runaway \nNvidia train, but his own team are going to need more convincing about the benefits of artificial intelligence.\nWhile AI has been the power story on Wall Street, driving names like Microsoft, Amazon and even Nvidia to fresh \nrecord highs, Paradice's own managers have called out the hype behind the tech.\n\"It is not clear to us that at this juncture the monetisation or productivity improvements from AI justifies the hype and \nvery extensive rerating of AI-exposed stocks,\" Paradice's large cap manager Troy Angus has told the $14.5bn fund \nmanager's clients.\nAngus also remains cautious on Australian stocks, tipping a possible interest rate hike here next month, based on \nstrong data around consumption and inflation.\nHe believes the Reserve Bank could be underestimating the impact of strong migration, fiscal stimulus and, \nimportantly, the \"lagged effect\" of EBA agreements which is likely to sustain higher wage inflation and therefore \nspending for some time.\nParadice's Australian Equity Fund posted returns of 12.77 per cent for the year, coming in just below the \nbenchmark S&P/ASX 200 (total return). The fund continues to outperform on three and five-year horizons.\nIn recent weeks Paradice has sold off BHP on a weaker China outlook. But Paradice was not a supporter of the \nmining giant's $65bn bid for Anglo American, which it ultimately abandoned in May after its advances were rejected.\nThe fund also kept the pressure on Qantas, recently meeting new director Nora Scheinkestel who is also in charge \nof the airline's board remuneration committee. Here the issue of nearly $15m in long-term bonus payments to \nformer Qantas boss Alan Joyce was raised - and the prospect of recovery. johnstone@theaustralian.com.au\nLoad-Date: July 18, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Months later, they temporarily edged above $100 per share for the first time since White had \nco-founded the company with Maree Isaacs in 1994.\nWiseTech has never made a loss - and 85 per cent of its 3500 employees globally own shares in it thanks to an \nemployee share scheme.\nAlan Wilson & Peter Wilson\nRank: 2 & 6\nCompany: Reece\nShareholding: $9.03 billion & $3.02 billion\nPage 2 of 4\n\" THE 10 WEALTHIEST EXECUTIVES IN THE ASX 300 REVEALED\nPlumbing parts maker Reece Group boosted net profit after tax by 20 per cent in the first half of last financial year.\nThe solid result shocked analysts as it came after the company warned shareholders last August that it expected to \nsell fewer products and experience margin pressure in the months ahead.\nSenior reporter Jonathan Shapiro said the result raised questions about Reece's adherence to the continuous \ndisclosure rules, as the company provided no trading updates before reporting profits that far exceeded market \nexpectations.\nNevertheless, executive director Alan Wilson climbed one spot on this year's list after the value of his company \nshareholding increased by 36 per cent to $9.03 billion.\nHis son, Peter, who has been chief executive of the family business since 2008, also made the top 10 for the first \ntime after it was announced in May that he would also replace Alan as executive chair from November.\nPeter's shareholding was worth $3.02 billion on June 30.\nAndrew Forrest\nRank: 3\nCompany: Fortescue Metals Group\nShareholding: $8.95 billion\nAndrew Forrest, executive chairman of Fortescue Metals Group and the eighth-richest person in Australia, dropped \nto third place on this year's Rich Bosses list after the value of his Fortescue shareholding fell by roughly $300 \nmillion.\nForrest had already conceded first place to White last year after the terms of his divorce left him with fewer \nFortescue shares than his ex-wife Nicola. The couple also transferred $5 billion of Fortescue shares to their \nMindaroo Foundation last June. The company's share price dropped 6.2 per cent last financial year as lower iron \nore prices offset an earlier rally that had taken the stock to record highs. But it still ended the financial year 137 per \ncent higher than it did in 2019.\nMore recently, Forrest made headlines when he was photographed kissing a woman on the streets of Paris in May. \nMoroccan Energy Minister Leila Benali, who sits on the board of one of Fortescue's joint ventures in the North \nAfrican country, later denied she was the woman in the picture.\nThe iron ore miner also became embroiled in a spying scandal that involved 19 days of surveillance by private \ninvestigators of the homes and families of three former Fortescue employees.\nFortescue had accused them of copying and stealing its intellectual property when they left to start rival green iron \nbusiness Element Zero.\nSam Hupert and\nAnthony Hall\nRank: 4 & 5\nCompany: Pro Medicus\nShareholding: $3.74 billion each\nHealthcare software developer Pro Medicus was the best-performing stock on the ASX 200 last financial year, \ndelivering shareholders a return of 118.7 per cent after a record year of new contract wins.Page 3 of 4\n\" THE 10 WEALTHIEST EXECUTIVES IN THE ASX 300 REVEALED\nThat meant the value of co-founders Sam Hupert and Anthony Hall's respective shareholdings more than doubled \nto $3.74 billion each.\nThe company's flagship Visage software enables radiologists to view reports and image files generated by X-rays \nand other medical scans on their mobile devices.\nHall and Hupert set up the company in 1983 and floated its stock in 2000 at $1.15 a piece. Last month, the share \nprice temporarily surpassed $140.\nMichael and Matt Heine\nRank: Joint 7th\nCompany: Netwealth Group\nShareholding: $2.67 billion\nNetwealth, the wealth company that Michael Heine registered in 1999, reported record inflows of $22 billion last \nfinancial year as it took its total funds under management to $88 billion.\nMichael's son, Matt, became sole managing director when Michael moved from joint managing director to executive \ndirector in 2022. The value of their combined shareholdings increased by almost $900 million last financial year to \n$2.67 billion.\nGerry Harvey\nRank: 9\nCompany: Harvey Norman\nShareholding: $1.73 billion\nRetailer Harvey Norman reported a 45.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profit in the first half of last financial year, as gloomy \nconsumers weighed down by interest rate hikes and stubbornly high inflation pulled back on spending.\nYet, the company's share price still rose by about 20 per cent, boosting the value of executive chairman Gerry \nHarvey's shareholding by more than $300 million.\nIn an interview after the company's first-half results in February, Harvey said he was feeling more optimistic about \nthe outlook than he was last year despite the large profit drop.\n\"So many more people are in the country, and they have all got to have a bed and a fridge,\" he said. \"If interest \nrates drop a bit, inflation drops, consumer confidence picks up and big tax cuts are coming.\"\nGreg Goodman\nRank: 10\nCompany: Goodman Group\nShareholding: $1.51 billion\nGreg Goodman has had a good year.

If you wait for a boom to invest, you're going to be bringing your product on \nin a bust,\" Dr Forrest said. \"No, I would not recalibrate (government policy).\" Ahead of an election where the major \nparties will present radically different pathways to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, Anthony Albanese \nprovided an assurance on Thursday that \"our energy plan is on track\" and Labor was \"getting on with the job\".\nDr Forrest said he would not change the way the company -approached its energy strategy, despite Fortescue's \ngreen-energy arm racking up more than $US1.44bn ($2.1bn) in losses over the past four years with little in the way \nof commercial returns.\nThe Fortescue restructure - under which 700 jobs will be cut - was seized on by the Coalition as evidence that \nLabor was \"picking losers\" by allocating billions of dollars in production tax credits for green-hydrogen producers.\nOpposition climate and -energy spokesman Ted O'Brien said the announcement had \"blown a gaping hole in the -\nAlbanese Labor government's energy plans\" and elevated the importance of gas. But he stopped short of \nrenouncing the viability of the emerging industry.\n\"We remain optimistic about the success of hydrogen in the long term playing a role in our -future energy mix but \nwe will not follow Labor's mistake of putting all its eggs in one basket,\" Mr O'Brien said.\nPage 2 of 2\nPullback Twiggy pushes tax credits\nAs part of its flagship Future Made in Australia plan, the -government provided a budget allocation of $6.7bn to \nprovide a $2 incentive for every kilogram of green hydrogen produced from 2027-28. It also committed $1.3bn for \nnew projects under the Hydrogen Headstart program.\nThe Prime Minister said Labor was encouraging investment. He said its policies would \"reward success\" because \nthe tax credits would only kick in once projects were realised. \"I tell you what's not real: -nuclear reactors,\" Mr \nAlbanese said on Thursday. \"There is no plan for how they (the Coalition) get around the (nuclear) bans which are \nthere.\" Australian Hydrogen Council chief executive Fiona Simon estimated that governments - state and federal - \nhad earmarked at least $12bn for hydrogen over the next 13 years. But she noted the US was offering a more \nappealing production tax credit than Australia: $US3 for every kilogram of green hydrogen.\nResponding to the Fortescue decision, Dr Simon acknowledged that an announcement involving staff cuts was \n\"going to be a blow\" but argued that confidence in the sector had not been shaken. \"(It) confirms what we've all \nbeen talking about for a while, which is that it's really hard to get hydrogen projects up. But ... it doesn't mean that \nall projects don't work,\" she said.\nDr Forrest said Fortescue planned to invest in renewable energy to bring energy costs down and make -hydrogen \nexports commercially feasible \"I wouldn't change anything about the government's commitment,\" he said. \n\"Companies like Fortescue will start deploying very low-cost, very low-risk capital into increasing electricity \ngeneration, because there's a very strong opportunity there.\" Dr Finkel, said green hydrogen could replace coal as \na chemical--reducing agent in the production of iron, but acknowledged its viability was \"highly dependent\" on the \ncosts of renewable electricity.\nHe said the goal should be to start producing green hydrogen at about $2 a kilogram, \"which would require the \nelectricity that is used to make the hydrogen to be less than about $30 per megawatt hour - which is very cheap.\" \n\"Worldwide, customers using iron or steel for railroad lines or building construction - they are not prepared to pay a \nlarge premium for green iron,\" he said. \"We need to get the costs down eventually towards the costs of existing iron \nand steel making.\" Dr Finkel and Superpower -Institute chair Rod Sims said green hydrogen - produced by cracking \nwater into hydrogen and oxygen through zero-emissions technologies - offered a fresh -opportunity for Australia to \ncombine its comparative advantages in iron ore and renewable energy.\nProfessor Sims said exporting hydrogen was \"incredibly\" expensive. \"You make the green hydrogen in Australia \nand you double the cost to send it overseas,\" he said. \"We've got the renewable energy sources to make green \nhydrogen. That's why Australia is the best place in the world to make green iron.\" Dr Finkel said that, in addition to \nlowering electricity prices, the government should make -legislative reforms to fast-track -approvals for renewable \nprojects key to producing green hydrogen.\nEDITORIAL P10 BUSINESS P13\nLoad-Date: July 18, 2024\nEnd of Document",

So if we can go to carbon-free iron ore, and carbon-free metals, we will make \nmuch, much better returns on this sunk capital we already have than just selling into the National Electricity Market \non the east coast - but if those opportunities arise, we're going to take them.\" Building solar and wind to power the \ncompany's Pilbara iron ore operations is a key part of Fortescue's goal of achieving \"real zero\" emissions by 2030 - \na goal Dr Forrest says the company is \"absolutely\" committed to.\nBut even that will require substantial capital spending and, while Fortescue's retreat from its hydrogen ambitions \nwas welcomed by market analysts on Thursday, MST Marquee analyst Saul Kavonic said the company might also \nbe forced to accept its 2030 zero-emissions target is unrealistic.\n\"This signals Fortescue Future Industries has failed. Despite the overwhelming evidence it would be unviable from \nthe get-go, Fortescue persisted with its green hydrogen ambitions, spending hundreds of millions and lambasting \ncritics, until only now finally admitting defeat,\" Mr Kavonic said.\n\"Fortescue's 2030 zero-emissions target should prove to be the next stubborn ambition they wind back, as it also \nappears im-possible.\" Fortescue executives who raised concerns about the mogul's green hydrogen ambitions \ndeserved an apology, Mr Kavonic added.\n\"Fortescue Future Industries has become the Fortescue Future Failure. Its failure was seen as inevitable by most \nfolks in the energy industry from the start, given how uncompetitive green hydrogen economics are. It's remarkable \nthat Fortescue took so long to figure it out themselves,\" Mr -Kavonic said. \"All the Fortescue leaders and staff who \nwere pushed out for telling the truth about Fortescue's green hydrogen ambitions deserve an apology.\" UBS \nanalyst Lachlan Shaw said in a client note that Fortescue's hydrogen retreat was welcome, given expectations the \nhydrogen strategy would suck up cash as the iron ore price retreated later this decade.\n\"We had long been cautious about green hydrogen on better alternatives,\" he said. \"\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The capital discipline \nimplied in the narrowing and slowing of Fortescue's push into green hydrogen is welcome.\" Fortescue shares \nclosed down 32c to $22.04 on Thursday.\nLoad-Date: July 18, 2024\nEnd of Document",

If increasing gas \nsupply was critical yesterday, it is absolutely essential today as the hopes that green hydrogen can play a role in \nsupporting supply fades. We remain optimistic about the success of hydrogen in the long-term playing a role in our \nfuture energy mix, but we will not follow Labor's mistake.\"\nWhile Dr Forrest is the highest-profile advocate for green hydrogen, the government points out he was not the only \nplayer, with more than 100 clean hydrogen projects in Australia, including 13 already operating and 17 under \nconstruction.\n\"Australia has more than 50 companies actively progressing renewable hydrogen project investment, making our \ncurrent clean hydrogen pipeline amongst the largest globally, valued at more than $225 billion,\" Climate Change \nMinister Chris Bowen said.\n\"This underpins strong collaborative relationships with export partners who are keen to receive Australia's green \nhydrogen in coming years.\nPage 2 of 2\nPM stays with hydrogen despite Fortescue retreat\n\"Green hydrogen will be one of the best ways Australia can decarbonise domestic heavy emitters and help develop \nrobust low carbon manufacturing, and industry.\n'The government is committed to working alongside commercial interests to deliver on this potential.\"\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese insisted his government's energy plan remained on track.\n\"We want to make sure that we deliver the clean energy that Australia needs and that when coal-fired power \nstations close, as they've announced their closure, there isn't a gap in the energy security that Australia needs,\" he \nsaid. \"That's why we need a real plan that's fully costed, and that's being rolled out with the certainty being provided \nfor investment.\"\nClimate Energy Finance director Tim Buckley said Dr Forrest was not alone in betting big on green hydrogen as \npart of the energy transition but costs had, in fact, gone up instead of following the usual pattern of better \naffordability for clean technology such as batteries, solar panels and electric vehicles.\n\"Twiggy went way too hard, way too fast and way too hyped about hydrogen,\" Mr Buckley said.\n\"Australia put out like 50 per cent of the world's press releases of hydrogen in the last five years but none of them \nhave come to fruition.\"\nWith Australian coal and gas exports to decline as the world decarbonises, Mr Buckley expressed doubt green \nhydrogen would be able to fill the void, pointing out the first ship capable of transporting chilled hydrogen at scale \nwas at least 10 years away.\nHe said green hydrogen's value was helping Australian resources companies to pivot to value-adding, such as \nprocessing critical minerals and producing strategic metals such as green steel.\nThe Superpower Institute, led by Rod Sims and Ross Garnaut, has warned it will be difficult for Australia to become \na major player in green iron production without a green hydrogen industry.\nThe institute estimates the annual export value of green iron to be $295 billion, or three times the current value of \niron ore exports.\n\"Green aluminium exports could be worth an additional $60 billion, compared with the current value of bauxite and \nalumina exports of $10 billion,\" it said in a report now sitting with the Department of Industry.\nMr Sims argues the government should double down on the hydrogen production tax incentive by introducing \ncapital grants of 50 per cent or equivalent tax credits for the first movers who build green iron plants.\nThe former ACCC boss had no issue if that meant Fortescue qualified for green iron support on top green \nhydrogen handouts.\n\"He could be helping Australia to start a $300 billion industry,\" Mr Sims said. \"And yet, if we don't help him, he won't \ndo it. So this isn't just money for someone who's going to do something anyway.\"\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The lawsuit made headlines when it was revealed \nFortescue had hired private investigators to follow and photograph the Element Zero executives and their families.\nThe stakes are high for Fortescue, which even after this week's austerity drive and 700 job cuts, has a bevy of \ntrials and projects under way into various embryonic clean energy technologies.\nDr Forrest has denied prior knowledge of the plan to use private investigators, and said Fortescue directors had \nstruggled to align the surveillance tactics with the company's values.\nGeneral counsel Phil McKeiver offered his resignation over the incident, but has been retained by Fortescue, albeit \nwithout his previous responsibility as company secretary.\nBut despite distancing himself from the private investigation tactics, Dr Forrest endorsed the decision to pursue \nElement Zero through the courts.\n\"There is an overarching message here: you're not going to be paid to develop technology with a whole heap of \nother people, at really serious risk and cost to the entire company and your workmates ... and then send that \ntechnology to another email address and think that's OK,\" he said.\n\"That's not OK.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nElement Zero execs burnt bridges: Forrest\nDr Forrest appeared to reference evidence tendered to the Federal Court in Fortescue's June 17 claim, where it \naccused Dr Winther-Jensen of sending technical documents about green iron research from his Fortescue email to \na personal email account.\nDr Forrest said the Element Zero team had burned the bridges behind them \"like the Nazis pulling out of Poland\".\n\"You want to send emails full of our data over there then eliminate it, you'll be held to the full responsibility of the \nlaw,\" he said.\nDr Kolodziejczyk was born in the Polish city of Rzeszow, according to Australian Securities and Investments \nCommission filings.\nA spokesman for Element Zero declined to comment on Dr Forrest's warning.\n\"We are not going to be drawn into responding to these comments. We look forward to these matters being \ndetermined through the court process,\" he said.\nMr Masterman has been one of Dr Forrest's closest allies over the past quarter of a century, working for both \nFortescue and some private entities linked to the Forrest family.\nMr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk were among the inner circle of trusted executives who travelled around the \nworld with Dr Forrest in 2020 collecting rights to clean energy projects.\nThe fight with Element Zero over \"green iron\" technology is timely, given Dr Forrest's latest long-term vision for \nFortescue is to eventually cease selling hematite iron ore, and instead use green hydrogen and other techniques to \nstrip out impurities and sell only the pure \"green iron\" left behind.\n\"We're getting out of iron ore, which is very interesting because we're going, as soon as we can ... to green metal,\" \nDr Forrest said on Wednesday, when Fortescue conceded it would not achieve his previous goal of producing 15 \nmillion tonnes of hydrogen a year by 2030.\nFortescue will start construction this year on a $US50 million ($74.2 million) green iron facility at its Christmas \nCreek iron ore hub in the Pilbara.\nDr Forrest said such projects would consume green hydrogen in the future, even if demand for the commodity as a \nfuel source from other companies was not as strong as Fortescue had hoped.\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Andrew Forrest removed one of \nthem, yet no one's paying attention.\nThe most surprising thing on the ASX yesterday was the way investors overlooked Fortescue's big news. Its \npromise to get back to its leaner and meaner roots and ease off its green energy expansion had the stock down 1.2 \nper cent in afternoon trade, while brokers barely mentioned it in their morning notes.\nHaving heard sell-side analysts consistently poke holes in the hydrogen story - the technology, the rollout, the cost - \nand listened to fund managers talk about Fortescue spending iron ore cash flows on an unproven business and \nwatching its cost base grow, we thought the wind-back would be welcome.\nIn theory, it's a reset that could return Fortescue to its glory days in 2018 and 2019, when just about every extra $1 \nmillion in revenue fell through to the earnings before interest and tax line and its dividend machine started.\nThe job cuts and statement could also dispel fears about Fortescue's energy unit spending $1 billion or so a year in \nthe near term with no clear path to revenue or earnings.\nInstead, it was met with crickets and yesterday's share price drop. There were nervy buyers in early trade, and no \ninstant gratification for what we thought was a pretty significant announcement.\nPerhaps the most telling thing was the way sell-side analysts largely ignored the news. Macquarie's team had a \nclose look, and upped its near-term earnings per share forecasts by 20 er cent, but none of the other 15 analysts in \nBloomberg's survey had re-cut the numbers by lunchtime. UBS, not in Bloomberg's survey for the past few years \nand which called the hydrogen news \"unsurprising\", published a brief 1-pager.\nSo what's going on? It's either something simple or much more serious, depending on who you ask.\nThe simple theory is that the school holidays have sucked plenty of money managers and analysts away from their \ndesks, significantly cutting active fund domestic institution trading volumes and quant money that factors in things \nsuch as broker earnings upgrades/downgrades.\nPage 2 of 2\nNo sugar hit from Fortescue backflip Closing Bell\nThat is true, but we still see share prices go up and down on small volumes, so while it may explain the lack of \nanalyst interest, we're not sure if it explains the muted share price response.\nWorse for Fortescue would be if it shows institutional investors and all those analysts with hold/sell \nrecommendations (all 16 of them in Bloomberg's survey) are materially more concerned by the company's other big \nissues. Time will tell. One day's trade does not make or break Fortescue's strategy, but the muted response can \nstill be interesting.\nThe two other issues are the iron ore price - a perennial question that has flared up given what's going on in China \nand the arrival of Rio Tinto-backed Simandou into the market from 2026 - and Fortescue's leadership team which, \nwhile under executive chairman Forrest and his co-CEOs Dino Otranto and Mark Hutchinson, has experienced a lot \nof turnover.\nBoth come up in our talks with Australian fund managers, including the big industry funds and the domestic long-\nonly crowd, and are long-term issues that cannot be addressed or overcome with one announcement.\nThe price of iron ore is Fortescue's core earnings driver, while its leadership team and governance framework is \nimportant to its long-term value creation for shareholders. Wednesday afternoon's announcement had three more \nexecutive team appointments: Apple Paget to chief financial officer (from acting CFO), chief corporate officer \nShelley Robertson to chief operating officer and Navdeep (Mona) Gill to company secretary (from assistant \ncompany secretary).\nIn the short term, the other thing on fund managers' minds is whether there may be some residual selling from long-\ntime Fortescue-backed Capital Group, a US funds management giant that was a substantial shareholder for close \nto a decade.\nCapital sold a monster $1.1 billion line of Fortescue shares in June, and dipped below the substantial mark days \nlater. It still has at least a few billion dollars invested in the $70 billion iron ore miner.\nSometimes investors hold off from buying after these blocks, thinking there may be more stock to shake loose at \ndiscounted prices. The block also showed there was not a lot of domestic interest in Fortescue; brokers reckon the \nstock was largely acquired offshore.\nWhatever the case, Forrest and Co have more work to do selling this story to the institutional investor community. \nWhile they're the sort of pack that likes to prove the doubters wrong, it does not hurt to have a few friends out there \nor at least ones that take notice of potentially meaningful strategic pivots.\nFrom the muted reaction, we cannot help to think it's a bit of a \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" when it \ncomes to green hydrogen.\nWhile investors bagged it when Forrest was trying to ram it out, they seem to be paying little attention now he has \ntaken his foot off the accelerator. They're more interested in the iron price.\nWhat's the long-term sustainable iron ore price? You'd be hard-pressed to find too many reputable markets people \nto say it is materially more than yesterday's $US105 a tonne.\nIf it does go south, absent this green hydrogen business we've heard a lot about recently, where does Fortescue's \nshare price go? That's why there are so many \"sell\" calls on the stock and the problem today.\nLoad-Date: July 21, 2024\nEnd of Document",

So what does it mean for green \nhydrogen?Get our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast\nBody\nThe iron ore billionaire Andrew Forrest has long vowed to transform Australia\u2019s energy landscape with green \nhydrogen made from renewable energy, even turning up to 2023\u2019s Cop28 in a ship dubbed the \u201cGreen Pioneer\u201d. \nBut pundits wondered whether the green dream had come crashing down to reality after Fortescue announced this \nweek  that it was cutting 700 jobs across its businesses globally as it seeks to remain \u201clean\u201d, with an unspecific \nnumber going in its energy unit.\nHere we look at the emerging green hydrogen industry and the headwinds \u2013 and tailwinds \u2013 it faces.\n                   What is green hydrogen?                   \nHydrogen, as fans of the periodic table recall, is the simplest element and most abundant in the universe. It makes \nup about 73% of the sun\u2019s mass and one-tenth of yours.\nRefineries use hydrogen to crack heavy oil into petrol and diesel, and to make ammonia for fertiliser. It is also an \nimportant energy store that might one day displace gas or other fossil fuels, used for everything from power \ngeneration to metal production and heavy transport.\nBut hydrogen usually needs to be split from other elements and that takes energy. According to the International \nEnergy Agency, hydrogen production and use was linked to 900m tonnes of C02 emissions in 2022, or about twice \nthat of Australia\u2019s total.\nThe source of the energy used to split hydrogen is categorised into up to a dozen colours. \nPage 2 of 3\nIs Andrew Forrest\u2019s energy dream in peril? The future of green hydrogen in Australia explained\nCSIRO highlights a few,  with green hydrogen extracted without greenhouse gas emissions, usually via \nelectrolysers that are powered by wind, solar or hydro.\nSo-called blue hydrogen uses steam to separate hydrogen from natural gas, with resulting emissions sequestered. \nIf they aren\u2019t, it\u2019s grey hydrogen. If coal is used (as the Japanese have been eyeing in Victoria  ), it\u2019s brown or black, \ndepending on the type of coal. There\u2019s also \u201cpink hydrogen\u201d if nuclear power is the energy source.\n                   Is Fortescue quitting the green hydrogen scene?                   \nFortescue said it \u201cremains resolute in its commitment to be the world\u2019s leading green technology, energy and \nmetals company with a laser focus on achieving Real Zero [ by cutting 90%  of emissions] by 2030\u201d.\nThe cost cuts relate to combining the metals and energy divisions into one \u201cto simplify its structure, remove \nduplication and deliver cost efficiencies\u201d.\n\u201cWe are by no means winding back on our commitment to green hydrogen,\u201d Forrest said in a statement provided to \nGuardian Australia. \u201cIn fact, we are doing all we can to back green hydrogen in Australia by investing in renewable \nenergy and hydrogen technology every single day.\n\u201cThe price of power remains a challenge in Australia, and this has been caused by fossil fuels and the subsidies \nprovided for fossil fuels.\u201d \nAccording to the investment bank UBS, Fortescue\u2019s proposed green ammonia plant  at Queensland\u2019s Gibson \nIsland needs electricity to cost $20-$30 per megawatt hour to be viable but recent long-term contracts for large wind \nand solar farms are offering $70-$90 per MWh power.\nThose price gaps must close if hopes for \u201cgreen steel\u201d or other green metals that use hydrogen are to be realised.\nAGL Energy, meanwhile, confirmed on Friday that Fortescue was ending plans to produce hydrogen at the site of \nits defunct Liddell coal-fired power station. \u201cAGL remains committed to exploring options to produce green hydrogen \nand future fuels at the Hunter [Valley] site in the future if economically feasible,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nUBS has a \u201csell\u201d call on Fortescue shares, predicting they have at least another 10% to fall (building on the 25%-\nplus fall in 2024 so far). A big reason for the dip is falling iron ore prices as China\u2019s demand cools \u2013 unrelated to \nFortescue\u2019s hydrogen hopes.\n                   What are governments doing?                   \nThe government will offer a tax credit to subsidise green hydrogen as part of its Future Made in Australia  scheme. \nProducers will receive a $2/kg \u201cincentive\u201d for up to 10 years \u2013 between mid-2027 and mid-2040 \u2013 for projects \nreaching final investment signoff by 2030.\nStates, too, are chipping in. South Australia, for instance, has a $500m hydrogen jobs plan  that includes $100m \nstate and federal support for the Port Bonython Hydrogen Hub  that aims to produce green hydrogen-related \nexports from 2030.\nNew South Wales, meanwhile, will offer as much as $3bn to lure similar ventures to that state, with a 2030 \u201cstretch \ntarget\u201d of 111,000 tonnes a year of green hydrogen output and 700 megawatts of electrolyser capacity.\nBut other nations are spending much more. The US\u2019s inflation reduction act may end up topping $1UStn ($A1.5tn) \nfor decarbonising programs, including hydrogen and electric vehicles among others.\nFortescue cuts were likely related to missing out on being shortlisted for the first $2bn  of the $4bn federal \ngovernment\u2019s \u201chydrogen headstart\u201d scheme, one source added.\n                   What does the hydrogen industry think?                   Page 3 of 3\nIs Andrew Forrest\u2019s energy dream in peril? The future of green hydrogen in Australia explained\nInsiders say much climate action hinges on \u201ccost-effective\u201d renewable energy, not just the green hydrogen industry.\nSo-called blue hydrogen might be a near-term solution to make the product cheap enough to foster greater demand \nbut \u201cit\u2019s better for the planet if we went straight to green\u201d, one source said.\nFiona Simon, chief executive of the Australian Hydrogen Council, said Fortescue\u2019s move was \u201cless about hydrogen \nthan it is about one company and how it\u2019s sought to reassess its priorities\u201d.\nThat said, \u201cwe\u2019ve all known that hydrogen was difficult, and in the last two or three years [experience has shown] \nthat is harder than we thought\u201d, Simon said. \u201cIt certainly doesn\u2019t signal the death of hydrogen.\u201d\nScaling up the production of electrolysers that use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen will help drive \ndown costs, she said.\nBy some estimates, hydrogen costs would need to drop to about $US2/kg ($A3/kg) to be competitive. One recent \nUS government study  puts present costs at $US12 to $16/kg when delivery costs are included.\n                   What next?                   \nThe International Energy Agency estimates global hydrogen demand reached 95m tonnes in 2022, rising about 3% \nthat year. Low-emissions sources of the fuel accounted for just 0.7% of demand.\nMinh Le, global head of hydrogen for analysts Rystad Energy, said that \u201cas things stand at the moment it will be \nvery challenging, if not almost impossible to reach $2 [US] for green hydrogen\u201d.\nStill, \u201cthe momentum of hydrogen development remains strong\u201d, with \u201cmany major auctions in key regions\u201d coming \nthrough this year in Europe, Japan and elsewhere, he said.\nFalling battery costs add to the competitive pressures in areas such as transport. At 14 times lighter than air, \nhydrogen is leaky \u2013 with safety issues  \u2013 and not yet barbecue ready. \nRystad Energy\u2019s Nigel Rambhujun said \u201ca lot more work can be done on demand-side policies to incentivise \npotential end-users and reduce the green premium associated with clean hydrogen\u201d with the next 6-12 months \n\u201ccritical\u201d for the sector in Australia.\n\u201cWithout significant government support, green hydrogen will continue to be the most expensive hydrogen colour.\u201d\nLoad-Date: July 19, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Forrest has made the difficult decision to scale back his green hydrogen initiatives, citing difficulties \nwith the commercial viability of the project.\nThis prudent business decision raises an important question: if green hydrogen projects are not currently viable for \nprivate investors such as Forrest, why should Australian taxpayers be expected to shoulder the financial risk? The \ndiscrepancy between Forrest's public advocacy and private actions signals the need for a thorough reassessment \nof taxpayer investments in green hydrogen.\nPublic funds should be allocated prudently, ensuring that investments are both economically viable and beneficial \nfor the broader community, not for billionaires' business interests.\nDon McMillan, Paddington, Qld\nFriday's editorial (\"Hydrogen rush is hitting reality\", 19/7) clearly sets out what the federal government should be in \nrelation to Australia's ongoing energy supply. Opposition energy spokesman Ted O'Brien says: \"Hydrogen was a \ngood example of why governments should avoid trying to pick winners and instead diversify the risk for taxpayers.\" \nThe current Coalition stance is effectively that we must leave our options open.\nWe know from our own and overseas experience that energy technology is developing rapidly. In practical terms, \nwe are increasingly seeing new energy supply opportunities revealed. I would like to think we are a fairly pragmatic \ncountry when it comes to the uptake of new technologies.\nAs your editorial says, \"The responsible thing to do is to safeguard electricity supplies using known technologies \nwhile alternatives are properly evaluated.\" We certainly have the skills and political nous to make long-term \ndecisions for the benefit of all Australians.\nJohn Houghton, The Gap, Qld\nPage 2 of 2\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nBrilliant letter by Mark Scanlan (\"Bowen EV policy driving us into dystopian future\", 19/7) on the future for green \nhydrogen and the advent of the zero-emissions Twigster! I hope he has sent copies to the Prime Minister, Energy \nMinister and rent-seekers of government energy investment schemes.\nKerry MacDermott, Binalong, NSW\nThe chooks have come home to roost. To sustain a renewable energy pipe dream takes a lot of money. Even \nAndrew Forrest, who seems to have lots of it, and government largesse aren't enough to overcome the reality of \nsupply and demand. There simply isn't sufficient renewable electricity currently or in the pipeline to service \nFortescue's proposed production of 15 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2030. Given supply-side issues, the cost of \nrenewable energy for the purpose of green hydrogen production is exorbitantly high. The Fortescue pullback has \npunched a mammoth hole in the government's renewable ambitions. It raises serious questions about the reliability \nof the government's forecasts and its promises in the energy space more generally. It's a wake-up call that to wed \nthis country's energy security to technologies that are yet to be proven at scale is not only fraught but also \nirresponsible.\nKim Keogh, Claremont, WA\nIt is hilariously strange to witness the evolution of the views of energy analysts and even Australia's Chief Scientist \non the outlook for green hydrogen in our energy mix since Fortescue's pirouette on its future application. I wonder \nif our next chief scientist might have a better grasp of the second law of thermodynamics.\nThere has been so much ignorant, greenwashing bunkum delivered to potential investors around projects to deliver \nhydrogen as a fuel. In fact, the manufacturing process itself consumes about three times as much energy as it \ndelivers in use. I've seen wild projects touted as environmentally friendly taking hydrogen from brown coal or \nmethane, coupled with carbon capture, while every second element of the periodic table has suddenly become \n\"critical\". Carpetbaggers and lifestyle company directors have had a field day.\nThe sad and concerning aspect of this madness is how poorly our government has been advised and the many \ntens of millions of taxpayer dollars that have been splashed around on harebrained projects of dubious merit.

But Dr Forrest told shareholders \nattending the Fortescue AGM his green dream would take the company to a new level entirely, and by 2030 \nFortescue would be challenging global energy majors such as Chevron.\nFortescue would be targeting production of as much as 235 gigawatts of renewable energy, Dr Forrest told \nshareholders - more than five times the capacity of Australia's National Electricity Market at the time.\nThe edges of the plan had been leaking out for months, as Dr Forrest and a small group of insiders had been \ntouring the world trying to stitch up deals with global governments to allow the company first choice of potential \nenergy projects. The company's new subsidiary, Fortescue Future Industries, had signed a deal for the potential \ndevelopment of hydroelectric power in Papua New Guinea only a month before, along with early stage agreements \nin Indonesia. And the company had already hired a raft of renewable energy experts - including former Pacific \nHydro boss Rob Grant - to help form its renewable energy plans.\nBy the November shareholder meeting Dr Forrest and his team had spoken with more than 25 governments around \nthe world, with another 24 on the list for the touring party.\nThat landmark presentation in November 2020 kicked off a bewildering array of announcements from the tour - \nincluding early stage agreements with India, Indonesia and Brazil - and plans to get involved in the world's biggest \nrenewable energy project, the Grand Inga project in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nAlarm bells were ringing in the market by mid-2021, however, when Fortescue's announcement it planned to spend \nup to 10 per cent of its net profits on green energy projects - or $US400m to $US600m that financial year - sparked \nconcerns the green energy project was looming as a major distraction from the company's main iron ore business.\nPage 2 of 3\nFortescue now marching 'to the one beat'\nFortescue chief executive Elizabeth Gaines faced a hostile reception from analysts and investors at the company's \nregular quarterly production briefing in July, with analysts and fund managers demanding the company give the \nmarket a \"clear business case\" for its green energy investments. But resurgent iron ore prices meant the rivers of \ncash were still rolling in and the backlash never really translated into a hit to Fortescue's share price - Dr Forrest \nargues the reverse happened, in fact, as green-focused investment firms piled into the company's stock.\nAnd the growing criticism certainly did not slow the flurry of announcements. By November 2021 FFI had inked \nagreements for hydrogen and renewable energy projects in more than 20 countries, and analysis by The Australian \nestimated that it would cost close to $200bn for Fortescue to make good on delivering just half of those projects.\nBy then FFI had more 700 staff, its own private jet to ferry energy boss Julie Shuttleworth around the world, and a \nvast portfolio of potential projects.\nBut even then cracks were appearing in Dr Forrest's green vision. An investigation by The Weekend Australian in \nlate 2021 revealed that the internal culture of FFI had become increasingly chaotic amid ruthless internal \ncompetition - so much so that insiders described its inner workings as being like the Hunger Games.\nAt the same time Dr Forrest's passion for Fortescue's project - which he genuinely believes is a key part of saving \nthe planet from the worst impacts of global warming - riled up the rest of Australia's mining industry, which until then \nhad been watching on with bemused fascination, after The Australian revealed the Fortescue founder was lobbying \nfor a phase-out of the federal government's diesel fuel rebate scheme, worth billions to the mining industry.\nBoiler room explosion It is bizarre to reflect that catalogue only reflects the first year of Fortescue's grand energy \nproject.\nEven close followers of the company amongst journalists and market analysts struggle to chronicle the bewildering \narray of announcements, promises and backflips - and executive departures - over the next few years.\nBut if there was a moment that sums up the chaos within the company, it is the complete implosion at the most \nsenior ranks in the company in September 2021.\nNewly appointed mining boss Fiona Hick left the company only days after Fortescue celebrated its 20th birthday \nwith a lavish bash in the Pilbara. She was quickly followed out the door by new chief financial officer Christine \nMorris, high-profile FFI recruit Guy Debelle. In an explosive interview with The Australian, Dr Forrest claimed the \nextraordinary events were sparked after he returned from an overseas trip to find the company's strategy had been \nhijacked by members of its executive team, over differences in opinion over Fortescue's green strategy. \"You put a \nlighthouse on a hill and aim at it (but) there was a feeling that another lighthouse was emerging and the \norganisation - particularly when the chairman was overseas for three months - was being pushed towards -another \nlighthouse,\" he said at the time.\nIs the dream over?\nThe spectacular departure of Hick and Morris did not end the upheaval in Fortescue's executive ranks, far from it. \nBut 10 months on, Fortescue now faces another round of major change as Dr Forrest this week reset the \ncompany's strategy - finally conceding that the company's most ambitious goal, of producing 15 million tonnes of \ngreen hydrogen a year by 2030, cannot be achieved in the face of soaring global energy costs.\nBut Dr Forrest rejects any suggestion the company's green energy dream is dead. Speaking to the Australian this \nweek, he said the company's commitment to decarbonise its own iron ore operations by 2030 is unwavering, and \nthe company will shift its green energy focus to building the massive amounts of wind and solar power needed to \nbring down energy costs and make hydrogen viable.\nAnd as for the 700 staff that will leave as part of the reset? Dr Forrest says that is \"heartbreaking\", but necessary as \nFortescue brings its iron ore and green energy arms back together.Page 3 of 3\nFortescue now marching 'to the one beat'\nBut the tension between those two arms has been at the centre of the chaos within Fortescue since the green \nenergy project first began - according to both former Fortescue employees and Dr Forrest's own words along the \nway.\nThe decision to build Fortescue Energy as a company within a company was a deliberate decision, the Fortescue \nfounder told The Australian this week, because it otherwise may not have happened at all.\n\"I had no choice. I tried for a couple of years to get green energy, and going green into the psyche of Fortescue. \nWe had a very good, very well run company, with shareholder returns which hit new records across Australia and \ntens of billions of dollars issued to shareholders. A super successful company - and strong resistance to change,\" \nhe said.\n\"And you can't have improvement without change. You can't be smug, fat and happy. And so as to not threaten the \niron ore sector at all with a major new initiative, we did it through a major startup. And that grew and grew.\" \nFortescue Energy had more than 1900 employees at the end of June 2023, according to the company's last annual \nreport. That may well be dramatically slimmed down by the latest restructuring.\nBut Dr Forrest says all of Fortescue is now \"all marching in the same direction, to the same drum beat\". \"There is \nno one else that is going to lead the world into a secure and non-fossil fuel future. It may as well be us, so it is us,\" \nhe said. And Dr Forrest rejects any suggestion that Fortescue's latest reset is a sign its green strategy is failing, \npointing to the green iron technology the company is developing, its acquisition of a role developing in the giant \nBelinga iron ore deposit in Gabon, its early stage green ammonia joint venture in Morroco, and its development of \nnew technology in shipping, trucking and rail. \"The failure here is a failure of your understanding - and I'm not being \nunkind here. We didn't just go after green hydrogen, we went after green technology - we went after what \nopportunities there could be in changing the world.That led to opportunities being offered to us,\" he said.\nLoad-Date: July 19, 2024\nEnd of Document",

If you don't, you're basically giving \nup on the world,\" he said.\n\"For us to say we're giving up on green hydrogen, as some people have tried to twist it, is just like saying you're \ngiving up on your kids [and] giving up on the world.\"\nInternational conflicts including Russia's invasion of Ukraine had driven up the price of all fossil fuels, and dragged \ngreen electricity with it, Forrest said.\n\"And there's precisely nothing we can do about it, unless we invest upstream in generating very large quantities of \ngreen electricity ourselves, which is what the company announced,\" he said.\nPage 2 of 2\n'A political mischief': Forrest hits back at green hydrogen detractors\n\"We're consolidating by investing upstream so we can get the price of electricity down to a point where green \nhydrogen becomes more competitive.\"\nIn recent years, Forrest has toured the globe seeking opportunities to produce the huge amount of affordable, \nemissions-free electricity needed to separate hydrogen from water in commercially meaningful quantities.\nThe potential markets are in replacing hydrogen from gas and coal in the manufacture of fertiliser and chemicals, \nand providing an emissions-free fuel in applications where batteries may be impractical, such as long-distance \nshipping.\nHowever, Fortescue found the cost of that clean energy prohibitively high and now wants to focus on developing \nrenewable energy projects to drive down the major cost in producing green hydrogen.\n\"If the electricity cost is high, then we can't make hydrogen cheaply enough to compete with fossil fuels,\" Forrest \ntold Radio 6PR in Perth on Thursday.\nClimate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen defended the viability of green hydrogen projects, which are \nbeing developed by more than 50 companies in Australia at a cost of $225 billion.\n\"Green hydrogen will be one of the best ways Australia can decarbonise domestic heavy emitters and help develop \nrobust low-carbon manufacturing,\" he said.\nWhile Bowen said the federal government was committed to working with the project proponents, opposition energy \nspokesman Ted O'Brien said Fortescue's move had \"blown a gaping hole\" in Labor's renewables-focused energy \nplans.\n\"Labor thinks it's picking winners, but we now know they are picking losers, and it's Australian taxpayers who are \npicking up the bill,\" O'Brien said.\nThe federal government's $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program is its highest-profile backing of the nascent \nindustry. In December, six projects - none backed by Fortescue - were shortlisted for funding. Recipients will be \nannounced late this year.\nO'Brien said the Coalition had supported the hydrogen industry while in government, and it was optimistic the fuel \nwould have a long-term role in the energy mix.\nGet to the heart of what's happening with climate change and the environment.

In \norder to work out when to launch the raids, Fortescue was required to determine if children under 18-years-old or \nfemale occupants would be in the properties identified in search orders and when they would be there.\nHe took the job seriously, with a court hearing he or his company conducted \"19 days of surveillance that was \nundertaken of all the respondents and their employees and some family members and wives following people to \nKmart, sifting through mail and the like\".\nLancaster produced a 600 page report, containing shots taken while undercover of Dr Kolodziejczyk's wife and five-\nyear-old son along with Dr Winther-Jensen's wife and 16-year-old daughter who had been watched as she left for \nschool and returned home on one day.\nWho is Robert Lancaster?\nLancaster has left a very public profile of himself across social media and online via interviews, and in old stories he \nwrote and published on his business website: Lancaster Global Risk.\nHe served in the British army, including the 22nd SAS and in Ireland during the Troubles, between 1977 and 1989 \nafter he joined the military at 16-years-old.\n\"When I was in the infantry I spent just under three years in Northern Ireland,\" he tells the Spycraft 101 podcast, \npublished about a month ago. \"A lot of that was intelligence gathering, a lot of surveillance. A lot of patrolling.\" In a \nsocial media post, that shows an old picture with Lancaster in camouflage, he says: \"Old school Australian SF. I \nserved in 22 SAS and later in the Australian Commandos. I remain a brother.\" In another, alongside a picture of two \nblokes arm-in-arm sitting in front of five dogs, Lancaster says: \"Catch up with Bill a mate from the Australian \nCommandos with his 'wolf pack' at one of his country estates. War stories and wine flowed freely.\" His time in the \nSAS set him up for a life in the private sector, Lancaster says. He left the military following a divorce and had just \n\"had enough\". In the early 1990s he moved to Australia following a job offer. He carried out a stint in the reserve \nspecial forces in Australia from 1990, and then undertook two months-long undercover operations in NSW, he tells \nthe Spycraft podcast.\nLancaster speaks highly of his track record as a PI. After he investigated a multimillion-dollar scam in NSW's Urban \nTransit Authority in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he claims 18 people were arrested. \"If I would have been found \nout there I'd have probably been disappeared. It was very unionised, it was quite a dynamic situation,\" he says. He \nsurvived, and moved on to another undercover gig three weeks later for the NSW State Rail Authority before \nlaunching what he says is a highly sought after PI business in Lancasters Global Risk based in Sydney. After he \nstarted off doing jobs for insurance companies investigating the veracity of disablement claims, business soared \nand he says he had about 100 investigations per week within a few years of setting up the company in 1991.\nIn another story, published on his company's website, he discusses Lancaster's role in one of Australia's most \nbruising industrial disputes: that between the Maritime Union of Australia and Patrick Stevedores in 1998.\nAfter Patrick's entire workforce was sacked and replaced with ex-military men, a month long picket disrupted \nmovements across major ports across the country. \"While the industrial clash intensified, with surging lines of \ndemonstrators, mass arrests, guards in balaclavas with dogs protecting strike breakers, there was another game \nbeing played behind the scenes,\" the article says. \"In the bush around the container port, hidden in the industrial \nsprawl of Sydney's Port Botany, Lancaster had his operatives, mostly former special forces soldiers, trained in the \nart of concealment and surveillance.Page 3 of 3\nMeet the veteran PI hired by Twiggy\n\"As Lancaster puts it, and talking only because the dispute is now some four years gone: 'We had people in camo \ngear dug into bushland watching where people gathered. We can take video images form up to a kilometre away as \nlong as the conditions aren't too hot \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and identify individuals.\n\"We clearly identified the ringleaders and documented instances of violence and intimidation. We also had people \ninfiltrate picket lines with miniature covert cameras, and had people at the front and rear gates and a roving patrol, \nall armed with cameras to record acts of violence and intimidation.\"\nDiversify your business Lancaster says he runs a pension fund and a property portfolio, including in France where \nhe says he ran an eight bedroom chateau with a Michelin star chef for guests. His Instagram profile, called \nPlantagenet Manor, is private but the name links to a chateau. It does not appear to be available for stays, although \nan old posting remains online.\n\"The chateau is located in the centre of historic Chalus on nearly two acres of private grounds, surrounded by high \nwalls and hedges and is within walking distance to restaurants, cafes, bars, shops and a lovely Health Spa,\" its \ndescription reads. \"Plantagenet Manor is a beautiful eight bedroom 'petit' chateau with a heated in-ground pool that \nhas gone through a complete renovation with five new bathrooms, gourmet commercial size kitchen (and) modern \nfour poster beds.\" Photos posted to Facebook in 2022 also show some shots of a completed renovation on a \nproperty in the Sunshine Coast, nestled among palm trees and a crystal blue pool. \"After living in Sydney for about \nhalf of my life it was a big call to move to Queensland,\" he said. He says had a significant heart attack a few years \nago; more recently he has suffered another health setback and has pulled back on work. However, he continued to \nwork \"contract by contract\", he told Spycraft.\nLoad-Date: July 19, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: OPINION; Pg. 39\nLength: 777 words\nByline: Patrick Gibbons\nBody\nTransition Andrew Forrest is not alone. Many companies have suffered a similar delusion about a simple, easy and \ncheap future.\nFortescue's hydrogen dreams have come up against the hard energy reality - affordability, reliability and zero \nemissions are difficult to achieve together. But Fortescue is not alone.\nFor the past decade, many have suffered a similar energy delusion. Promises of an easy transition have given way \nto the realisation that nothing with energy or climate ambitions is simple or cheap.\nOnly this month, Google, which had claimed to be carbon-neutral since 2007, said it no longer counted offsets and \nthat it now aimed for neutrality by 2030 because the energy demand associated with AI had seen its emissions \nincrease 48 per cent between 2019 and 2023. Likewise, some Australian funds walked back climate commitments. \nOr just ask Europe.\nThe hype around green hydrogen should be a case study for those interested in the difficulties when it comes to \nenergy and climate.\nDespite green hydrogen being seen as the Swiss Army knife for difficult decarbonisation problems, buyers were \nhard to find, largely because the cost remained stubbornly high and the technical challenges more complex than \nenvisaged.\nAttempts to deliver green hydrogen at $2 a kilogram sounded great at a political level. But, like most politically \ngenerated targets, ambition is no replacement for hard analysis.\nEven with the best assumptions, analysts struggled to get it below $5 a kilogram any time soon. And as with all \nprojections, they depended on the assumptions. The rise in interest rates and equipment costs have cruelled low-\ncost scenarios.\nAs clean energy advocate Michael Liebreich noted earlier this year, when it came to hydrogen, \"expectations have \nraced far ahead of reality\".\nPage 2 of 2\nHard energy reality has mugged Fortescue's hydrogen dream\nWhile various governments and the IEA were making grandiose predictions about how much clean hydrogen would \nbe produced, they bore no relationship to the real world.\nThe Sixth Hydrogen Ministerial held last September in Japan predicted global production of renewable/low-carbon \nhydrogen by 2030 would be 90 million tonnes.\nThis would, Liebreich pointed out, require 60 times more clean hydrogen production than what's already been \nfunded. Even more risibly, he noted an annual demand of 50 million tonnes would have to be created from sectors \nthat do not use hydrogen.\nIn other words, the hydrogen story, at best, is based on wishful thinking. Less charitably, it's based on hype driven \nby subsidy chasing.\nAnd with the increasingly likely return of former president Donald Trump to the White House, the wishful thinking of \nhydrogen advocates will face even further setbacks as the new administration seeks to wind back elements of the \nBiden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. Hydrogen subsidies are on the list.\nThis isn't to say green or clean hydrogen has no future, rather its application will be more modest - green metals, \nsome transport and fertilisers.\nFortescue's about-face reflects the bigger challenge of decarbonising its Pilbara mining operations, for which it still \nclaims will be \"Real Zero by 2030\". Its mines and rail operations annually consume about\n700 million litres of diesel.\nThe push to electrify the Pilbara mines as a way of decarbonising is not straightforward.\nStarting with the diesel trucks that carry iron ore, each of these weigh more than 500 tonnes, and carry 300 tonnes \nof ore. Add in trains about 2.8 kilometres in length, all powered by diesel locomotives, there are clear challenges of \ncost-effectively electrifying what is a global logistical operation that operates 24/7.\nDoing so requires more than just the rollout of renewable energy. Realistically, the push to achieve net zero in the \nmines requires step changes in technology and its commercial deployment, all of which will take time.\nFurther, it highlights the need for a more realistic approach to the challenges of decarbonisation.\nWhether activists and some policymakers want to hear it, the world is not moving off fossil fuels any time soon. Last \nyear saw record demand for oil, coal and gas. This is not about to change.\nThe real world of energy where demand is only rising, with affordability and reliability the key criteria, is only going \nto make it harder for those companies that have overpromised.\nAnd although Fortescue has taken the hard decision to moderate its decarbonisation ambitions and in the process \nlay off 700 people, it's an open question as to who else will follow suit. There is no shortage of companies that have \nmade tough-to-meet commitments that look increasingly unrealistic.\nPatrick Gibbons is a former diplomat and partner at corporate advisory firm Orizontas.\nLoad-Date: July 24, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Less than \nthree hours later, Forrest's Fortescue Metals told investors it was kicking its target down the road from 2030 to a \ndestination one stop short of Never Never Land. In the meantime, Fortescue will concentrate on what it does best: \ndigging stuff out of the ground instead of building castles in the air.\n\"Reports of the death of green hydrogen have been greatly exaggerated,\" said Bowen. Fortescue may have \"de-\nprioritised\" green hydrogen, but $200bn of investment was \"in the pipeline\". That's renewable energy speak for \"the \ncheque is in the mail\".\nA Boston Consulting survey, published last September, found that 824 green hydrogen projects with a theoretical \ncapacity of 21 million tonnes a year were in the pipeline in North America and Europe. But only 2 per cent of the \nannounced capacity reached the planning stage, and just 0.2 per cent were completed.\nGlobal energy companies are rethinking the wisdom of pumping billions of dollars of capital into an unproven \ntechnology with uncertain timing and no guaranteed rate of return. Statkraft, the Norwegian hydro-electricity giant, \nrolled back its plans last month. \"We have definitely underestimated the challenges,\" a company spokesman said. \n\"Developing green hydrogen has become much more expensive than we expected.\" Earlier this year, French \nenergy giant Engie dropped plans to build a green hydrogen plant in Portugal. Only this month, the European Court \nof Auditors criticised the European Union's 2030 green hydrogen production target of 10 million tonnes as \n\"overambitious\", saying it was unlikely to be met and, therefore, shouldn't be included in carbon reduction \ncalculations.\nIt's been less than three years since Forrest boasted about spending $1bn to build the world's largest green \nhydrogen electrolyser manufacturing plant in Gladstone, Queensland.\nPage 2 of 3\nBowen lost in a Forrest of green energy hubris\nForrest explained his plans to convert the Gibson Island ammonia factory in Brisbane to run on green hydrogen. He \nalso committed to building the world's first green hydrogen import and export facility at Port Kembla, linked to a \npower station fired by \"the miracle molecule \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. clean as the day is long \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 crystal clean, green hydrogen made \nright here at home\".\nMuch nonsense has been spoken at the National Press Club over the years, but seldom have journalists been \ntaken on a flight of fancy quite as crazy as the one piloted by Forrest back in October 2021. \"To make green \nhydrogen, you simply split water,\" he said. \"Any old water \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It can be wastewater, desalinated water, sea water \ninto hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity only.\n\"It's like a miracle molecule, the Swiss Army knife of energy and green products, versatile and able to decarbonise \neven the most challenging sectors, like, say, iron ore, cement, steel, iron fertilisers, aeroplanes, trucks, trains, cars.\" \nWe now know all this was pure fantasy. The multibillion-dollar projects he promised were technologically unproven \nand economically unfeasible. There was barely a dollar of committed finance behind them and only the flimsiest of \nbusiness cases.\nWe shouldn't be surprised. Hydrogen has been breaking hearts since 1766, when Henry Cavendish described the \nproduction of \"inflammable air\" by reacting zinc metal with hydrochloric acid. Try as they might, technologists have \nnever overcome hydrogen's fatal flaw: whatever hydrogen is asked to do, another technology will do it better, safer \nand cheaper.\nForrest's 2021 expectations about the cost of green hydrogen were somewhat wide of the mark. The cost had \nhalved, he claimed, because \"unlike fossil fuels, green hydrogen was becoming cheaper and would never run out\".\nLast week he told Nine Radio in Perth: \"We just have to work out now how to produce it cheaply enough.\" The \ncollapse of the green hydrogen bubble is a double blow for Bowen.\nGreen hydrogen manufacturing and the proposed Sun Cable solar development were supposed to provide the \nportable energy that would turn Australia into a renewable energy export power by the end of the decade. Neither \nproject is going to happen, certainly not by 2030. The collapse of the business case for green hydrogen puts the lie \nto Bowen's claim that renewable energy is cheap.\nHours before the Fortescue announcement, he was repeating his trite line at the National Press Club. Yet even \nBowen's cheer squad now doubts the claim, if it is not ready to abandon all of the hopes for a renewable future. \nGreen hydrogen still had a great future, an opinion article in Renew Economy claimed. It's just there was \"limited \naccess to the large amounts of low-cost renewable energy\". Quite.\nMany of us have been making that point for some time. The lesson for Bowen from the green hydrogen debacle is \nthat he should stop clogging his diary with carpet-bagging time-wasters and stick with the technology that actually \nexists. Bowen will never get back the hours he's spent listening to the green hydrogen salesmen peddling miracle \ncures for the planet, just as taxpayers are unlikely to see a return on the billions of dollars of poorly scoped \nsubsidies pushed their way.\nYet Bowen is part of a government that believes it understands capital allocation better than the markets. Its \nTreasurer has fallen for the neo-Marxist fantasy of values-based capitalism and the delusion that innovation should \nbe driven by the state.\nIt has a Finance Minister who lacks the wisdom to ask tough questions and a Prime Minister content to leave the \ndetails to others. Labor will respond to Fortescue's misadventures by throwing more money into its Hydrogen \nHeadstart program and associated corporate welfare schemes designed to bridge the gap between the cost of \nmanufacturing green hydrogen and the amount customers are willing to pay.\nAustralia will be caught up in the global sugar war, competing with governments in Europe and North America to \npile more sugar on the table. However, it will not have the advantage of cheap energy enjoyed by countries blessed \nwith abundant hydro-electricity or in which nuclear power is legal.Page 3 of 3\nBowen lost in a Forrest of green energy hubris\nPoliticians and entrepreneurs may be equally prone to the cognitive biases that allow bad ideas to hang around \nlong after they should've been dismissed. The redeeming grace of entrepreneurs is the profit motive, which tells \nthem when to stop throwing good money after bad.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 748 words\nHighlight: Fortescue is about to turn 21, and with age seemingly comes wisdom, as the company puts its \nenormously expensive green hydrogen plans on the backburner.\nBody\nAndrew Forrest's corporate baby, Fortescue, turns 21 on Thursday. So it seems fitting that the mining billionaire \nand climate change evangelist appears to have taken stock of what's economically and technologically achievable \nin his trailblazing quest to green the planet.\nIt's a reality check for Forrest and Fortescue, who have perhaps realised that chasing some dreams doesn't make \nsense, and wild ambition more often than not needs to be tempered with some common sense.\nWhile Fortescue is not giving up on its green aspirations, there is clearly a pivot to realism on how it can get there. \nIt is looking to move downstream to more conventional green electricity projects - wind and solar. The hundreds of \nbillions that investors around the world (including Forrest) have already ploughed into these renewables are a \ntestament to the fact that they stack up economically.\nBut what about green hydrogen, produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity? \nHas Forrest raised the white flag on the technology? Not yet, and maybe never.\nThe new strategy will lead to a number of green hydrogen projects being \"deprioritised\", Forrest told this masthead \non Wednesday, but Fortescue will still hold on to a few.\nThe way Forrest explained it, Fortescue is \"pivoting downstream along the conveyor belt\", and when green \nelectricity becomes cheap and abundant enough, Fortescue can go back to fuelling Forrest's \"green hydrogen \nobjectives\".\nMaking green hydrogen, which requires enormous amounts of energy, is expensive using today's technology, which \nis why Fortescue has decided to take a breather and support more established renewable technology.\nCosts and reassessments aside, Forrest is also seemingly facing the looming challenge of dealing with the fallout \nfrom the likely return of Donald Trump to the White House.\nTrump's not exactly a climate crusader, but Forrest seems unperturbed.\n\"What I know about President Biden and Trump is that they will turn on a dime. Both Trump and his nominated vice \npresident, J.D. Vance, will act in the best interests of America or get tossed out of government,\" Forrest said.\nPage 2 of 2\nBillionaire Andrew Forrest's green crusade cops a reality check\n\"Trump always wants to clear the swamp, [and to do that] he would want to reduce the high-cost structure of the \nswamp, which is the fossil fuel sector.\"\nLink to Image\nDomenico Pugliese\nMeanwhile, the move to reposition Fortescue's green investment will certainly find favour with the miner's \ninvestors, who have enjoyed some $49 billion in dividends and capital appreciation since the company was listed.\nWhile Forrest still has plenty of shareholders who back his mission, concerns had been raised about the large \nnumber of green projects Fortescue was investigating and the amount of money (generated from iron ore) that was \nneeded to pursue them.\nFortescue said on Wednesday that the repositioning of its priorities would lead to 700 staff, or about 5 per cent of \nthe company's workforce, being retrenched. The cuts are part of a broader plan to further consolidate the two arms \nof the company - its renewable energy arm and its iron ore division - into a single operating entity.\nEach division will retain its current chief executive, but the next level of executives will be shared across both pillars.\nThe company's chief legal counsel, Phil McKeiver, who had been running a corporate espionage claim by \nFortescue against three ex-employees in court, will no longer retain a dual role as company secretary. \n(Fortescue's legal team has been accused of using private investigators to follow three former executives and their \nfamilies. The company accused the men of copying and taking intellectual property when they left to start a rival \ngreen iron project called Element Zero.)\n\"People in senior management make the decisions they do, and we don't always agree with them,\" Forrest said.\n\"No board member knew about the private investigator and a very enthusiastic group general counsel and company \nsecretary wanted to demonstrate that you cannot steal technology and then eliminate that technology that the \ncompany produced on the way out. That's like Hitler ripping up the bridges retreating out of Poland.\n\"You can be assured that the temperature turned a little warmer around that gentleman's desk. He took it upon \nhimself to tender his resignation (as legal counsel),\" Forrest added.\nThat offer was rejected by Fortescue, with McKeiver staying on as general counsel.\nThe Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day's trading.

This clumsy, boneheaded remark, uttered in \nthe midst of a cultural audit at the company, is typical of a proud oaf like Ellison. He wouldn't have the slightest clue \nthat it's the women of MinRes, far more than the men, who rely so heavily on flexible working arrangements - and \nit's women, strangely, who he's still so eager to attract to his workforce.\nMinRes has had a longstanding problem with women. Its most senior have departed and its leadership team is \nstacked with Chris's and Marks and Mikes and Darrens.\nThere are six chief executives in the upper levels of the executive, allmen. There's not even a pretence of diversity, \na feat in itself. The place is a giant, heaving man-cave, a boys club stinking of chauvinism and Lynx Africa.\nOne of the most senior women to work with Ellison was lawyer Bronwyn Grieve. She arrived in August 2022 as \nchief people officer and had been tasked with revamping culture at the mining company. In other words, it was her \njob to make the place more amenable - or just slightly less repellent - to women. Blocked at every turn, she quit \nwithin a year.\nSo did executive general manager Shelley Robertson, who quit MinRes in March 2023. Grieve and Robertson have \nsince ended up at Fortescue, as Margin Call has learned, both now occupying seats on Andrew Forrest's \nexecutive. Robertson was promoted this month to chief operating officer and Grieve is Fortescue's global \nsustainability and external affairs lead.\nNot to mention the profusion of women elsewhere at MinRes who have walked out over some shabby treatment. \nTania Champion, MinRes's principal tenement adviser, started at Fortescue two months ago as the principal of \napproval planning. Courtney Kelley, MinRes's in-house counsel, ended her two years at the company at the same \ntime, according to LinkedIn.\nPage 2 of 2\nMinRes's best bail to Fortescue\nMeanwhile, Ellison, a year on from his outright dismissal of flexible work, is back to making more bold \npronouncements - this time about his commitment to hiring more women. Here he is at a Macquarie Australia \nconference in May talking about his vision for a \"safer work environment\" for women.\n\"I'm building a daycare centre so, ladies, if you want to come and work for me, 20 bucks a day for your kids, we're \ngoing to be able to accommodate about 140 kids, so all our workforce.\" This wasn't satire. Nor was the hiring of \ncompany \"ambassador\" Julie Bishop to star in a video spruiking the miner as modern and female-friendly.\nOh, if only she knew that the women who get anywhere near the MinRes leadership are out of that place faster than \na Manhattan rat in a kitchen.\nEllison's problem isn't just hiring women, it's keeping them - and losing the best of them to Fortescue.\nEarly exit Meanwhile, what to make of Richard Harding's premature exit as CEO of Insurance and Care NSW?\nHarding had been booked to leave in October but was quietly desaparecido'd earlier this month, leaving the agency \nand the government flat-footed in finding a replacement.\nNo change to his LinkedIn, of course; according to that, he hasn't left at all. But he has, and there's been little \nprogress identifying a successor.\nPart of the problem seems to be a tiff between iCare's chair, John Robertson, and the responsible minister, Sophie \nCotsis. Their beef centres on control of the appointment process and a broader argument around the agency's \nindependence.\nThe other snag is the board. Once upon a time it was stacked with Liberal Party donors and toadies. Now it's \nLabor's turn to try that on.\nDeputy chair Michael Cameron disappeared in November (apparently rissoled for being a Liberal Party member) \nand a month later Unions NSW secretary Mark Morey appeared with a directorship. That's worth at least $100,000, \nand even more if he chairs a subcommittee. Robertson, a former union boss himself, receives $200,000 as chair. \nAll of it's easy money for just nine meetings a year.\nNevermind that there's no one on the board with any actual experience in the realm of insurance. The only person \nwho comes close is Stuart Farquharson, formerly a CFO at Zurich. He's not on the board but rather acting in \nHarding's role as interim CEO, so he's allowed to sit in the room.\nIn any case, all this bickering over who gets to run the appointment process is awkward when one considers \nRobertson's position. Cotsis might put up a fight but she knows - or should - that Chris Minns was chief of staff to \nRobbo while he was opposition leader.\nLoad-Date: July 23, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 657 words\nHighlight: Mining giant says it will lift spending on its green energy division this year despite setbacks tempering its \nambitious green hydrogen targets.\nBody\nMining giant Fortescue says it will lift spending on green energy technology over the next year and has reaffirmed \nits commitment to developing zero-emissions hydrogen despite scaling back ambitions to produce 15 million tonnes \nof the fuel a year by 2030.\nBillionaire Andrew Forrest, Fortescue's founder and executive chairman, has had to hit the brakes on the speed \nand scale of his plans to diversify the world's fourth-largest iron ore miner into a green hydrogen superpower, \nblaming the high cost and the vast amount of renewable energy required to split hydrogen from water.\nLink to Image\nDominic Lorrimer\nPerth-based Fortescue last week announced it would slash 700 jobs, put its 2030 hydrogen target on hold and \nmerge its green energy and iron ore divisions to reduce duplication and costs.\nHowever, in a briefing on Thursday, Fortescue Energy boss Mark Hutchinson reaffirmed to investors that the \ncompany was \"steadfast\" in its commitment to scale up and commercialise green hydrogen - the name for hydrogen \nmade using an electrolyser powered by renewable energy to ensure the end product is emissions-free.\nFortescue had initially allocated capital expenditure of $US300 million ($457 million) for its energy division for the \ncoming 12 months, but that figure was increased to $US500 million ($763 million) on Thursday. The division's \noperating expenditure would rise from a maximum of $500 million to $700 million, the company said.\n\"I want to make it really clear: Fortescue is steadfast in our commitment to green hydrogen,\" Hutchinson said. \n\"However, our financial discipline always comes first, and we will never do projects that are not economically \nviable.\"\nSince 2020, Forrest has toured the world promoting the virtues of green hydrogen and seeking to partner with \ngovernments that have areas suitable for producing the vast amounts of wind, solar or hydropower required.\nGreen hydrogen is considered a promising future fuel due to its potential to displace fossil fuels and help \ndecarbonise industrial processes, such as steel-making, that cannot be simply electrified. However it remains \nPage 2 of 2\nForrest's Fortescue boosts spending to keep green hydrogen dream alive\nprohibitively expensive to make and is not yet viable at scale, with most of today's hydrogen still made using fossil \nfuels.\nHutchinson on Thursday said it had become apparent that the ability to source renewable electricity at a cost of \naround $US30 ($45.80) a megawatt-hour was essential for a project to be viable.\nIn jurisdictions where power was more expensive, he added, Fortescue would invest in plans to build renewable \nenergy generators, including in Western Australia and Queensland.\n\"Where the power costs are not at this level, we will work steadfastly with those economies to help bring down the \ncost of electricity by producing electrons,\" he said.\nFortescue will initially focus on four key green hydrogen projects in Australia, the United States, Norway and Brazil. \nFurther projects in Morocco, Oman, Egypt and Jordan would follow, the company said.\n\"We totally believe green hydrogen is what the world ultimately needs, that is why we will continue to maintain a \nsignificant portfolio of projects,\" Hutchinson said.\nThe update on Fortescue's green hydrogen strategy came as the company reported record quarterly exports of the \nlucrative steel-making raw material iron ore from its mines in WA.\n\"It's been an outstanding quarter by the team who rallied together to deliver record iron ore shipments of 53.7 \nmillion tonnes, which was 10 per cent higher than the June quarter last year,\" Fortescue Metals chief executive \nDino Otranto said.\n\"This record result demonstrated the efficiencies gained through our recovery plan following the ore car derailment \nin December 2023.\"\nThe Market Recap newsletter is a wrap of the day's trading.

Macquarie \nestimates Fortescue's break even price at about $US40 a tonne - lower than that of BHP at about $US32 and Rio \nat about $US35.\n\"Fortescue has addressed market downturns in the past with a focus on cost and flexibility.

The company said \nIron Bridge shipments were affected by \"higher than planned concentrate moisture affecting material handling\".\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue shares take a beating\nFortescue said those issues were now largely solved, and it was working towards an alternative solution to the \nlong-running water supply issues plaguing Iron Bridge. The company has previously flagged the need to replace a \nlength of pipeline to borefields that leaks when placed under high pressure.\nThe project was now \"banking\" rainfall and surface water, Fortescue said, an option that \"may mitigate\" the need to \nreplace the high pressure section of the raw water pipeline.\nFortescue now expects Iron Bridge to produce 5-9 million tonnes of concentrate in the current fiscal year, with the \nmassive mine expected to hit its full capacity by September next year.\nFortescue mining boss Dino Otranto said the new guidance range reflected shipping constraints at the company's \noperations, and not any expectation output from Fortescue's traditional hematite mines would slip during the year.\n\"For full year 2025 the bottleneck, as magnetite ramps up, becomes shipping and it does then give us flexibility to \nramp up and down hematite and magnetite in that portfolio based on market conditions,\" Mr Otranto told analysts \non Thursday.\nThe company's realised price for its iron ore also slipped in the quarter, as the disparity between higher and lower \ngrade ores widened. Fortescue said it realised an average $US92.12 a tonne, or about 82 per cent of the \nbenchmark index for iron ore grading 62 per cent iron.\nIn the March quarter, Fortescue sales averaged $US104.48 a tonne, or 85 per cent of the benchmark price. It \nreceived an average $US103.01 a tonne for the full year.\nFortescue said its cash costs averaged $US18.53 a tonne for the quarter, down slightly, and $US18.24 a tonne for \nthe full year.\nThe mining major is flagging cost increases in the current year, however, with costs expected to run between \n$US18.50 and $US19.75 a wet tonne.\nBut despite the cost-cutting and restructuring at Fortescue, partly aimed at ending the duplication of support \nfunctions between its iron ore and energy arms, the company will accelerate spending on its green energy projects.\nFortescue chief financial officer Apple Paget told analysts about a third of the planned $US500m capital spending \non energy projects would go to the already approved green energy projects in the US, Queensland and Western \nAustralia, with another third allocated to Fortescue Zero - formerly known as WAE Technologies - which is looking \nto build hi-tech manufacturing centres in the US and the UK.\nAbout 60 per cent of Fortescue Energy's $US700m operating spend would support the development of new green \nenergy projects - including feasibility studies on green hydrogen projects in Norway and Brazil - with the rest \nallocated to Fortescue Zero, she said.

Fortescue executives presented the \ncompany's quarterly production report to investors yesterday.\nThe Forrest family owns 36.74 per cent of Fortescue, which has pivoted to clean energy in the past five years.\nSquadron bought 75 per cent of wind power developer Windlab in 2020, under a deal that meant Federation Asset \nManagement owned the remaining 25 per cent. Windlab has been developing wind farms, including the \nundeveloped Prairie and Wongalee wind projects in Queensland.\nA Windlab subsidiary - Wongalee Renewable Energy Farm - applied to federal environment regulators last year for \npermission to install 175 wind turbine generators across 48,000 hectares of land near Hughenden.\nWindlab's shareholding in the Wongalee subsidiary was transferred to Australian Fortescue Future Industries on \nFebruary 23 - the day after Fortescue's half-year financial results were released. Fortescue has not mentioned the \nacquisition of the Wongalee project in any market filings.\nOwnership of the Prairie wind farm has followed a similar path.\nA Windlab subsidiary - Prairie Renewable Energy Farm - applied to regulators in 2022 for permission to build 116 \nwind turbines near Hughenden. But documents lodged with the corporate regulator show that, on February 23, \nWindlab's ownership of the subsidiary was transferred to Australian Fortescue Future Industries.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrests' wind farms sold to Fortescue after blow to hydrogen plan\nThe closest Fortescue has come to disclosing its connection to the Prairie and Wongalee projects was in \nNovember 2022, when the company issued a press release - but not a market filing - that said Fortescue would \n\"partner\" with Windlab on a renewables \"super hub\" that included the two projects.\nThat statement did not say that Fortescue would take ownership of the two wind farms, or whether the company \nwould help fund construction.\nThe Wongalee and Prairie wind projects have not been mentioned in Fortescue's annual report, financial results or \ncapital spending schedules in the 20 months since the November 2022 press release.\nAsked about the wind farms yesterday, Fortescue energy boss Mark Hutchinson said the company had originally \nthought they could supply clean energy to its proposed green hydrogen projects in Queensland.\nFortescue will not build any large-scale green hydrogen projects in Queensland any time soon and its small \nhydrogen project at Gladstone will purchase power from the grid.\nMr Hutchinson said the wind farms could be \"repurposed\" to supply power into the national electricity grid, but that \nwould probably require the Queensland government to build the CopperString electricity transmission project \nbetween Townsville and Mt Isa.\nMr Hutchinson said Fortescue would not incur any significant spending on Wongalee nor Prairie \"for a few years\" \nat least.\nASIC filings suggest Australian Fortescue Future Industries acquired Wongalee and Prairie for an initial \npeppercorn price of $1 each. It is understood the agreement between Windlab and Fortescue would see further \npayments made to Windlab if certain construction and energy generation milestones are achieved.\nWindlab has said construction on the wind farms could begin as soon as 2025, with first power as early as 2027. \nHowever, Mr Hutchinson hosed down those expectations, saying yesterday that it was \"very early days\".\nLoad-Date: July 28, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Further cost pressures are expected; the amount of waste rock Fortescue digs up to access \nsaleable iron ore - known as the \"strip ratio\" - is expected to be higher over the next four years.\nFortescue mining boss Dino Otranto said the need to move more waste rock was a factor driving costs higher. \n\"Strip ratios are increasing over the mid term,\" he told investors yesterday.\nResources companies are also being hit with requests for higher wages and escalating energy costs.\nAsked about the job cuts, Mr Otranto said Fortescue had \"always maintained the leanest structure possible to \nmake sure we are competitive and the leading [unit cost] player in the market\".\nFortescue chief financial officer Apple Paget said the miner would also use technology and innovation to mitigate \nrising costs at the mines. Further adoption of autonomous haulage shapes as one way Fortescue might be able to \nlower costs. The company is considering whether to purchase construction machine manufacturer Liebherr's \nautonomous vehicles.\nPage 2 of 2\nSurging iron ore mining costs plague Fortescue's year ahead\nFortescue's budgeted spending on fleet replacement and decarbonisation of its mines in the year ahead was also \nhigher than analysts had expected. UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw described the guidance as \"in-line to soft\".\nFortescue's cost woes come after Whitehaven Coal managing director Paul Flynn warned last week that \ninflationary pressures remained \"rife\" despite rising unemployment.\nSeveral coal miners have reported a doubling of unit costs since 2016.\nFortescue shipped 191.2 million tonnes of iron ore in the 12 months to June 30; the first time in five years it has \nreported a sequential decline in export volumes. It shipped 192 million tonnes in the previous financial year.\nThe decline in volumes was caused by the derailment of an ore car in December. Fortescue tried to make up for \nthat outage with a fast finish to the financial year; the export rate over the past three months was higher than ever.\nAnalyst consensus, measured by Bloomberg, suggests Fortescue is on track to post a $US6.11 billion ($9.3 billion) \nunderlying profit next month, up from $US5.5 billion last year.\nThe promise to ship up to 200 million tonnes in the next year includes a target for the struggling Iron Bridge \nmagnetite project in WA of between 5 million and 9 million tonnes.

To sustain the dividend policy, we believe \nFMG may need to increase gearing,\" Macquarie said in a client note on Friday.\nGoldman Sachs analyst Paul Young noted the company's capital spending was increasing to maintain production at \nsome of its older mines, and it may need to ramp up spending again if new green hydrogen projects in Norway and \nBrazil - now going through feasibility studies - are given the green light by the company's board.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue's green expenditure could put pressure on dividends\n\"We continue to think Fortescue is at an inflection point on capital allocation, and to fund the ambitious strategy, we \nassume the company reduces the dividend payout ratio from the current 65 per cent in the second half of FY24 to \nabout 50 per cent from FY25 onwards - the bottom end of the 50 to 80 per cent guidance,\" he said.\nFortescue narrowly missed its annual export targets, shipping 191.6 million tonnes for the year, below the bottom \nend of its 192 to 197 million tonne guidance range.\nBut after Fortescue's troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project again missed expected export rates, the company only \ncame close to its overall export target after shipping far higher quantities of a lower-grade product known as super \nspecial fines, which made up more than half of its record June quarter exports.\nThe iron ore major says it expects Iron Bridge to ramp up production rates of 5 to 9 million tonnes this financial \nyear, after shipments of only 1.2 million -tonnes in the year ending June 30.\nBut Fortescue has also wi-dened its overall export guidance target, flagging shipments of 190 to 200 million \ntonnes.\nThat suggests shipments from some of its hematite mines could taper off this year, according to Morgans analyst \nAdrian Prendergast. \"Management denied this view, commenting that changes in FY25 will only be minor, but the \nfacts are hard to dismiss,\" he said.\n\"The lack of commentary makes it hard to identify the drivers of the change, but it is clear that FMG has been \npushing some of its ageing mines hard with strip ratios rising and the need for increased mine replacement \ninvariably -increasing.\" While Mr Prendergast said he still expects Fortescue to maintain dividend yields above \nthose of its competitors, softening iron ore prices could put pressure on shareholder payouts. \"Fortescue maintains \na healthy balance sheet, but its capex-heavy mine replacement, decarbonisation, and sustainability investments are \nplacing an increasing load on its base iron ore business in terms of capital requirements,\" he said. Fortescue \nshares closed up 21c at $20.35 on Friday.\nLoad-Date: July 26, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The book at the bottom of the range \nwas covered on Monday night.\nThe price equates to a discount of between 8.8 per cent and 6.1 per cent to the last traded share price of $20.35.\nOn offer was about 100 million securities, or about 3.2 per cent of the shares on issue and equalled about $1.9bn in \nvalue.\nThe book build was due to close at 8pm AEST for Australian and Asia investors. Dr Forrest, the billionaire \nFortescue Metals founder, owns about 36.7 per cent of Fortescue Metals, which has a $63bn market value.\nFortescue shares are now down almost 10 per cent since the company announced a major restructure on July 17, \nwhich will see about 700 staff depart the company in a mass wave on redundancies, as Fortescue signalled a \nbackdown from the most aggressive of its green hydrogen and ammonia targets - including a plan to be producing \n15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030.\nMacquarie analysts noted last week that Fortescue's slowdown on its green energy ambitions could lead to a \nselldown by ESG-minded funds, saying that - despite widespread criticism of the lack of financial details of the \ncompany's strategy - it had helped Fortescue break free of its traditional link to iron ore prices.\nPage 2 of 2\nJPMorgan sells down $1.9bn stake in Fortescue\n\"ETFs seeking hydrogen exposure, or 'long onlys' with strong energy transition mandates may seek to reduce -\npositions on these developments and a slowing of Fortescue's -external green energy business trajectory,\" \nMacquarie analysts said in a client note.\nMacquarie said Fortescue's green energy strategy could be worth as much as $4.70 a share.\nBut the iron ore major also delivered a disappointing June quarter report last week with the company falling short of \nits annual export guidance for the year, -despite record shipments in the June period.\nWhile the export miss was relatively minor, analysts also noted that Fortescue's spending on its green projects was \nactually projected to rise for the current financial year, despite the company's announcement that it planned to cut \njobs and costs and reshape its green strategy towards green iron production and renewable energy infrastructure.\nOverseeing the block trade on Monday was JPMorgan's Jonas Troeber, who has been made the sole head of \nequity capital markets for JPMorgan in Australia.\nIt comes after his ECM co-head, Simone Haslinger, has opted to leave the bank following a period of parental \nleave.\nOther changes include Sunil Dhupelia and Peihao Huang, currently co-heads of Asia ex-Japan ECM, becoming co-\nheads of ECM for Asia Pacific.

Should the seller be The Capital Group as expected, it would go down to owning about 3.42 per cent of \nFortescue.\nBlock trades this size are few and far between, but suggest institutional investors are tiring of Andrew Forrest's \nFortescue, which seems to be battling major C-suite issues, at the same time as iron ore prices slump, costs rise, \nand its hydrogen ambitions prove unrealistic.\nFortescue shipped 191.2 million tonnes of Australian iron ore in the 12 months to June 30; the first time in five \nyears the company has reported a sequential decline in export volumes, after shipping 192 million tonnes in the \nprevious financial year. Last Thursday, it warned of higher costs across its WA iron ore operations. Earlier this \nmonth, it abandoned a target for Fortescue to produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 28\nLength: 631 words\nByline: Anthony Macdonald\nBody\nFortescue could use a new friend. And quickly. The stock dropped like a stone yesterday, taking the benchmark \nS&P/ASX 200 down with it.\nWhy? Because it lost one of its two big long-term backers; the sort of shareholder that picks and sticks and helps \nsomeone like Andrew Forrest have the certainty and platform to create a $63 billion miner.\nThat shareholder was US fund manager Capital Group, a rusted-on Fortescue bull that backed Forrest's growth \nstory in the early years and collected its substantial dividends later.\nIt was a great trade for both sides; Fortescue got a steady and loyal institutional shareholder (not as common as \nyou might think), while Capital got a substantial stake in a stunningly strong cash machine. This time last year, \nCapital was Fortescue's third-biggest shareholder with a 7.94 per cent stake.\nBut managers and their views change, and now Capital is on hard retreat. There have been two block trades worth \na combined $3 billion in the past six weeks via JPMorgan's equities desk, and they can only have come from \nCapital Group. Fortescue stock was down 10 per cent yesterday, dragging the ASX 200 down with it.\nWhat sparked it? We're told it is internal changes at Capital. What matters for Fortescue - and indeed its other \nshareholders now getting washed around in the swell - is where the stock went.\nWhoever bought it, it is unlikely that Fortescue has found another Capital Group. Such high-conviction and deep-\npocketed investors are rare; they pretty much do not exist anywhere else.\nThere are no active managers with substantial stakes at BHP or Rio Tinto, for example, or any of the big four \nbanks. Offshore miner Glencore has a good, sticky institutional shareholder with an 8 per cent stake - but once \nagain, it is Capital.\nSo, Fortescue needs to find a way to get a dozen or more smaller institutions - the sort that don't have $5 billion \ntied up in a stock like Capital did at Fortescue this time last year - to invest, or invest more. It needs more \nwidespread support than it has had.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue plunge reveals huge shoes to fill\nThe steady grind lower in China's bond yields is evidence that investors are betting more rate cuts will be needed to \nstimulate the economy.\nCapital did stunningly well on its Fortescue investment. When the investor first disclosed its stake in February \n2015, it had just picked up 67.6 million Fortescue shares at an average $2.34 each.\nThe stock's now above $18, nearly hit $30 in February, and has paid $11.26 a share in dividends since, which puts \nit in 10-bagger-plus territory.\nFortescue shares yesterday closed at $18.32. The stock traded weakly all day, which suggests some of those \nCapital shares are yet to find a medium-term home. Until they do, it could be a choppy ride.\nCapital's big sell orders leave Fortescue holding on to its one long-term backer (two if you count the Forrests' \nTattarang), China's Hunan Valin Iron and Steel Group, which doubles as a customer.\nHunan Valin bought its initial 260 million shares, still the bulk of its holding, in the 2009 financial year, which means \nits interest predates Capital's. And like Capital, it has also done very well. It paid $US452 million ($645 million) for \nthose shares 15 years ago. If it thought about it in Australian dollars, that's an entry price at less than $2.50 a share \nin return for stock now worth more than $18 and having paid $11.71 in dividends. The difference is that it is a \nstrategic investor and is yet to head for an exit.\nIt comes as investors and analysts are still trying to work out what's going on with Fortescue's energy arm. The \ncompany jettisoned its 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 production target a fortnight ago, although \nmanagement made it pretty clear on last week's quarterly production call that the push was more delayed rather \nthan abandoned.\nANTHONY MACDONALD\nLoad-Date: August 2, 2024\nEnd of Document",

In 2019, five Federal \nCourt judges unanimously backed an earlier ruling by judge Steven Rares that granted exclusive native title over \n2700 square kilometres to the Yindjibarndi, and effectively recognised them as private owners with a spiritual \nconnection that allowed them to decide who came onto the land.\nBut Fortescue has never struck a compensation agreement with the Yindjibarndi people, nor received permission \nfrom the native title owners to mine their land, despite a decade of mining the steel-making commodity in north-west \nWA.

Forrest's wealth is estimated at $US22.8 billion ($35 billion) by Bloomberg.\nLink to Image\nTrevor Collens\nForrest issued a warning to his company's external legal team, stating that their engagement was under review \nbecause of the investigation's tactics and that they \"had an obligation to comply with the company's values\".\nFortescue has taken legal action against three former employees, Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and \nBjorn Winther-Jensen, in the Federal Court and has accused the men of copying and taking the company's \nintellectual property when they left to start a rival green iron project called Element Zero.\nMasterman, who is Element Zero's chief executive, has called Fortescue's claims \"spurious\" and said their \"green \nmetals technology was developed independently of, and is very different from, anything that Fortescue is doing or \nhas done in this space\". All three men have denied the allegations.\nLate on Friday evening, the Federal Court released a swathe of documents from the case, including details from a \n600-page private investigator's report that was commissioned for Fortescue by its external lawyers. Fortescue had \npreviously tried to suppress the release of that private investigator's report.\nThe documents, which also included dozens and dozens of photographs from the investigator's surveillance, \nrevealed the extent of the spying conducted on those three former staff members, their children and family \nmembers, and other staff at Element Zero.\nPage 2 of 3\nFortescue in-house lawyer issued spying orders, court documents reveal\nIt also revealed that Adrian Huber, a senior legal counsel at Fortescue, gave direct instructions to Lancasters \nInvestigations to undertake some of the surveillance activities.\n\"On Tuesday 7 May 2024, Mr Huber instructed Lancasters Investigations to immediately reinstate their surveillance \nof the below locations in order to locate Dr Kolodziejczyk, and to immediately report to Fortescue any sighting of Dr \nKolodziejczyk,\" it was revealed in an affidavit by Paul Dewar.\nDewar is from Davies Collison Cave, the law firm acting for Fortescue in the intellectual property case.\nElsewhere in that affidavit, Dewar detailed again Huber's instruction to Lancasters Investigations. \"I am informed by \nMr Huber and believe it to be true that he today instructed Lancasters to investigate whether Dr Kolodziejczyk and \nMr Masterman are presently located in [Western Australia's] Port Hedland or Boodarie. I am informed by Mr Huber \nand I believe it to be true that he has today examined Dr Kolodziejczyk's Facebook, X and lnstagram accounts, and \nthey do not provide any indication as to Dr Kolodziejczyk's present location.\"\nHuber was also included in the correspondence between Lancasters Investigations and external lawyers, as was \nPhil McKeiver, who was Fortescue's chief general counsel.\nMcKeiver had last month offered his resignation over the surveillance tactics that were used, but has been retained \nby Fortescue, albeit without his previous responsibility as company secretary.\nIn Dewar's affidavit, he said it was Fortescue that had engaged Lancasters Investigations \"with the aim of \nestablishing the identity and location of each of the respondents to the search order application\".\nThe spying that was carried out occurred over a three-week period in April and May this year. It included \nphotographing and following the three men, including to the gym, cafes, to the beach, shopping centres, the airport, \nthe hairdresser, accountant, and other meetings, as well as to their work and homes.\nThe spying occurred in Melbourne and Perth and included following Kolodziejczyk and his wife to their child's \ndaycare centre. It also included detailing the school times of a teenage family member of Winther-Jensen.\nThe spying also included details of the arrival of personal mail and packages at the men's home addresses, \nproviding walking maps of routes they took, and floor plans of Kolodziejczyk and Winther-Jensen's homes.\nPhotos were taken of mail delivered to Masterman's home address, and investigators also searched his rubbish bin. \n\"It was noted the previous mail was still protruding from the mailbox,\" the investigator's report said of Masterman's \nhouse. \"Also noted was there were two new letters. A search of the garbage bins noted no new rubbish at this \ntime.\"\nMasterman was surveilled by the private investigator even though he was not a party to the search orders that \nFortescue would seek in the Federal Court.\nElement Zero staff who were also not party to the search orders were also photographed and followed by \nLancasters Investigations, and the report details the use of covert cameras to surveil the office.\nFortescue conducted the surveillance to obtain search orders that allowed it to raid Element Zero's office and the \nhomes of Kolodziejczyk and Winther-Jensen, which would result in it gathering almost 3 terabytes of data from \ncompany documents and their personal devices, email and cloud accounts.\nElement Zero's lawyers have objected to the huge amount of data that was gathered during those raids, claiming \nthere is a substantial amount of confidential and private information that does not relate to the court case.\nElement Zero was formed by Kolodziejczyk and Masterman at the end of 2022. Masterman has had a long career \nin the energy industry, including as chief financial officer of what was then known as Fortescue Future Industries \n(FFI).Page 3 of 3\nFortescue in-house lawyer issued spying orders, court documents reveal\nKolodziejczyk was once FFI's chief scientist and led a push to develop green hydrogen to decarbonise the \ncompany's mining operations and shipping fleet. Fortescue has since wound down its hydrogen ambitions.\nKolodziejczyk is now Element Zero's chief technology officer. Winther-Jensen also worked as a scientist at FFI \nbefore joining Element Zero. He departed Element Zero in January this year.\nElement Zero ambition is to reduce the carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry. It has \npatented a technology that aims to convert metal ores to metals, not only iron ore, with zero carbon emissions.\nFortescue has said it would \"vigorously\" defend its intellectual property in the development of cutting-edge \nsolutions to decarbonise its Australian iron ore operations by the end of the decade.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

A government discussion paper estimated that the \nsector could be worth up to $120 billion.\nLoad-Date: August 7, 2024\nEnd of Document",

I consider that the Element Zero process is substantially the same process as that \nwhich Dr Kolodziejczyk took steps to develop while employed at Fortescue. That is because both processes are \nbased on a hydroxide electrolyte where the water has been removed to make an ionic liquid.\" Dr Bhatt also says he \nreviewed Dr Winther-Jensen's email folders at Fortescue and \"identified five documents of concern that Dr \nWinther-Jensen emailed from his Fortescue professional email address ... to his personal email address ... \nbetween his resignation from Fortescue on November 3, 2021 and his final day at Fortescue, November 12, \n2021\".\n\"Each of the five documents is confidential and directly relevant to the Fortescue project.\n\"Following my review ... I consider that the leaching technical report, iron ore leaching update, TEA Sheet and TEA \nCovering Email contain information that would be of particular value in progressing a competing research and \ndevelopment project in relation to the purification of iron ore utilising electrochemical reduction.\n\"I cannot conceive of any legitimate reason for Dr Winther-Jensen to have sent an email attaching any of these \ndocuments in the November 2021 period. I am concerned that the confidential information in each document could \nhave been misused, could continue to be misused and/or may in the future be misused by Dr Winther-Jensen and \nElement Zero.\" FFI employee Adrian Huber has also claimed in his affidavit that Dr Kolodziejczyk was the subject of \ncomplaints he misrepresented his qualifications.\nA subsequent Deloitte investigation, Mr Huber's affidavit says, found Dr Kolodziejczyk made \"material \nmisrepresentations and inaccuracies in respect of activities, positions held and qualifications\" in his CV.\nA letter published as part of the trove of documents also raises concerns about Dr Kolodziejczyk's behaviour \nfollowing his resigning from FFI in mid-2021, and then later retracting his resignation.\n\"All of us who serve at FFI, would like to support you and see you successful,\" the letter, from then-FFI CEO Julie \nShuttleworth says. \"Bart, this however will necessitate a substantial behavioural change by you and leads me to our \nchairman's chief concern, to your failure to be a positive and encouraging leader.\" The nature of the concerns about \nDr Kolodziejczyk's behaviour are not detailed in the letter.

Dewar disclosed that Fortescue had instructed Lancasters Investigations to conduct surveillance on \nKolodziejczyk, Winther-Jensen and a third individual to establish their identities and locations.\nThe surveillance included detailed observations, such as Winther-Jensen watering his garden and following a \nwoman into a shopping centre. Despite a search order granted by Justice Melissa Perry permitting raids on \nKolodziejczyk's home, Dewar's affidavit revealed that the investigators also spied on properties owned by Michael \nMasterman, who was not targeted by the search orders.\nPage 2 of 2\nGreen iron battle: Fortescue raided former staff to investigate 'IP theft'\nAn affidavit from a solicitor for Element Zero, Kolodziejczyk and Masterman, highlighted concerns over the invasive \nnature of the surveillance and the extensive data capture during the search orders. Williams said around three \nterabytes of data were seized, containing confidential and privileged information that was unrelated to the case.\nUpon discovering the surveillance, Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest expressed his surprise and warned the FMG \nlegal team. \nA new affidavit, from mining and engineering consultant Wayne McFaull, asserts that Element Zero's rapid progress \ncould only be attributed to having access to Fortescue's design documents from January 2023. \nMcFaull claims that Element Zero's $5 million research fund was not enough for the level of research and \ndevelopment they achieved. He said, \"Projects in the nature and complexity of the Fortescue project and the \nElement Zero project take a great deal of trial and error.\"\nElement Zero has denied Fortescue's claims and is challenging the private search and seizure orders.

And the documents also show that a second law firm, Seyfarth Shaw, \nwas also involved in overseeing the investigator's work.\nSeyfarth Shaw was first hired by Fortescue in early 2023 to investigate an anonymous complaint to the company's \nboard that Dr Forrest had had an inappropriate relationship with a Fortescue staff member.\nOn Thursday Justice Brigitte Markovic rejected the orders sought by Element Zero for the instructions issued to \nLancasters, saying they were likely the subject of legal professional privilege and the concerns aired by the three \nmen about the conduct of Fortescue's investigators could be dealt with at a hearing later this month, when Element \nZero will seek to set aside the original search orders and argue for the return of their data.\nLawyers for Element Zero also lost an application to cross-examine Davies Collison Cave lawyer Paul Dewar over \nallegations the law firm's initial evidence to the court to win the secret search orders made material omissions that \nmight have damaged its -application.\nWhile arguing that the cross-examination should not be allowed, Fortescue lawyer Julian Cooke SC also flagged a \ndesire to cross-examine Mr Masterman and Element Zero lawyer Michael Williams, if the Element Zero application \nwas successful. \"I'd seek to cross-examine Mr Masterman and Mr Williams, about their so called privacy concerns,\" \nhe said.\nLoad-Date: August 8, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 19\nLength: 623 words\nByline: Brad Thompson and Elouise Fowler\nBody\nWest Australian premier Roger Cook has backed unions seeking to re-establish themselves in the Pilbara iron ore \nindustry despite warnings from the nation's biggest miners about risks to productivity and their ability to remain cost-\ncompetitive.\n\"The Cook government supports WA workers and their unions undertaking collective bargaining with employers for \nbetter pay and conditions,\" a spokesman for Mr Cook said.\n\"Unions play an important role in our society representing workers in a diverse range of industries, including the \nmining and resources sector.\"\nIron ore royalties generated from largely union-free mines are the backbone of the WA economy, most flowing from \nRio and BHP. Both companies sounded alarm over the Albanese government's industrial relations changes that \nhave allowed unions to force BHP to the negotiating table on a collective bargaining agreement.\nWA has already forecast iron ore royalties will fall by more than 35 per cent, or $3.5 billion, in 2024-25. The forecast \nis based on the iron ore price falling to $US71 a tonne amid concerns about the strength of the Chinese economy \nand its real estate market.\nThe Cook government said the new bargaining provisions in the Fair Work Act were the responsibility of the \nAlbanese government.\nUnder these new rules, unions no longer need to demonstrate that the majority of the workforce supports collective \nbargaining, as long as an agreement is within five years of expiring.\nThis has opened up terrain for the Australian Workers' Union to pounce, forcing BHP back to the negotiating table \nto start bargaining on wages and conditions at the Mining Area C and South Flank mines. BHP's last agreement on \nthis site expired in August 2019.\nThis is the last agreement covering iron ore mines that can be triggered by federal Labor's new provisions, The \nAustralian Financial Review understands. Unlike BHP, Rio is not compelled to negotiate with unions because its \nPage 2 of 2\nWA premier backs union drive for membership in Pilbara mines\nenterprise agreements expired before 2019. Fortescue has not struck a collective agreement in more than a \ndecade.\nStill, the big miners fear a return to the strike-prone Pilbara of the 1980s if unions re-establish themselves in an \nindustry already grappling with softening prices for the steel-making ingredient and emerging competition from \nAfrica, including the Rio-backed Simandou project.\nThe Chamber of Mining and Energy WA, whose members include Rio Tinto, BHP, Fortescue Limited and Gina \nRinehart's Roy Hill, said unionisation of the Pilbara had the potential to increase costs and lower productivity.\n\"While we are fortunate to have a world-class resources industry, we also know Australia is a relatively high-cost \njurisdiction,\" CMEWA chief executive Rebecca Tomkinson said.\n\"Any levers that could further increase operational costs and uncertainty will jeopardise our investment \nattractiveness and need to be carefully considered by all parties.\"\nUnions are known to have targeted BHP and Rio as part of recent recruitment drives with limited success.\nUnion members made up just 10 per cent of the mining workforce in 2022, down from 16.5 per cent in 2016, \naccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Union membership on mine sites was 44 per cent in 1994. \nFortescue is understood to be the least unionised of the three biggest miners.\nAsked if it was concerned about unions gaining a foothold in the Pilbara, Fortescue said workers already received \nsome of the highest wages in the country together with other favourable terms and conditions.\nBHP said on Sunday it had been forced to bargain with unions under the new legislation, which does not require the \nunions to establish that the workforce is in favour of bargaining.\nRio has declined to comment on union demands that it come to the negotiating table.\nLoad-Date: August 15, 2024\nEnd of Document",

His story is not \nonly inspiring but also reflects the broader efforts of Fortescue to integrate First Nations values and business \npractices into their operations, culminating in a remarkable $5bn investment with Indigenous service providers and \nsuppliers.\nEarly life and career beginnings Mr Wheelock, a Badimaya/Wajarri man, grew up in Broome, Western Australia, \nspearing, and enjoying the freedom that those early days of growing up in the Kimberley had to offer.\nHis early life was shaped by the rich cultural heritage of classic Broome, as well as the challenges of Kimberley life. \nWhile his career began in the pearling industry, seeking more stable employment and driven by a desire to \ncontribute more significantly to his community, he enrolled in a Certificate III in Geoscience Practices at his local \nTAFE, setting his sights on the mining and resources sector.\n\"I started mining in my early 20s,\" Mr Wheelock recalls.\n\"Mining just made sense to me personally because of the fly-in, fly-out arrangement, and it offered a clear path for \ncareer advancement.\" His early days in the state's biggest industry were marked by a commitment to continual \nlearning and development, completing a degree in Mine Engineering and recently earning a Global Executive MBA.\nRise through the ranks at Fortescue Mr Wheelock's career at Fortescue spans over a decade, during which he \nhas held numerous leadership roles. Starting off as a technical services superintendent in 2011, he quickly \nadvanced through the ranks, as he pressed to always do more - a common theme of his life. He served as the \nproduction superintendent at Cloudbreak and later as the mining manager at both Fortescue's Cloudbreak and \nSolomon mines, where he oversaw critical operations and drove significant improvements in efficiency and safety. \nIn his role as general manager Eliwana, Mr Wheelock was instrumental in the operational readiness and \nPage 2 of 3\nLeader inspires change\nmanagement of the Eliwana Mine. His strategic vision early on, and his hands-on style saw the successful \ncommissioning and operation of the site in December 2020.\nIn March 2023, Mr Wheelock took on the role of Fortescue's general manager First Nations, where he has been \ninstrumental in consolidating the miner's First Nations functions into a cohesive unit. This strategic move has \nstreamlined processes and enhanced the company's engagement with Indigenous communities, ensuring that \nFortescue's initiatives have been both more co-ordinated and more impactful.\nPassion for Indigenous empowerment Throughout his personal and professional life, Mr Wheelock has been \npassionate about creating opportunities for Indigenous people. His efforts align perfectly with Fortescue's \ncommitment to fostering Indigenous employment, training, and business development, with some of the most \nambitious targets for Indigenous engagement.\n\"We have a huge amount of talent within our organisation, and it's recognised which has given the opportunities \nthat those individuals deserve on their own merit,\" Mr Wheelock says.\n\"It's not because I'm Aboriginal that I am in this critical role; it's because of my track record in running operations, \nmanaging teams and solving complex problems. However being Aboriginal does give me unique and diverse \nperspectives.\" Mr Wheelock's personal journey of continuous professional development and his rise to leadership \npositions within Fortescue serve as an inspiration to many Indigenous people. He embodies the potential for \nsuccess when opportunities are made available and supported by strong organisational commitment at every level.\nFortescue's $5bn commitment to Indigenous businesses Fortescue's \"Billion Opportunities\" program, which began \nin 2011, is designed to boost Indigenous business participation across the company's entire supply chain.\nIn August this year, days before this magazine was launched, the initiative saw over $5bn in contracts awarded to \nmore than 190 Indigenous services and suppliers. In the 2023 financial year alone, there was more than $505m \nspent with Indigenous-owned businesses. Such a significant milestone underscores the company's dedication to \nfostering Indigenous economic independence and meaningful participation well ahead of its time.\nTime and again, Fortescue has demonstrated its commitment to seeing Indigenous-owned businesses get a bigger \nshare of the pie when it comes to their operations and engagement, but it's not without effort.\nAs Mr Wheelock says, \"We have to make sure we're helping Indigenous-owned businesses remove roadblocks or \nwhere they're having issues. Our Aboriginal business development team, that's their task, to help ensure they're \nsupporting these companies. We're really proud of this achievement.\n\"Even in Perth, it's not just about where our operations are. We've got things from coffee beans to stationery, we \nlook for wherever there's opportunity for Aboriginal businesses to be involved with our organisation.\"\nThe broader impact of Fortescue's initiatives Fortescue's approach to Indigenous engagement extends well \nbeyond business contracts. The company has over 1400 Aboriginal employees and ensures that there is \ncomprehensive cultural awareness training and support for Indigenous heritage across the company.\nThese efforts are all part of Fortescue's broader strategy to integrate Indigenous perspectives into all aspects of \ntheir operations. \"It makes you realise, when you take a step back and go, wow, we've actually achieved some \npretty incredible outcomes,\" Mr Wheelock says.\nNet zero commitment Fortescue's dedication to sustainability is encapsulated in its ambitious goal to achieve real \nzero terrestrial emissions by 2030 without the use of carbon offsets. This initiative is a testament to the company's \nforward-thinking approach and its commitment to reducing its environmental footprint.\n\"Fortescue emits more than 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent each year,\" Mr Wheelock notes. \"Our $US6.2bn \ninvestment in achieving Real Zero by 2030 is a significant step towards mitigating climate change and setting a new \nstandard in the industry.\" The integration of Kooya's electric all-terrain vehicles, for example, into Fortescue's \noperations is a tangible example of how the company's sustainability goals align with its commitment to supporting Page 3 of 3\nLeader inspires change\nIndigenous businesses. This collaboration with an Indigenous-owned business not only contributes to reducing \ncarbon emissions but also ensures that Indigenous enterprises play a central role in Fortescue's decarbonisation \njourney.\nA vision for the future Mr Wheelock's vision for the future is closely tied to Fortescue's ongoing efforts to uplift \nIndigenous communities through meaningful engagement and sustainable practices. His leadership and dedication \ncontinue to drive positive change within the company and beyond. \"We are incredibly proud of our approach to First \nNations engagement, whether it's through business opportunities, employment, or cultural heritage support,\" he \nsays. \"The journey has been challenging but immensely rewarding. I look forward to continuing this work and \nmaking a lasting impact.\" Rosli Wheelock's story is a powerful reminder of the transformative impact that dedicated \nindividuals and forward-thinking companies can have on Indigenous communities in Australia. Together with \nFortescue, it's these alignments of similar values and dedication which continue to lead the way in Indigenous \nengagement and environmental sustainability, and Mr Wheelock's role will undoubtedly be central to their ongoing \nsuccess. With a strong foundation in operational excellence and a deep commitment to Indigenous empowerment, \nhe is poised to help further Fortescue's vision of creating a sustainable and inclusive future. His work not only \nbenefits Fortescue but also sets a benchmark for other companies in the industry to follow and helps lift up \nIndigenous people across the country. \"\nLoad-Date: August 13, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Even some of her supporters don't fully understand the role and, at least politically, regard it as \nnothing more than a sop for the critics - that is, having now named an envoy, Anthony Albanese can safely deflect \nany allegation that his government has been a dithering, equivocating, morally limp-wristed mess on the issue.\nWhat's made matters worse, however, are the consequences of the PM's recent reshuffle of cabinet, which saw \nAndrew Giles not only dumped from immigration but also from his portfolio of multicultural affairs. Both have been \ngifted to Tony Burke, a bete noire of Jewish leaders who've criticised his tepid support for Israel in the aftermath of \nOctober 7, among other unhelpful, highly questionable remarks and positions.\nBurke, for example, backed the right of pro-Palestinian protesters to occupy universities. He's on record quoting \nHamas casualty figures as fact, and he's pledged full-hearted support for Canterbury-Bankstown Council's decision \nto fly the Palestinian flag - that was in the days after the southern Israeli massacre, well before Israel's ground \ninvasion even started in Gaza.\nIronically, he's simultaneously facing political annihilation in his own western Sydney seat of Watson, where an \nactivated Muslim population is threatening to oust him over a perception that Labor has been far too pro-Israel since \nthe start of the war.\nSomehow, Segal is supposed to report her findings on anti-Semitism to this politically conflicted minister, one who \nfaces electoral suicide if he puts a foot wrong and who's already demonstrated a total lack of insight and empathy \non the anti-Semitism itself.\nMeanwhile, not a word out of the PM's office about the impending appointment of a Special Envoy for \nIslamophobia. That's because of the genuine struggle to find a moderate Muslim leader willing to take on the role, \none that the government will accept, and one who'll at least be prepared to condemn what happened on October 7.\nPage 2 of 3\nLittle to envy about the envoys\nA tougher benchmark than everyone in cabinet realised, apparently.\nBuilding relationships The last time NSW Lands Minister Steve Kamper was spotted out on the town it was at a low-\nkey dinner in the company of a corrupt former Hurstville mayor, Con Hindi.\nAlso in attendance was construction boss Ronnie Wardan, head of Sydney firm Wardan Group, and his employee \nAmanda Ghalloub, but Kamper saw no need to declare this private meeting in his ministerial diary. He told Margin \nCall at the time that Wardan and Ghalloub were family friends and that Hindi wasn't invited but crashed the dinner \nand wouldn't go away. The minister, being a gentleman, just couldn't bring himself to tell Hindi to take a long walk.\nThe only reason to relive this matter is that Kamper has unfortunately been spotted once again in a deep, offline \nconversation with a prominent character in the NSW property game, this time developer Fouad Deiri, chairman of \nDeicorp, who had the pleasure of chewing Kamper's ear at an NRL football game last weekend.\nKamper told us he was invited to the Dragons v Bulldogs match by the St George CEO and spent most of the game \nin the Captain's Lounge. Not according to one eyewitness, who told Margin Call that Kamper seemed to spend \nmuch of the game in the Deicorp box.\nA spokesman for Kamper said the interaction with Deiri was hardly for most of the match. \"The minister dropped \ninto Fouad's box for about 15 minutes to distract himself from the score,\" they said. The Dragons, for what it's \nworth, were snuffed out 28-10 by the Bulldogs, the flak adding: \"The minister has known Fouad from when he still \nworked on the tools.\" That is, for decades, when a much younger Deiri wasn't the leader of a developer-builder \nempire and instead an apprentice carpenter starting out in the trade.\nThese sightings wouldn't be so awkward if Kamper wasn't the Minister for Lands and Property, a portfolio of \nimmense consequence to guys like Deiri and Wardan, and anyone else whose business is real estate. It seems just \nabout everyone in this sphere is very old mates with the minister!\nSubtle sledgehammer So little love has been lost between Fortescue and three former employees of the company \naccused of stealing intellectual property - if only to establish their own rival green steel start-up concern.\nFortescue's ham-fisted private investigators followed the trio around for weeks, spied on their families and rifled \nthrough their mail.\nBut court documents in the case suggest the animosity Fortescue felt towards former chief scientist Bart \nKolodziejczyk might go back well before the company launched legal action this year.\nWhat other conclusion are we to draw when the mining major named a special report in search of misconduct \n\"Project Sledgehammer\". Surely a hint of the whacking to come, if nothing else. Kolodziejczyk left the company in \nNovember 2021.\nAhead of his departure Fortescue allegedly called in Deloitte to run a forensic sweep on his laptop and phone, \nlooking for evidence he was taking proprietary information with him.\nAs it turns out, Deloitte's Project Sledgehammer (released in December) was something of a swing and a miss, \nidentifying no wrongdoing.\nYou'd expect such a bold title to get a mention in court when the trio try to have Fortescue's case against them \nthrown out next week. If nothing else, it offers an easy argument that Fortescue's legal case is as much about \ntrying to scare off would-be competitors than it is about IP theft.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Twiggy's subtle as a sledgehammer\nLoad-Date: August 13, 2024Page 3 of 3\nLittle to envy about the envoys\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1082 words\nHighlight: Court documents reveal a development in the intellectual property case in which Fortescue hired private \ninvestigators.\nBody\nBillionaire Andrew Forrest was \"generally updated\" on a rival's mineral processing technology that converted iron \nore into green iron, and discussions to test that technology on Fortescue's iron ore, according to court documents.\nForrest's Fortescue Metals Group is suing Element Zero, a start-up that developed that mineral processing \ntechnology.\nFortescue has claimed in the Federal Court that the three men behind Element Zero, who are ex-Fortescue \nemployees, have infringed its intellectual property. It is claimed Element Zero was launched using technology that \ntwo of the men, who are scientists, had helped develop at Fortescue.\nThe three men have denied the allegations and stated the technology was developed separately from their former \nwork at Fortescue.\nIn correspondence submitted to the Federal Court, it was revealed that Michael Masterman, a former long-time \nlieutenant to Forrest, was seeking a meeting with Andrew Hamilton, a technical director at Fortescue, and also its \nchief executive, Dino Otranto, in January this year. The meeting was to discuss the technology. Also included in the \ncorrespondence was Phil McKeiver, Fortescue's chief general counsel and then company secretary.\nIn that correspondence, Masterman said: \"I have kept Andrew Forrest generally updated and let him know that I \nwould follow up with you guys.\" Forrest is Fortescue's executive chairman, the founder of the mining group, and its \nlargest shareholder.\nThe intellectual property court case has made headlines after it was revealed that Fortescue had engaged a \nprivate investigations group to spy on and follow Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen, the \nthree men behind Element Zero. The spying also involved following the men's family members, including children, \nand other Element Zero staff for a three-week period.\nThe spying was done by Lancasters Investigations, a company founded by former British SAS soldier turned private \ninvestigator Robert Lancaster, which produced a 600-page report for Fortescue. Lancaster has posted photos of \nhimself holding weapons on Instagram, and photos from his days as a soldier. It was revealed in court that \nFortescue's in-house legal counsel, Adrian Huber, gave direct instructions to the private investigations group.\nPage 2 of 3\nNew evidence in court case as Fortescue takes aim at smaller rival\nReports and emails from Lancasters Investigations were also sent to Seyfarth Shaw Australia, a law firm that was \nalso used by Fortescue's board last year to investigate an anonymous claim that Forrest had a relationship with an \nemployee. The investigation by Seyfarth cleared Forrest of any wrongdoing, and found that none of the matters \nraised in the anonymous letter were substantiated.\nForrest last month said he had no knowledge of the extensive spying conducted on ex-staff and their families, \nincluding children, and was \"surprised to learn of the investigations\".\nThe billionaire, who is the world's 87th wealthiest person according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, said he was \nadvised by Fortescue's legal team that the spying was \"necessary in order to be granted search orders from the \nFederal Court\" in its case. Forrest's wealth is estimated at $US22.3 billion ($33.8 billion) by Bloomberg.\nLink to Image\nTrevor Collens\nFortescue's lawyers required the private investigator's report before a search warrant from the Federal Court could \nbe obtained. After the search orders were granted, raids were conducted on the homes of Kolodziejczyk and \nWinther-Jensen, and Element Zero's offices, in which 3 terabytes of data was obtained, including from \nKolodziejczyk and Winther-Jensen's personal emails, cloud accounts, mobile phones and personal computers.\nMasterman and other Element Zero staff were the subject of surveillance but not the search orders. Masterman's \npersonal mail was rummaged through and photographed by Lancasters Investigations.\nFortescue's McKeiver had last month offered his resignation over the surveillance tactics that were used, but has \nbeen retained by the mining group, albeit without his previous responsibility as company secretary. He stepped \ndown from that role in July.\nIn court earlier this month, it was revealed that Fortescue had conducted an internal investigation into \nKolodziejczyk, claiming he had overstated his professional record. This claim was made in an affidavit by \nFortescue's in-house lawyer Adrian Huber.\nKolodziejczyk is the co-founder of Element Zero, and its chief technology officer. Element Zero was formed at the \nend of 2022.\nKolodziejczyk was once Fortescue Future Industries' chief scientist and led a push to develop green hydrogen to \ndecarbonise the company's mining operations and shipping fleet. Fortescue has since wound down its hydrogen \nambitions. Winther-Jensen was a former FFI scientist before he joined Element Zero. He left Element Zero in \nJanuary this year.\nIn court earlier this month, Fortescue was successful in preventing Element Zero's lawyers' attempt to access \ninstructions given to Lancasters Investigations. Element Zero's lawyers also lost an application to cross-examine \nDavies Collison Cave lawyer Paul Dewar over claims the law firm's initial evidence to the court to obtain the search \norders made material omissions, which might have damaged its application.\nDuring those hearings, Julian Cooke, senior counsel representing Fortescue, said his client's case had nothing to \ndo with the meetings between Fortescue and Element Zero in January this year, when it was said: \"Your process is \ndifferent to our process.\"\n\"That's not part of our case,\" Cook said. \"Our case is they worked on our dime on a confidential process, the ionic \nprocess which they then, without our permission, utilised in the Element Zero process. That's the third part of the \ncase. The second part of the case is then they took documents to develop - to construct and design their pilot \nplant.It has got nothing to do with any alleged similarities between our process and their process which we accept, \nnot dispute ...\"Page 3 of 3\nNew evidence in court case as Fortescue takes aim at smaller rival\nElement Zero said it wanted to reduce the carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 510 words\nHighlight: Weeks ago Fortescue dumped a target to be a major producer of green hydrogen by 2030, but Andrew \nForrest still insists his native Pilbara can supply the globe with green iron.\nBody\nJust weeks ago Fortescue shed 700 workers and dumped a target to be a major producer of green hydrogen by \n2030, but the miner's billionaire owner Andrew Forrest still insists his native Pilbara can supply the globe with green \niron.\nStraight from a dinner in China the night before, the company founder pointed to the red dirt at his feet at \nFortescue's Cloudbreak mine, said, \"this is rich iron,\" then turned his hand up to the blue sky and said, \"and that is \nenergy.\"\nLink to Image\nPeter Milne\nThe simple proposition of combining ample raw material and energy occurring in the same place will succeed or fail \non practicalities.\nWhen questioned about whether he is overly ambitious, Forrest always has the justified retort that many doubted if \nthen tiny Fortescue could break the BHP-Rio Tinto duopoly and become the third force in Pilbara iron ore mining.\nFortescue's $53 billion market capitalisation is proof he got it right, but Forrest's next challenge is tougher.\nHis first success, in iron ore, was as a late entrant into an existing business. This time he wants to be one of the first \nmovers into a sector that hardly exists outside the laboratory.\nSteelmaking produces by some counts 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Most of it is made from \niron ore - a mix of iron and oxygen - in huge integrated steel plants.\nFirst the oxygen is removed in a process called reduction, using coal for heat and to aid the chemical reaction. The \nresult is iron, and an enormous amount of carbon pollution. Next the iron is refined and turned into steel.\nForrest wants the first, most polluting part of the process, to be done in the Pilbara and to ship the zero-emissions \ngreen iron to the world.\nPage 2 of 2\nAndrew Forrest isn't giving up on his green iron Pilbara dream\nOn Friday he turned the first sod on what in 12 months' time is to be a $75 million electric smelting furnace to test \ndifferent ways of producing 1500 tonnes of green iron a year.\nRight now it is a flattened piece of dirt, but Fortescue was keen to show progress elsewhere. Zero-emissions iron \nneeds zero-emissions iron ore, and Fortescue is aiming for its mining to be fossil-fuel free by 2030.\nThat will require more than two gigawatts of solar and wind generation and massive battery storage to provide \nreliable power - enough for about a million homes, the company said.\nFortescue said the plant would use green hydrogen from one of the company's facilities, as well as an electric \nsmelting furnace.\nThe project milestone follows Fortescue's announcement last month that it would cut 700 jobs and merge its \nmining and energy divisions, as it also tempered its ambition to be a major producer of the clean fuel hydrogen.\nForrest has maintained he is committed to green hydrogen, and on Friday, West Australian Premier Roger Cook \nsaid hydrogen had an important role to play in remote areas such as mine sites.\n\"WA is on its way to becoming a global clean energy powerhouse, and a major producer, user and exporter of \ngreen iron,\" Cook said.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

The iron ore consumption doesn't go up in a straight direction, it has \na jiggered edge on an upwards curve and we're in one of those downward edges right now, but the trend will still be \nstrong.\n\"If you look at the big mega-trends out there, I'm not worried about their trends going up or down because they \nhappen to go up or down towards an upwards curve.\" According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, that \ncountry's steel production in July was 82.94 million tonnes, down 9 per cent on the previous month, as mills cut \nback due to subdued demand, lacklustre prices and tightening margins.\nIron ore's price has dropped to its lowest level since November 2022, $US95.25 a tonne, after topping $US144 a \ntonne on January 3, and the downturn has put pressure on major Australian iron ore -producers.\nDr Forrest was in the Pilbara on Friday showcasing his new green hydrogen technology, declaring it could easily be \n\"Australia's biggest ever industry.\" Fortescue's mission to build a sustainable iron supply chain in Western Australia \nkicked off on Friday with the founder showing off their latest hydrogen-powered technology at the green energy hub \nat Christmas Creek mine.\nThe $US50m project is expected to produce more than 1500 -tonnes per annum of green iron metal, with \nproduction anticipated in 2025. But while demand for the metal hit a near two-year low after China pulled back its \norders, Dr Forrest said he was not fazed.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest shrugs off iron ore price pullback\n\"I just came back from China where I went to ascertain with our leaders, with China's leaders, where they want to \ngo with green metals,\" he said.\n\"The pollution over the skies of China isn't sustainable. They need to keep on building their cities but if they can do \nit in a way that doesn't cause any harm then they're going to take that shot.\" The Christmas Creek processing plant \nwill use green hydrogen produced at Fortescue's gaseous and liquid hydrogen facility, the largest of its kind in \nAustralia, together with an electric smelting furnace to produce high purity green iron. Once established, the \ncompany hopes to supply the final product to almost any steel plant globally.\nDr Forrest in July abandoned ambitious green -hydrogen targets in a major -business backdown, pulling back from \nthe company's goal of producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030.\nStanding behind the all-new hydrogen-powered haul truck prototype, dubbed \"Europa\", Dr Forrest said that once \nthe old fleet of 80 trucks was replaced, the company would save about 4500 litres of diesel everyday, eliminating up \nto three million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year.\nClean-burning hydrogen has been hailed as a potential solution to a range of climate-related energy challenges, \nfrom fuelling trucks to generating electricity.\nVery little hydrogen is produced from sustainable energy sources today; most is made using natural gas and fossil \nfuels.\nFortescue plans to use solar or wind energy to power electrolysers that split water into hydrogen and oxygen. \nProducing hydrogen as an economically viable energy source in Australia is high on Dr Forrest's priority list, but he \ncould not estimate when that would happen.\n\"Oil is about $80 a barrel now. When oil started, let's be clear, it started at equivalent dollars of $1600 a barrel, like, \nyou know, 20 times current.\n\"Industries don't start at really economic prices and then bingo,\" he said. The billionaire was joined by Fortescue \nMetals chief executive Dino Otranto for a ceremony to mark the start of civil works at the site.\n\"Hydrogen and fuels made using renewable energy will have a role to play in decarbonising mining, whether it's in \nbuses, heavy mining equipment such as haul trucks and excavators, or producing green iron,\" Mr Otranto said. \n\"This renewable hydrogen plant is versatile, enabling us to produce gaseous and liquid hydrogen to be used to \npower our mining equipment prototypes, while also providing the added benefit of refuelling our fleet of coaches at \nChristmas Creek.\" Dr Forrest also celebrated awarding $5bn to 200 First Nations businesses through the Billion \nOpportunities Program, which was established in 2011.\n\"This program has really been a game changer for us and it wouldn't be where it is today without the dedication of \nall of you - our First Nations business partners, and the incredible Fortescue team driving forward this -initiative.\" \nThe reporter travelled to WA as a guest of Fortescue.\nLoad-Date: August 16, 2024\nEnd of Document",

And yet, it \nstill managed to recruit one of the country's most powerful recent premiers, Mark McGowan, as its new non-\nexecutive chairman.\nFrontier's chief executive Adam Kiley announced McGowan's appointment yesterday as the company seeks to \ndevelop a parcel of land 120 kilometres south of Perth for a solar project. The recruiting coup was celebrated by the \nsolar shillers at the Smart Energy Council as a \"major milestone\".\nHow did Frontier get onto McGowan's radar? We can take a stab. Frontier's largest shareholder is mining \nPerthonality Grant Davey, who owns about 10 per cent of the renewable explorer's stock, and until yesterday was \nthe company's chairman.\nIn 2022, Davey was among the millionaires and billionaires at the WA Telethon Ball, the state's premier charity \ncommandeered by Kerry Stokes. That year, the top prize was a private lunch with Stokes and Prime Minister \nAnthony Albanese, with the winner ferried across the Nullarbor on a private jet donated by Tim Roberts. Davey bid \nfor it, but Roberts - no fan of the mining entrepreneur - gazumped him, bidding $525,000 for the pleasure.\nThat left Davey instead bidding on a private audience with (who else) McGowan. Did a charity event to raise money \nfor sick kids facilitate a meet-cute that ended up with a cushy post-political job on the board of a new energy \ncompany? Please dial down the Perthiness of it all.\nMcGowan getting poached into non-executive director land doesn't come free. Signing on, he was handed 2 million \nshare options, vesting over the next two years at levels between 20\u00a2 and 40\u00a2.\nThey are already in the money, and on the news of McGowan's recruitment, the share price jumped another 9 per \ncent to 50\u00a2. Nice business for Davey and the other members of the board, including Dixie Marshall, the former Nine \nnewsreader who left journalism last decade to run Colin Barnett's media operation.\nPage 2 of 3\nRear Window\nHas anyone sought more mileage so quickly in their post-political life than McGowan? The Frontier gig is his fifth \nsince announcing his shock exit from the premier's residence in May last year.\nThey're hardly benevolent public service roles either: he is now an adviser to BHP, Chris Ellison's Mineral \nResources, the soon-to-be private APM (which flew him to the Melbourne Cup for some reason), and on the roster \nof Joe Hockey's Bondi Partners.\nThe public knows veteran politicians will seek private sector careers to make the kind of money they couldn't get \nwhile in office. That it's often adjacent to their past responsibilities is part of the uncomfortable bargain. Whatever \nMcGowan's doing (so soon after proffering up excuses of being \"burned out\" and \"exhausted\"), is beginning to look \nlike a wind-up.\nTwiggy fills the ranks\nwith his PhD advisers\nFor billionaires, nothing counts so much as loyalty.\nThat's no doubt a large part of why Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest is pursuing former employees through the \ncourts, where his case against former Fortescue scientists Bartlomiej Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen \nopened yesterday.\nAnd it's probably why his current scientific team has been bolstered by those he can trust. Chief among them are \nthose who have seen him through academia's best instrument of torture. We speak, of course, of the PhD.\nIn 2019, Forrest was one of a few Australians to survive (and secure) a doctorate. In said document, he thanked a \nnumber of academics and technicians, a startling number of which later ended up involved in his corporate-\nphilanthropic empire.\nThere's Dr Shanta Barley, who was thanked for providing \"technical, logistic, intellectual and moral support\". She \nnow works at Fortescue in the role of chief climate scientist, having first been hired by Forrest's philanthropic \nMinderoo Foundation in 2020.\nProfessor Sarah Dunlop was, at the time of Forrest's PhD, a head of school at the University of Western Australia. \nShe's also with Minderoo now, where she heads up the Plastics and Human Health division.\nForrest also thanked Professor Daniel Pauly, who doesn't appear to work directly for Forrest. But Seas Around Us, \nthe research institute he heads, worked with Minderoo on its Global Fishing Index.\nForrest's PhD also notes the fieldwork and in-house technicians at the Centre for Marine Futures. Of the five names \nhe thanked, fully three (Alex McLennan, Claire Raphael and Nikki De Campe) have, in the five years since, worked \nor work for Minderoo.\nThere's nothing untoward about any of this. Minderoo is a charity shaped by Forrest's interests, and he likes marine \nbiology enough that he did a PhD on it.\nBillionaires always fill their courts with shiny personages that enter their orbit, and while few entourages look like \nthis, relatively few billionaires have spent much time on campus.\nThen, there's the trust thing, and Forrest has, by virtue of familiarity, more reason to put stock in this group of \nscientists than the ones he reckons ran off with Fortescue's trade secrets to start hydrogen start-up Horizon Zero \n(they are defending the case).\nBefore being convinced to undertake his PhD, Forrest donated $65 million to the University of Western Australia, \nfunding a new residential hall, scholarships and post-doctoral fellowships. The university can't begrudge him luring \naway a few star academics. Though, not the biggest star. The person most integral to his PhD was Professor Page 3 of 3\nRear Window\nJessica Meeuwig, whose parents he effusively thanked in its first page (\"this immense character can only wellspring \nfrom enlightened and encouraging parenting\", he gushed).\nDr Meeuwig has never worked for Fortescue. Though Forrest briefly invested in Buru Energy, the gas business \nfounded and, until Friday, chaired by her husband.\nGabby RBA spills\nits press flacks\nLast week, Labor hack turned lobbyist Stephen Conroy called deputy Reserve Bank governor Andrew Hauser \"a \nfailed ideologue\", \"wrong\", and \"a wanker\". Or a \"tosser\", he added, translating for the British recruit.\nThis childish tirade was sparked by a spicy speech in which Hauser lamented the \"extraordinary certainty\" of the \n\"gurus and charlatans, geniuses and buffoons\" quoted on the path of interest rates.\nConroy - whose TG Public Affairs lobbies for embattled telcos and unpopular supermarket chains - could be \nprecisely the kind of overconfident, underqualified commentator Hauser was thinking of. Still, if the intention is for \nReserve Bank figures to keep giving interesting speeches, its figureheads are going to need some serious PR \nsupport.\nNo one could realise this better than newish chief communications officer Sally Cray, a former political headkicker \nwho used to be Malcolm Turnbull's principal private secretary.\nNearly two weeks ago, she embarked on a root-and-branch restructure of the two dozen-strong RBA comms team. \nIt has effectively spilled their jobs, forcing all of them to reapply for new, reconfigured roles in the Hunger Games \narena. All are now waiting to find out if they've been successful. May the odds be ever in their favour.\nSeasoned insiders described this whole process as very unlike the central bank. Though, surely, that's the point. \nThe review of the bank, commissioned by federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers last year, spends a whole chapter on the \nRBA's communications strategy, in the aim of radically boosting the central bank's transparency and accessibility.\nThe government ordered the review in the wash-up of former governor Phil Lowe's disastrous prediction interests \nrates wouldn't rise until this year. But no political good deed goes unrewarded. Now, the newly chatty bank is using \nthe press conferences the government forced upon it to discuss everything from government spending to the nature \nof public interest rate debate.\nIt's the kind of thing oppositions love, and it's driving the government crazy.

The subsidiary collapsed \nowing $29.9 million to its creditors, and the list of creditors included 45 local employees.\nHyzon Motors Australia had worked to retrofit hydrogen fuel cells into diesel trucks and buses from a site controlled \nby the RACV in Melbourne's south-east.\nAn Australian subsidiary of Korea Zinc, Ark Energy, was owed $2.89 million at the time of collapse, Cleanaway was \nowed $1.36 million and Wesfarmers subsidiary Coregas claimed $288,000.\nThe vast majority of Hyzon Australia's $29.9 million of debts were owed to Hyzon entities in the US and China.\nPage 2 of 3\nHydrogen collapse hits big Australian firms\nDespite vowing to cease working in Australia as part of efforts to focus more on North American markets, Hyzon's \nparent entity is now trying to acquire the Australian subsidiary under a deed of company arrangement that has been \nrecommended by the administrator, PKF partner Jason Stone.\nMr Stone told creditors they would get a better dividend if they accepted Hyzon's offer, because the US and \nChinese subsidiaries of Hyzon would not claim their full debts if the offer was accepted. But he said the Hyzon \nparent could seek repayment of its secured debts if the Australian subsidiary was instead put into liquidation.\n\"In the event the proposal is not accepted it is understood that HMI [Hyzon's US parent] and the other related party \nentities will seek to prove [reclaim debts] in the liquidation,\" Mr Stone said.\nHe said the best-case scenario under a liquidation was for creditors to receive 7\u00a2 for every dollar owed by Hyzon \nMotors Australia. But he said creditors could receive between 19\u00a2 and 60\u00a2 for each dollar owed if they accepted the \ntakeover by the US parent company.\nFortescue was named as a debtor to Hyzon Motors Australia, allegedly owing the collapsed company just over \n$55,000. Mr Stone did not explain in his report why Fortescue owed the money; however, he did say there was one \n\"after sales client\" who had been invoiced for \"spare parts and other support charges\".\nHyzon had transferred just over $1 million into an accountant's trust account in case Fortescue claimed repairs \nunder warranty on the 10 hydrogen buses it had purchased.\nMr Stone said the administrators were eligible to collect those warranty reserves, and he had ordered the third-party \naccountant to return the money.\n\"To date this has not occurred and proceedings may need to be issued to recover the funds,\" he said.\nThere is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Fortescue.\nThe 10 hydrogen coaches are used to ferry workers between their mine site accommodation and the airport at \nFortescue's Pilbara iron ore mines.\nAustralian businessman Craig Knight led Hyzon to a Nasdaq listing in July 2021 amid a wave of cheap money and \na boom in hydrogen stocks.\nBut the stock has since lost more than 99 per cent of its value on the back of a regulatory probe and the failure of \nthe company to ramp up sales as quickly as hoped.\nMr Knight stepped down in mid-2022 and is barred from being a company director for five years after the US \nSecurities and Exchange Commission accused him of making false statements about Hyzon's progress.\nHyzon shares hit a new low of US5.4\u00a2 on Friday.\nMost other hydrogen stocks have also suffered steep falls over the past three years.\nNorwegian electrolyser manufacturer Nel is down 85 per cent since January 2021, while scandal-plagued Nikola \nMotors is down 99.6 per cent since June 2020.\nElectrolyser manufacturer Plug Power has lost 96.5 per cent of its value since January 2021.\nAside from higher interest rates and slow progress on technology delivery, hydrogen stocks have suffered from the \nfact subsidies promised under the US government's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have proved far harder to access \nthan expected.\nSentiment towards hydrogen has also suffered from perceptions that Republican nominee Donald Trump may scrap \nthe hydrogen incentives in the IRA if returned as president in November.Page 3 of 3\nHydrogen collapse hits big Australian firms\nHyzon's Nasdaq-listed parent lost $US85 million in the six months to June 30.\nLoad-Date: August 22, 2024\nEnd of Document",

One, because that's all it has \n- it's 100 per cent iron ore, and almost all of it goes to China. But secondly and more potently, its iron ore is inferior \nto BHP's and Rio's (and Brazil's Vale).\nThis is great when China is booming and iron ore is in demand; the price Fortescue gets starts to approach the \nBHP/Rio price.\nBut when the opposite occurs, as now, its iron ore price falls further and faster; and the drop in the price comes all \nand straight off Fortescue's profit.\nAnd, obviously, its company tax bill. The same goes for BHP and Rio. Hence, their pain is also Treasurer Jim \nChalmers's pain. And so ours.\nFor instance, as I've argued, it's going to be critical for the government to repeat its $300 electricity rebate in the \n2025-26 year.\nBut will the post iron ore-plunge budget numbers be able to afford it? The obviously unknown - but critically \nimportant for us - question is what happens in China, not just next year but through the rest of the 2020s.\nPage 2 of 2\nA few worries to iron out\nThough the big spenders in Canberra are unable to understand it, it's not just the budget revenues built on China \nbut our entire economic prosperity.\nEven if it doesn't buy them directly from us, like it does iron ore, China drives both the prices of and the volumes of \ncoal and gas we sell into the global market.\nIf their prices really plunged, and stayed down for any extended period, for all the post-fossil fuel fantasies of people \nlike Forrest and the minister for destroying our energy system, Chris Bowen, the Aussie dollar would really collapse \nand this country's economy would become a rubbish heap.\nYet, that would actually be good news for the rest of the world. Lower iron ore and energy prices would feed into \nlower prices for everything - and I really mean everything - across the world.\nYou would see sustained near zero inflation, much lower interest rates, and booming economies. Some of that \nprosperity would even filter down to our trash heap.\nNow as for the three companies themselves, apart from his now essentially abandoned hydrogen fantasies, Forrest \nhas shown zero interest in diversifying away from the total reliance on iron ore and on a never-ending China growth \nstory.\nAfter actually going long on iron ore and China, by selling out of fossil fuels, BHP is now trying desperately to \ndiversify into other commodities. Rio, extraordinarily, has just doubled down in Africa on its iron ore exposure.\nLoad-Date: August 19, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The search \norders, obtained by Fortescue in May, were granted by judge Melissa Perry based on allegations the men stole \nFortescue's intellectual property, including claims that Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen deleted emails and \ndocuments relating to the green steel concept from their personal laptops just before they resigned.\nBut the Federal Court heard on Monday that Justice Perry was not told the men were instructed to work from home \nin the weeks before they left Fortescue, and since their IT access was cut off they were forced to work on their own \ndevices and asked to delete some documents because there were copies.\n\"Her Honour is reading that material and no doubt thinking this is a classic former employee case that people on the \nway out the door \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 having resigned, have made off with highly confidential information,\" Element Zero barrister \nDavid Studdy SC said.\nEarlier, Mr Studdy said Justice Perry was repeatedly told the ex-Fortescue executives engaged in \"industrial scale \nmisuse\" of the mining giant's confidential -information.\n\"That phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 cannot be excused as a throwaway line or a barrister flourish.

Mr Studdy said his clients were \n\"very concerned\" a large amount of private and \"highly confidential\" material, including some belonging to third \nparties, was taken.\nIt was also alleged that Mr Masterman, who is a party to the proceedings, was discussing Element Zero technology \nwith Fortescue up until February this year to explain how it worked, but Justice Perry was not told about this.\nJustice Markovic said that even if the search orders were discharged, \"the fact is you can't undo what's been done\".\nMr Studdy responded that if his clients were successful, then the material collected from their homes and offices \ncould at least be returned to them and taken out of the hands of independent solicitors.\n\"The material non-disclosure and inaccurate and misleading information put before the court caused Her Honour \n\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 to find a strong primary case contrary to the true position,\" he said.\nThe extraordinary legal fight between Fortescue and Element Zero was revealed in July, weeks after the raids \nwere carried out. Fortescue hired a private eye, Robert Lancaster, to spy on Element Zero staff and their families, \nincluding rummaging through their mail, following wives of the directors to Kmart and taking pictures of their \nchildren.

Morningstar upgraded its Fortescue rating to hold.\nLast week, Citi analysts said the company's 100 per cent iron ore exposure had \"proved problematic\", but it \nnonetheless slapped a buy rating on the shares given the historically cheap price.\n\"[We] upgrade to buy given the depth of the valuation discount rather than our still cautious iron ore view,\" Citi \nanalysts told investors last week.\nThe slew of buy ratings follows a 41 per cent decline in Fortescue shares since the start of the year, outpacing a \nretreat in iron ore peers BHP and Rio Tinto, which have fallen 21 per cent and 19 per cent respectively in 2024.\nThe shares have been weighed down by falling iron ore prices, which was down as much as 30 per cent this year \non slowing global growth and waning demand from China's property sector.\nPage 2 of 2\nWeak share price lures funds to Fortescue Iron ore\nThe weaker commodity price arrives at an already challenging time for Fortescue, which last month delayed its \nmuch-hyped push into green hydrogen and continues to battle a federal court case relating to an IP feud with three \nformer executives.\nFurther, signs that longtime funding partner US-based Capital Group has been selling billions of dollars in shares \nhave also hurt investor confidence in recent weeks.\nDespite the headwinds, Mr Kourtis said the bearish outlook was reflected in its already-weak share price.\n\"Negative sentiment around sluggish but flat Chinese steel demand, elevated China port inventory and an \nimproving iron ore supply outlook from West Africa have weighed on the big three Australian iron ore producers,\" he \nsaid.\n\"However, we believe the valuation buffer now accounts for much of the risk to spot prices moving below $US100 a \ntonne.\"\nWhile the steepening sell-off in iron ore and mining shares - the commodity fell 9 per cent last week to trade well \nbelow $US100 a tonne - caught Fortescue buyers off guard, it was profitable for some hedge funds. Those include \nSydney's Sage Capital, which said its short against Fortescue was the top contributor to returns last month.\nLooking ahead, Sage Capital portfolio manager Sean Fenton said he remained bearish on the outlook for iron ore. \n\"We anticipate iron ore and lithium to remain weak due to excess industrial capacity created in China due to \ndomestic policy that encourages the economy to diversify away from housing,\" he said.\nOthers also remain cautious, with nine of the 16 equity analysts covering the stock sticking with a sell rating. UBS \nreiterated its sell recommendation this week, saying the iron ore miner was more exposed to further weakness in \nthe iron ore price than diversified miners BHP or Rio Tinto.\nLoad-Date: August 23, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Mr Cooke said Element Zero's bid to have the search orders discharged was a \"cynical attempt\" to prevent \nhis client from viewing material seized in raids and to delay filing their defence.\n\"The discharge application has been a monumental waste of time and is a distraction from the real issues to be \ndecided,\" he said.\nDocuments and emails referred to intellectual property concepts about \"green\" projects, including the green iron \nconcept, the court was told. Mr Cooke said the evidence before Justice Perry supported her conclusion that \nFortescue had a \"strong prima facie case\" in favour of granting the search orders.\nSignificantly, he denied Ele-ment Zero's claim that Justice Perry should have been told they were co-operating with \nFortescue to allay the mining giant's concerns in December last year and January this year by meeting with it to \ndiscuss technical differences between the organisations' green technologies - before she approved the search \norders.\n\"Mr Masterman was co-operating because he wanted to persuade Fortescue there were no relevant similarities \nbetween the Element Zero electrochemical reduction process and the Fortescue electrochemical reduction process \nso that Fortescue would not bring a case on any such claim,\" Mr Cooke said.\n\"Fortescue's pleaded case \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is (not) that the Element Zero process is the same or similar to the Fortescue \nparticle process.\n\"Rather, the respondent misused what's defined as the Fortescue Confidential information - the ionic liquid \nresearch and development which is fundamentally different from the Fortescue particle process.\" Mr Cooke said \nFortescue also claims Element Zero misused its confidential plant information.\nMr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk were in court for Tuesday's hearing. Federal Court judge Brigitte Markovic has \nreserved her judgment in the interlocutory matter.\nLoad-Date: August 20, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 27\nLength: 701 words\nByline: Alex Gluyas\nBody\nAnalysts are warning investors against jumping back into the beaten-up mining giants, given Beijing is offering little \nhope of stabilising China's property crisis, presenting a continuing headwind for commodity prices.\nThe red flag from Morningstar comes as iron ore's spot prices hover near a two-year low of about $US95 a tonne. \nPrices have plunged more than 30 per cent this year as weakness in China's construction activity hurts steel \ndemand, leaving mills unprofitable and unwilling to buy the commodity.\nThat has whacked the valuations of the sharemarket's largest mining stocks - BHP and Rio Tinto are down about \n20 per cent this year, and Fortescue has plunged more than 40 per cent.\nAlthough the Chinese government has increased support for its property sector, Morningstar believes much more \nneeds to be done to stabilise the industry and trigger a sustained rebound in mining shares.\n\"The price falls are justified in our view and are a rational reaction to demand headwinds from China. All three \nminers were overvalued. They are now fairly valued,\" said Morningstar equity analyst Jon Mills.\n\"There is little for an investor to do but hope for a turnaround in China. We think that is unlikely.\"\nThe bearish outlook chimes with that of the hedge fund industry, which has been targeting iron ore stocks. Short \npositions in Rio Tinto are sitting at the highest level in at least three years and bets against Mineral Resources have \nhit a record.\nIt's also been fuelled by a wave of short-sellers in Asia pulling money out of poor-performing Chinese equities and \nredirecting the funds into targeting Australian mining stocks.\n\"Asian hedge funds have been aggressively shorting Australian resource stocks as a proxy for what they expect to \nsee from China - weak growth,\" said Bell Potter strategist Richard Coppleson.\nAnalysts also agree that Fortescue is the most vulnerable to lower iron ore prices, given it is a pure-play producer \nand its margins sit well below rivals BHP and Rio Tinto. That is partly because Fortescue sells a lower-grade \nPage 2 of 2\nBHP, Rio Tinto still at risk from China crisis Iron ore\nproduct compared with the 62 per cent iron ore benchmark. This means it costs more for customers because of the \nwaste created when transporting and processing the ore, the additional energy/coal per unit of steel, and lower \nblast furnace productivity.\nThis results in a lower realised price compared with the benchmark. In the 10 years to June, Fortescue realised a \n23 per cent discount compared with the benchmark price.\nWhile the eventual ramp-up of Fortescue's higher-grade Iron Bridge joint venture will help, Morningstar warns that \nthe company's margins will fall more than its rivals if iron ore prices continue to decline.\nHowever, not everyone agrees. Some fund managers - including Ellerston Capital's Chris Kourtis - and brokers are \nturning bullish on Fortescue, citing its low share price as an attractive entry point for investors. Morningstar has \nalso flagged the risk from BHP's exposure to the Chinese economy, given the mining giant's earnings are \ndominated by iron ore and copper.\n\"With demand for many commodities likely to soften as the China boom ends, particularly iron ore... we think the \noutlook is for earnings to materially decline,\" Mr Mills said.\nBHP is regarded as the most resilient to weaker iron ore prices because of its low-cost and high-quality assets, \nmaking it one of the few miners that remains profitable through the commodity cycle.\nIt's why UBS has nominated it as the best option for investors amid weaker prices, but it also warns that the stock's \nprice-to-earnings ratio is trading up towards its long-term average.\n\"On a historical basis, BHP does not appear to be especially cheap currently,\" said UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw, \nwho has a \"neutral\" rating on the stock.\nThe broker has the same recommendation for Rio Tinto, and notes that both companies will derive about 30 to 40 \nper cent of their earnings outside iron ore in the next two years.\nThe share prices of both closely follow the iron ore price, given it is the core driver of earnings - a trend UBS \nexpects to continue until that equation changes.\nThat could spell further trouble for both stocks - some analysts predict that iron ore prices will drop below $US90 a \ntonne.\nLoad-Date: August 24, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Futures added 0.8 per cent to $US99.25 a tonne yesterday, and have bounced more than 7 per cent from \nlast week's two-year low of $US91.45.\nThe swift rebound follows a 9 per cent plunge in prices last week, which added fresh momentum to Asian hedge \nfunds targeting Australia's largest mining stocks.\nShort positions in Mineral Resources hit record levels this week, and bets against Rio Tinto are at the highest in \nmore than three years.\nThat trade has paid off, with BHP, Rio Tinto, Fortescue and MinRes down more than 20 per cent this year, but \nthere are signs of that unwinding after all four miners rallied on Wednesday.\nBHP jumped 2.6 per cent from its low, Rio Tinto gained 2.7 per cent, Fortescue 4.9 per cent and MinRes 7.5 per \ncent. All four extended those gains yesterday. \"Asian hedge funds were still shorting Aussie resource stocks \n[yesterday morning], but as they saw iron ore still rallying, it looked like they went to the sidelines to see if this is a \nfalse recovery, or it keeps going and takes iron ore back above $US100,\" said Bell Potter strategist Richard \nCoppleson.\nThat \"would be a disaster for all the shorts and see some trying to cover\".\nIron ore's rapid turnaround has been triggered by reports that Beijing is considering a new funding option for local \ngovernments to buy unsold homes. It would involve the issue of so-called special bonds, which are currently \nrestructured for use in infrastructure and environmental projects.\nThe potential support follows a series of rescue packages that have failed to stabilise China's real estate market - a \nbig source of iron ore demand.\nPage 2 of 2\nShort-sellers brace for iron ore back at $US100 Commodities\nThat included 500 billion yuan ($104 billion) of funding to purchase excess housing inventory for conversion to \naffordable homes. But with market estimates indicating that between 2.5 trillion yuan and 7 trillion yuan is needed to \nabsorb the excess housing in China's property sector, traders have been left disappointed.\nAnalysts remain divided on the direction of iron ore prices and mining stocks from here.\nMorgan Stanley strategists told clients yesterday they did not expect iron ore to stay under $US100 a tonne for \nlonger than one to two months because lower prices would force higher-cost producers to curtail supply.\nThe broker estimated that about 80 million tonnes of production was making losses at current prices, with about 93 \nper cent of that coming from Chinese supply.\nMorgan Stanley also said the increase in supply from Australia and Brazil in the first half, which weighed on prices, \nlooks to have passed.\n\"Although a rebound in iron ore prices will benefit all iron ore miners, it is likely to benefit higher-cost miners more,\" \nnoted its equity analyst Rahul Anand.\nFor that reason, the broker prefers Minerals Resources followed by Rio Tinto. It has an \"overweight\" rating on both \nstocks.\nIt is \"equal weight\" BHP and remains \"underweight\" Fortescue given the company's continued spending on green \nenergy, which threatens its free cash flow generation and future dividend payouts.\nThat stands in contrast to some fund managers - including Ellerston Capital's Chris Kourtis, who sold his fund's \nBHP stake to buy Fortescue, and other brokers who have upgraded the stock to a buy.\nMorningstar also warned investors this week it was too early to jump back into beaten-up mining stocks, given \nBeijing had offered little hope of stabilising China's property sector.\nAnd Westpac, which has been one of the most vocal iron ore bears, is sticking with its view that prices of the \ncommodity will drop below $US90 a tonne this year.\n\"If we do see iron ore back into the late $US90s, we want to sell it again for that coming drop into the $US80s,\" said \nWestpac's head of commodity and carbon strategy Robert Rennie.\nLoad-Date: August 25, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 27\nLength: 885 words\nByline: Anthony Macdonald\nBody\nFor everything written about the iron ore price and its dip below $US100 a tonne, one statistic stands out.\nOnly 1 per cent of Chinese steel mills are currently profitable.\nOne per cent - that's hard to fathom. Yes, it is not unusual for Chinese steel mills to operate at a loss, but for only 1 \nper cent to be making money is ridiculously low and unlike anything seen in the past five years.\nThe 1 per cent statistic comes from a survey by Mysteel, a Chinese reporting agency.\nThe survey also showed these steel mills' hot metal output had dropped materially - much more than at the same \ntime last year.\nGoldman Sachs' commodities research team picked it up and said iron ore's \"fundamental outlook remains bleak\". \nThey called the past week's recovery rally - where iron ore bounced off its $US92 ($135) a tonne low to the high \n$US90s - \"unsustainable\".\n\"While both port and in-plant iron ore stocks declined this week, visible stocks remain elevated compared to \n'normal' August levels,\" the broker said. \"And mills' destocking (despite the drop in iron ore prices) could be an \nindication of a negative production outlook.\"\nGoldman struggles to see how iron ore can go back above $US100 without a material increase in hot metal \nproduction.\nWhy? Because on the supply side of the ledger, supply is strong - just ask Australia's big three listed iron ore \nminers, or Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting.\nAnd iron ore may need to stay below $US100 a tonne for a while to shake out some of the lower-quality miners (not \nour big four) and lead to any sort of supply-side response.\nPage 2 of 3\nThe 1 per cent that should spell fear\nCompounding the price fall is that Chinese iron ore stocks at ports and mills are near six-year highs - which means \nthey have plenty of stock sitting around even if that supply-side shake-out does arrive.\nSome iron ore watchers are calling it the end of the greatest commodity boom this century; one that has been \nespecially good to Australia.\nThey don't think China has a rabbit to pull out of the hat - something that would spark construction and demand for \nsteel - as it has repeatedly done when required in the past 15 years.\nIt creates an interesting backdrop for BHP and Fortescue's full-year results, due tomorrow and on Wednesday.\nThe last time we heard from Fortescue, chief executive Dino Otranto was phoning in to the June quarter production \ncall from China and talking up how hungry customers were for his company's iron ore, including from its Belinga \nproject in Gabon, Fortescue's first outside of Australia. We expect he'll still feel pretty bullish, even if data coming \nout of China is weak. It will be a similar test for BHP's Mike Henry.\nHow can Chinese steel mills keep buying so much iron ore when they don't make money?\nOn the economic front, Goldman's China property team also cut forecast property starts and completions for 2024, \nwhile its China economists think there is rising risk to Chinese growth. You don't have to be a genius to work out \nwhat that would mean for steel demand.\nAnd it is not just Goldman pointing out these weaknesses in China. Bank of America's August China consumer \nsentiment survey found only 30 per cent of respondents thought they would spend more in the coming six months, \ndown from 45 per cent in June, while income growth and future income expectations also weakened.\nYou couldn't blame Australia's large-cap fund managers for booking a post-reporting season trip to China to see it \nfor themselves. It is a huge concern, particularly for the Pilbara miners - who collectively export more than 1 billion \ntonnes of iron ore a year to China - and their investors. The Baowu chairman's \"severe winter\" proclamation for the \nsteel industry comment lingers.\nOf course, the big Australian miners can still make good money with iron ore at less than $US100 a tonne.\nAt $US95 a tonne, where it was a week ago, UBS analysts said BHP had the strongest margins thanks to its \nindustry-leading cash costs and higher iron content than WA rivals, and would still make more than $US50 a tonne. \nBrazil's Vale, Rio Tinto and Fortescue are next best, in terms of the majors.\nUBS said Mineral Resources is highest on its value-in-use cost curve, reflecting its higher-cost Pilbara hub \nproduction, and early phase ramp-up at the Onslow iron ore project.\nUBS says the supply-side response will come - it always does. Iron ore had traded below $US100 a tonne seven \ntimes since its peak in May 2021 ($US233 a tonne) and each time the market adjusted by supply exiting. The \nquestion is whether it takes a bit longer for the adjustment to help the iron ore price, given port stocks.\nWhatever happens in the near term, analysts and fund managers have called for iron ore to be below $US100 a \ntonne for years. It is not unexpected.\nWhile it's a big deal for miners' profits, it is also material to Australia's budget, given iron ore accounts for nearly \none-fifth of this country's exports. A $US10 a tonne decrease would shave $5.3 billion off Australia's nominal GDP \nthis year and $500 million from tax receipts, according to the federal budget papers, making it one of the budget's \nbiggest swing factors.\nThat makes it a big deal for the country. If the bears are right, and Australia's hungry iron ore customer is past its \npeak, the country will have bigger things to worry about than BHP, Rio and Fortescue's share prices and dividends.Page 3 of 3\nThe 1 per cent that should spell fear\nLoad-Date: August 28, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Both moved quickly to find new partners, \nboth equally raffish: Waislitz with singer-actor Rebekah Behbahani (currently filming a reality TV show while also \nbeing sued by her sister) and Pratt with former Noiseworks rocker Jon Stevens, once a fiance to Jodhi Meares until \nshe had him charged with domestic assault (police withdrew the case months later).\nNearly 10 years divorced and not a murmur of any financial discord between them. Both achieved spectacular \nwealth through their joint-ownership of Thorney Investments, started by Waislitz in the early 1990s, although \nHeloise was basically born into luxury through her late father's success with Visy.\nBut whatever held until now as a fragile peace appears to have shattered, with Margin Call learning of a breakdown \nin efforts to finalise their financial separation.\nThis has been months in the making, leaving an impasse and a pile of legal letters that lawyers have been unable \nto clean up themselves.\nUglier still is the fact that Heloise is allegedly moving to make a greater claim on her ownership of Thorney \nInvestments. Margin Call hears she wants a sizeable portion of the group, potentially enough to take it off her ex-\nhusband and relegate him to the very bottom of the annual rich list, or off the steep cliff that follows Glencore CFO \nSteve Kalmin (in 250th place, with a net wealth of $590m). Her camp says that because it was her father's seed \nmoney injected at the start of the business, she's technically entitled to more - even though it was repaid.\nAnd perhaps there's some truth to this claim.\nIn 1991, Waislitz was given a $1.15m parcel of Amcor shares by his late father-in-law, which was parlayed into a \n$300m investment portfolio by the end of the decade. Waislitz's current net wealth is estimated to be in the order of \nPage 2 of 3\nBillionairrre rich-listers in carve-up\n$1.5bn. Heloise, chair of the philanthropic Pratt Foundation, and still listed as a director of Thorney, is worth at least \ndouble that amount, but given her family's ownership of Visy and Pratt Industries, a far more dizzying sum is just as \npossible.\nThe devil in all this is that while Heloise may demand a greater claim, Waislitz could conceivably do the same with \nthe Pratt wealth, which could make a mess of matters, though even if he's tempted to hit that button Waislitz will still \nhave to wait his turn.\nSomeone is already attempting to make a play on the family estate and its trust, Paula Hitchcock, a 27-year-old \nhalf-sister to Heloise and her siblings Fiona Geminder and Anthony Pratt. This happens once every couple of years \nor so, meaning Waislitz will have to get in line.\nMine battle Desperate not to have its name besmirched, Rio Tinto is sicking its top scientists onto one of the world's \nmost influential academic journals.\nThey're demanding Scientific Reports, a peer-reviewed title that shares a publisher with the prestigious Nature, \nretract a paper that criticises Rio's bid to develop Europe's biggest lithium play in western Serbia.\nHaven't heard of the Jadar project? It's one of the hottest political potatoes in the Balkans right now, worth $2.4bn \nand likely to cement Rio's reputation as a leading lithium producer - if it goes ahead.\nOpposition to the project has drawn thousands of protesters onto Belgrade's streets and at one point dragged in \nSerbian tennis ace Novak Djokovic.\nNow, Rio chief scientist Nigel Steward and three Serbian colleagues are blasting nasty letters to the editor of \nScientific Reports, demanding it withdraw a July paper that said Jadar is \"not worth mining in terms of \nenvironmental risks\" and will \"certainly destroy one of only three water-bearing areas in Serbia\".\nWrong, wrong and wrong, says Steward's letter, which attacked a swag of apparent inaccuracies in the research \npaper, which, for a start, said the mine site would cover 2,431 hectares. Rio scientists say Jadar will only run to 220 \nhectares.\nAlso in dispute is the study's claims that liquid waste will end up being stored on a flood plain, and that Rio's \nexploration drilling has already contaminated the region. We'll spare you the technical reasons for why this triggered \nthe scientists but it does involve the finer points of dry tailing and storage.\nTo be fair, there's an abundance of self-interest at play from everyone throwing mud in this sandbox. The study's \nlead author, Dragana Dordevic, happens to be a longstanding critic of Rio's plans. Meanwhile, the Serbian \nacademics who signed Steward's letter are notably featured on the very Environmental Impact Statement that Rio \nsubmitted to Serbian regulators.\nScientific Reports might be a venerated periodical, but, hang on, it's also made some appalling retractions in recent \nyears.\nOne 2018 paper went viral after careful readers noticed Donald Trump's face in a picture of baboon faeces that \naccompanied the study.\nAnother said phone-hunching could cause a horn to grow on the back of your neck. It was retracted, as was a 2020 \nstudy linking integrity to body weight, which, to be fair, at least explains why newly-elected Australian PMs always \nlook slimmer once they hit the Lodge.\nDodgy tactics The hired-goons at Lancaster Global really stooped to some pathetic lows in their surveillance of \nformer Fortescue executives Bart Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn Winther-Jensen and Michael Masterman.Page 3 of 3\nBillionairrre rich-listers in carve-up\nFor anyone unfamiliar, these are the men who left Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Group to start a rival green-iron \noutfit, Element Zero, and who remain in a court battle over allegations they stole intellectual property from the \nmining major.\nFresh filings in the case shed even more light on how operatives (hired by Fortescue) behaved in their pursuit of \nKolodziejczyk.\nMargin Call has learned they tailed Kolodziejczyk's wife as she dropped her daughter at childcare, the really sad \npart being that the joes were idiotic enough to get burned and actually fled when she confronted them. There's also \na Kolodziejczyk neighbour mentioned in the papers who claimed to have expressed concerns about an occupied \ncar with heavily-tinted windows idling on the street for three straight evenings. This at a time when neither \nKolodziejczyk, his family, or anyone else involved in Element Zero had a clue that Fortescue was in a beef with \nthem - or that PIs were on their case.\nLoad-Date: August 26, 2024\nEnd of Document",

This growth was \ndriven by an 8% rise in the average revenue from hematite, which stood at US$103 per dry metric tonne (dmt).\nThe hematite C1 cost also saw a 4% increase, reaching US$18.24 per wet metric tonne (wmt). This was primarily \ndue to higher labour rates and cost escalations related to the mine plan, though these were partially mitigated by a \ncontinued emphasis on cost control.\nFortescue's underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 7% year-\nover-year to US$10.7 billion, reflecting the revenue increase. The underlying EBITDA margin remained strong at \n59%.Page 3 of 3\nFortescue delivers net profit after tax of US$5.7 billion\nMeanwhile, the company's underlying net profit after tax (NPAT) rose by 3% to US$5.7 billion. This increase was \nmainly due to the higher EBITDA, although it was partially offset by increased depreciation and amortisation \nexpenses stemming from higher capital expenditure and the commissioning of assets, including Iron Bridge, in \nFY24.\nIt maintains a robust balance sheet, characterised by low-cost, investment-grade terms and the absence of financial \nmaintenance covenants.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the company reported a cash balance of US$4.9 billion and gross debt of US$5.4 billion, \nresulting in a net debt position of US$0.5 billion. Fortescue's credit metrics remained strong, with a gross debt to \nlast 12 months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) ratio of 0.5 times and a \ngross gearing of 22%.\nThe company also demonstrated strong cash flow performance, with net cash flow from operating activities \nreaching US$7.9 billion, a 7% increase from the previous year. Free cash flow grew by 18%, totalling US$5.1 \nbillion.\nIn FY24, Fortescue's total capital expenditure and investments amounted to US$2.9 billion. This included US$1.9 \nbillion for sustaining and hub development, US$271 million for exploration and studies, US$155 million for iron ore \nprojects, US$224 million for decarbonisation efforts, and US$317 million invested by Fortescue Energy.\nLooking forward, FY25 guidance based on an assumed FY25 average exchange rate of AUD:USD 0.68 is:\n  \n\u2022 Iron ore shipments of 190-200 million tonnes, including 5-9 million tonnes for Iron Bridge (100 per cent \nbasis);  \n\u2022 C1 cost for hematite of US$18.50-US$19.75/wmt;  \n\u2022Fortescue Metals capital expenditure of US$3.2-US$3.8 billion; and  \n\u2022Fortescue Energy net operating expenditure of approximately US$700 million and capital expenditure of \napproximately US$500 million.\nLoad-Date: August 27, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Revenue for the period edged up 8 per cent to $US18.2 billion.\nFortescue received an average of $US103 a tonne for the 192 million tonnes of iron ore it shipped in the financial \nyear, however the price of the steelmaking ingredient has dropped by more than a third since January.\nThe miner announced a final dividend of 89\u00a2 a share, taking its full-year dividends to $1.97 a share (a payout ratio \nof 70 per cent), higher than the payout ratio of 65 per cent a year earlier. Andrew and Nicola Forrest own a 36.7 per \ncent stake in Fortescue.\nLink to Image\nPeter Milne\nThe latest results come as Fortescue has had to re-evaluate its green energy ambitions, cutting 700 jobs in July, \nas it scaled down its plans to become a green hydrogen superpower. The company had earlier set a target of \nproducing 15 million tons of green hydrogen (produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules using \nrenewable energy) a year by 2030.\nFortescue is also more exposed to the dip in iron ore demand, compared to its more diversified rivals - BHP and \nRio Tinto. Iron ore accounts for almost 90 per cent of Fortescue's operating sales revenue.\nJarden's analysts said on Wednesday that while the miner's underlying earnings met consensus expectations, net \nprofit after tax for the year fell short by 10 per cent due to increased depreciation. They added that continued falls in \nthe iron ore price would put the miner's future dividends under pressure, forcing Fortescue to keep a tight leash on \ncosts.\nFortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said the result was the third-highest earning in Fortescue's history.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue dividend delivers for Forrest despite modest profit jump\nMeanwhile, Fortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson said the division had achieved its two final \ninvestment decisions during the year to produce green hydrogen in Arizona and Queensland.\nThe company expects to spend up to $US3.8 billion on capital works in its mining division, and the nascent clean \nenergy business will be funded with about $US700 in operating expenses and $500 million of capital expenditure.\nFortescue shares were trading 1.8 per cent weaker at $18.30 in afternoon trading.\nThe Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

Green hydrogen, green ammonia, green iron \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.\nThe company now has two distinct arms, Fortescue Metals run by Dino Otranto, who oversees its profitable iron \nore operations, and Fortescue Energy, run by Mark Hutchison, who oversees Fortescue's array of green projects. \nPage 2 of 3\nTWIGGY'S BIG CHALLENGE\nSuch is the status of Fortescue Energy these days that the two are described as \"co-CEOs\" reporting to Forrest as \nthe globetrotting founder and executive chair.\nAfter looking at a wide array of potential green projects round the world, and facing rising energy costs globally, \nFMG has had to focus its thinking this year, scaling back its green hydrogen ambitions and announcing in July that \nFMG would be cutting 700 jobs from the total business.\nThe Energy division is expecting to spend $US1.2bn during the year - $US700m on operations and $US500m on \ncapital expenditure (a significant increase on the $US317m capex for the energy arm in the financial year just \nended).\nThe division, which had its gestation period in several trips around the world by Forrest in his jet in the depths of \nCovid, has now settled on its first energy projects.\nIt recently turned the first sod on its green hydrogen project in the US, Arizona Hydrogen, which is expected to start \nconstruction this year with production set for 2026, and started work on a 50MW green hydrogen project in \nGladstone in Queensland using FMG's own electrolyser technology. Production of green hydrogen from the \nGladstone plant is expected to begin in 2025, potentially getting to 22 tonnes of green hydrogen a day.\nNext on the horizon, but not yet given the final go ahead by the FMG board, are a 300MW green ammonia project \nin Holmaneset, Norway, and a green hydrogen project in Pecem, Brazil. These are \"progressing to feasibility \nstage\".\nThe company is expecting the Norwegian project to cost something just over $US1bn, with the Brazilian project \npotentially costing three times that - a total potential capital outlay of more than $USS4bn.\nBut Fortescue executives were at pains to point out that not all of that would be put on the FMG balance sheet, \nwith the company expecting to get some money from the EU for the Norwegian project and other investors \nexpected to come in to help finance both projects. Just how much FMG would need to spend on the projects and \nwhen they would make a profit was not clear.\nFurther down the track are potential projects in Morocco, Oman, Egypt and Jordan.\nEnergy chief Hutchison assured analysts that the company's \"financial discipline always comes first. We are only \nfocused on those projects which are economically viable.\" He said the green hydrogen market was \"still \ndeveloping\", with the cost of power needed to make green hydrogen projects in many countries economically viable \ntoo high.\n\"What we don't do is give up,\" he said. \"When power costs are prohibitive, we will work to bring those costs down.\n\"Longer term, we totally believe that green hydrogen is what the world ultimately needs which is why we continue to \nmaintain a significant portfolio of potential projects. There's plenty to be excited about and we are focused on \nmaking business decisions that make sense, economically and commercially.\" Executives also argued that FMG's \ngreen iron plans would also provide more revenue in China. Otranto said the company was \"doubling down on \ngreen iron\". He now believed the opportunity for it in China was \"much, much higher than expected\" following a visit \nto the country.\nBeijing, he said, had recently mandated that 10 per cent of all its coal-fired boiler feedstock would have to be \nammonia.\nThis, he said, would translate into demand for 300,000 tonnes of ammonia a year which would need some 50 \nmillion tonnes of hydrogen to produce.\n\"The train has definitely left the station,\" he declared.Page 3 of 3\nTWIGGY'S BIG CHALLENGE\nOnce content to sit back and watch iron ore shipments sail out of the Pilbara to China, FMG shareholders will need \nto get with the program when it comes to green technology - its potential and its green-sky economics.\nForrest is effectively asking his shareholders to back him in his green-energy vision, arguing that he has done it \nwhen it comes to iron ore and he will do it again when it comes to green-energy projects. FMG shareholders need \nto sit back, buckle up their seat belts and strap in for the ride, as they count their dividends.\nLoad-Date: August 28, 2024\nEnd of Document",

But what's the harm in a recap?\nNot only has the Fortescue empire abandoned plans to produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 (it \nwas supposed to have started on that objective last year), but now up to 700 workers who've been banging away at \nthe pipedream are also facing the sack.\nA sad outcome, and one that adds a dimension of absurdity to unseen photographs helpfully leaked to Margin Call \nthis week.\nYou've heard of the comical meme known as How it Started vs. How it's Going? Well, what a difference these \nimages show.\nIn the first, Fortescue officials lay out a tapestry of dreams to Credit Suisse bankers, in 2020, enwrought with \ndetails of a green hydrogen start-up that, by 2028, they said, would have an energy output \"larger than Saudi \nAramco \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. and growing\".\nUtter tosh, of course. Saudi Aramco remains the biggest energy company on the planet. To say Fortescue is on \ntrack to be situated in the same ballpark, let alone the same galaxy, is preposterous. The company will be lucky to \nproduce 20,000 tonnes of hydrogen a year if it manages to complete its first-round projects by 2028. No one would \nbe daft enough to hold their breath for that, except maybe the Fortescue spokeswoman who answered our inquiry, \nand who told us the company remained \"proud of the progress\" it had made so far.\nWe really shouldn't laugh. Tread softly, for you tread on their dreams. The second photograph features Forrest and \na trio of Fortescue employees - former chief of staff Claudia Blanch, company lawyer Emily Ward and ex--security \nchief Damien Rogers - in front of Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, an odd \nsight for a billionaire so fervently on the side of Ukraine these days.\nPage 2 of 3\nForrest still dreaming of power\nForrest reportedly seeded $750m into a fund with BlackRock's Larry Fink for the reconstruction of the war-torn \nnation, while his Minderoo foundation separately committed $20m to worthy causes.\nBut in 2021, Forrest was giddy about Russia, hamming it up in Red Square and busily talking green hydrogen to an \neconomy that backstrokes lazily through pools of oil and gas revenue.\nAt a St Petersburg economic forum held that year, Forrest met with Russian Deputy PM Alexander Novak and \napparently an oligarch or two. Regulation stuff, how could he not? Did he smack himself with birch leaves in a \nbanya, too? Scope out a dacha? We'll never know.\nAnd obviously this all preceded Forrest's withdrawal from Moscow, where he no longer has business, although one \nmight argue the writing was already on the wall for Kyiv as Twiggy paid a visit to the Kremlin.\nWhich makes us wonder: what was he doing there in the first place?\nEx-PwC man pops up A rare sighting this week of Sean Gregory dipping his toe back into public life. Gregory, for \nthose with short memories, was one of eight partners to be booted from PwC Australia in the aftermath of that \nbusiness with tax secrets.\nA year on since PwC shoved him off a plank accusing him (and others) of failing to stop the proverbial train before \nthe crash, he was spotted on stage at a tech and AI forum hosted on Tuesday by the Australian British Chamber of \nCommerce.\nGuests included WiseTech CEO Richard White, former News Corp exec and ABC deputy chair Peter Tonagh and \nMicrosoft's Steven Worrall (the tech giant having sponsored the gathering).\nThis would be Gregory's first time raising his head above the parapet since the mess of last year. He happens to be \na director of the ABCC and has been for two years, according to his LinkedIn account, which explains why he was \nrunning the forum.\nAs for what Gregory's been up to, word around town is that since the ugliness of PwC he's been studying the \nbusiness of artificial intelligence at MIT, with ambitions, apparently, to start a VC play on the same theme. We put \nthat to him, but he declined to comment.\nMore ACU pain Philosopher Stephen Finlay, formerly of the Australian Catholic University, was left unemployed last \nmonth after his position and those of his colleagues were unexpectedly terminated from the Dianoia Institute.\nIt's harder to come by a more heartless decision by the university and its vice-chancellor, Zlatko Skrbis. Foreign \nscholars left safe jobs at prestigious universities to be lured to ACU in 2019 on the promise of stable employment. \nThey, along with Finlay, are all out of a job, with Finlay making his feelings known last month.\n\"My family and I are now in a dire situation, as the timing of this could hardly be worse,\" he wrote on Facebook. \n\"While I am dying to be able to share more about events at ACU, I cannot say more at present.\" And perhaps now \nwe know why.\nListed on Monday in the Melbourne division of the Fair Work Commission is an unfair dismissal case between \nFinlay and the university, with Skrbis and others named as the respondents. Deputy president Bernadette O'Neill \nwill oversee the matter via the modern method of \"Teams\".\nGiven the contemptible treatment Finlay and his colleagues absorbed, this kind of court action would seem to have \nbeen inevitable, with others surely lining up to pursue the same course.\nAfter all, ACU sold them out, along with the entire philosophy institute, to address financial woes of the university's \nown making. We asked ACU for a comment but it declined.Page 3 of 3\nForrest still dreaming of power\nMinding P-2's and Q's Companies and governments live or die by the credit scores they're awarded from the ratings \nagencies. Mistakes, you'd imagine, would come by rarely.\nOr maybe not, judging by a curious release from Moody's this week. Margin Call's interest was piqued by a sudden \nupgrade to Qantas's short-term credit rating from Moody's, the timing of this adjustment a bit odd considering the \nairline won't report its annual profits for another week.\nBut it's not that Moody's has suddenly gleaned fresh insight into the airline's credit worthiness. Instead, it has \nuncovered a three-year-old mistake in its own homework.\nWe'll spare you the jargon, but essentially it \"mistakenly assigned\" a short-term rating known as P-3 to Qantas, \ninstead of P-2.\nThe difference?\nA rating of P-2 suggests a \"strong ability\" to repay short-term debt obligations, according to Moody's guidelines. The \nalternative of a P-3 rating isn't exactly a deadly downgrade, but it's more like an \"acceptable ability\" to repay those \nobligations.\nNot that this flub seemed to bother Qantas much - it never even raised a complaint. And sure, mistakes happen, but \nit does bring into question whether the ratings agencies are the paragons of exacting analysis and impeccable \nreputation they claim to be.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL A rare sighting this week of ex-PwC partner Sean Gregory\nLoad-Date: August 28, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: CHANTICLEER; Pg. 40\nLength: 1051 words\nByline: Myriam Robin and Mark di Stefano\nBody\nYoung fogeys of\nprivate clubs unite!\nSpeaking in generalities, the membership of Australia's elite private clubs splits by generation.\nThose who joined when it was just what successful men did are often not particularly fond of gender rules, keen on \nmodernising, or passing on membership to their daughters, should they have any.\nIt can be a rather different situation for younger members. Those under 40 (\"young\" being a relative term here) \njoined when it was explicitly not something most of their generation did.\nBy spending their time at a private membership club over, say, a pricey gym or business networking group, they \nmade a deliberate choice. They don't want female members. And they get very uppity at the old codgers keen on \nfoisting such a thing upon them.\nBeing a young fogey can be isolating. And so, last night in Melbourne, a portion of the memberships of the city's \nfour leading private members clubs gathered at the Athenaeum, where an earlier vote of the membership showed a \ndistinct preference for segregation among the younger set.\nCall it a show of force from conservative members of the Athenaeum Club, Melbourne Club, Australian Club and \nSavage Club. It follows concerns about the salami tactics by which Athenaeum's general committee seemed to be \nallowing women into the place (most recently into the Drawing Room, to align the club with \"proper etiquette and \nsocial norms\").\nAt the dinner, a presentation was planned on the mental health benefits of single-sex spaces. And then, the young \nfogeys would no doubt have compared tactics and strategies.\nAfter all, it's hard being counter-cultural.\nPage 2 of 3\nRear Window Young fogeys of private clubs unite!\nTwiggy's 'ambassador'\nleft holding her bags\nEven as executives fled Fortescue, one didn't leave Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest's side.\nIn August last year, off went CEO Fiona Hick (after six months) and CFO Christine Morris (two months). Guy \nDebelle was out from the board a week later. Some 11 executives had left Fortescue in three years. It was former \nCEO Elizabeth Gaines who stayed.\nTurns out she had so many reasons to! Last year, Fortescue shareholders found out that Gaines' transition from \nnon-executive to executive director as a result of a reshuffle came with a $794,856 one-off exertion payment, \nrelating to her role as Fortescue's first \"global ambassador\".\nThis fee was to compensate for the additional \"work, time and travel commitment\" that came with her emissary \nduties. It was awarded on top of a $1.97 million payment she was given for her CEO reign in 2023, and another \n$1.05 million for FY24.\nThose inducements are unwinding. Yesterday, Gaines' executive director pay was effectively slashed in half to \n$500,000 to reflect a \"reduction in time commitment\" for the former CEO. This is after proxies objected to her pay.\nStill, a decision to remove her travel allowance is a head-scratcher. How can a global ambassador fulfil her duties \naround the, err, globe, if she's left carrying her own bags through Perth International? Could it be that the position \nwas a nebulous panic title that her boss gave her so she wouldn't follow others out the door?\nBesides, if the company had need of a global ambassador, wouldn't it be the bloke spending an inordinate amount \nof time crossing timezones in a private jet? University lectures on lethal humidity. Media hits in the Bloomberg \nLondon studio. Drone shows over Manhattan. Global ambassador for Twiggy is as useful as being spokeswoman \nfor Donald Trump: you may as well wait to hear from the big mouth.\nGaines isn't the only one in line for a pay cut. Former Reserve Bank board member-cum-Village People enthusiast \nMark Barnaba will no longer be the lead independent director on the Fortescue board, where he was paid $1.26 \nmillion for FY24. That duty will soon fall to ex-CSIRO boss Larry Marshall.\nBut there are still plenty of benefits in staying in Twiggy's graces. Both Barnaba and Gaines were added to the \nboard of Western Australia's Greatland Gold in 2022. Two weeks later, it was reported that Twiggy's Wyloo Metals \nhad taken an 8.6 per cent stake in the gold and copper explorer. That's the thing about boardroom jobs, the most \nqualified candidates are so often the ones already in the contact book.\nGaines also sits on the board of the West Coast Eagles. She's there along with Fortescue's new PR chief Nicole \nMoody (another coincidence surely).\nGaines is so well favoured, she's talked about in Perth as the next leader of the influential AFL club. You have to \nwonder if crossing the Nullarbor to watch cellar-dwellers lose at the MCG can hold a candle to flying through Paris.\nJon Adgemis' vintage\nyacht seeks buyers\nWhat's the saying? The two happiest days in a boat owner's life are the day they buy the boat, and the day they sell \nit.\nSo, we arrive at the situation facing embattled publican and ex-KPMG dealmaker Jon Adgemis, who's living an \nintriguing day-to-day life riding the debt markets, holding off creditors, all the while living the life of a budding \nHollywood producer on Sydney Harbour. Imagine the stress!Page 3 of 3\nRear Window Young fogeys of private clubs unite!\nSome of the properties in his Public Hospitality Group have been seized. But in June, Deutsche Bank and New \nYork-headquartered Muzinich came to the rescue with a $400 million refinancing package.\nThat eases the pressure somewhat. For now. But it doesn't mean that Adgemis can't take steps to show things are \nchanging. And that's where the boat comes in.\nHe owns the 95-foot yacht called Hiilani. But unlike some of the more modern craft doing laps of the harbour, his \nHiilani has a distinctly vintage feel. It was once owned by celluloid royalty Shirley Temple.\nNews has reached us that Adgemis is seeking buyers for the yacht, turning to a local dealer to gauge interest. \nOffloading the yacht is part of the owner's quest seeking a more humble, less flashy life, apparently. The seafaring \nelite are hardly affected by the cost-of-living crisis. Though this is too retro a toy for the Bondi plastic set.\nHowever, there's always other ways to extract cash flow. Celeb accountant Anthony Bell's Ghost 2 recently played \na starring role in Ryan Gosling's Fall Guy this year, set around Sydney Harbour. Did the studio pay for the pleasure \nto have the yacht moored in one of the movie's central scenes? Adgemis certainly has new friends in the industry.\nRemember Jon: a ship is safest in the harbour, but it is not built for that.\nLoad-Date: August 31, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 28\nLength: 729 words\nByline: Anthony Macdonald\nBody\nAs our two biggest iron ore exporters dress themselves up as future-facing copper companies, third force \nFortescue has nowhere to hide. In fact, it does not even want to.\nFortescue's future is firmly Pilbara iron ore. It will spend $US4 billion ($5.9 billion) this year developing hubs and \nmines, exploration and trying to decarbonise its operations, mostly focused on iron ore. Energy - the hydrogen part - \nis slated to get only $US500 million of it.\nThat's not to say Fortescue wants to keep doing what it has always done. It knows China is changing - as is what it \nwants from Australia and the miners that sell it 1 billion tonnes of red dirt a year.\nFor 60 years, China has bought that red dirt and burnt it with metallurgical coal (mostly from Queensland) to make \nsteel. It got more hungry as its property and infrastructure construction stepped up, sending the price of iron ore to \nmore than $US100 a tonne, where it has mostly stayed.\nBut China's growth has slowed, including in the all-important property sector, its steel mills have dropped production \nand even bulls such as Fortescue co-CEO Dino Otranto see the difference.\n\"We're in the middle of China changing,\" he says.\nWhat China wants, Otranto says, is higher grade and cleaner products to help decarbonise its own industries, \nincluding those steel mills. There are ongoing talks about how this will play out inside China and Fortescue is trying \nto deal itself into the discussions; executive chairman Andrew Forrest was in China for such talks yesterday and \nOtranto will be there next week, he says.\nFortescue's plan is to sell China what it is calling \"green metal\" - made in Australia, using that same red dirt from \nthe Pilbara. It would dig up the dirt, and use hydrogen (not coal) to make a product that looks like a granule and \nexport it to China (via its railway and port infrastructure).\nThe steelmaking bit would still happen in China - that is important - but without the need to burn coal, and without \nthe pollution that would usually spill into the air and hang over major cities including Beijing and Shanghai.\nPage 2 of 2\nAustralia's iron ore future is different, not dead\n\"Up until now, it hasn't been economic to do it,\" Otranto says. \"We are on a mission to make it economic.\"\nTo make it economic, Fortescue probably needs China's (and Australia's) help. It would need Chinese equipment, \ncapital and skills at its production sites, the first of which is a small green energy hub at its Christmas Creek mine in \nthe Pilbara. Fortescue hopes it can produce 1500 tonnes of green iron metal a year with first production in 2025.\nTo get from there to 100 million tonnes or even the whole 191.6 million tonnes shipped in FY24 would be a huge \ntask, requiring huge investment. It cannot happen overnight. There are plenty of sceptics - as there have always \nbeen around Fortescue's ambitious plans - as Otranto acknowledges. \"Some of the sceptics still say it is not \neconomic and 'you're wasting your time'. We don't agree with that.\"\nTo make it work, Otranto says Fortescue (and Australia) need to attract China's capital, which is looking to replace \nthe big blast furnaces that have burnt Australia's iron ore and coal to make steel. He says that money is making its \nway into Brazilian, African and Saudi technology. \"That's why we need to muscle our way back in and say 'no, our \nores have a future',\" he says.\nThe key to it all is bringing the capital cost down - which in Saudi Arabia, for example, means concessions, \napprovals for land access and the like. Otranto says the Australian government needs to think similarly here - China \nhas always wanted our commodities, and the next ones are sun and wind.\nIt's interesting to hear Otranto talk so passionately about it on results day. Our three big miners are dealing with \nChina's slowdown in different ways, with BHP and Rio Tinto spending a lot of time talking up electrification and their \ncopper portfolios. The word \"copper\" appeared 78 times in BHP's results presentation on Tuesday, as James \nThomson wrote, while \"iron ore\" featured just 14 times.\nCopper does not get a mention at all at Fortescue. Its buzzword is \"green\" - which can be green metal, green \nhydrogen, green energy and even \"green pioneer\".\nFortescue shares dropped 1 per cent to $18.44 on Wednesday, following its result. UBS said earnings fell slightly \nshort of expectations, but the 89\u00a2 a share final dividend was better than expected.\nANTHONY MACDONALD\nLoad-Date: August 31, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 21\nLength: 748 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue will use debt, government grants and equity sell-downs to minimise the toll on its balance sheet from the \nestimated $US4 billion ($5.9 billion) cost of its next two hydrogen projects.\nInsights into the potential capital required of the next wave of hydrogen projects came as Fortescue raised its \ndividend by 16 per cent and reported a $US5.7 billion annual underlying profit yesterday.\nTotal dividends for the year of $1.97 a share translate into $2.2 billion for Andrew and Nicola Forrest, who \ncollectively control 36.7 per cent of Fortescue.\nThe iron ore miner announced in July that it would slow its push into hydrogen as part of an austerity campaign that \nwould involve 700 job cuts. The belt-tightening comes at a time when analysts believe weak iron ore prices will \ndrive a 15 per cent slide in revenue in the year ahead.\nBut Fortescue has not fully abandoned the nascent hydrogen sector, and plans to bring projects in Norway and \nBrazil to the board for an investment decision over the next 12 months.\nFortescue energy chief Mark Hutchinson said both projects would, in fact, make green ammonia, a compound of \nhydrogen and nitrogen that was easier to transport than hydrogen.\nHe said a plan to build an ammonia project at Holmaneset in the Norwegian fjords would cost in the \"low $US1 \nbillion\" range, with construction expected to start in 2025 and first production by 2027.\nBut Mr Hutchinson stressed that Fortescue did not plan to cover the full $US1 billion price tag, with the European \nCommission already pledging (EURO)204 million ($335 million) towards the project.\n\"We would get going on the project, we would bring bank debt in at some stage, probably at financial close, of 50 to \n60 per cent, and then we would sell down some of the equity,\" he said of the project's funding.\nMr Hutchinson did not provide an exact cost estimate for Brazil's Pecem ammonia project, but said it would be \n\"three times the size\" of the Norwegian project.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue plan to split bill on mega hydrogen build\nFortescue has made similar remarks about the funding structure for its energy projects in past years, but has so far \nfully funded its hydrogen projects in Arizona and Gladstone.\nThe company had $US4.9 billion of cash on hand and net debt of $US500 million at June 30.\nCredit rating agency Moody's Investor Services said those metrics left Fortescue well-placed to invest in projects \neven though the outlook for iron ore prices was soft.\n\"This leaves Fortescue with significant capacity as the company steps up its decarbonisation efforts and capital \nexpenditure for Fortescue Energy in fiscal 2025, while considering further green energy projects,\" said Moody's \nanalyst Sean Williams.\nFortescue's total capital spending in the next year will be between $US3.7 billion and $US4.3 billion, with only \n$US500 million going to energy projects, while up to $US900 million of the spend will be on decarbonising its iron \nore mines.\nFortescue vowed to continue returning between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of earnings to shareholders as \ndividends. The $1.97-a-share dividend total for 2023-24 equated to a 70 per cent payout ratio; an improvement on \nlast year's 65 per cent.\nThe stronger dividend was made possible by an 8 per cent rise in revenue on the back of stronger iron ore prices, \nand came despite a rare decline in annual export volumes.\nIt was also made possible by an austerity campaign that saw Fortescue announce 700 job cuts last month, on top \nof hundreds of job cuts in the previous 15 months.\nAnalyst consensus measured by Bloomberg had pointed to a $US6.09 billion underlying profit.\nMorgans analyst Adrian Prendergast said higher than expected depreciation and amortisation charges were the \nmajor reason why Fortescue's profit result was lower than expected.\nFortescue shares have lost 36.5 per cent of their value since January 1, and Mr Prendergast believed the stock \nwas offering good value at current levels.\n\"The stock had become oversold following two discounted block trades in two months and fears around China \ngrowth [where we expect much more stable iron ore fundamentals],\" he said.\nBenchmark ore with 62 per cent iron was fetching $US101.10 a tonne on Tuesday, according to S&P Global Platts.\nYesterday's Fortescue accounts also revealed that former chief executive Fiona Hick was paid $2.4 million for \nworking eight months in 2023-24.\nHer resignation was announced in August last year, but she remained employed until February 28. Her pay was \ndescribed as $327,205 of fixed remuneration, plus a $2.08 million \"termination payment\".\nLoad-Date: August 31, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 28\nLength: 974 words\nByline: James Thomson and Anthony Macdonald\nBody\nWe can't help feeling just a bit sorry for Gillon McLachlan, the new chief executive of Tabcorp, who fronted his first \nresults announcement yesterday after just 18 days in the role. That would be a big ask for any leader, but the \nformer AFL boss was tasked with selling an extraordinarily difficult message.\nFirst, there was the $1.4 billion write-down of the value of Tabcorp's core wagering business. Then there was the \nabandonment of the group's TAB25 strategic plan to boost digital revenue, slash costs and double return on \ninvested capital. Third, he had to warn that costs are actually likely to increase next year due to inflationary \npressures. And finally, McLachlan had to (quite reasonably) tell investors that it's too early to have his own strategic \nvision in place.\nThere's an element of what's called kitchen-sinking about all this; that's when a new CEO comes in, junks their \npredecessor's strategy, attempts to rebase expectations and creates room to engineer a turnaround; it's better to \nget all the bad news out of the way at once - that is, throw in everything, including the kitchen sink - than dripfeed \nmisery on long-suffering shareholders.\nHistory says it's a common strategy, and a reasonable one - but it's not without pain. While McLachlan insists \nTabcorp's assets are strong (particularly its mobile app) and there is still plenty of opportunity to unlock value in a \ncompetitive wagering market, the 15 per cent fall in Tabcorp's share price yesterday was no surprise.\nNow the market awaits McLachlan's rescue plan. As he said, this is a company still in turnaround mode - and will be \nfor a while.\nSell-side surprise\nBarrenjoey's Glyn Lawcock had a simple follow-up question for Fortescue: what's your overall sense of the iron ore \nmarket? Fortescue co-CEO Dino Otranto said it was mid-transformation, however \"we are very encouraged by the \ndiversification and robustness of the Chinese market\". He said the demand for green products in particular was \n\"much, much higher than expected\".\nPage 2 of 2\nMcLachlan's textbook start not without pain Closing bell\nChart of the day\nRetiring Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci pulled a page from the Commonwealth Bank playbook to show \nhow tough various parts of the Australian community are doing it. The message? It's surging housing costs, not \nhigher food spending, that is weighing most on household budgets. Indeed, the graph shows spending on food has \nfallen sharply recently, below long-term averages, as rent and mortgages have soared.\nWhat caught our eye\nFortescue: The miner is trying to do two things at once: significantly transform its business and pay hefty dividends. \nCan it pull it off? It's walking a fine line. The good news is that it starts with a pristine balance sheet and only \n$US500 million ($735 million) in net debt (equivalent to one-tenth FY24 free cash flow), which makes funding this \nyear's $US4 billion-odd capital expenditure and its future-facing projects easier. Fortescue also plans to tap third-\nparty investors for stakes in its hydrogen plants, should they progress as planned. Meanwhile, it is paying 70 per \ncent of profits as dividends. That is a lot. For comparison, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which has a much \nlighter growth ambition, returned 79 per cent of profits in FY24, while rival BHP returned 54 per cent and Rio Tinto \n50 per cent. (Rio's was for the six months to June 30 only.)\nWoolworths Group: One of the fascinating aspects of Coles' and Woolworths' profit results was the sharp increase \nin e-commerce sales, with revenue in the WooliesX division rising 19.8 per cent, and EBIT surging a staggering 94 \nper cent to contribute three-quarters of the earnings growth in the flagship food division. No wonder Brad Banducci \nsuggested the changing digital landscape was the big thing his successor Amanda Bardwell needed to watch.\nAPA Group: Gas pipelines owner APA Group's numbers are heading in the right direction; distributions were up 2 \nper cent in FY24, and it expects the same again this year. The two big things on results day, though, are the threat \nof tighter regulation in its legacy gas pipelines patch and renewables expansion, particularly in the Pilbara. On \nregulation, it's about six months since the Australian Energy Regulator kicked off its review, which at its worst could \nput gas transmission on a similar regulatory footing to electricity. APA boss Adam Watson says there is still no need \nto change - and cites the review's public submissions, none of which raise significant concerns with the current \nframework. The fact there is a review alone has created uncertainty, which stifles investment, and means gas \ninfrastructure to deal with a generational change in supply (from the south-east to up north) isn't being built. That \nleaves part of the country at serious risk of running out of gas in the next few years. It's serious. In terms of the \nPilbara, APA has a $3 billion pipeline of wind farms, battery storage and other renewable energy infrastructure it \nwants to build, and service the likes of BHP Group as they decarbonise. How that pipeline progresses is what we're \nwatching.\nFlight Centre: We loved the \"Turner index\" - Flight Centre's airfare affordability index, named after managing \ndirector and co-founder Graham Turner. It tells us it costs $1509 to fly from Sydney to London, the equivalent of \nfour days' pay based on the average Australian's wage. Pre-COVID, Flight Centre tells us it only cost three-days' \nwork/pay ($1039), while it was almost a week's wages 10 years ago, 1 weeks' wages 20 years ago, five to seven \nweeks' wages 50 years ago, and 1 times the average annual wage when Qantas first flew to London in 1947. The \nnumbers may be a bit fuzzy - the fare from 50 years ago is based on Turner's personal recollection, for example - \nbut they show how much more affordable airfares are than they used to be, even if they are not quite at pre-COVID \nlevels.\nLoad-Date: August 31, 2024\nEnd of Document",

He said the company was \"doubling down on green iron\", with a recent visit to China \ndemonstrating to the company's management that the green shift was going to present a huge -opportunity.\n\"When I was there a few weeks ago, the Chinese government made an announcement that 10 per cent of all coal-\nfired boiler feedstock will be ammonia,\" he said. \"And if you do the numbers, China burns two billion tonnes of \nthermal coal a year, 10 per cent of that by mass is 300,000 tons of ammonia. That's nearly 50 million tonnes of \nhydrogen to get to that ammonia amount.\" Fortescue Energy this year is focused on four main projects: its 80MW \nArizona hydrogen project on which it is expected to start construction this calendar year with production set for \n2026; its 300MW Holmaneset green ammonia project in Norway targeted to start construction in 2025; its Pecem \ngreen hydrogen project in Brazil for which the design process has started, and; the Gladstone PEM50 project, \nwhich is a two-stage 50MW green hydrogen project that will operate alongside the company's Gladstone \nelectrolyser manufacturing plant.\nMr Hutchinson said the company would look to sell down stakes in those projects as they progressed. Fortescue \nEnergy is expected to spend about $US700m on operations and $US500m on capital expenditure in the current \nfinancial year.\nOn the earnings front, Mr Otranto said Fortescue delivered its third-best result to date, with underlying profit after \ntax of $US5.7bn, up 3 per cent.\nRevenue rose 8 per cent to $US18.2bn, with the company receiving $US103 a tonne for its ore, also up 8 per cent.\nThe result was a miss on consensus profit estimates of $US6.12bn, while revenue was in line with market \nexpectations.\nIron ore guidance for the current year is for shipments of 190-200 million tonnes, compared with 191.6 million \ntonnes in the 2024 financial year.\nThe company is expecting its cost for hematite production to come in at $US18.50-$US19.75 a tonne, up from \n$US18.24 for 2024.\nFortescue will pay a dividend of 89c a share on September 27, down from $1 for the same period last year.

BHP and Woolworths \nhave also moved away from offsets.\nCompanies in the past have offered products that are \"carbon neutral\", based on the fact that consumers or the \ncompany itself had bought carbon offsets sufficient to offset the emissions from the product's production.\nThe trend now is to focus on reducing actual emissions rather than buying financial instruments to offset them. \nHowever, for many companies there is a level beyond which it is difficult to abate, and offsets remain useful.\nFortescue, founded by Andrew Forrest, is aiming for what it calls Real Zero, which involves using no fossil fuels or \noffsets in its Scope 1 and 2 emissions profiles.\n\"Fortescue has a plan to decarbonise our Australian terrestrial iron ore operations (Scope 1 and 2) in the Pilbara \nby 2030,\" the company says.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue sounds offsets alarm\n\"We have identified the solutions needed to eliminate approximately 90 per cent of terrestrial ... emissions from our \nAustralian iron ore operations and are actively working to identify solutions for the final approximately 10 per cent.\" \nMacquarie, in a research note entitled \"Carbon neutral no more\", points out that Google recently announced it was \nno longer maintaining operational carbon neutrality, having bought three million tonnes of offsets in 2022, while \nShell has withdrawn its carbon offset targets and several airlines including Delta, Easy Jet and JetBlue have \ncanned their carbon neutral schemes.\nMacquarie says this is being driven by both credibility concerns and regulatory scrutiny.\n\"In January the European Union parliament approved new regulation, under which, carbon offsets will not be \nallowed to contribute to product carbon neutrality claims from 2026,\" Macquarie says.\n\"There are also currently negotiations between the EU member states and parliament on the use of offsets for \ncompany carbon-neutral claims.\n\"In Australia, there is a strategic review of the Climate Active certification under way, with proposals to drop the \nterm carbon-neutral and tighten the use of offsets.\" Macquarie says at the moment, 25 per cent of the companies in \nthe ASX100 claim carbon neutrality or have a carbon-neutral target, and 7 per cent have a carbon-neutral product.\n\"Given greater scrutiny and greenwashing concerns, we may see a decline in the percentage of Australian \ncompanies offering carbon-neutral products or using carbon offsets to reach carbon-neutral targets, particularly \nfrom companies which are using a large volume of international offsets,\" Macquarie says.\nMacquarie says there are particular quality concerns around international offsets, and says almost 80 per cent of \nthe offsets used by Australian listed companies under the Climate Active scheme were international.\n\"Globally, according to a Bain & Company survey of 137 global companies in the fourth quarter of 2022, less than \n25 per cent of corporate respondents plan to use carbon offsets despite more than 90 per cent having a net \nzero/carbon-neutral target by 2050,\" Macquarie said.\n\"It was flagged that more than 50 per cent of corporate respondents attributed their unwillingness to participate in \nthe voluntary carbon market to market imperfections and a lack of transparency on climate impact and quality. \nFurther, about 40 per cent of companies had concerns regarding reputational as well as legal risk.\" In Australia, \nMacquarie said that while voluntary demand for Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCU) grew by 21 per cent over \nthe year to the end of March, more than half of the trade in Australian credits was being pushed by the Safeguard \nMechanism's requirements, \"and will likely be used by Safeguard entities to meet compliance obligations as \nSafeguard baselines decline\".\nThe ACCU spot price had remained stable at around $34 per tonne, however, indicating that Safeguard-driven \ndemand was not yet pushing prices higher. Last year, the Albanese government announced a review of the Climate \nActive certification, originally introduced in 2017 and rebranded in 2019, with proposed updates including removing \nthe term \"carbon-neutral\" and implementing stricter requirements.\nLoad-Date: September 8, 2024\nEnd of Document",

BHP and Woolworths have also moved away from using carbon \noffsets.\nCompanies in the past have offered products which are \"carbon neutral\", based on the fact that consumers or the \ncompany itself have bought carbon offsets sufficient to offset the emissions impact of the product's production.\nThe trend now is to focus on reducing actual emissions rather than buying financial instruments to offset them, \nhowever for many companies there is a level beyond which it is difficult to abate, and for which offsets remain the \nmechanism by which this can be achieved.\nFortescue is aiming for what it calls Real Zero, which involves using no fossil fuels or offsets in its Scope 1 and 2 \nemissions profiles.\nPage 2 of 2\nAnother company ditches offsets\n\"Fortescue has a plan to decarbonise our Australian terrestrial iron ore operations (Scope 1 and 2) in the Pilbara \nby 2030,\" the company says.\n\"We have identified the solutions needed to eliminate approximately 90 per cent of terrestrial \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 emissions from our \nAustralian iron ore operations and are actively working to identify solutions for the final approximately 10 per cent.\" \nMacquarie, in a research note entitled \"Carbon neutral no more\", points out that Google recently announced it was \nno longer maintaining operational carbon neutrality, having bought three million tonnes of offsets in 2022, while \nShell has withdrawn its carbon offset targets, and several airlines, including Delta, Easy Jet and JetBlue, have \ncanned their carbon neutral schemes.\nMacquarie says this is being driven by both credibility concerns and regulatory scrutiny.\nMacquarie says there are particular quality concerns around international offsets, and says almost 80 per cent of \nthe offsets used by Australian listed companies under the Climate Active scheme were international. Last year, the \nfederal government announced a review of the Climate Active certification.\nLoad-Date: September 8, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The company s single \nlargest order includes 360 autonomous battery-electric trucks, 55 electric excavators and 60 battery-powered \ndozers, it said.\n This deal is expected to create one of the world s largest zero emission mining fleets and represents a major \nbreakthrough in the pursuit of a mining industry no longer reliant on fossil fuels,  Fortescue said. The fleet will be \nused in Fortescue s iron ore operations in the remote Pilbara region in Western Australia and will cut costs in the \nlonger term while meeting its emission reduction goal.\nThe contract will help both companies meet their decarbonization targets, according to Fortescue. Liebherr and \nFortescue target to have a comprehensive and large scale zero emission mining ecosystem operational by 2030, \nthe Australian miner said.\n As part of the deal, Liebherr and Fortescue will deploy a complete autonomous battery-electric haulage solution \nfor large scale mining operations,  the statement said.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: CHANTICLEER; Pg. 40\nLength: 1254 words\nByline: Mark Di Stefano and Myriam Robin\nBody\nMost of the attention around the government's gambling ad reforms is focused on what appears on TV. And look, \nno one likes settling in for Friday night footy and finding out their eight-year-old has memorised Sportsbet slogans.\nEveryone knows there will be new some types of restrictions on advertising announced soon, covering both TV and \nonline. But what about the entirely new generation of gambling content that slips through the cracks, and in fact, is \nnot considered advertising at all?\nTake Dabble, the self-described Millennial bookmaker that has taken a lot of the social usability of Facebook and \nmashed into a betting account. Customers place bets like any other bookie, but they also set up social media \nprofiles and follow each other.\nOne way it rapidly grew was relying on real Facebook pages and automated chatbots to lure (mostly) men with free \ntips if they signed up for accounts.\nThen there was ex-AFL player Heath Shaw who joined as an investor. He did wonderful things, like when he posted \na video promoting Dabble in a male mental health Facebook group that discussed things such as depression, \nanxiety and suicide.\nRed flags? Pish posh. Tabcorp sensed an opportunity. The ASX-listed wagering giant under now-ousted chief \nAdam Rytenskild was struggling with the youth market, so the company invested $33 million into Dabble for a 20 \nper cent equity stake in 2022. Last year, Tabcorp's investor relations general manager Terry Couper joined \nDabble's board.\nCashed-up - and with a new veneer of respectability - Dabble keeps growing.\nTake the case of Benny Scarf, whose online videos have turned him into a star. In his videos, Scarf tells his \n\"punnas\" he'll place 5\u00a2 for every Instagram follower he has on a \"best bet\" (being a short-priced favourite). At day \n82, he's got more than 184,000 followers, so the clips show him flashing wads of $100 bills, walking into his local \nTAB, and bantering while he puts down $9000 punts, often on fringe country races on a weekday.\nPage 2 of 3\nRear Window Tabcorp's youth bookie has its own viral star\nNext he's watching the race in his living room, sometimes swinging a golf club, screaming at his runner to come \nhome. He loses his marbles if he loses, and like the best viral videos, it's fun stuff! But yes, sure, make no mistake, \nit's promoting degenerate problem gambling.\nIt's made him into the industry's version of an influencer. In his recent video from the track, he's mobbed by \nstrangers wanting selfies with him. One follower recently asked what everyone was thinking under a recent video: \n\"Does anyone know how Benny is funding this?\"\nWould you believe he's getting money from Tabcorp's Dabble? It gives him a fee for all the followers who use the \nlink in his bio, or by entering his name at sign-up.\nIt's affiliate marketing, and in some cases online bookmakers are known to share the losses of a customer with the \nperson who referred them. Dabble did not return a request for comment, and neither did Scarf.\nSo, take a step back. An online bookmaker part-owned by Tabcorp is giving money to someone who films viral \nvideos of himself spending thousands of dollars a day in a TAB. And because he doesn't explicitly promote a \ncompany in the video, well, it's not \"advertising\" is it? No legal disclaimers. Just a customer acquisition funnel \nstrapped to Instagram's rocket algorithm.\nOne recommendation many skipped over in late Labor MP Peta Murphy's inquiry was banning \"commissions being \npaid to staff or any third party involved in the referral\" of gambling services. That would make the gambling \ninfluencer business less lucrative.\nLast week, new Tabcorp boss Gillon McLachlan used this masthead to say all staff were being told to return to the \noffice five days a week. Scarf reacted to the news, writing sarcastically: \"Bad guys in turmoil.\"\nOh, Benny. If only everyone got to spend their office hours down at the TAB.\nFortescue puts words\nin Rio's mouth\nGrandiose claims are not uncommon for Fortescue's Andrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest. But when his mining company \nannounced a $3 billion contract with German mining manufacturer Liebherr, it was someone else singing his \npraises.\n\"Fortescue's partnership with Liebherr marks a turning point in the history of the mining industry,\" the release \nquoted Rio Tinto chief Jakob Stausholm as saying. And he didn't stop there, further praising the \"foresight and \ncourage\" of \"first mover Fortescue\", with the consolation that \"while we can't always be first, we can be fast \nfollowers\".\nIf any Rio Tinto shareholder thinks their usually understated chief executive is sounding a lot like Forrest, well, \nthey'd be right.\nTurns out it was Fortescue operatives who drafted and suggested the quotes to Rio Tinto, which never approved \nthem despite them being sent to journalists shortly after 7am yesterday.\nThe erroneous release was withdrawn 90 minutes later, with Fortescue telling journalists the quotes were \n\"mistakenly included\". But no hard feelings. Stausholm, who had indicated he was open to some public comment, \ninstead wrote on Fortescue's LinkedIn post later in the morning, lauding the company for a \"significant\" agreement \nthat constituted a \"bold step\".\nSo, what do we make of this, besides the inadvisability of not getting exceedingly generous quotes duly signed off? \nWell, it's instructive in once more revealing the breadth of Fortescue's ambition. Not only does it aim to mine \nwithout carbon emissions (the Liebherr trucks will not run on diesel), but it hopes for the broader industry's \nwholehearted praise and gratitude for leading the way.Page 3 of 3\nRear Window Tabcorp's youth bookie has its own viral star\nThis is even as Forrest, in the same release, lashed said industry majors for their lack of leadership, lamenting with \nall the certainty of an Old Testament prophet how \"the time of others persuading you that greenwashing is a better \nreturn to shareholders and your community is over\".\nIs this the best way to convince others to join Forrest's crusade? One may as well hope for the heavens to open \nand bestow a permanent halo atop Twiggy's forehead, a voice ringing out and proclaiming celestial approval of his \nmission. We wouldn't count on it, but hey, a man can dream.\nPwC chairman sells\npublishing business\nNew PwC chairman John Green has been a banker and a lawyer, as well as the proprietor and chairman of his own \nfamily-run publishing business.\nAll three careers are now drawing to a close, the last with the sale of the Green family's Pantera Press to Hardie \nGrant, due to be completed at the end of this month.\nProminent Pantera authors include political journalist Simon Benson, media entrepreneur Tim Duggan, and \niconoclastic political activist Nyunggai Warren Mundine. And then, there was John Green himself, who as well as \nchairing the family business, has through it released a series of financial thrillers.\nSome suggest an imagination not ill-placed in considering how, for example, wonky consultants could knowingly or \ninadvertently bring an organisation to its knees.\nConsider the blurb for The Trusted, released in 2013 and focused on financial terrorists keen on destroying Wall \nStreet \"from the inside\".\n\"What if the people we trust most are those we should trust least,\" the author asks.

Notoriously private, Creasy wouldn't respond when we asked.\nAnd it isn't the only late-life change for the legendary digger. As we reported two years ago, he and partner Annie \nGuo welcomed a baby, which, arriving now at the age of tantrums and bitter defiance, should make running a \nremote mine in the kiln of WA's northwest seem like a refreshing vacation.\nOverpriced Libs Prices are clearly booming on the rubber-chicken circuit.\nWe're at a loss to explain why, but the expense of attending a Liberal Party fundraiser is getting way out of hand.\nPage 2 of 2\nProspector Creasy gets his mine\nA private dinner scheduled with John Howard for October 15 was originally priced at $10,000 a pop - that was \nhalved two weeks later, presumably because the expense was exorbitant. The same event (on Lygon Street, \nMelbourne) is now being offered for 20 people, instead of 10, at a cost of $5000. Cheaper, but hardly a steal.\nDinner with Peter Dutton isn't much more affordable. He's down for an event in Canberra next month where tickets \nare selling for $10,000, or roughly double what Anthony Albanese and members of his cabinet charge. Dutton has a \nsecond event in the offing, also $10,000, to be held in Melbourne around the same time.\nAre we to take this jacked-up pricing as a signal of Liberal confidence in their own polling numbers?\nFor an example of just how inflated this fundraising bubble has become, take a look at Liberal hopeful Tim Wilson.\nHe's not even a member of parliament (anymore) yet he's charging $10,000 \"per plate\" for a lunch with New \nZealand's Regulation Minister David Seymour, someone who, according to Wilson, \"is coming to Melbourne to do \none lunch in support of my campaign to take back Goldstein\".\nUnexpected, too, that a conservative-minded Seymour, leader of the right-wing ACT Party, would be embraced so \nwholly by a moderate like Wilson, whose invitation says: \"It will truly be a wonderful lunch with robust and enlivening \ndiscussion.\" No doubt. But for ten large?\nThe market for bloviating is definitely due for a correction. Taking a stand A low-hanging morsel from Fortescue's \ncontinuing beef with Element Zero and its co-founders Michael Masterman, Bjorn Winther-Jensen and Bart \nKolodziejczyk, all of whom stand accused of stealing intellectual property to start their rival green iron business.\nA veritable library of affidavits have been lodged with the Federal Court, from both sides, but one previously-\nredacted number demands renewed attention.\nRat-holed inside 691 pages filed by Adrian Huber, Fortescue's senior legal counsel, are details of a confidential \ninvestigation that had been run into Kolodziejczyk. He held the role of chief technology officer at Fortescue Future \nIndustries from late 2019 until his resignation in October 2021, at which time \"concerns\" were raised over his \nqualifications and experience \"as represented on his resume\".\nThat much has been reported. The short version of the story is that Fortescue alleged Kolodziejczyk - coldly \nreferred to by the investigation as \"the Subject\" - misrepresented his CV and the former chief scientist, in his own \naffidavit, denied ever doing so.\nLesser known until now is that Fortescue was sufficiently miffed about these \"numerous gaps\" that it hit up \nrecruitment firm Gerard Daniels - two years after it recommended Kolodziejczyk for the job - asking for its money \nback.\nGerard Daniels, it said, had \"admitted in writing that they had failed to manage the reference check process \nproperly\", resulting in a Fortescue claim for $67,000. \"The employee due diligence had effectively been outsourced \nby FMG (Fortescue Metals) to Gerard Daniels,\" the report said.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL For $5000, a cut-price dinner with John Howard\nLoad-Date: September 26, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The Federal Court on Friday \ndismissed attempts by Element Zero to have the search-and-seizure tactics ruled invalid.\nFortescue's use of private investigators was described by Element Zero as a \"massive overreach\" because the \nsurveillance reports included photographs of children and private homes, and details obtained by rifling through mail \nand following family members.\nIn July, Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest distanced himself from the use of private investigators and reports of \nspying on the children of the Element Zero founders, saying that the surveillance and search raids did not align with \nthe \"values\" of the mining giant.\nBut Friday's ruling means evidence seized during the searches that followed the surveillance campaign may be \nadmissible in court when the matter goes to trial.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 17\nLength: 642 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue's plan to cease emitting carbon by 2030 could earn the company at least $50 million a year from a new \nfederal government carbon credit scheme, but chairman Andrew Forrest's disdain for offsets may prevent the miner \nfrom accepting the windfall.\nDr Forrest has vowed that Fortescue will not rely on offsets to achieve \"real zero\" emissions across its iron ore \nmines by 2030. The billionaire has previously labelled offsets as a \"scam\".\nBut the imminent launch of the Albanese government's new carbon credit scheme - known as Safeguard \nMechanism Credits (SMCs) - is offering Fortescue a lucrative incentive to start selling offsets to other companies.\nCompanies that cut emissions faster than required by the federal government's Clean Energy Regulator will be \nrewarded with an SMC for each extra tonne of carbon they abate beyond their target. Those that earn SMCs will be \nable to sell them to rival emitters that have failed to deliver their emissions reduction targets for the year.\nFortescue will earn vast quantities of SMCs if it delivers on its \"real zero\" goal because its actual emissions in 2030 \nwould be dramatically lower than the emissions allowance granted to the company by the Clean Energy Regulator. \nFortescue will be permitted to emit about 1.4 million tonnes of carbon pollution in 2030 if it maintains current iron \nore production rates. If the company delivers on its promise to emit no carbon in 2030, it will earn about 1.4 million \nSMCs in that year alone.\nThe Albanese government has signalled that trading of SMCs will begin early next year and that the exact price of \nan SMC will remain unclear until trading begins.\nBut based on the ceiling price imposed on the carbon credits regime by the Albanese government last year - $75 a \ntonne indexed to the consumer price index plus 2 per cent - analysts believe Fortescue could make between $50 \nmillion and $150 million from selling SMCs in 2030.\nThe potential revenue boost from selling SMCs has prompted debate inside Fortescue over its hardline stance \nagainst carbon offsets.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue eyes $50m carbon credit free kick\nAsked whether Fortescue planned to sell the SMCs it would earn in the future, a spokesman for the miner said no \ndecision had been taken.\n\"Fortescue is finalising its position on the implications of the reformed Safeguard Mechanism and is working \nclosely with the government,\" he said.\n\"We will do this consistent with our broader approach to voluntary and compliance carbon markets, which is that the \ncore focus must always be the delivery of real reductions in emissions.\"\nFortescue has a huge task ahead to cut emissions to zero within six years; the miner's scope 1 and scope 2 \nemissions rose by about 7 per cent in the year to June.\nFortescue exceeded its legislated emissions allowance for the year by about 120,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas. \nDespite the company's disdain for offsets, it was legally obliged to buy about $4.2 million worth of Australian Carbon \nCredit Units (ACCUs) to atone for the excess carbon emitted in 2024.\nFortescue says it will only buy ACCUs when legally forced to, and the spokesman reiterated the company did not \nplan to rely on offsets or carbon capture to achieve its 2030 target.\n\"We will show that decarbonisation is good for business and creates greater value for shareholders while \nsafeguarding our planet,\" he said.\nFortescue estimated in 2022 that it would need to spend $US6.2 billion to achieve \"real zero\" in the Pilbara mining \ndistrict by 2030.\nOxford Sustainable Finance Group director Ben Caldecott last month praised Fortescue's plan for getting to zero \nemissions by 2030.\n\"The plan is marked by high ambition and well-defined actions, underpinned by accountability mechanisms to \nensure systematic delivery across the organisation,\" he said.\nRival miner Rio Tinto expects to spend up to $US6 billion ($8.8 billion) on works that will halve its carbon footprint \nby 2030.\nLoad-Date: October 10, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1418 words\nHighlight: In tough times for many junior ASX mining companies, luring a \"big dog\" onto the share register to add \nfinancial grunt has become a common boardroom pursuit.\nBody\nAfter a few years of \"easy money\", a big chunk of the small-cap mining sector has recently found the going tough as \nglobal financial pressures have seen widespread interest in the highly-speculative bottom end of the market come \nto a screeching halt.\nAnd that has required more business agility than ever, including strategic boardroom moves to try and attract \nestablished, big-spending partners to the share register.\nIn this second edition part of our occasional \"Big Dogs\" feature series, we look at four companies which have \nreceived both a timely cash injection and a share price boost up to recent highs after announcing a tie-in with a \nmuch bigger player in the industry.\nA good case in point is Kincora Copper, which revealed on May 28 that global gold giant AngloGold Ashanti had \nsigned a staged earn-in joint-venture (JV) agreement for its Northern Junee-Narromine Belt (NJNB) project in New \nSouth Wales' renowned Macquarie Arc region.\nAngloGold has the right to spend $25 million on exploration to earn an initial 70 per cent in the JV, with either a \nfurther $25 million spend or completion of a preliminary feasibility study (PFS) required to increase its stake to an \n80 per cent interest.\nThe two companies will target the prospective project that includes the Nyngan and Nevertire licences, where a \nwide range of near-untouched, sizeable intrusive-related copper-gold targets will be tested by the one piece of \nequipment that always lets you know exactly how things are - the ever-honest drill bit.\nMarket punters took a liking to the news, with the share price that closed at 3.6c on May 24 before the trading halt, \nbolting out of the gates on the morning of the announcement.\nThe price opened at 4.6c that day and shot to an intraday high of 5.7c. It then continued its march forward in the \nnext few weeks, hitting 7c on June 3 and then touching its year-high of 7.1c on June 14 for a near 100 per cent gain \nsince the announcement.\nVolumes that had as few as 12,000 shares swap hands the day before the trading halt, took a leap of faith with \nmuch higher-than-normal volumes and exceeded more than a million units in a single day for the first time this year. \nPage 2 of 3\n'Big Dogs' keep adding bite for junior mining partners\nA whopping 1.3 million shares changed hands on May 31 and more than 2 million units found a new home on the \nnext trading day on June 3.\nThe Macquarie Arc porphyry copper-gold geology is recognised as a globally-significant region, with two of \nAustralia's biggest copper-gold producing mines - Newmont Corporation's massive Cadia operation and the \nEvolution Mining-Sumitomo Group's Northparkes mine.\nIn the 2023 financial year, Cadia produced a whopping 597,000 ounces of gold at a stunningly low cost of $45 per \ngold ounce, due to huge credits from the copper that is also produced at the site.\nThe NSW Government recently released a report indicating the Macquarie Arc has produced more than 14 million \ntonnes of copper and hosts some 50 per cent of the State's gold endowment.\nAnother company benefitting from a tie-in with a powerful player is HyTerra after it revealed to the market on August \n29 that iron ore giant Fortescue's wholly-owned subsidiary, Fortescue Future Industries Technologies, will invest \n$21.9 million to acquire a 39.8 per cent stake in the company at a price of 3.4c per share, subject to shareholder \napproval.\nThe Fortescue investment funds will enable the expansion of the exploration drill program at HyTerra's Nemaha \nproject in the State of Kansas in the United States. A two-well drill program will be stretched to a six-well campaign \nafter the investment has been finalised.\nHyTerra is pursuing the discovery of white hydrogen at Nemaha as it aims to assist the push towards global \ndecarbonisation. White hydrogen, also known as natural hydrogen or geologic hydrogen, is a gas formed \nunderground by natural processes and extracted by conventional methods.\nFunds will also contribute to plans for significant additional leasing and geophysics to be conducted at Nemaha. \nThe two firms plan to enter into a strategic alliance agreement to advance the project and explore new opportunities \nglobally.\nNews of the tie-in resonated with the market, helping the 3.1c closing price before the Fortescue reveal to leap at \nthe open to 4.8c and touch an intraday peak of 5.5c.\nThe share price bounced around for a few days on massive volumes, with 90.6 million units swapping hands on the \nday of the announcement, followed by 64.3 million on August 30 and 29.2 million the next trading day. Overall, the \nprice has remained positive since, with it trading predominantly in a 4c to 5c range.\nGreen Technology Metals also got the market excited when it advised of a strategic investment from South Korea's \n21st-biggest listed company, the US$16.95 billion (AU$24.8 billion) market-capitalised EcoPro Innovation Co.\nThe world-leading electric vehicle (EV) battery metals producer agreed to subscribe for an $8 million, two-tranche \nplacement in Green Technology. It provides a foundation for co-operation between the two firms, as Green \nTechnology strives to become the first integrated lithium producer in the Canadian province of Ontario.\nThe investment was made at a significant premium to the market price.\nExecuted agreements cover proposals for upstream and downstream activities, including potential mine \ndevelopment and proposed lithium conversion facilities. It provides for a 12-month option to have exclusive rights to \nnegotiate and agree on staged investments in the Seymour and Root projects in the expectation of negotiating a \npossible JV agreement for either or both projects.\nThe deal also includes the option to undertake negotiations to form a comprehensive agreement for co-funding a \nprefeasibility study (PFS) for the Canadian lithium conversion facility, which may in turn lead to a JV for completing \na definitive feasibility study (DFS) and the co-development of the North American plant.Page 3 of 3\n'Big Dogs' keep adding bite for junior mining partners\nGreen Technology's shares rallied on the prospect of the South Korean giant bolstering the company's promising \nprojects after recent times for virtually all juniors in the lithium space that could best be described as bleak.\nThe stock opened at 9.2c on August 20 after previously closing at 6.4c, then jumped to hit an intraday high of 9.5c \non bigger than normal volumes. It ran again two days later, touching 11c on volumes of 2.8 million shares traded, its \nheaviest trading day since March, for a 71.88 per cent increase after the news of the tie-in.\nLike a lot of junior mining companies in the rare earths space, Peak Rare Earths has seen its market capitalisation \nand share price tumble south in the past few years. Yet, its Ngualla rare earths project seems to be kicking goal \nafter goal.\nThe company's shares hit a 12-month low of 17.5c on July 19 prior to revealing on July 24 that Chinese rare earths \ncompany Shenghe Resources Holding Co., through its Singaporean subsidiary, had agreed to subscribe for a 50 \nper cent interest in the Ngualla Group UK from Peak, which retains the remaining 50 per cent.\nNgualla Group has an 84 per cent interest in the Ngualla rare earths project and Shenghe agreed to stump-up a \ncool $96 million for its slice of the pie.\nThe market obviously liked what it heard and pushed the share price to 22c at the day's trading open after the \nnews, before reaching an intraday high of 23c. It then traded sideways for a period before touching 24c on \nSeptember 5.\nShenghe's big investment into the junior's rare earths project came after other positive developments for Peak, \nincluding its significant, new partner entering into an offtake agreement for 100 per cent of the rare earths \nconcentrate from the project for an initial term of seven years.\nThe icing on the cake came in the form of a consortium of lenders signing a non-binding indicative term sheet for \nthe funding of a US$176.6 million (AU$256.7 million) debt solution for the Ngualla operation.\nThe lump sum contribution from Shenghe will fund the development of the project, in addition to the balance of the \nproject's capital costs to be met by a Shenghe-arranged debt facility - a la the consortium's non-binding term sheet.\nPeak has no requirement to contribute towards equity funding for the project. It now holds a 42 per cent interest in \nNgualla and Shenghe has also moved to 42 per cent, with the Government of Tanzania holding the remaining 16 \nper cent.\nIt all just goes to show that adding a bit more bark can, in fact, lead to a harder bite.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

What does he mean \u2013 and can he achieve it?\nThe original concept of \u201cnet zero\u201d was for global economies to end almost all fossil fuel use and then use \ntechnologies, many not proven at scale, to directly cut atmospheric CO2.\nBut examples are legion of major corporates  buying carbon offsets, some of dubious quality, to make their \nemission reduction targets instead of actually cutting fossil fuel use.\nSign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s breaking news email\nClaire Snyder, the founder and director of Climate Integrity, said: \u201cAndrew Forrest is right on this: the \u2018net\u2019 in net \nzero is a loophole that is frequently exploited.\n\u201cFossil fuels are the primary cause of climate change, yet hardly any companies have explicit plans to phase out \ncoal, oil and gas from their own operations.\u201d\n                   Old lies and offsets                   \nFortescue\u2019s latest climate transition plan , published last month, reflects Forrest\u2019s disdain for carbon offsets. \nOffsets and carbon capture are not part of Fortescue\u2019s plans.\nFortescue says its annual emissions that it has direct control over were at 2.72m tonnes of CO2-equivalent last \nyear. Most of that comes from the diesel burned by haulage trucks, trains and ships, and the gas burned for power \ngeneration at its mining sites.\nBy 2030, Fortescue aims to have eliminated all those fossil fuels with a combination of green fuels (such as \nammonia for shipping and clean hydrogen for power generation) and battery electric vehicles charged with \nrenewables.\nSimon Nicholas, a global steel sector analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said \nFortescue\u2019s operations are concentrated in the remote Western Australia Pilbara region, giving the company ample \naccess to solar and wind and the space needed to build them.\n\u201cIt seems like the technology to enable Fortescue to reach real zero is either already available or will be soon,\u201d he \nsaid.\n\u201cReal zero by 2030 is very ambitious, but even if they hit the target a bit late, they will have transformed operational \nmining emissions and laid the path for others to follow.\u201d\n                   A much bigger problem                   \nFortescue\u2019s (and the climate\u2019s) much bigger problem comes when its iron ore goes to overseas steelmakers that \nuse combinations of coal, gas and fossil-fuel powered electricity to turn the ore into iron, and the iron into steel.\nThe indirect emissions (called scope 3) from the shipment and use of Fortescue\u2019s iron ore last year were 100 times \nthe company\u2019s direct emissions: about 262 Mt CO2-e (for comparison, Australia\u2019s entire annual emissions are now \nat 440 Mt).\nAbout 97% of that is emitted in the steelmaking process. But Fortescue has a target for \u201cnet zero scope 3 \nemissions by 2040\u201d \u2013 an odd choice of the \u201cnet zero\u201d phrase given Forrest\u2019s dislike of it.\nBut could it be done?\nMost of Fortescue\u2019s iron ore is low-grade and not suitable for a process known as Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), \nwhere the ore is turned into iron metal using gas. But this process could be emissions free, Nicholas said, if the gas \nwas replaced by clean hydrogen.Page 3 of 3\nAndrew Forrest says net zero is \u2018fantasy\u2019 so his goal is \u2018real zero\u2019. What does he mean \u2013 and can he achieve it?\nFortescue says it is working on ways to tweak the DRI process that would allow use of its lower grade ore to \nproduce \u201cgreen metal\u201d, while also developing higher grade ore deposits (such as its massive Iron Bridge mine  ). \nThe company is also building a pilot green metal production plant. \nThe company told analysts a few months ago that \u201cpivoting to producing green metal\u201d was its planned next step.\nOnce you have iron, about a third of steelmakers use electric arc furnaces to produce the steel and these too can \nbe powered by renewables.\n\u201cThe technology to decarbonise iron and steelmaking is already available,\u201d Nicholas said.\n\u201cElectric arc furnaces and renewable energy are perfectly mature technologies. DRI is also mature and in use today \nat commercial scale. \n\u201cThe technology to do this at commercial scale is available now,\u201d he said, pointing to a green steel manufacturing \nplant in Sweden. \n                   Clean power and influence?                   \nBut questions linger over how much control Fortescue can have over the source of power generation for electric \narc furnaces.\nFurnaces not powered by renewable electricity, but using Fortescue\u2019s ore or green iron would still leave the \ncompany with scope 3 emissions.\n\u201cThe key challenge is what happens to Fortescue\u2019s future green iron production when it reaches steelmakers in \nplaces like China,\u201d Nicholas said.\nOn this, Fortescue\u2019s plan just says it will \u201cpartner\u201d with customers and establish a \u201cgreen metal value chain\u201d.\nTemperature Check asked Fortescue why it had used the term \u201cnet zero\u201d for its scope 3 target and how it would \nconvince its customers to go \u201creal zero\u201d.\nA Fortescue spokesperson said ending reliance on fossil fuels \u201cis the only way to secure the global temperature \ngoals of the Paris agreement\u201d and the company backed \u201call companies and governments\u201d in phasing out fossil fuels \n\u201cno later than 2040\u201d.\nFortescue was working with \u201cglobal science-based standard setting entities\u201d to understand trends that could \n\u201cimpact best-practice Scope 3 target\u201d, the spokesperson said, adding the company may change its position.\n\u201cFortescue has a policy to not use voluntary [carbon] offsets towards its real zero 2030 target and only supports \ngenuine decarbonisation solutions such as investment in green iron and other innovations necessary to eliminate \nscope 3 emissions in the iron ore industry.\n\u201cIf every company takes the necessary action to reduce their scope 1 and 2 emissions, for which they are directly \nresponsible, then globally scope 3 emissions will decline quickly.\u201d\nLoad-Date: October 9, 2024\nEnd of Document",

In my view, on balance, it \nwas.\n\"The fact of the ongoing relationship, and the issues raised and discussions with Element Zero in the latter part of \n2023 and early 2024, were facts which should have been brought to the court's attention on the application for the \nsearch orders.\nPage 2 of 2\nJudge backs Fortescue in IP stoush\n\"Those facts were relevant to the question of whether there was a real risk of destruction given past co-operation, \nalbeit about different issues.\" Element Zero had also asked the court to set aside the search orders because it \nclaimed surveillance conducted in the lead-up to obtaining them was excessive.\nIt emerged that Fortescue employed former SAS soldier Robert Lancaster to spy on Element Zero staff and its \nfamilies for up to 17 hours per day. The surveillance included following family members to Kmart, rummaging \nthrough mail and taking pictures of their children leaving school.\nElement Zero argued the surveillance reports produced presented a misleading picture to the court, which coloured \nit as \"nefarious\" and \"dishonest\".\nBut Justice Markovic accepted surveillance conducted by private investigators was necessary.\n\"As I have already observed, the private investigator's reports are lengthy and detailed,\" she said.\n\"However, on their face they do not disclose any collateral purpose. Rather, they attempt to provide information \nnecessary for an application for search orders and as required by the court's search orders practice note.\n\"One way of obtaining that information is to instruct qualified persons to attend at and observe premises. In this \ncase, Fortescue chose to do so by instructing a private investigator firm.\n\"Finally, that the surveillance reports were lengthy, to a degree repetitious and perhaps inelegantly expressed, \ncannot justify setting aside the search orders.\" A spokesman for Element Zero said it wanted the search orders set \naside primarily based on Fortescue's \"failure to disclose the ongoing commercial relationship\" with Fortescue.\n\"Although Element Zero believes that the orders should have been set aside, and is still considering challenging \nthat result, it is pleased that the court varied the search orders to quarantine all of the materials seized during the \nraids,\" he said.\n\"This means that Fortescue cannot access any of the 12 million documents and must now follow standard \ndiscovery processes.\" A Fortescue spokesman said it would continue to \"rigorously protect its intellectual property \nin every part of its green energy, technology and metals business\".\n\"With Justice Markovic's decision, two Federal Court judges have now found a strong prima facie case that the \nElement Zero parties misused Fortescue's confidential information and breached its rights, and have determined \nthat there was a real risk of destruction of crucial evidence if the search orders were not granted,\" he said.\n\"The Element Zero parties sought to set aside the search orders on five grounds, all of which failed. To obtain the \nsearch orders, Fortescue was required to satisfy the Federal Court that it had a strong 'prima facie' case against \nthe Element Zero parties, that those parties possessed important evidence, and that there was a real possibility that \nthey might destroy or hide that evidence.\" As well, the spokesman said: \"In rejecting the ... attempt to set aside the \nsearch orders on the ground of 'material nondisclosure', Justice Markovic found that while certain matters relating to \nprior meetings were not disclosed, this was unintentional and would not have changed Justice Perry's decision to \ngrant the search orders given the conclusions reached from Fortescue's substantial body of evidence.\"\nLoad-Date: October 11, 2024\nEnd of Document",

CASE\nFEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA ISSUES FULL COURT DECISION FOR \nFORTESCUE, ET AL. V/S ELEMENT ZERO, ET AL. CASE\nAustralian Government News\nOctober 15, 2024 Tuesday 3:27 PM  EST\nCopyright 2024 HT Media Limited. All Rights Reserved\nLength: 983 words\nBody\nAustralia, Oct. 15 -- The Federal Court of Australia issued the following judgement on Oct. 4:\n1 On 30 April 2024 the applicants, Fortescue Limited, Fortescue Future Industries Pty Ltd (FFI) and FMG \nPersonnel Services Pty Ltd (together, Fortescue), commenced this proceeding against Element Zero Pty Limited, \nBartlomiej Piotr Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn Winther-Jensen and Michael George Masterman as respondents. At the time, \nFortescue filed an originating application and statement of claim (SoC).\n2 Element Zero was registered on 7 December 2022. Element Zero is a start-up that has technology to convert \nmetal ores such as iron and nickel into pure metal using intermittent renewable energy. Mr Masterman is a director \nand shareholder of Element Zero and its chief executive officer (CEO), Dr Kolodziejczyk is the chief technology \nofficer and a shareholder and director of Element Zero, and Dr Winther-Jensen is a shareholder of Element Zero \nand was its research and development manager and from 7 December 2022 to 11 January 2024 a director. Dr \nWinther-Jensen ended his employment with Element Zero in December 2023.\nFORTESCUE'S EX PARTE APPLICATION\n3 The proceeding first came before Perry J in her Honour's capacity as general duty judge on 9 May 2024 on an ex \nparte application made by Fortescue for search orders. The transcript of the hearing on 9 May 2024 discloses that \nher Honour was provided with affidavits and submissions dated 8 May 2024 prior to the hearing, and that some \nadditional affidavits were provided at the hearing. The hearing lasted for approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes. \nTowards its conclusion, her Honour said:\nThe last thing - this is the - to my mind at the moment, I can indicate that I do agree that there is a strong prima \nfacie case that's really established by a very substantial body of evidence. And there's also, one would have \nthought in light of the matters that have been covered in the written submissions, a real risk that if information were \nprovided in advance and it weren't inter partes application, there is a real risk that information might be destroyed or \nhidden, squirrelled away. And obviously, the prejudice - you've clearly established prejudice of a very substantial \nnature to the applicants in the event that the orders are not made, so that I do consider it's appropriate to make the \norders, but subject to that concern.\nPage 2 of 3\nFEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA ISSUES FULL COURT DECISION FOR FORTESCUE, ET AL. V/S \nELEMENT ZERO, ET AL. CASE\nAnd after reviewing Fortescue's proposed orders added:\nI mean, as I said, I've been very carefully through the written submissions. And then having those, having the \nbenefit of being taken through the evidence in a closely and in the structured way that you have, has led me to the \nview that it is appropriate, subject to addressing the particular issues I've raised, to make orders in the nature that \nare sought.\n4 On 9 May 2024 the Court made interim suppression orders pursuant to s 37AI of the Federal Court of Australia \nAct 1976 (Cth) and otherwise adjourned the proceeding to 14 May 2024 to allow Fortescue to deal with a number \nof matters raised by her Honour principally in relation to practical issues that might arise on execution of the \nproposed orders.\n5 On 14 May 2024, when the proceeding was next listed before Perry J, the search orders were made. Those \norders are directed to Element Zero, Dr Kolodziejczyk, Dr Winther-Jensen and the occupants of three identified \npremises. Relevantly, the search orders permit searches to be undertaken in accordance with their terms at the \npremises and require the recipients or targets of the search orders, referred to as \"You\", among other things:\n(1) to permit members of the \"Search Party\", as defined, to enter the premises so that they can carry out the search \nand other activities referred to in the search orders;\n(2) having permitted members of the Search Party to enter the premises, to:\n(a) permit them to search for and inspect the \"Listed Things\" as defined in Sch A to the search orders, and to make \nor obtain a copy, photograph, film, sample, test or other record of the Listed Things;\n(b) disclose to them the whereabouts of all the Listed Things in their possession, custody or power, whether at the \npremises or otherwise;\n(c) disclose the whereabouts of all computers (including smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices), computer \ndisks, drives or memory (including portable drives and USB drives), electronic information storage devices or \nsystems, and online accounts (including all cloud and email accounts) at or accessible from the premises in which \nany documents among the Listed Things are or may be stored, located or recorded and cause and permit those \ndocuments to be copied or printed out;\n(d) do all things necessary to enable the Search Party to access the Listed Things including by opening or providing \nkeys to physical or digital locks and enabling them to access and operate computers and online accounts and \nproviding them with all necessary passwords, access credentials and other means of access;\n(e) permit any \"Independent Lawyer\", as defined, to remove certain specified things into their custody; and\n(f) permit any \"Independent Computer Expert\", as defined, to search any computer (including any smartphone, \ntablet and other mobile device), computer disk, drive or memory (including any portable drive and USB drive), any \nelectronic information storage device or system, and online accounts (including all cloud and email accounts) at or \naccessible from the premises, and make a copy or digital copy of any of the foregoing and permit any Independent \nComputer Expert to remove any of the foregoing from the premises in accordance with the terms of the search \norders.\n*Rest of the document and Footnotes can be viewed at: \n(https://www.judgments.fedcourt.gov.au/judgments/Judgments/fca/single/2024/2024fca1157) For any query with \nrespect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at contentservices@htdigital.in\nLoad-Date: October 15, 2024Page 3 of 3\nFEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA ISSUES FULL COURT DECISION FOR FORTESCUE, ET AL.

This is not an exhaustive list, but rather a \nglimpse into the varied and multifaceted careers these leaders excel in, from corporate boardrooms to grassroots \nenterprises\nColleen Hayward AM Colleen Hayward's appointment as an independent non-executive director at Mineral \nResources (MinRes) is more than just a boardroom position, it's a testament to the company's commitment to \nmeaningful Indigenous engagement and leadership.\nAs a highly respected Noongar Elder from Western Australia with extensive experience across health, education, \nand community development, Hayward brings a unique and invaluable perspective to the operations of Mineral \nResources.\nThroughout her life, Hayward has been resolute about the importance of authentic engagement with Aboriginal \npeople.\n\"Every bit of business that happens in this country happens on Aboriginal land,\" she points out, underscoring the \nneed for businesses to recognise and respect this reality by engaging meaningfully with traditional owners and \nIndigenous communities.\nThis mission is evident in MinRes' procurement strategy, which has seen an extraordinary increase in spending with \nIndigenous-owned businesses.\nFrom just $2.6m in FY21, the company's engagement skyrocketed to $68m in FY24, benefiting 44 Indigenous \nbusinesses.\nThis growth is not just about meeting targets; it's about fostering real, sustainable economic development.\nPage 2 of 5\nThe game changers\n\"It's not procurement for procurement's sake,\" Hayward explains. \"It's about partnering with the most capable \nindividuals to deliver the services we require.\" MinRes' approach goes beyond transactional relationships, with a \nrange of program in place to support Indigenous businesses through initiatives such as Business Startup Grants, \ntailored finance solutions through dedicated finance facilities, and in-house support for business set-up and \nsustainable growth.\nThe impact of these efforts is perhaps best illustrated by the personal stories that emerge from MinRes' \ncollaborations. Hayward shares one particularly inspiring example: \"I was at a lunch recently, and there were a \ncouple of the traditional owners there \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and they were over the moon in terms of their personal experience. In 10 \nmonths, because of their engagement with MinRes they were buying their own house, and they had never been \nable to do that before.\" This story, one of many, underscores the transformative potential of MinRes' strategic \nsupport for Indigenous businesses, enabling them to achieve economic stability and growth in ways that have a \nprofound impact on the broader community.\nDespite these achievements, Hayward acknowledges that there is still a long way to go, particularly in increasing \nIndigenous representation at the highest levels in corporate Australia.\nCurrently, there are only four Indigenous directors on ASX 300 boards. This figure starkly contrasts with the \nincreased public sentiment calling for greater Indigenous involvement.\n\"People don't know the skills and expertise that we can bring \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and when you don't know, you get a bit scared. \nFear breeds paralysis. But it's actually time, in this country, for everyone to be a bit brave,\" she says.\nIt's clear that companies like MinRes continue to make bold steps to address this disparity across the country, and \nin so doing not only enhance their own governance and community engagement but also lead by example for \nothers to follow. Hayward's leadership at MinRes serves as a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when \nIndigenous voices are not just included but are actively shaping the future of corporate Australia.\nMike Westerman Glencore Copper industrial lead Mike Westerman oversees a global workforce of 30,000 \nemployees. His formative years growing up on sheep and cattle stations, combined with his education in the Tom \nPrice community in the Pilbara, gave him a first-hand introduction to the mining industry and shaped his leadership \nstyle. Drawing on his rural and Indigenous heritage, Westerman emphasises the importance of fostering strong \nrelationships at both grassroots and corporate levels. In discussing the First Nations business landscape, he \nhighlights that true success lies in the ability to add value and deliver tangible results, affirming that dedication and \neffectiveness can drive achievement in any endeavour.\n\"My career has involved a fair bit of sacrifice, including living in places others wouldn't and taking on responsibilities \nothers didn't want. There have also been some risks involved, such as moving to new locations or taking on \nchallenging jobs. And, of course, a bit of luck - being in the right place at the right time and showing up when \nneeded.\"\nGordon Cole Noongar man and Cole Supplies chief executive Gordon Cole has a strong entrepreneurial spirit that \nhas led him to work across various industries within the Indigenous business sector. Since co-founding the \nIndigenous-owned wholesaler in 2013, specialising in workwear, safety, health, medical and industrial products, \nCole has held key roles, including board director at First Australians Capital and chair of the Noongar Chamber of \nCommerce and Industry. He describes the Indigenous business sector as vibrant, healthy and on an unprecedented \ngrowth trajectory.\n\"I've really enjoyed my time in business and have started to explore further opportunities for our sector in business, \ntrade and investment, where we aim to scale up and become greater participants in the economy.\"\nWayne Bergmann Wayne Bergmann is the managing director of Leedal Pty Ltd, where he focuses on fostering \neconomic independence and opportunities for Aboriginal communities in the Kimberley region. He previously \nserved as the CEO of the Kimberley Land Council, negotiating multibillion-dollar native title agreement. He is \nexecutive chair of the National Indigenous Times and Professor of Practice at the University of NSW.Page 3 of 5\nThe game changers\nA published author, Bergmann's strategic leadership has driven commercial success by advocating for Indigenous \nbusiness participation, securing significant investments and facilitating partnerships that empower Aboriginal people \nto achieve economic self-sufficiency.\n\"All my life in business I have been told 'you can't do that', such as with the National Indigenous Times. To see the \nthings that I've put effort into, in the Indigenous space, where it has failed in the past, and to see it become \nsuccessful, has become an incredible feeling to make things happen that no one else believed could happen. With \ngrit and determination you can do anything.\" \"Business has been a single value of my whole life. Working for a \nliving. But for the first 30 years, most of my life was about social justice and the biggest challenge was pivoting and \nfinding the balance between that mission and being an entrepreneur.\"\nNoel Pearson Hailing from the Guugu Yimidhirr community of Hope Vale on the southeastern Cape York Peninsula, \nNoel Pearson is a prominent Indigenous lawyer, academic and activist who founded the Cape York Partnership in \n2004. The non-profit organisation focuses on empowering Indigenous families and communities to pursue lives of \nvalue, freedom and prosperity. Pearson has long championed Indigenous self-determination and economic \ndevelopment, with a focus on tackling systemic inequalities and promoting practical solutions for community \nempowerment. His influential work has shaped national discussions on reconciliation, Indigenous policy reform and \neconomic participation. Recently, Pearson was appointed to the board of Fortescue Metals Group, further \nextending his influence into corporate leadership and the resource sector.\nAmanda Healy Under Amanda Healy's leadership, Warrikal has become one of Australia's most successful \nIndigenous-owned engineering companies, providing significant employment and training opportunities for \nIndigenous people in the resources sector.\nSimultaneously, as CEO of Kirrikin, she champions Indigenous artists by transforming their works into globally \nrecognised fashion statements, bridging culture and commerce.\nHealy has spoken extensively about her leadership journey, and the impact she aims to make through her \nbusinesses. Reflecting on her early career in the mining industry, she notes she had to be tough to succeed in a \nmale-dominated environment, but she has always focused on building strong relationships with both employees and \ntraditional owners. She emphasises the importance of leading by example and leveraging entrepreneurship to \nsupport Indigenous artists and communities, such as through Kirrikin, her luxury fashion brand that returns profits to \nthe artists and supports small Indigenous businesses.\nAt Warrikal, Healy aims to provide opportunities for Indigenous workers and has grown the company to a significant \nsize with a diverse workforce. She acknowledges the challenges in achieving a 20 per cent Indigenous workforce \ntarget but remains committed to expanding opportunities for Indigenous participation in the industry. Healy is also \npassionate about using her platform to address the lack of generational wealth among Indigenous communities, a \nchallenge she has personally faced and strives to overcome through her business ventures.\nAmanda is clear on the future when it comes to Indigenous business leaders: \"We need to have a bigger say in it \nand we're never going to get there unless we are taken seriously, unless people start to see us functioning and \noperating at the highest possible level, and understand that we're just as smart as everyone.\"\nBen Wyatt Renowned as the first Indigenous treasurer (WA) for any Australian state or territory and the first \nIndigenous person appointed to the board of an ASX-200 company, Yamatji man Ben Wyatt continues to be a \nsignificant force in economic reforms and fiscal management. Speaking on the positive growth within the \nIndigenous business landscape, Wyatt highlights the increasing opportunity for Indigenous entrepreneurs. In his \ncurrent role as an independent non-executive director on the boards of Rio Tinto and Woodside Energy, he \nemphasises that the resources sector can play a pivotal role by ensuring Indigenous communities are included in \neconomic opportunities through partnerships, procurement and investment in Indigenous-owned businesses.\nDaniel Tucker AM Wongatha and Mirning man Daniel Tucker AM founded and sits at the helm of Carey Group, a \nFirst Nations mining, construction and training company, as its managing director. With more than 30 years of \nexperience in the mining industry and a background in senior executive roles within ASX-listed companies, Tucker Page 4 of 5\nThe game changers\nestablished the Carey Education Trust in 2007 to support Aboriginal education. Honoured with an Order of Australia \nMedal in 2020, he is a prominent champion for reconciliation, cultural preservation and community development. \nTucker continues to advocate for greater investment in Indigenous-led education and the need to address systemic \ninequalities within Indigenous communities.\nAdam Goodes Former AFL legend, two-time premiership winner and dual Brownlow Medallist Adam Goodes is a \nproud Adnyamathanha and Narungga man, celebrated for his contributions both on and off the field. Known for his \nstrong advocacy for Indigenous rights and anti-racism efforts, Goodes has shifted his focus to community work \nsince retiring from football. In 2009, he co-founded the GO Foundation, which supports Indigenous youth through \neducation initiatives. Goodes believes education is the key to a better future, which inspired the foundation's launch.\nSharna Collard Balladong and Wilmen woman Sharna Collard's leadership journey began in 2015 with the launch \nof Australia's first Indigenous-led and owned fleet company, Kooya. As the current chief executive, Collard reflects \non the family-run enterprise's mission to address the critical need for Indigenous-owned businesses in the fleet \nsector.\n\"We diversified into the fleet sector with Kooya because there were no other Aboriginal businesses in this space. \nRecognising this untapped market gave us the confidence to fulfil this need,\" she explains.\nCollard, alongside her father Kim, who initially served as chief executive before transitioning to chair, have been \ninstrumental in driving the company's growth. Starting as fleet manager, Collard quickly showcased her potential, \nadvancing to general manager in 2018 and assuming the top role a year later.\n\"I've grown with the business and now understand every facet of it,\" she says. \"'The importance of Aboriginal \nleadership in business cannot be overstated. While Aboriginal ownership is crucial, effective management and \nleadership are essential for maintaining the company's cultural integrity.\" Reflecting on Kooya's early challenges, \nCollard admits it wasn't an easy start. \"I don't mind admitting it was certainly trying,\" she says.\n\"There was some hesitance from businesses to engage with Kooya because we are in the professional and \nfinancial services sectors, where Aboriginal businesses are under-represented.\" Despite these initial obstacles, \nKooya quickly established itself in the market. \"Kooya has stood the test of time, and now, looking at our customer \nbase, we have a series of blue-chip clients, including Fortescue, BHP, Telstra and Chevron,\" Collard says.\nFortescue began its partnership with Kooya in 2018, initially leasing services for 34 assets on a single mine site. At \nthe end of last year, the contract was renewed and expanded to include 110 electric Tuatara Ultra Terrain Vehicles \nfor Fortescue's Pilbara sites. Kooya now manages leasing activities across three mine sites for Fortescue: \nSolomon, Eliwana and Iron Bridge.\n\"The key to the success between Kooya and Fortescue has been incremental growth. It began as a small \nopportunity, which required Kooya to prove our worth by providing excellent customer service and be competitive, \nas is often the case in business,\" Collard says.\nShe highlights that the partnership is built on a shared mission to drive Fortescue's decarbonisation goals.\n\"There is a strong synergy and alignment between First Nation businesses and our commitment to decarbonisation. \nOver the past 12 months, we executed the exclusive master decarbonisation contract with Fortescue, allowing us \nto work closely with them towards their decarbonisation objectives.\" Beyond business, Collard's leadership is \ndeeply connected to social impact. The Bibbulmun Fund, established in 2014, channels 5 per cent of Kooya's net \nprofits into community initiatives. The fund supports leadership and entrepreneurship programs and contributes to \nhealth initiatives such as the Purple House Foundation's renal dialysis support.\n\"A crucial aspect of Kooya's offering is its focus on the Aboriginal social impact. My dad and I and many Aboriginal \npeople/individuals recognise that governance is rooted in reciprocity and giving back. To embody this principle, we \nestablished the Bibbulmun Fund to support and contribute to our communities,\" she says.Page 5 of 5\nThe game changers\nReflecting on her journey so far, Collard expresses pride in what she's achieved. \"As a proud Aboriginal woman in a \nmale-dominated field, I take great pride in my role as a leader. I strive to create change and lead by example, \ndemonstrating the impact of Aboriginal leadership in driving progress and inspiring others,\" she says.\nLoad-Date: October 15, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: FEATURES; Pg. 36\nLength: 2084 words\nByline: Jennifer Hewett\nBody\nBusiness acumen Mark Barnaba has an uncanny ability to forge close relationships that turn into long-term \nopportunities, writes Jennifer Hewett.\nMark Barnaba met a brash, young New York property developer in 1988. Donald Trump had sold the iconic St \nMoritz hotel in Manhattan to Alan Bond for $US180 million. Barnaba was Bond's young executive assistant.\n\"Even then, Trump was just extraordinarily firm in his own views regardless of what others thought,\" Barnaba says. \n\"He's not easily persuaded.\"\nIt's one more adventure in a now crowded corporate history that features Barnaba's close relationships with some \nof Australia's most famous - or infamous - business leaders.\nBarnaba promised to work for an almost equally brash and persuasive West Australian entrepreneur for two years \nin exchange for Bond's help in funding his degree from Harvard Business School.\nThis was after Bond had read an article about the ambitions of a bright, young university medallist in The West \nAustralian newspaper and immediately called him in for a chat.\nThe Bond empire collapsed before Barnaba's two years was up. Barnaba jokes he was \"green as a cabbage\" while \nBond was ditching assets - from Chilean phone businesses, to Heileman Brewing, to private aircraft - in a desperate \nattempt to stay afloat.\nBut he describes the ability to listen and observe as key to an \"incredible education\", leading to many more \nencounters with more billionaire entrepreneurs.\nThat list includes Andrew Forrest and Robin Khuda. Barnaba has been on the board of Fortescue Metals Group \nsince 2010. He will step down as lead independent director next month but remains as deputy chairman.\nHe is also independent chairman of Australia's latest global success story, AirTrunk, the big data centre developer \nbought by Blackstone last month for a staggering $24 billion.\nPage 2 of 5\nA director with a golden touch for connecting\nThe evening the sale was announced, Khuda celebrated over dinner at Barnaba's spectacular riverside home in \nPerth's Mosman Park. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was another guest.\nChalk it up as another remarkable day and night in the life of one of the country's most well-connected directors - \nbut in almost the mirror image of the stereotypical Melbourne club directors who once dominated corporate \nAustralia. It's the triumph of new money and new opportunities over old - always with the lure of more to come, new \nrecords to beat.\nBarnaba, for example, is also chairman of Greatland Gold, which is in the news after paying $US475 million ($709 \nmillion) for Newmont Mining's gold and copper assets in Western Australia. This was the largest capital raising in \nmining in the UK in seven years. Next step is an ASX listing in 2025.\nBarnaba, 61, is the son of immigrant Italians and credits his own supportive family for his rise.\nBut he has also always forged other tight personal connections, helping him become a major player in corporate \nconsultancy work in WA before an array of senior executive roles and directorships.\nOver those decades, this has involved stints with McKinsey and his own boutique advisory firms, executive roles at \nMacquarie Bank and board positions on prominent corporate, sporting and not-for-profit businesses, including the \nReserve Bank board.\nHis enthusiasm for what has been achieved - and by whom - is undimmed.\nHe happily describes his old friend Forrest and his new mate Khuda as \"incredible Australians\" he's been fortunate \nto work alongside.\n\"It's a privilege working with companies like Fortescue, AirTrunk, Greatland, even in a prior life the RBA and \nMacquarie,\" he says.\n\"Think about how many companies there are that have really exported themselves out of Australia.\"\nIt translates into Barnaba's belief in the success of founder-led companies or those that are still greatly influenced \nby the original DNA in shaping the culture.\n\"At the end of the day, what separates those companies is culture,\" he says. \"They are all different cultures, but \nthey are distinctive and they are world-class.\n\"It's difficult to argue that the organisations aren't materially better off still having their founders there.\"\nAccording to Barnaba, Blackstone is a strong, very supportive and natural owner of AirTrunk and will \"bring a lot to \nthe party\".\n\"Both Blackstone and Robin asked me to stay because if it wasn't for Robin, I wouldn't want to be there,\" he says.\n\"Often you have to ask: do you make a decision based on the naked nature of the opportunity or on the quality of \nthe individuals involved? Ideally, you want all of one - the people - and some of the other - the opportunity.\"\nSo he probably wouldn't have gone to work at Macquarie in 2011, he insists, had it not been for people he greatly \nadmires, such as former chief executive Nicholas Moore and ex head of Macquarie Capital Robin Bishop, doing the \nasking.\nBut Barnaba also fosters an instinctive ability to translate personal attachments into long-term business \nopportunities. When Barnaba became chairman of AirTrunk in October last year, an enthusiastic Khuda cited his \nextensive background in scaling fast-growing businesses, his entrepreneurial acumen and deep understanding of \ncapital markets.\nYet the major link, personal and professional, was Macquarie and its original investment in AirTrunk.Page 3 of 5\nA director with a golden touch for connecting\nAs the business prepared itself for an IPO or sale, Barnaba replaced Ani Satchcroft, Macquarie Asset \nManagement's head of infrastructure, as chair. She happened to be married to Alex Satchcroft, an ex-Macquarie \nbanker, who had worked with the current head of risk, Andrew Cassidy, when Ben Brazil was one of the investment \nbank's key deal makers.\nNaturally, Barnaba and Brazil have been friends since their 20s. Naturally, Alex Satchcroft and Cassidy also knew \nBarnaba well from their overlapping time at Macquarie. Naturally, Cassidy asked Barnaba if he would take a call \nfrom Ani Satchcroft.\nThose sorts of intricate relationships are liberally sprinkled over Barnaba's corporate record. But are they a little too \nclose for claims to independence? The top echelons in Australia's business community can seem incestuous in \ntheir circles within circles, the WA business community even more so.\nBarnaba has been close friends with Forrest for decades, for example, as well as being Fortescue's deputy \nchairman since 2017 and lead independent director since 2014. Forrest's private company Wyloo Metals has \nbecome a cornerstone investor in Greatland.\nBarnaba will only step down as lead independent director after proxy advisers last year questioned the \nremuneration packages and the sudden exits of a relatively new CEO, Fiona Hicks, along with other key executives.\nFortescue said at the time that Barnaba's replacement would \"be a key component of the board's renewal strategy\" \neven though Barnaba will stay as deputy chairman.\nForrest has, of course, made an art form of defying the traditional corporate rules and restraints to build a massive \nbusiness.\n\"If anything, I feel more independent than I have during my whole tenure because independence is a state of mind \nand not an outcome dedicated by length of service on a board,\" Barnaba argues.\n\"If you spend enough time on a board with colleagues, you get to know them well and end up sharing aspects of \nyour lives together.\n\"But it doesn't have to - and shouldn't - impair independence. It never has for me. It's just not in my nature. I wear a \nbadge of objective and independent thinking.\"\nTake that, corporate governance specialists.\nWhat is never in question is Barnaba's admiration for Forrest.\n\"The man is one of the country's greatest ever industrialists,\" he says.\n\"There's no other way to frame that. He has got stamina and energy and vision like no one I have ever known.\"\nAnd Barnaba has known Forrest a long time.\nAfter several years operating out of London with McKinsey, his initial foray into the boutique advisory world in Perth \nin the mid-1990s soon included work for someone he had first encountered while still at the University of Western \nAustralia.\n\"He doesn't remember that, but I remember it, because Andrew always made an impression.\" Barnaba says drily.\nBy the time of their renewed acquaintance, Forrest was trying to develop Anaconda Nickel before being forced out \nin 2001 by investors dismayed at their losses.\nThe relationship survived and thrived - unlike Forrest's standing with many Australian investors and US \nbondholders.Page 4 of 5\nA director with a golden touch for connecting\nBarnaba has been along for most of the wild ride since the indefatigable Forrest began to build again with \nFortescue.\nThis included another near-death corporate experience after the iron ore price collapsed against a heavily indebted \nbusiness, requiring radical new debt restructuring to be set up at hyper-speed.\nFortescue's perilous dance with survival is in the past. Despite delays or missteps in Forrest's more recent forays \ninto areas such as green hydrogen and nickel, the company is securely enough grounded in the iron ore wealth of \nthe Pilbara to accommodate his ambitions to help lead the energy revolution.\n\"Andrew's mantra, which we all believe, is to show you can do real zero - not net zero, real zero - profitably and \nFortescue is in the process of showing that,\" Barnaba says firmly.\nThat may prove an even bigger test than creating a new iron ore business.\nNor does Barnaba see any conflict in holding his view on renewables while chairing a massive data centre operator \ngrappling with the extreme, unresolved energy demands of data centres in an artificial intelligence world.\nAirTrunk, he says, is one of the most sustainably aware and advanced companies globally, with a policy of net zero \nby 2030.\n\"The ones that do it best are the ones that do it from within,\" he says. \"If it's forced on you, you never get as far as \nquickly.\"\nAll such challenges were beyond any board's thinking in the distant era when Barnaba started his corporate \nconsulting career.\nIn 2001, the WA consulting business he started with two mates and veteran deal maker John Poynton was sold for \n$44 million.\n\"You wake up and think: 'I've got balance sheet'. I never expected that to occur in my 30s,\" he says, calling it \nanother \"life-changing experience\".\nHe went deeper into boutique investment banking, co-founding Azure Capital with Poynton, before selling out of \nthat in 2010 and taking up the role with Macquarie.\nUnusually for the perpetually smooth Barnaba, the break with Poynton was personal as well as professional.\nNone of his activities stopped him holding an extensive variety of WA board roles over the years, ranging from \nchairman of Western Power to president of the West Coast Eagles to executive chairman of the UWA Business \nSchool to chairman of the Black Swan State Theatre Company.\nBarnaba was, of course, also friendly with a range of influential federal Liberal cabinet politicians at the time, \nincluding factional enemies Julie Bishop and Mathias Cormann. Nicholas Moore was not the only one to make jokes \nabout Barnaba being Mr WA.\nBut being asked to join the RBA board in 2017 allowed an easy exit from Macquarie. No one imagined a pandemic \nwould transform monetary policy during his six-year role.\n\"There's no playbook and you are having to make real-time decisions with imperfect information,\" Barnaba reflects \non that extraordinary time.\nHe won't join any criticism of former governor Philip Lowe over his forward guidance about interest rates staying low \nfor years. Not only did this guidance fail to contemplate surging inflation, it ensured Lowe's unpopularity with the \npublic and politiciansPage 5 of 5\nA director with a golden touch for connecting\n\"It's important to note that the executive, the governor, will put forward a recommendation but it's a decision by the \nboard. Phil Lowe was an outstanding governor and we were terribly fortunate to have him. He stood tall and he did \nit with integrity.\n\"Michele Bullock has been a wonderful choice as well.\"\nBut as he looks out over the glorious vista of the Swan River, the optimistic Barnaba sees troubles ahead.\nThose include many of the typical business concerns, especially in the mining industry, about the impact of the new \nindustrial relations laws, excessive regulation and a tax system no longer fit for purpose.\nHe is also greatly concerned about inequality, he says, particularly given the cost of housing.\n\"So what are our issues? Inequality and making sure that the best society is the one that looks after the most \ndisadvantaged,\" he says.\n\"Two is social unrest. Three is that Australia still creates opportunities.\n\"The day we fail to celebrate, or don't generate, an Andrew Forrest or a Robin Khuda is the day we will lose the \naspirations of those who are so important to creating our next industries.\" AFR\nLoad-Date: October 19, 2024\nEnd of Document",

However, as soon as we became aware \nof the incident we took immediate action.\n\"We take all matters relating to safety seriously. While we have policies, training, reporting and support services in \nplace, this improvement notice reinforces the work already under way and the need to continuously improve.\" In a \njoint statement last week, the Forrests said it was an appropriate time to step aside as co-chairs with Minderoo's \n2030 strategy finalised and being rolled out. Dr Forrest also said he wanted to focus on his role as executive chair \nof iron ore miner Fortescue.\nThe WorkSafe revelations come amid rumblings about the workplace culture at Minderoo, where 150 staff have \nbeen shown the door since April as part of -efforts to ensure more funds go -towards causes that include helping \nvulnerable communities and protecting oceans.\nOne former employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they had concerns about psychosocial safety at \nMinderoo. \"There is clearly a cultural problem, I don't think that is a great secret,\" the employee said.\nAnother source at Minderoo spoke of unrealistic workloads and being pressed to work on tasks outside their \nemployment contract. Some of the concerns were borne out in a staff survey.\nOthers have praised the Forrests and Minderoo CEO John Hartman for their achievements in philanthropy and \nleadership through the foundation's overhaul.\nMinderoo became one of world's biggest philanthropic foundations in June last year when the Forrests tipped in 220 \nmillion shares in iron ore miner Fortescue. The shares were worth about $5bn at the time and represented about a \nfifth of their total shareholding in the miner.\nThe foundation, started by the couple more than 20 years ago, subsequently went through a shake-up and staff \nclean-out. The reset included a new structure and executive team, and cutting the workforce from about 350 to 200.\nApart from Mr Hartman, the rest of the Minderoo nine-member executive team are women.\nThe foundation made one of its biggest grants last year to a gender fund aimed at achieving a fairer world for \nwomen and girls.\nThe watchdog took Fortescue to court last year, alleging the miner had failed to supply work safety authorities with \ndocuments relating to 34 cases of -alleged sexual harassment.\nFor-tescue was charged with 34 counts of refusing or failing to comply with a requirement to provide documents to \na WorkSafe inspector within a specified period.\nThe legal showdown involved legislation introduced after a WA parliamentary inquiry shed light on sexual \nharassment and assaults on women in the mining industry. Fortescue said at the time that it did not want to reveal \nthe identity of those mentioned in the documents to WorkSafe inspectors, but was \"committed to upholding the \nhighest standards of workplace health and safety and has zero tolerance for inappropriate behaviour in the \nworkplace\". WorkSafe's dropped the charges after reaching agreement with Fortescue on an \"enforceable \nundertaking\" that included handing over the documents. and a commitment to tackle inappropriate workplace \nbehaviour.\nLoad-Date: October 20, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The site has since been destroyed.\nThe accuracy of that estimate was challenged by the archaeologist enlisted by Fortescue, Doug Williams, who \ndescribed it as \"highly speculative\".\nAll three archaeologists, however, agreed the sites pointed to human habitation in the area since at least 42,500 \nyears ago.\nThe scientific significance of the various sites are being considered by the court as it weighs up what if any \ncompensation Fortescue owes the Yindjibarndi for the mining it has carried out on land over which the Yindjibarndi \nholds Native Title rights.\nAlso admitted as evidence this week was a joint report signed by economics consultant Murray Meaton and PwC \npartner Campbell Jaski - engaged respectively by Yindjibarndi and Fortescue - examining the calculation of -\npotential royalty-based compensation. Those experts considered royalties of between 1 per cent and 0.55 per cent, \nwhich if ultimately found by the court would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the -Yindjibarndi.\nThe Solomon hub has to date exported around $50bn of iron ore since 2013 and is expected to continue operating \nfor decades.\nPage 2 of 2\n'Oldest' Pilbara Aboriginal site destroyed\nFortescue was granted approval to damage or destroy 249 sites across the area under Western Australia's \nAboriginal Heritage Act, the same legislation that gave Rio Tinto the legal authority to destroy the Juukan Gorge \nrockshelters in 2019.\nExcavations at the Juukan Gorge rockshelters before their destruction had found charcoal and other artefacts that \nsuggested they had been inhabited as long as almost 43,000 years ago.\nIn their report, Professor Veth and Dr Bird said there were five rock-shelter sites within Solomon \"which by virtue of \ntheir great age and repeated occupation through time are, in our opinion, based on our study, training and \nexperience as archaeologists, of national significance\".\nThose sites included TRYINPAD13-03.\nThe pair was critical of how -little information from the -excavation works at Solomon had been made available \npublicly, given the wider cultural, public and research value of the sites.\n\"There appears to be a lack of dissemination and publication of excavation site reports for early Aboriginal \noccupation and use of the [Solomon hub]. It is not clear why this information has not been disseminated for wider \nheritage management and significance assessment both in the Pilbara and the wider Australian arid zone,\" they \nsaid.\nMr Williams, who among other roles is the ACT Heritage Council's expert for archaeology, said Professor Veth and \nDr Bird had relied on a \"relatively uncritical analysis\" of the estimated dates for the sites.\nHe said the estimate for TRYINPAD 13-03 was based on just 22 recovered artefacts and there were indications \nthere had been mixing of the deposit over time.\nA spokeswoman for Fortescue said the company was committed to seeing this matter settled \"so all Yindjibarndi \npeople can benefit\".\nBusiness P15\nLoad-Date: October 20, 2024\nEnd of Document",

We encourage the federal government to bring forward its review, so the mining sector can focus on \ninvesting in decarbonisation.\"\nThe safeguard mechanism is slated for review in 2026-27.\nCalls for a review mark an escalation in Fortescue's attack on the diesel tax credit system, which allows mining \ncompanies to claim a tax rebate when the diesel is used on private roads.\nFortescue's director of global sustainability and external affairs, Bronwyn Grieve, earlier this month told the \nFinancial Review the government should consider tying the lucrative fuel tax credit to decarbonisation efforts for \nmajor miners.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue pushes Canberra for emissions safeguard review Exclusive\nFortescue argues the cost incurred by companies paying for Australian carbon credit units when they don't meet \nprescribed emission reduction levels under the safeguard mechanism are outweighed by the value of the diesel fuel \ntax.\nBut Productivity Commission commissioner Barry Sterland said the policy was working to prompt big emitters to \nreflect on their emission abatement opportunities.\nHe said while the commission wanted to see the safeguard mechanism expanded to cover more industrial players \nand heavy transport, he did not believe it was being undermined by fuel credits.\n\"I don't think that necessarily works at cross purposes, I think there's a different complex argument to be had about \nthe transport fuel space,\" Mr Sterland told The Australian Financial Review Energy and Climate Summit in Sydney. \n\"I think, regardless, the safeguard sends a signal into that sector.\"\nThe call for a shake-up of the safeguard mechanism comes a week after the WA government announced it would \nstrip its environment protection agency of the power to assess mining and other major project applications on their \nemissions.\nThe government cited legal advice that suggested the Commonwealth should be responsible.\nThe move, which the government argued would reduce duplicative assessments between the state and federal \nsystems, was lauded by the WA mining lobby and energy giant Woodside, but condemned by environmental groups \nand the Greens.\nAsked whether the federal government would consider bringing forward its review, a spokeswoman for Climate \nChange and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the safeguard mechanism was driving down emissions from the \nnation's biggest industrial facilities.\nLoad-Date: October 25, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The latest development saw both \nof them abandon their torrid legal beef on Tuesday after White buckled and agreed to pay an undisclosed \nsettlement amount in the millions of dollars.\nFor that price, Rogan withdrew the raft of unpalatable allegations that she's levelled at the WiseTech founder, \nnamely that he invested in her wellness -business in exchange for sexual relations.\nSpurred by that glowing cinder of scandal, a parade of women have stepped forward to accuse White of \nungentlemanly conduct, including on social media.\nInstead of Instagram, White used LinkedIn to slide into the DMs of the women he fancied. One woman he met, \nJenna Riches, told The Australian that he presented her with a bunch of flowers, which is sweet enough \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 except \nthere was a dildo sticking out among the chrysanthemums. Or perhaps they were roses? Riches never confirmed \nthe genus of flower.\nMore material here is that the staggering drop in WiseTech's share price, the $2bn wipe-out to White's net wealth, \nand the reputational whacking he's received (top of low, bottom of medium on the public shaming scale) could have \nall been buried beneath a pile of NDAs for a fraction of the sum he's now agreed to pay.\nMargin Call has established with impeccable authority that Rogan made an attempt last year to settle her feud with \nWhite for a bargain basement price of about $400,000, or what White probably spends restringing his rare guitars \neach year.\nIt was an offer extended during the early months of 2023, at which point Rogan had been locked out of the \nVaucluse mansion that White had purchased for her - and at a time when Rogan was alleging that White owed her \nmore than $91,400 for the furnishings she had bought. It's that amount that she later successfully sought months \nlater to garnish from his bank account, setting the fuse on this palaver between them.\nPage 2 of 3\nCut price could have solved issue\nA Sydney solicitor (referred to Rogan by someone in the Cranbrook parent network) -approached White's camp \nwith the offer, which was refused, and which must now be regarded as one of the worst decisions ever made by a \nman with much, much more to lose than $400,000.\nWhite, clinging for life to what remains of his good name, chose not to comment on that.\nChange of address If British corporate regulators ever need to write to Fortescue, it's very important that they know \nthe company owns its own building.\nThat's the only conclusion that can be drawn from a bizarre little update to the company records in the UK this week \nof Fortescue Zero, which noted a change of address for the miner's UK subsidiary.\nAnother management shake-up? Or have they moved? Curious if so, given they only bought the \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a316m ($31.1m) \nbuilding a year ago, and moved in in April.\nBut no! On closer examination the address change is little more than a missive to Companies House to announce a \nrebrand had officially arrived in the village of Kidlington, just outside Oxford.\nIn future, rather than writing to Fortescue Zero at Oxford Spires Business Park, correspondence should be \naddressed Fortescue Zero, The Fortescue Building.\nStill, it cost the company a cool \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a38.8m to pay out the lease on its former HQ, according to its financial \nstatements, so you'd probably want to make sure you get full value from the branding where you can.\nFortescue Zero's annual accounts, released at the end of August, show a \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a322m loss for the year - on revenue \nup 45 per cent to \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a3112.6m.\nThe improvement, its directors say, is due to extra business coming in from Fortescue's own decarbonisation \nprograms in Australia. But the extent of Fortescue Zero's remaining outside business is, alas, not clear - the \ncompany has taken advantage of UK rules that allow it to duck reporting related-party transactions in wholly owed \nBritish subsidiaries of offshore companies.\nBlackwattle spray The danger of spraying your opinion around in the name of publicity is that you're always in \ndanger of making yourself look like a bit of a goose.\nTake Sydney investment house Blackwattle Partners. After launching in 2023 with $60m in seed capital, the fund \nmanager has done a nice job of getting its name in the financial press.\nCalling on Rio Tinto to abandon its dual-listed structure in June was met with a shrug by the mining giant, but \nsparked a new round of discussion about Rio's listed structure.\nAnd then there is Rio's $US6.7bn takeover offer for lithium play Arcadium. Blackwattle mid-cap fund manager Tim \nRiordan rushed out a statement decrying the deal as soon as it hit the market, saying it would never, ever vote for \nthe bid without a substantial bump and expressing \"disappointment\" that the board and management had agreed to \nthe deal.\nThat, as an aside, was given short shrift by Arcadium chairman Peter Coleman, who told a Perth newspaper he'd \nnever heard of Blackwattle, hadn't received its letter, and was only taking it on faith that it was a shareholder. \nArcadium wasn't in Blackwattle's top five mid-cap fund holdings in September, by the way, according to its latest \nfund statement.\nBut then the weekend press brought out Blackwattle's Ray David on the subject of lithium, talking up Rio's offer as \npotentially one of the company's finest acquisitions.\n\"Buying low-cost lithium assets such as Arcadium at current lithium prices makes total sense to us as Rio Tinto \nshareholders,\" David said.Page 3 of 3\nCut price could have solved issue\nDavid manages a different Blackwattle fund, to be fair, so there's no suggestion of Takeovers Code breaches. And \ninvestment managers are entitled to their own opinions.\nBut, as David reminded Margin Call when asked about the disparity of views, there are a lot of distressed lithium \ncompanies on the market and not many buyers - which you might think would also resonate with his colleagues \nacross the hall.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Fortescue Zero's bizarre update to UK company records\nLoad-Date: October 22, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 15\nLength: 837 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nThe chief executive of Fortescue's energy business, Mark Hutchinson, has assumed a leadership role at a \nreligious organisation that says sex should exclusively be between married heterosexual couples, despite the iron \nore giant's stated support for sexual and gender diversity.\nMr Hutchinson and wife Angelina became directors of Alpha International last year, putting them at the helm of a \nglobal Christian group that seeks to transform society through a \"re-evangelisation of the nations\".\nLondon-based Alpha offers courses to help people \"discover and develop a relationship with Jesus\". Some 1.8 \nmillion watched its videos in the past year alone. The courses are aimed at teenagers, those preparing for marriage, \nand couples trying to salvage or \"affair-proof\" their marriage. The courses also preach abstinence before marriage, \ntell married people to serve their partner's sexual needs even when they don't feel like it, and claim that prayer can \ncure illnesses such as cancer.\nMr Hutchinson does not appear in the video courses but is one of 17 directors of the global organisation. He is also \na director of Alpha International and Alpha Australia National Office.\nIn one episode of the Alpha Youth series, Canadian pastor Jason Ballard told his teenage audience that \"Jesus \nwants to guide us\" in our sexuality.\n\"Have you ever thought about the idea that God invented sex? The Bible is clear about it. Sex is designed for a \nman and a woman in the commitment of marriage,\" he said. \"God invented sex, and it has the power to bring \npeople together, build families and give life, and because it is powerful, it can also cause a lot of damage when it is \nmisused.\"\nMr Ballard's comments are one of several instances in Alpha video courses where sex is exclusively depicted as an \nact between a man and a woman.\nFortescue has positioned itself as a champion of sexual and gender diversity and supports this through a dedicated \nemployee group called Fortitude. The company won an award in July from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry \nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue boss leads anti-gay group\nof Western Australia for its diversity program, and in 2022 it painted one of its mining trucks in rainbow colours as a \nshow of support. Fortescue was a supporter of not-for-profit group PrideWA in 2021.\nMr Hutchinson did not respond for a fortnight when asked by The Australian Financial Review whether Alpha's \nmessages were at odds with Fortescue's stated values. He also declined to say whether he was happy for his \nteam at Fortescue to include people in same-sex marriages.\nAs a result of Mr Hutchinson's silence over the past two weeks, his views on same-sex marriage are not known.\nShortly after the Financial Review published this story online yesterday, a Fortescue spokesman issued a \nstatement saying the company was committed to diversity and encouraged people from different faiths and \nbackgrounds to join its workforce.\n\"All our staff live by the Fortescue values in every aspect of their employment, fostering an inclusive, safe working \nenvironment for all employees,\" said the Fortescue spokesman.\nFormer National Australia Bank head Andrew Thorburn was forced to step down as chief executive of AFL club \nEssendon in 2022 because the team believed his religious links clashed with its values.\nMr Thorburn was, at the time, the chairman of City on a Hill Church, which posted at least one sermon that \ncondemned abortion as murder and another that reportedly described homosexuality as a sin.\nThe board of Alpha International also includes British reverend Nicky Gumbel, who has raised concerns with \nChurch of England bishops about their plan to introduce prayers for same-sex couples.\nThe Alpha Youth course also tells its audience that illnesses can be cured by prayer. In one episode, a woman \nnamed Crystal expresses a belief that worship cured her cancer, rather than the chemotherapy she was receiving.\nIn the same episode, Mr Ballard said he watched a cross-eyed girl, Shannah, have her vision fixed by prayer.\n\"I noticed right away when she looked at me, she had been healed. I could see it in her eyes, they were working \ntogether perfectly ... God had healed her.\"\nIn the Alpha marriage course, the host Sila Lee said staying attractive after marriage is an act of kindness to one's \nspouse, encouraging her audience to service their spouse's sexual desires even when they don't feel like it.\n\"Being responsive may mean taking the initiative to make love as a deliberate choice, even though we may be tired \nor feeling stressed by work, or the circumstances don't match up to our highest expectations,\" Ms Lee said.\nThe Hutchinsons became directors of an Australian registered company, Alpha Australia National Office, in \nNovember 2021. A charity of the same name and company number has been registered with the Australian \nCharities and Not-For-Profits Commission since 2013. The charity reported more than $9 million of revenue in the \n18 months to December and donated more than $1 million to Alpha International, the UK company that has counted \nthe Hutchinsons as directors since last year.\nLoad-Date: October 26, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Element Zero had claimed the surveillance was excessive, but Federal Court judge Brigitte \nMarkovic accepted it was necessary in response to an application to have the search orders thrown out. Justice \nMarkovic ultimately decided Fortescue was legally -entitled to carry out the search -orders and seize millions of \ndocuments ahead of more court -action, but she acknowledged Andrew Forrest's company made a \"material non-\ndisclosure\" when it failed to alert the court about a commercial relationship between it and Mr Masterman.\n\"I am not satisfied that the EZ respondents have established that Fortescue had a weak prima facie case,\" she \nsaid.\n\"The question is whether evidence of Fortescue's relationship with Element Zero, through Mr Masterman, and the \ndiscussions it had about the different concerns it held in December to January 2024 was capable of having affected \nthe court's decision, in particular in relation to the consideration of the risk of -destruction.

The surveillance included following family members to Kmart, rummaging through \nmail and taking pictures of their children leaving school.\nJustice Markovic declined to set aside the search orders based on those claims, however.\n\"The private investigator's reports are lengthy and detailed. However, on their face they do not disclose any \ncollateral purpose. Rather, they attempt to provide information necessary for an application for search orders and \nas required by the court's search orders practice note,\" she said. \"One way of obtaining that information is to \ninstruct qualified persons to attend at and observe premises.

Let's reshape \nit and tie it to decarbonisation,\" he said.\nAs polls suggest the Albanese government is at risk of losing its majority in the next federal election, due by May, \nthe support of independent MPs could prove crucial for any future government.\nBut Federal Resources Minister Madeleine King said there was no appetite to overhaul the tax credit system, which \nwas critical for farmers.\n\"We are not changing the diesel fuel rebate. Farmers and miners get the rebate for vehicles that only operate on \nprivate roads that are not funded by the taxpayer,\" she said.\nThe crossbench foray into the debate comes just weeks after mining giant Fortescue also advocated for fuel tax \ncredits to be tied to decarbonisation efforts, putting it at odds with its competitors and paving the way for a potential \nfight within the resources industry.\nMs Chaney said she had spoken with Fortescue representatives about the reforms, and that the credit should \nremain in place for farmers. She said any company that claims less than $50 million should receive the original \ncredit, which would capture most farmers.\nMinerals Council of Australia chief executive Tania Constable pushed back at Fortescue and Ms Chaney's \nsuggestions, saying removing the credits would weaken the economy.\n\"We already have effective mechanisms to reduce emissions; tinkering with our tax system won't help us achieve \nthese goals,\" she said.\nTeal independent member for Warringah Zali Steggall agreed with her crossbench colleagues that the credits \nshould not be taken away from farmers, but said miners should not receive them at all, regardless of whether they \nwere tied to decarbonisation efforts.\nSenator Pocock accused mining companies of hiding behind farmers on the issue, given agriculture had more \nsocial capital than the resources sector.\nThe Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, which counts Fortescue as well as Rio Tinto, BHP and \nHancock Prospecting as members said it did not support changes to the tax credit system.\nLoad-Date: November 6, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Following this extended \nperiod, with policy ambiguity remaining regarding government approval, we have chosen to withdraw from the sale \nof Rawlinna, which was always a long-term energy opportunity for Fortescue,\" said the spokeswoman.\n\"Fortescue remains committed to pursuing long-term green energy opportunities in the Nullarbor and south-east \nWA region via alternate arrangements.\"\nJumbuck Pastoral has now appointed Elders to sell Rawlinna via a staged expressions-of-interest process \ncommencing this month. Price expectations are understood to be above $20 million for the land (excluding \nlivestock).\nMr MacLachlan, a relative of former AFL chief executive and new Tabcorp boss Gillon McLachlan, discovered the \nsite for the sheep station in the mid-1950s as he was travelling from South Australia to Perth on the Indian Pacific.\nWhen the train stopped at a remote siding called Rawlinna, he observed that it had good quality underground water \nand saw the potential for a vast sheep operation across the vast open saltbush, bluebush and grass plains.\nPage 2 of 2\nKey sheep station on sale\nMr MacLachlan first placed a survey peg in the ground in the 1960s. Through careful planning and substantial \ninvestment, he turned it into the largest sheep station in Australia and an iconic property in the livestock sector. \nAmong its standout features is a 400-kilometre boundary fence.\nRawlinna is part of 136-year-old Jumbuck Pastoral, one of the country's biggest sheep and beef producers. \nJumbuck still controls vast agricultural landholdings despite the MacLachlans splitting up their rural empire last year \nfollowing the departure of brothers Jock and Callum from the business.\nFollowing the breakup, Mr MacLachlan and his daughters Airlie MacLachlan, Islay McKenzie and Brooke Yates \nretained Blina Station in WA, Bulgunnia Station and Commonwealth Hill in SA, and Gunbar Station in NSW, as well \nas Rawlinna.\nJock MacLachlan took charge of McCoys Well Station in South Australia and Derby Station in Western Australia \nwhile Callum retained Wave Hill Station and Killarney Station in the NT.\n\"This represents a rare opportunity to acquire Australia's largest sheep station during a period of unprecedented \ngrowth in demand for quality Australian fibre and protein,\" said Elders executive general manager of network Tom \nRusso.\n\"The station is strategically located to give access to both the western and eastern markets and is a powerhouse of \nwool production, having carried up to 69,000 sheep in recent history. The short-term opportunity is immense as \nRawlinna has benefited from an outstanding season and is very conservatively stocked presently.\"\nLoad-Date: November 6, 2024\nEnd of Document",

More than 52 per cent of shareholders who voted last year opposed the remuneration report.\nThe backlash came after more than a year of leadership upheaval that saw CEO Elizabeth Gaines step aside, her \nreplacement Fiona Hick exit after a short stint in the top job as well as the departure of chief financial officer Ian \nWells and other executives.\nFortescue's move to pay Ms Gaines and Mr Wells special recognition payments of $1.98m and $1m respectively \nearned a rebuke for proxy advisory firms, with CGI Glass Lewis saying \"such ad hoc discretionary payments on \nretirement are unusual among ASX 100 entities\".\nFortescue does not expect to have issues with this year's remuneration report after moving to address shareholder \nand proxy adviser concerns.\n\"The board has heard this feedback and while it retains the ability to apply discretion to incentive outcomes, it will \nnot make discretionary payments that do not clearly align with shareholder interests,\" the company said in its 2024 \nremuneration report.\nThree resolutions on performance rights, including those for Mr Otranto and Mr Hutchinson, that will be put to a vote \non Wednesday are separate to the remuneration report.\nFortescue told investors Ms Gaines, now a part-time executive director and global ambassador for the company, \nhad agreed not to participate in the performance rights plan even though she was eligible.\nFortescue said that if shareholders voted down the resolutions on Mr Otranto and Mr Hutchinson it would need to \nreconsider their remuneration packages for 2025-26 and could offer equivalent cash incentives. Fortescue noted \nsome of the targets that applied to the two chief executives were market sensitive and said it would provide more \ndisclosure in the 2024-25 annual report.\nLoad-Date: November 5, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Sources within the Fortescue leadership team believe \nChina could dramatically boost economic stimulus in response to any move by the US to ramp up tariffs.\n\"The amount of horsepower in the tank of China's economy and the ability to self-stimulate is phenomenal. You've \nseen just the edge of it,\" Dr Forrest said after Fortescue annual general meeting in Perth.\n\"I know that they (China) have so much ready to roll that, whichever way it goes, Australia is going to be all right.\n\"The biggest trading partner the US has ever and will ever have is China. Let's not forget that they butter each \nother's bread.\" Most commentators expect Mr Trump to take an axe to green energy incentives, with implications for \nFortescue's $US550m ($841m) hydrogen project in Arizona. Dr Forrest said Fortescue was already unhappy \nabout some of the rules around the Arizona project and needed more certainty on the future direction of the IRA.\n\"If you have a look at the IRA, it might get adjusted \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we need clarity,\" he said.\n\"The reason why we're not hammering into it is because we need clarity around some of the rules, which has been \nput off to after the election.\" The Fortescue founder described Mr Trump as a \"pragmatic economic guy\" who might \nsee the sense in pursuing investment in green energy.\n\"He's toed the election line. He's been really positive about green energy. He's been really positive about fossil \nfuels. Will he lean forward as much (into green energy), I don't know. But remember, he's an economic pragmatist, \nso he's going to follow the money.\" Dr Forrest was speaking after Fortescue comfortably avoided a second strike \nPage 2 of 2\nChina strong enough to survive US trade war: Forrest\non its remuneration report. The company had moved to quell shareholder unease over ad hoc payments made to \ndeparting executives in 2022-23.\nIndigenous leader Noel Pearson and infrastructure investment expert Rao-Monari were elected to the board and \nshareholders overwhelmingly endorsed bonus packages for metals division chief executive Dino Otranto and his \nenergy division counterpart Mark Hutchinson.\nShareholders received no update on when Fortescue might make final investment decisions on the Holmaneset \nhydrogen project in Norway and the Pecem project in Brazil.\nIn response to a request from Australia Shareholder's Association for more information on where money was being \nspent within the loss-making energy division, Dr Forrest promised to provide a more detailed breakdown.\nIn July, Fortescue retreated from its green hydrogen ambitions, shed about 700 jobs and abandoned a target to \nproduce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030.\nThe company shifted its focus to renewable electricity and to producing green iron in the -Pilbara.\nMr Otranto told the meeting a major barrier to green iron production in Australia was the high cost of renewable \nenergy. He said Fortescue would need the help of government to launch the technology-dependent industry.\n\"If this new industry is to truly succeed in Australia, we cannot do this alone. The cost of green energy is still a \nsignificant challenge here in Australia, and the barrier to getting a green metal industry off the ground which will \nrevolutionise Australia,\" he said.\n\"With the help of government, I firmly believe we can establish a new green metal industry here in the Pilbara.\" Dr \nForrest said Fortescue wanted help in the form of approvals and infrastructure, not taxpayer handouts or \nincentives.\nFortescue recently completed a 100MW solar farm near its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite operations. Dr Forrest \nsaid it was eyeing a big increase in capacity to 3GW and pointed to the $US6bn funding set aside to reach the \ncompany's decarbonisation target. Asked about the land required, Dr Forrest said it was substantial but indicated \ntraditional owners and other stakeholders were keen to become involved. \"People are looking for income, and I \nknow on our properties I really welcome it because the diversification of income is a really good idea,\" he said.\nDr Forrest again defended Iron Bridge after revelations WA work safety authorities had intervened over exposure to \ndust high in crystalline silica, which if inhaled can cause lung cancer and other diseases. Asked if he was worried \nabout the health of workers, Dr Forrest said: \"Of course, that's my first concern. We are all over it like nappy rash.\" \nSafety inspectors issued one prohibition notice, and four improvement notices in September related to dust \nmanagement at Iron Bridge.\nIron Bridge, built at a cost of $US3.9bn, was originally supposed to be producing 22 million tonnes of high-grade \niron ore concentrate a year by June 2023. The operations produced 1.6 million tonnes in the three months to the \nend of September and have been plagued by various setbacks and cost blowouts. \"You have a look at the \nmagnetite projects to ramp up around the world.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 26\nLength: 990 words\nByline: Anthony Macdonald\nBody\nIt takes only two words to mesmerise investors this year: data centres.\nThey are red-hot. It's part artificial intelligence, part cloud adoption and part big tech, colliding in the sweet spots \nwhere public and private markets and infrastructure and real estate (together \"real assets\") meet. Investors are \nhooked.\nWe've seen all sorts of proof points recently - AirTrunk's $23.5 billion sale, NextDC's back-to-back equity raisings, \nAustralianSuper's multibillion-dollar bet and David Di Pilla's opportunistic (and still pending) IPO.\nBut the one that is hiding in plain sight, and doing things its own way, is $70 billion warehouses and logistics parks \ndeveloper, operator and fund manager Goodman Group. It told investors it was crossing into data centres last year, \nand has since added about $25 billion to its market capitalisation.\nWhat's it done to date? A lot of preparation work. It has the sites, has scurried together a 5 gigawatt power bank - \nup from more than 3GW when the plans were first unveiled mid-last year - including 2.6GW of secured power and \nanother 2.4GW in advanced negotiations, and has started digging trenches at a few sites.\nIt has also been talking to potential co-investors (or capital partners) and customers, including the big tech \ncompanies who need homes for their AI training machines, and hiring engineers and other staff with the appropriate \nexpertise. Greg Goodman, the conductor, gave his latest update yesterday. He revealed only a little bit more than \nthe last time he fronted analysts in August, really.\nThe secured powerbank, for example, was up to 2.6GW from 2.5GW. He's talking more about developing turnkey \ndata centres - fully designed, built, powered, installed - and even operating them, although can and will also do \nlighter \"powered shells\" for the opportunity.\nWhere exactly are these data centres, though?\nWhat's the rollout schedule?\nPage 2 of 3\nGoodman's striking run at data centres Closing Bell\nHow quickly can that 2.6GW power bank turn into revenue?\nWho exactly is Goodman Group in talks with to invest in them?\nWhat are the expected returns?\nGoodman punted a lot of the questions, or at least the specific answers to them, into next year.\nHe wasn't evasive, so much as not yet ready for the full reveal. He promised a more fulsome update when he fronts \nthe market with his company's half-year results in February, saying 2025 would be a big year for project starts.\nIt sounds like he expects to be building data centres in the US, Europe, Japan and Australia next year. Some of \nthem will be co-located with Goodman's logistics assets, others will be standalone. Artarmon in Sydney, the only \nspecific site to get a callout during the analyst briefing, is the latter.\nAnalysts and investors are lapping it up. There was no dissent on the call, no pushing Goodman to be more specific \nabout the returns/investors/sites - he gave away enough to satisfy curious minds, but kept coming back to next \nFebruary's more comprehensive briefing. The shares are up more than 40 per cent so far this year.\nThis sort of organic expansion plan is rare in Australia. Such plans tend to only take place where a big player in one \nindustry spots a gap in a new or booming adjacent industry - like a warehouses builder getting into powered shells, \nor pay TV company Foxtel getting into streaming with Kayo/Binge.\nListening to the call, we couldn't help but think Goodman Group's treatment was a stark contrast to another large \ncap's ambitious organic expansion plans: Fortescue's move into hydrogen and energy more broadly.\nFortescue's calls are met with demands for more details: where are the sites, what's the rollout schedule, how \nquickly can it turn into revenue, who are the co-investors, what are the expected returns - all the same stuff that is a \nbit vague at Goodman Group.\nIt's got to the point where analysts are sick of talking and hearing about it until there are binding agreements worth \ndisclosing, even if the message is delivered by Andrew Forrest, another of Australia's great founder class who has \ncreated plenty of value for long-term shareholders.\nIt shows the difference of being hot - or not. Data centres are clearly hot (hydrogen still not), with demand right now, \ncustomers keen to sign long-term contracts and infrastructure and real estate investors willing to invest in new \nprojects to underwrite developments. That reduces the risk involved of a logistics park developer switching over to \ndata centres, which can cost $1 billion-plus and take years to build.\nIt is a credit to Greg Goodman's ability to spot an opportunity and make a run for it.\nHe's doing it without any acquisitions (\"it's highly competitive if you want to buy anything already operational\", he \nsays) or diluting shareholders with equity raisings, preferring to build capability within his existing team and utilise its \nexisting sites. (So is Fortescue for that matter, albeit there is much more scepticism around the clean energy end-\nmarket and no sign that customers are willing to step up today to underwrite big developments.)\nThe other thing that helps Goodman is that his core logistics business is in rude health. It reported 97.5 per cent \noccupancy across its industrial and warehouse assets at September 30, which includes partnership sites, and 4.9 \nper cent like-for-like net property income growth. It reaffirmed FY25 operating earnings per share and distribution \nguidance, and isn't reliant on one customer (China) like Fortescue.\nIf Goodman pulls it off, it will be one of the great strategic pivots.\nFor now, having added tens of billions to Goodman Group's value, it is already one of the most valuable organic \ngrowth strategies we've seen on the ASX. Goodman's job is to turn that value, which is based on potential, promise \nand things like land banks and sites, into built and functioning data centres.Page 3 of 3\nGoodman's striking run at data centres Closing Bell\nThis sort of organic expansion plan is rare in Australia.

And we'll be more than pleased to \nexplain why real zero is the cut-through for financing what I call the economic transition,\" he said.\nTrump, a climate sceptic, has vowed to junk President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which is offering \n$US369 billion of subsidies and incentives to companies involved in the energy transition, including Fortescue.\nInstead, he wants the federal government to get behind a renewed expansion of the oil and gas industry, using the \nslogan \"drill, baby, drill\".\nDr Forrest conceded the slogan was \"kind of interesting, catchy\".\n\"But look where it's got us - it's got us to unreliable, unpredictable, fluctuating energy prices, which have had an \nextreme negative effect on everyone's living costs,\" he said.\n\"What I say is, 'build, baby, build': build out these [green energy] systems, replace fossil fuel completely and \nforever, and it's a great investment.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest uses dollars to make sense with Trump Energy transition\n\"What the president-elect will look at hard, climate sceptic or not, is that the best investment the US can make is \nsitting on the table. And it's proven, thanks to Fortescue.\"\nAlthough Fortescue has scaled back some of its energy-transition plans, particularly on green hydrogen, it still \nhopes to decarbonise its mining operations in the Pilbara, without relying on carbon offsets, by 2030.\nIn the US, Fortescue has allocated $US550 million to its proposed Phoenix Hydrogen Hub, envisaging an 80-\nmegawatt electrolyser and liquefaction plant with a production capacity of up to 11,000 tonnes a year of liquid green \nhydrogen.\nDr Forrest said that winding back the IRA would be unlikely to shift Fortescue's US investment plans, \"but it would \nmake other projects around the world more attractive\".\nAxing the IRA would \"certainly make the US less competitive\", he said. \"'Drill, baby' drill' - as opposed to 'build, \nbaby, build' - is not going to drive economic growth. It's not going to drive full employment.\"\nDr Forrest said he was using COP29 in Baku to road-test his pitch to the Trump administration.\nLoad-Date: November 18, 2024\nEnd of Document",

By Cameron England\nELECTRIC VEHICLES MIGHT still be a green badge of honour in our cities but, at Twiggy Forrest's Pilbara \noperations, they're part of a revolution helping to transform Australia's mining sites. Those pictures of giant, diesel-\nhungry haul trucks and trains that have defined the nation's mining sector for decades may soon be consigned to \nthe history books as resource companies go electric.\nFortescue, for example, is in the process of purchasing 360 autonomous battery-electric trucks, 55 electric \nexcavators and 60 battery-powered dozers as it joins other big miners, such as BHP, in a bid to solve the sector's \ndependency on diesel. But it's an expensive transition and with upfront capital costs up to double that of diesel, \nsome players in the mining sector are looking for government help.\nIn a recent report, the Electric Mine Consortium, which counted South32, Barminco, IGO and Sandfire as members, \ncalled for tax incentives to help drive mine electrification, arguing it could reduce operating costs to 56-88 per cent \nof the diesel-powered equivalent. The report says there were significant financial and health and safety benefits \nfrom going electric, but the cost was a deterrent. Only 60 per cent of Australian miners say they will transition to \nelectric power in their next development.\nThe report says high capital cost is the primary barrier to adopting electric equipment for 76 per cent of miners \nsurveyed, while 50 per cent lack confidence in its operational effectiveness. \"Across the Australian industry, there is \na clear consensus that the major barriers to progress are the capital cost and the confidence in new electric \nequipment,\" the report says.\nCapital tax incentives - such as Canada's 30 per cent investment tax credit and its accelerated capital cost \nallowance which allows faster depreciation - would help, according to the report. It also notes that Australia's diesel \ntax credit will cost taxpayers $37bn from 2024-30 but, not surprisingly, with such industry dependence on diesel, it \nstops short of arguing for its removal.\nPage 2 of 2\nELECTRIC VISION\nDespite the costs, the big miners are increasingly talking up their commitment to dump diesel, and some are \ndeveloping radical technology solutions as part of the transition. BHP, for example, will trial a new energy transfer \nsystem in its Caterpillar vehicles at its Jimblebar and Escondida sites. The dynamic energy transfer system \nconverts energy from the mine site's power source, uses an electrified rail system to transfer the energy to the \ntruck, and a machine system to transfer the energy to the truck's powertrain.\nCaterpillar, one of the world's biggest suppliers of diesel-powered heavy vehicles, says the rail system is a \"highly \ndeployable, mobile solution that can be customised to customers' specific site layouts\".\nBHP plans to source 500MW of renewable power and storage in the Pilbara by 2030 and says it will have its first \nall-electric truck fleet operating before the end of the decade. The global miner says it is on track to deliver \"at least\" \na 30 per cent reduction in scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 against a 2020 baseline, and has \nmaintained its aspirational target to be net zero by 2050.\nFortescue, meanwhile, has signed a $US2.8bn ($4.2bn) deal with German truck manufacturer Liebherr, which \naims to convert two-thirds of its mining fleet to zero-emissions battery technology over the next couple of years.\nPart of the Fortescue push has its genesis in Formula 1 technology: two years ago, the miner bought Williams \nAdvanced Engineering, an offshoot of the legendary F1 team founded by the late Sir Frank Williams. The \ncompany's battery technology will play a key role in enabling Fortescue to electrify its haul fleet, with rapid charging \nat the core of its strategy. The fast-charging F1 technology can charge a haul truck in 30 minutes, providing six \nhours of run-time, and Fortescue chief executive Dino Otranto says that while that's impressive, it's just the \nbeginning.\n\"We've got a concept called boost charging in the works, which could bring the current charging time of minutes \ndown to seconds,\" says Otranto. \"That will unlock even further productivity increases. As it stands, the first \ngeneration charger and power system combination is already a better offering than its diesel equivalent in the \nmarket.\" The deal with Liebherr builds on a 2022 purchase of 120 haul trucks from the German company.\nThe problem of heavy haul vehicles queued for charging is an issue for the miners, but Fortescue will use a robotic \ncharging system, which, combined with the fast charging times and autonomous vehicle operation, is designed to \nsolve that issue.\nFour autonomous trucks are now being checked at Fortescue's testing site, with the first deployment on site \nexpected in the first quarter of 2025 with validation of the complete autonomous battery-electric solution expected in \nearly 2026. Fortescue also aims to sell its technology to other companies in the mining sector, once it has been \nproved up.\nIn its 2024 Global Metals and Mining Outlook, KPMG said the resources sector would have to pull off a remarkable \nfeat in coming years - both dramatically reducing its carbon footprint while increasing minerals output. \"Global \ndemand for minerals indispensable to a low-carbon economy, such as copper, lithium, cobalt, nickel and graphite, is \nexpected to increase fourfold by 2040,\" the professional services firm said. \"At the same time, metals and mining \ncompanies are highly carbon intensive. The mining industry accounts for two to three per cent of global carbon \nemissions and metals production comprises an additional eight to 10 per cent. Combined, metals and mining are \nresponsible for more than half of greenhouse gas emissions from global industry.\"\nLoad-Date: November 21, 2024\nEnd of Document",

And we'll be looking at different ways to operate around that \nnew renewable energy system that we're installing.\" Ms Robertson said expenditure on the wind and solar farms \nwould come from the $US6.2bn ($9.6bn) set aside to reach the decarbonisation target.\nPage 2 of 2\nBig solar farm for Fortescue operation\nThe project abandoned last year - known as Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub - involved building more than 300 wind \nturbines and a solar farm with a capacity of up to 5.4GW on cattle stations a south of Onslow in the Pilbara. The \nconstruction work was estimated to take seven years.\nFortescue has built one 100MW solar farm, known as North Star Junction, near its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite \noperations.\nThe 150,000ha tenement package understood to figure in its broader renewable plans is mostly covered by land-\nuse agreements with the Nyamal and Pakyka traditional owner groups.\nFortescue intends to use renewable energy to charge its electric mining machinery. The company received $10m \nfrom the taxpayer-funded Australian Renewable Energy Agency on Tuesday to develop a 6MW fast charger test \nunit for its future mining fleet.\nMr Forrest said at the Fortescue annual general meeting last month that the company wanted help in the form of \napprovals and infrastructure to reach its \"real-zero\" decarbonisation target. Mr Forrest said substantial land was \nrequired for solar and wind farms but traditional owners and other stakeholders were keen to become involved.\nLoad-Date: December 3, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Meanwhile, ACU's financial fortunes will be lucky to \nscrape into surplus by the time he's gone.\nSkrbis arrived in 2021 presiding over a $55.5m pot of gold, which was drained into an $8m deficit by the end of \n2022 and a $35.7m deficit by the close of 2023. The deficit for 2024 is anyone's guess, but it's shaping to be deeper \nthan a dwarven mine once the results become available in the coming weeks.\nBut truth be told, the ACU balance sheet is really not our primary concern here. Instead, our jolly is with a letter \ndispatched by ACU Corporation president (and Brisbane Archbishop) Mark Coleridge in which he hand-wrings \nmuchly over the lack of public adulation for the institution's leadership.\nFor you see, the corporation owns the university, and according to Coleridge it hasn't been cheering loudly enough \nfor Skrbis or for chancellor Martin Daubney and pro-chancellor Victoria Bourke, all three of whom, in Coleridge's \nmind, have been subjected to \"relentless public attacks \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 impugning their integrity, truthfulness and competence\".\nWe can only wonder if Daubney himself had a hand in the construction of this cry from the heart under Coleridge's \nname (and we obviously have no proof of that), because while Skrbis received a vote of confidence with the \nrenewal of his contract, Daubney and Bourke haven't benefited from the same \"comparable public statement of \nsupport\", as Coleridge put it. As Lenin famously wrote in 1913: \"It is not so important who directly advocates \nparticular views. What is important is who stands to gain from these views.\" Thus Coleridge's ham-fisted attempt to \nrustle up the corporation's two dozen members for some spontaneous and uninterrupted clapping of the ACU's \nleadership politburo. He attempted a similar play a few months ago and the response was the loudest silence ever \nknown to man.\nPage 2 of 3\nACU told to cheer for its leaders\nWe've obtained Comrade Coleridge's letter and it veers on North Korean in both effort and intent. There's a request \nthat his corporation members denounce the press coverage of ACU's horrendous decision-making and proclaim it \nall unfair. He also enjoins them to thank Skrbis \"for his service to the university\" and \"congratulate him on his \nreappointment\".\nAs for Daubney and Bourke, Coleridge's suggestion is that the corporation \"state publicly their support for the \nchancellor and pro-chancellor\" and thank them \"for their service to the university through this turbulent time\". No \nmention of what gave rise to this turbulence in the first place. And besides, if you have to ask \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We were \nsupposed to see this vigorous statement of support released by Monday night, with Coleridge saying he wanted to \npublish it \"if a majority of members consent\".\nAnd lo, that deadline has passed. What on earth could that mean?\nSpiteful $10m battle What's $10m between billionaires? Plenty, it seems, given the level of spite on evidence in the \nlatest legal exchanges between Andrew Forrest's US energy arm and Paul Tudor Jones's private advisory firm.\nTudor Jones's Kid Shelleen is suing Fortescue's US subsidiaries for allegedly ratting on a deal to jointly bid for gas \nand coal-fired power stations in the Americas so they could be turned into hydrogen production centres - back when \nFortescue still thought that was a good idea, in 2022.\nInstead, Kid Shelleen says it was cut loose by Fortescue after a change of US management - with no \nreimbursement for the costs of the work it did, accusing Fortescue of \"immoral, unethical and unscrupulous\" \nbehaviour.\nForrest described the allegations as a \"total non-event\" at the time. And, legal affairs being the same all over the \nworld, the matter has barely gotten to the discovery stage so far.\nBut it's fair to say that tempers are getting a little short in the United States District Court for the District of \nConnecticut.\nMatters started normally enough. Both parties requested a pile of documents, each party handed over a pile of \ndocuments, and sundry discussions were had about whether either pile of paperwork fit the brief.\nAnd then Fortescue went nuclear, heading to the court with an accusation that Kid Shelleen of having \"violated\" a \ncourt order when handing over its latest batch of documents. That's a pretty serious allegation among lawyers.\nThe problem? Lawyers for Tudor Jones had sent over some 2000 documents - including diary entries for Kid \nShelleen executive John Vivenzio - without saying who they belonged to. Fortescue's brief sent a complaint about \nthis at midnight the same day - suggesting, as an aside, the legal costs are likely to be worth more than the $13m at \nstake.\nNo problem, says Kid Shelleen the next morning. You didn't ask us who owned them, but here's that information as \nwell. In response, Fortescue trots off to the court to complain that its orders had been violated.\nOutrage ensues.\n\"Defendants attempt to manufacture a violation of this court's order where none exists,\" thundered Kid Shelleen in \nits response. \"Defendants have made clear that, rather than litigate the case on the merits, they would prefer to try \nto wear the plaintiff down through a never-ending series of manufactured discovery disputes.\" Anyway, Fortescue \ndid the same thing to us when we forgot to include a request for the owner of documents supplied, the submission \ncontinues. And they can't complain about the number of documents we gave them, because that's what they asked \nfor.\n\"Defendants' complaint that plaintiff has identified nearly 2000 documents that Mr Vivenzio alone reviewed and/or \nrelied upon boils down to the simple fact that Mr Vivenzio reviewed his calendar in creating his declaration, and his \ncalendar had a lot of entries on it,\" says the submission.Page 3 of 3\nACU told to cheer for its leaders\nSo there.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL What's $10m between billionaires?

The multi-year deal, which covers waste management \nservices across Fortescue's Pilbara iron ore operations, represents a new level of growth and autonomy for \nKingKira - a 100 per cent Indigenous-owned enterprise rooted in the leadership of founder Tammy O'Connor.\nO'Connor, a proud Palyku woman with deep Nyiyaparli and Kariyarra heritage, founded KingKira in 2014. Back \nthen, the company's partnership with Fortescue began through its Billion Opportunities program, which was aimed \nat empowering Indigenous businesses.\nReflecting on this milestone, O'Connor says: \"Fortescue, through their Billion Opportunities program, has been \ninstrumental in helping us grow as a business. I'm incredibly proud of how much we have grown and can now stand \non our own with these major contracts.\" In a decade, KingKira has gone from an ambitious startup to a company \nwith more than 119 employees, 103 mobile assets and a client base of 124 across four Pilbara locations. The \nnumbers speak to a well-earned reputation for delivering top-tier service. But for O'Connor, they also represent \nmuch more: a success story that underscores the potential of Indigenous businesses to achieve independence in \nsectors where First Nations representation is still growing.\nFortescue's Warren Fish, director of approvals, communities, and environment, emphasises the wider impact of \nthis partnership: \"We've always been committed to initiatives that foster genuine economic and employment \nopportunities for First Nations Australians,\" he notes \"Contracts like this not only help businesses like KingKira \ngrow, but they also have a ripple effect, delivering long-lasting economic benefits to First Nations communities.\" \nThe $5bn-plus that Fortescue has funnelled into Indigenous businesses through its Billion Opportunities program \nhighlights how deliberate, well-structured support can elevate First Nations enterprises into sustainable, impactful \nentities within Australia's economy.\nFor KingKira, this new contract is a testament to resilience and innovation - a company that's gone beyond simply \nholding its own to thriving alongside global players.\nPage 2 of 2\nCapitalising on Opportunities\nFor KingKira, this latest contract isn't just another business win; it's a powerful symbol of Indigenous resilience and \ncapability in Australia's economy.\nThe partnership shows that with the right opportunities, First Nations businesses can evolve from emerging players \ninto industry leaders, standing toe-to-toe with some of the world's largest corporations.\nLooking ahead, as Fortescue pursues ambitious goals for decarbonisation and sustainability, partnerships like this \none with KingKira aren't just beneficial - they're essential.\nTogether, they're setting a new standard for collaboration, where economic growth aligns with community \nempowerment and cultural integrity. This collaboration underscores a vision of the future where Indigenous \nenterprises play a central role in Australia's resources sector, building a legacy that empowers First Nations \ncommunities for generations to come.\nLoad-Date: December 10, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Not only was Hazard -ordered to immediately take down the \noffending tweet, but he was placed under investigation and instructed not to show his face in the office.\nA raft of Jewish employees at the firm raised a riot with executive partner Kristin Stammer and director of culture \nand inclusion Danielle Kelly alleging Hazard had a \"singular and obsessive focus on Israel\" and published posts \nthat displayed the \"classic traits\" of anti-Semitism.\nClearly outraged, and moving quickly to draw a line under the scandal, HSF chair and senior partner Rebecca \nMaslen-Stannage said the leadership council had voted to end Hazard's near-three-decade association with the \nfirm.\n\"The council of Herbert Smith Freehills has resolved today that Damien Hazard should be removed as a partner \nfrom our firm,\" Ms Maslen-Stannage said. \"We have issued him with the relevant notice.\" Numerous HSF clients \nwere privately making their displeasure known to management about the matter, and presumably these hints of \nreputational damage bore no small weight on the council's decision-making. Plus, the timing couldn't have been \nworse: HSF is in the middle of merging with Jewish law firm Kramer Levin, whose bosses in New York wouldn't \nhave looked kindly on the tweets either.\nHazard's back catalogue of online posting, according to the complaint letter from his colleagues, included \nexpressions that allegedly played on tropes of \"Jewish power\", \"Jews as murderous and blood thirsty\" and -invoked \n\"holocaust inversion\" and \"conspiracy theories\".\nPage 2 of 3\nFreehills partner given boot\nThe tweet that appears to have cost him his partnership took aim at Leibler for linking the arson attack on the Adass \nIsrael synagogue with the weekly Jew-hate parades that, as Leibler said, had been \"displayed on the streets of \nMelbourne every week for over a year\".\nHazard's response, amid the collective rage surrounding the anti-Semitic attack, was to accuse Leibler of \"cynically \npoliticising\" the crime and \"inventing a link\" with the anti-Israel protests, which, as a set-piece, often loudly and \nproudly call for an \"intifada\", or violent uprising, against Jews.\nSo in a sense Hazard was right: the need for invention was wholly unnecessary. The link was evident all along.\nAlbo's about-face And just on that - it was quite a sight to see Anthony Albanese attempting to warmly embrace the \nnation's Jewish community in the days after the terrorist attack on the Adass Israel synagogue.\nThe PM started by almost dancing a hora into that barmitzvah in Perth. Three days later he donned a kippah and \ntook a tour of the gutted Melbourne synagogue, and by Wednesday he was announcing an $8.5m upgrade to the \nSydney Jewish Museum.\nSuch a mensch! You might have almost forgotten that the funding became necessary because the government's \ndone such a lousy job of protecting the community.\nAnd yet, as he shook his head and his voice almost caught in his throat, Albanese always knew that Australia was \nabout to abandon the Jewish State - again - on two lopsided resolutions being thrown up at the UN - the first \nresolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza (no strings attached on the release of hostages), and the second in \ndefence of the criminally corrupt relief agency UNRWA.\nIt's strange how, on the one hand, Albanese insists that Hamas should play \"no role\" in any \"future Palestinian \nstate\", only to then, on the other hand, barrack for a ceasefire that will entrench the terrorists and grant them space \nto re-arm and resupply - to the detriment of Palestinians.\nIt's almost as though Albanese and his Foreign Minister, Penny Wong, both suffer from a weird, childish \nmisapprehension that the word \"ceasefire\" somehow equates to \"peace\". It doesn't, and it might be one reason why \nIsrael PM Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted his contempt for the Albanese government a week ago.\nSetback for MinRes A minor setback for Chris Ellison's Mineral Resources in its bitter legal dispute with fellow \nMinRes founder Steve Wyatt - but one that reveals more about Wyatt's viewing habits than the state of the lawsuit.\nMinRes has been in the courts for four years with Wyatt's rival mining services business, Destec, complaining that \nWyatt stole MinRes secrets ahead of setting up the company in 2015.\nThe latest legal skirmish saw WA Supreme Court judge Jenni Hill knock back a bit of legal overreach from MinRes, \nwhich claimed a forensic examination of Wyatt's former laptop showed he copied thousands of documents while \nworking for the company - some of which contained MinRes trade secrets later used to set up Destec to compete \nwith MinRes.\nJustice Hill struck out part of MinRes's statement of claim this week because it's not entirely clear what information \nWyatt is alleged to have stolen.\nProblem is the forensic examination doesn't show the contents of the files, just their names. And while some file \nnames suggest they probably relate to MinRes technology and pricing information, others clearly don't.\nAnd how do we know this? Well, as Hill pointed out in her decision, it's pretty unlikely that a set of files titled \"Game \nof Thrones Season 5\" includes any intimate details of the design mining machinery.\nMind you, given recent revelations about the internal workings of MinRes, you could probably mount an argument \nthat the bloody fantasy saga is a pretty good guide to the internal workings of the company - though not to the \nstandards required in a legal claim.Page 3 of 3\nFreehills partner given boot\nStill, it wasn't a major setback. The sloppy bit of legal argument only cost MinRes a couple of paragraphs from its \nclaims, with liberty to re-plead those aspects of its case.\nAnd it could have been worse. Rather than a fantasy epic, Wyatt could instead have been getting business advice \nfrom the final season of The Sopranos.\nGreen dreams Andrew Forrest has always run a pretty shameless line in self justification when things don't work out \nas planned. But this week's effort is pretty close to peak Twiggy.\nAsked by the Australian Financial Review whether Fortescue's grand promises on green hydrogen - such as a \n\"deal\" to deliver 5 million tonnes a year to Germany's E.ON Energy by 2030 - weren't perhaps a touch over-egged, \nForrest blamed the government for his failure.\n\"Governments were saying we need all this green hydrogen, [including] the government of Germany,\" he said. \n\"E.ON is a government instrumentality. And so they're telling us what they need, and we're believing them. Now, \nwhen they suddenly back out, we're high and dry.\" This from the man who spent years flying around the world \nhectoring governments and industry about the need to replace fossil fuel sources with green hydrogen. And is yet to \nproduce a single molecule of commercially viable hydrogen for sale, despite spending more than $2bn in \nshareholder money on the idea.\nSince Forrest floated his hydrogen balloon, governments have announced billions of dollars worth of hydrogen \nproduction credits and subsidies. Germany updated its hydrogen strategy only days after Forrest cut loose \nFortescue's hydrogen dreams in mid-July, and signed a $660m deal with Australia to encourage hydrogen \nproduction in September.\nForrest argues that Fortescue was forced to dump hydrogen because governments didn't act fast enough, and \ndidn't do enough to drive down energy costs to help make hydrogen viable.\nWhy would they? If you can get renewable power prices low enough to make hydrogen viable, you're probably \ngoing to use it to do something more useful - like deliver cheap power to households and businesses, perhaps.\nForrest was told this over and over again by experts, inside and outside of Fortescue, but kept making promises \nthat seemingly could never be delivered.\nBut it's OK, because green iron is now Fortescue's bright and shiny new thing. Rather than produce 15 million \ntonnes of hydrogen by 2030, Fortescue will be shipping 100 million tonnes of carbon-free iron by an unspecified \ndate.\nEarlier in Fortescue's history, plenty of people said this and were wrong - but we'll believe it when we see the first \nshipment leave Port Hedland.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Quite a sight seeing Albo embrace the Jewish cause\nLoad-Date: December 12, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 15\nLength: 623 words\nByline: James Thomson\nBody\nThe stunning 9000-word profile of Andrew Forrest by The Australian Financial Review associate editor Primrose \nRiordan is a portrait of one of our great entrepreneurs in all his glory - passionate, driven, visionary, pugilistic and, \nby his own admission, imperfect.\nBut alongside the in-depth exploration of Forrest's fascinating character is the story of a great Australian business \napproaching a pivotal moment - maybe the most pivotal since Forrest willed the company into existence through \nsheer force of personality.\nIn the coming years, Forrest must bring investors along on a great juggling act, as he manages growing pressure \non his flagship iron ore business, a capital-hungry, but earnings-accretive decarbonisation program, and a new \npush into green iron. It's a puzzle worth tens of billions of dollars.\nFortescue has rightly earned a reputation as a dividend machine in the past five years, but the 31 per cent fall in \nthe company's share price this year speaks to the pressure on its revenue and earnings from a sagging iron ore \nprice.\nThe long-term outlook for prices isn't good. Citi, for example, has a long-term target of $US85 for iron ore in 2026; it \nestimates about 200 million tonnes of new supply is scheduled to come into the market and Chinese steel demand \nhas peaked and will gently decline, even with the economic stimulus that is widely predicted for next year. \nFortescue's revenue is expected to fall from $US18.2 billion ($28.6 billion) in the 2024 financial year to $US16.3 \nbillion in 2025 and $US14.1 billion in 2026 and $US13.9 billion in 2027, according to projections from RBC Capital.\nTotal annual dividends are tipped to fall from $1.97 in 2024 to 67\u00a2 in 2027, as free cash flow before dividends and \ndebt drops from $US5.1 billion to $US2.9 billion.\nAs a falling iron ore price squeezes the sustainability of the dividend from one end, investors are worried about \nanother squeeze coming from Fortescue's capital expenditure bill.\nPage 2 of 2\nMercurial Forrest approaches a pivotal moment for Fortescue Comment\nForrest's grand plan to decarbonise Fortescue's mining operations by retooling its heavy mining equipment by as \nearly as 2030 will need at least $US6.2 billion on the company's estimates, although analysts believe the cost is \nmore like $US7 billion to $US8 billion.\nThere is value to be extracted from this decarbonisation push, which Jarden analyst Jon Bishop puts at $1.87 a \nshare if Fortescue hits its target of zero carbon emission (without the help of offsets) by a conservative 2040, or \n$2.25 a share if the target is achieved by the company's stated aim of 2030.\nBut Bishop remains frustrated at the lack of detail from Fortescue about the size of the capex bill over the next five \nyears - which he believes the market is underestimating - and the potential savings that could be generated by a \ndecarbonised mining operation.\n\"The capex numbers assumed in our estimates are anchored to guidance that, beyond FY25, lacks significant \ngranularity and is therefore prone to significant changes in due course. However, in our view, whatever the final \nnumbers are, they are large,\" he says of the capex task ahead.\nThere are other questions too. The green hydrogen dream is off the table for now, but the market is still struggling \nto get its head around the cost of Fortescue's green ammonia projects.\nThen there's Forrest's nascent plan to value-add to iron ore by turning it into green iron, which is where low-carbon \nsolutions such as green hydrogen and solar energy are used to remove waste elements from iron ore (such as \nsilica and alumina), leaving behind a product that is almost pure iron. What this project looks like, and what it costs, \nisn't quite clear.\nForrest has plenty of credits in the bank with investors. But they're looking for meat on the bones of his grand \nvision.\nLoad-Date: December 24, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 3\nLength: 2253 words\nByline: Primrose Riordan Associate editor\nBody\nIt was a meeting whispered about as Fortescue's version of the \"red wedding\" scene from Game of Thrones, in \nwhich a slew of characters were killed off in one sitting. Fortescue's executive chairman, Andrew Forrest, refers to \nit as \"judgment day\", which in the Bible is God's final sorting of people into the saved and the damned.\nAppropriately, it took place in the \"red cafe\" at the company's Perth headquarters, so named for its colour scheme. \nAnd it was a bloodbath. One person who was there says Fortescue's chief executive at the time, Elizabeth Gaines, \nwas in tears, and the rest of the company's C-suite was rattled and emotional.\nThe catalyst for the meeting was the troubled Iron Bridge magnetite mine. A joint venture between Fortescue and \nTaiwan's Formosa Steel, the mine is about 145 kilometres south of Port Hedland in the Pilbara. In early 2021, it was \nbehind schedule and over budget. Forrest was furious.\nGaines and other executives, including former chief financial officer Ian Wells, were forced to apologise and take \nresponsibility for the situation. Greg Lilleyman, a well-respected mining executive who was then chief operating \nofficer, announced he was leaving the company. Project director Don Hyma and Iron Bridge project director Manie \nMcDonald would also depart, the company confirmed later on February 16, and Gaines and Wells would forgo their \nbonuses.\n\"It was like a public shaming,\" says one person who was at the meeting. The executives were forced to make \"a \nconfession, saying they had betrayed the Fortescue values\".\nThese values are clearly laid out on the company's website and referred to repeatedly by management. They \ninclude family, empowerment, frugality, enthusiasm and \"stretch targets\". Fortescue sets deliberately ambitious \ngoals to ensure employees strive to do tasks faster and with fewer dollars.\nBut that cost-saving ambition has been put under a spotlight at Iron Bridge. The project has so far increased its \nexpected capital expenditure at least five times and has suffered from persistent leaks in the pipelines that deliver \nwater to the site and then slurry the ore product to Port Hedland. What's more, dust issues have put the company in \nregulators' sights.\nPage 2 of 4\nAndrew Forrest's 'lesson in humility'\n\"It's been a lesson in humility,\" says Forrest, in an interview with The Australian Financial Review during a visit to \nthe mine site. Labelling the project \"the company's most difficult\" mining venture, he lays the blame for the \nexpensive leaks on pipeline contractors.\nThe company has previously said cost blowouts and delays at Iron Bridge were due to cultural problems and that \nnegative news had not reached executives and directors fast enough. But interviews with at least a dozen \nFortescue insiders reveal Iron Bridge was hamstrung from the start by tough cost-saving targets and because \nplanners failed to anticipate the difficulties of piping large amounts of water in high-pressure pipelines across tough \nterrain.\nIron Bridge was much more than just another mine for Forrest. Unlike the more common hematite iron ore mines, it \nis a magnetite mine - which involves turning low-grade ore into a much higher 68 per cent grade ore through \nenergy-intensive processing. Its success is key to transforming Fortescue from a low-cost, lower-quality iron ore \noperation to one of the largest iron ore producers in the world. It allows the company to take the fight more directly \nto rivals BHP and Rio Tinto, as mining companies bet air pollution-conscious countries such as China will favour \nhigher-grade ore because it produces fewer fumes.\nCentral to the development of Iron Bridge was one of Forrest's oldest friends, former Fortescue executive Michael \nMasterman. The pair go way back. Masterman was finance director for Forrest's first disastrous business venture, \nAnaconda Nickel, before following him to Fortescue as one of the company's executives. They are also family \nfriends; Forrest is the godfather to one of his children. But they have since fallen out. Masterman left Fortescue last \nyear to set up a green metal company, Element Zero, triggering a messy legal dispute. Fortescue is now suing the \nfirm and Masterman over alleged intellectual property theft.\nBut in 2013, Masterman was a senior executive at Fortescue and crucial to arranging the finance for Iron Bridge. \nThat year, as he jetted between Shanghai and Perth, he organised for Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Group, one of the \nNorth Asian nation's biggest conglomerates, to invest $1.15 billion for a 31 per cent equity stake. Fortescue had \nalready secured an investment from Baosteel, the world's largest steel producer, with the Chinese conglomerate \nthrowing in a stake it already had in a magnetite mining lease. And so Fortescue set up FMG Iron Bridge, with the \naim of developing the Glacier Valley and North Star deposits where the mine now sits.\nIt is a huge project. Alongside an airstrip, accommodation camp and an ore-processing facility which aims to churn \nout 22 million tonnes of concentrate a year, Iron Bridge also has hundreds of kilometres of pipeline. One, which \nruns for more than 200 km from borefields in the Canning Basin to the mine, has been the most susceptible to \nleaks. \"That water pipeline failure, so that was a shock to the organisation,\" Forrest says. Another 135-km pipeline \npumps magnetite slurry to Port Hedland and a third returns water to the mine.\n\"It was absolutely the contractor who gave us the guarantee this solution would work,\" Forrest says when asked \nwho he blames for the pipeline issues. \"But going after them is a puerile practice as they are too small. Sending \npeople broke is not our speed.\" He later adds that the company was working with the contractor and manufacturer \non the issue. The prime pipeline contractor on the project, MPC Kinetic, declined to comment.\nThe company said at the start of the year that it would need to set aside $US100 million to replace 65 kilometres of \nthe pipeline that feeds raw water from the Canning Basin to the plant. But more recently, the on-site project team, \nled by operations director Graham Howard, has been able to sufficiently stem the leaks, and the company has put \nthe more expensive fix on the back-burner.\nIf all goes well this year, Howard, a Fortescue veteran, is confident Iron Bridge will meet its target to produce \nbetween 5 million and 9 million tonnes of product by the end of the financial year. But that is still less than half the \nmine's ultimate target of 22 million tonnes a year.\nIt's been a journey. He jokes to the Financial Review on the same visit last week to Iron Bridge that the amount of \nhair on his balding head tells the tale.Page 3 of 4\nAndrew Forrest's 'lesson in humility'\nBut as always with Forrest, there are even more demands. As the bus rolls into the mine site, Forrest asks why the \nplant's lights aren't sensor activated to save energy and instead stay on during the day. Executives have been \nunder relentless pressure, with much of it related to cost control - Fortescue is renowned for its focus on costs. \nWhen Iron Bridge was first proposed, the company estimated capital expenditure would be $US2.6 billion.\nOn a site visit after the announcement, Forrest warned a crowd of workers including senior engineers that they may \nas well resign if they were not committed to building the mine within budget, people with direct knowledge of the \nevent said.\nIron Bridge had been planned for some time and the company had conducted thorough cost estimates for smaller \nmines, including 11 million-tonne and 16 million-tonne versions, bringing in outside consultants and planners to put \ntogether the expected capex. But in the lead-up to the project getting the green light in 2019, the decision was \nmade to expand it to a 22 million-tonne mine.\nInstead of getting a new capex estimate, the company \"factored\" up those previous cost estimates, people with \nknowledge of the process said. Though it did take outside advice, it was not a calculation from scratch, which those \nwith knowledge of mine planning said would have been more in line with the industry norm.\nThe only way the company's internal planners could get closer to the $US2.6 billion figure authorised by the board \nwas by not including as much \"contingency\", an amount typically set aside by miners for additional, unforeseen \ncosts, and by including a large cost-reduction target.\nForrest does not deny the project was subject to cost saving targets. \"We deliver operations at the lowest cost in \nthe world. And it's who we are. We don't pretend to be like others.\" But he rejects any notion that the company \nunderplayed the costs. \"We all thought we'd get change out of $US2.6 billion as we have in our other projects, so \nwe didn't see this as different,\" he says.\n\"That's not how we roll. The board approves projects on exactly the information it has, and it got to $US3.2 billion \nwell after it had been approved and it was being built. And that's when you have the come-to-judgment day,\" he \nsays.\nFortescue's upward capex revisions may have cost the company investors. Chinese steel giant Baosteel, formerly \na shareholder, quit the project in 2021, selling its stake in the holding company for the mine. Though the motivations \nbehind the decision are unknown, the company has since participated in other Pilbara mining projects, including \nMineral Resources' Onslow Iron project and Rio Tinto's new Western Range mine.\nSources say planners underestimated the price of laying the long pipelines needed by the mine, which cost \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\nThis pressure on costs filtered down to Fortescue's contractors, who were constantly forced to revise plans after \nthe company demanded more savings.\nIn the end, the capital expenditure estimate was revised up five times. In August last year, more than two years \nafter the infamous \"red wedding\" meeting, the company announced the mine's capex at $US4 billion, more than a \nthird higher than the initial estimate. Jon Mills, an equity analyst at Morningstar who covers Fortescue, says rising \ninflation hasn't helped and could not have been anticipated.\nFortescue's tight focus on costs has attracted support and has been central to the company's success. \"They are \nmuch leaner, much more focused on lower unit cost of iron ore than their rivals and that makes their business more \nsustainable,\" says one person intimate with the project's operations.\nDelays in the ramp-up have been costly. On May 1 last year, Forrest declared that the mine had produced its first \nore. But when the mine got going in August that year, it reported a $US726 million pre-tax impairment charge - \neffectively devaluing the mine - because of delays in the project's ramp-up.Page 4 of 4\nAndrew Forrest's 'lesson in humility'\nAfter the company announced its latest production report in September, it fielded questions about why it wasn't \ngetting premium prices considering the higher grade of iron ore that the mine promised.\n\"At the moment, they aren't seeing as high a premium as they had hoped,\" says Morningstar's Mills.\nIn September, Fortescue Metals chief Dino Otranto blamed the lower prices on \"low steel volumes, depressed \nmargins\" and a \"slight oversupply\" of the concentrate market in China.\n\"So long story short, capex has been higher,\" says Mills. \"It's taken longer to ramp up, costs are going up as well for \nsimilar reasons. And then, you know, on the revenue side, they're not getting the premium they hoped for.\"\nCost blowouts have not been the only problem at Iron Bridge. In September, mine safety officers from WorkSafe \nWA issued four improvement notices and one prohibition notice \"related to dust management\".\nWorkers at the site said they were concerned about their exposure to silica dust, present in the ore mined at the \nsite, which can lead to silicosis, a potentially terminal condition. Magnetite needs to be crushed into such fine \nparticles, finer than talcum powder, that dust is inevitable. Other Pilbara sites have similar issues.\n\"People were coughing ... it gets under your mask and in your clothes,\" says one worker who was not authorised to \nspeak publicly. Forrest wore a PAPR dust mask on his visit to the mine last week.\nA rope chain separates the area where you are required to wear a dust mask and where you no longer need one, \nand the area was recently expanded. \"There has always been a requirement to wear respiratory protective \nequipment in the mandated restricted areas of the dry plant, however in September the senior site executive \nincreased the restricted area to include the entirety of the dry plant to ensure compliance,\" a company \nspokeswoman said.\nTwo workers told the Financial Review they were concerned some of the staff facilities and offices were too close to \nmine infrastructure, so dust filtered into mask-off areas.\n\"We categorically dispute this,\" the spokeswoman said. \"Our PAPR and P2 requirements are adequate. Outside of \nthe mandatory dry plant area, our sample analysis does not require protection.\"\nOne former executive says they decided to leave Fortescue not long after the \"red cafe\" meeting in 2021. \"The \nculture had changed and it felt very deliberate,\" the person says.\nBut Forrest does not resile from his actions of that day. He had just returned from overseas, and after Gaines \nalerted him there was an issue he says they decided to change the management team and conduct an audit.\n\"Here at Fortescue, you get rewarded heavily on doing well, and not if you disappoint. And that was a really deep \ndisappointment. They took the information they received and believed it, but below them there were issues, and \nunfortunately, like with me, others in leadership, the buck stops with you.\"\nLoad-Date: December 24, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: PERSPECTIVE; Pg. 17\nLength: 1180 words\nByline: Primrose Riordan\nBody\nPostcard from WA After months of reporting, and only carefully worded replies from Fortescue, Primrose Riordan \nwas invited to jet around with the iron ore billionaire.\nAndrew Forrest hands me a pair of gloves. We're on a mining site in the Pilbara and he explains how the region's \nfamous pindan dust seeps into your skin, staining it for days.\nA week earlier, after months of reporting on Fortescue, I had sent a list of 50 questions to the company, some of \nthem covering uncomfortable territory. These included claims about Forrest's at times aggressive leadership style, \nthe company's troubled green hydrogen business and high executive turnover, and concerns about the board-led \ninvestigation into an alleged relationship with an employee that cleared Forrest of wrongdoing.\nAt first, the company sent some written responses, but two weeks ago, the call comes. Forrest, returning from \nShanghai, will handle this himself. Head on. I am summoned to the Pilbara for an interview.\nStraight off the plane at Port Hedland last Thursday, and it's straight into hard hats and fluoro. We're directed to a \nladder leading to a platform that feeds iron ore onto waiting ships. Soon after I put the gloves on, I realise no one \nelse is wearing them.\n\"They're Sydney gloves.\" Forrest laughs, and the gathered workers join in. We're on his turf.\nBut there's no time to linger. We're off to speak to \"the troops,\" one of many staff gatherings that Forrest addresses \nwith a loosely prepared stump speech. What executive turnover? These staff have been here for years. They love \nit. \"Can't you just feel it?\"\nHe motions to his team. \"You can talk to anyone. Which other company would do Out on a tour of another site, the \nnarrative arcs and the lessons in overcoming adversity are ever-present as I scribble away on bumpy bus rides. \nForrest reminds us of how BHP tried to stop Fortescue from getting its product to port, pointing out the window to \ninfrastructure built by Fortescue workers to get around the blockages.\nPage 2 of 3\nA Tour of The Pilbara with Andrew Forrest\n\"I just say gently - it's your article not mine ... I'd be grateful if you could just balance it,\" Forrest says later. \"I mean \n[you] might be assassinating Andrew. He's fair game. But can we at least mention what a fantastic team the other \ntwenty-odd-thousand people are?\"\nForrest has done many interviews in his three decades in business. He bats off questions: \"I just hope you're \nenjoying it, the interview. Oh, please enjoy it. You've come a long way to not have a good time!\"\nWe're on his private jet drifting above Iron Bridge, the company's most difficult mining project. It has been racked by \ndelays, cost blowouts and technical challenges. More recently, the company narrowly avoided spending hundreds \nof millions of dollars replacing more than 60 kilometres of leaking water pipelines essential for slurrying the product \nto port.\nUnlike the rich maroon of hematite, this magnetite mine is grey, and a much smaller particle, tinier than talcum \npowder. On the ground, it bathes the site monochrome; above, it drifts in unsettling wafts of dust. The company, \nwhich now insists that things are under control, has recently been rapped on the knuckles by mine inspectors for \nunsafe air quality levels, considering the high silica concentration. Walking through in post-40-degree heat and \nmasked up, it's like a dystopian film.\nBut it's nothing like that, according to Forrest. It's the most successful magnetite project in the region. They're \nshooting the lights out. (Fortescue's also the best-performing company ever on the Australian stock exchange; it's \nprobably the most efficient construction company in mining in the world; no company creates bigger crushers; their \nrail cars stack more ore than anyone else; they're going to make green iron metal faster than anyone else; they \nhave the best battery technology in the world.)\nFortescue is one of Australia's standout corporate success stories and its rising share price over the years has \nmade Forrest and many others rich, but it's a lot of superlatives to take in.\nThere's a reason he's described as evangelical. He's a long talker and on message. He remembers your name and \nrepeats himself often and on purpose. He conducts crowds and urges them to come close. \"I need your eyes.\"\nEveryone's his brother, his sister. People are approaching him for selfies. He's embracing people. \"Come in for a \ncuddle!\" (One flinches as he approaches - \"Don't worry I'm not gay!\") There's laughter, he has the crowd but it's his \nentourage's turn to flinch.\nForrest travels with a team of former senior political staffers, who also advise him on policy, manage his diary and \ninterrupt him to draft email replies to staff on the fly.\nPeople don't need to come to him with problems that often, he says, as they have already solved things \nthemselves. At another site, a worker asks how their new Liebherr trucks will handle the wet weather. Forrest \ndoesn't dwell. \"I'm sure you and the team are going to figure it out.\"\nBeep beep. Beep beep. Forrest's two phones are a constant soundtrack. \"Blue phone, Signal!\" \"Red phone, \nWhatsApp!\" The blue one is looking a bit tattered, the other is wrapped in a red flip wallet case.\nHe doesn't mind. He complains that overseas hotels are too good at laundry, dislodging the Pilbara's dust from \nclothing, and making him look like an interloper on mine trips. There are spells of self-depreciation. \"Do your job, \nForrest, you little prince, get over it,\" he says. He doesn't like to give speeches on a stage as it makes him feel like \n\"a wanker\". There's another 15-minute plane trip, during which we try to hold on to bowls of bone broth we've been \nserved for lunch, but they are swishing around.\nAt Christmas Creek, Forrest is asked whether countries will just want to process his iron ore into \"green iron metal\" \nthemselves. After pulling back from his 2030 green hydrogen target earlier this year, he has switched his focus to \ngreen iron (a precursor to steel made with renewables or hydrogen) and is aiming to eventually make 100 million \ntonnes a year. Later, he admits, some governments are keen to do that themselves, which would cut him out of the \nmarket. \"I'm not talking about China!\"Page 3 of 3\nA Tour of The Pilbara with Andrew Forrest\n\"That's not the steel mills, that's the politicians. The steel mills say make it where it's most efficient,\" he says. \nSomewhere close to vast amounts of sunshine and wind, like his mines.\nLessons follow in Chinese environment policy, carbon emissions and industrial strategy. Forrest gets on his knees \nto draw another chart in the dust, but it's hard to concentrate. A rail car is making a deafening sound as it gets filled \nwith iron ore.\nThere's some static on the microphone during one of his worker stump speeches. \"That was just the Chinese \nauthorities,\" he jokes. The room chortles. \"Checking I'm saying the same thing here as in Beijing.\"\nFor me, it's all over as I walk behind workers to the plane. Stretched across a calf muscle in front is a bulldog with a \nmachine gun in its mouth.\nForrest has more site visits. He ends the day in the pit at his Solomon mine. And, no doubt, the team there are \nshooting the lights out. P\nLoad-Date: December 16, 2024\nEnd of Document",

They have flagged spending several \nhundred million dollars building a pilot plant capable of producing 40,000 tonnes of molten iron year at a site next \ndoor to BHP's mothballed nickel refinery at Kwinana, south of Perth.\nFortescue metals chief executive Dino Otranto said establishing a green iron industry in Australia could create \nthousands of jobs and secure a place for WA iron ore in global supply chains for decades to come.\n\"Getting this new industry off the ground will require wisely invested public and private sector funds,\" Mr Otranto \nsaid.\n\"Australia has a strong history of public investment to create the industries that have kept our economy strong over \nthe decades, such as the significant investment by government to kickstart the oil and gas industry in the 70s,\" Mr \nOtranto said.\n\"The whole of industry is calling for bold policy to establish a new green iron industry.\" Mr Otranto said Fortescue \nwas more advanced in its plans to produce green iron than BHP and Rio and, unlike the Neo-Smelt partners, would \nnot be -relying on gas as a fuel source.\n\"This week's announcement by the WA government to invest $75m in the NeoSmelt project clearly shows that \ngovernment shares our view of the importance of establishing this new green industry,\" he said.\n\"While a final investment decision on the NeoSmelt project is anticipated in 2026, Fortescue will already be \nproducing high-purity green iron from our pilot plant at Christmas Creek, using green hydrogen.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue claims green iron lead over Rio, BHP\n\"This process differs to the NeoSmelt project, which is expected to initially use gas, and ultimately transition to low-\nemissions hydrogen, rather than hydrogen produced using renewable energy.\" The NeoSmelt project is slated to be \nin production some time in 2028 if all goes to plan for Rio, BHP, BlueScope and Woodside at the Kwinana site and \nwith so far unproven technology.\nFortescue is also relying on technology breakthroughs as it contemplates building a commercial scale green iron \nplant in the Pilbara. It has revealed plans for a 1-2 million tonne a year plant, but is exploring opportunities for an \neven bigger plant likely to involve a multibillion-dollar investment.\nIt is set to begin pre-feasibility studies on the commercial-scale plant early next year.\nFortescue is relying on federal and WA government support to launch the technology-dependent industry.\nDr Forrest has said Fortescue wants help in the form of approvals and infrastructure.\nBHP WA iron ore asset president Tim Day said more partners could join the NeoSmelt project over time, and \ndefended the decision to use gas supplied by Woodside as a fuel source on the road to reducing carbon emission \nin steelmaking.\n\"You have to start this with something. For us, a gas supply is required. You need that energy initially and then what \nwill happen over time is we'll get to more green energy,\" he said.\nMr Day said BHP agreed with Rio that technology breakthroughs would be required to advance to commercial scale \nproduction and that the likely time frame was five to 10 years.\nThe NeoSmelt pilot plant is intended to test production of iron from an electric smelting furnace (ESF), a type of \nfurnace being developed by steel producers and technology companies seeking to lower emissions.\nIron ore is first converted to direct reduced iron (DRI) before being charged into the ESF.\nA lot is riding on the technology and a combination of DRI-ESF working effectively for BHP, Rio and Fortescue. \nBlueScope this week said the low and medium grade iron ore produced in the Pilbara did not work well in the DRI \nprocess gaining favour as a way to cut emissions.\nThe NeoSmelt partners hope reductions of up to 80 per cent in emission intensity can be achieved in processing \nPilbara iron ore through a DRI-ESF combination. Other lower emission--intensity production options emerging as \nalternatives to blast furnaces, such as electric arc furnaces, require scrap steel and DRI produced from high grade \niron ore. Fortescue shares closed up 2 per cent on Friday, at $18.20.\nLoad-Date: December 20, 2024\nEnd of Document",

ASIC v Star directors Former Star \nEntertainment directors are being sued over allegations they failed to stop money-laundering risks and criminal links \ncreeping into its operation will face a trial from February 10.\nASIC first launched the civil case in the Federal Court against former CEO Matthias Bekier and ex-chairman John \nO'Neill among other board members in December 2022. It is set to run for about six weeks.\nBarrister James Arnott, SC, a silk who regularly advises and -appears in relation to regulatory investigations, \naccording to his Sixth Floor Selborne Wentworth Chambers profile, represented ASIC for the past few court dates in \nthe matter.\nChinese high-roller junket operator Suncity allegedly pumped billions of dollars into Star casinos, with Star's \nturnover from Suncity reportedly worth $2.1bn, $4bn and $5.9bn for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years.\nASIC has alleged the board continued to allow the junket operator to expand its operations instead of scrutinising its \npotential organised crime links and money laundering risks.\nIn 2022, a royal commission-style inquiry into Star revealed the casino operator stopped short of issuing Suncity, \nwhich was owned by Alvin Chau, a third warning letter after it was busted operating a \"pseudo cage\" where bundles \nof cash from black backpacks were exchanged for casino chips, breaching anti-money-laundering rules.\nPage 2 of 4\nLegal stoushes set to keep courts busy\nInstead, Star allegedly renewed its agreement with the junket operator in 2018. It was claimed that senior Star \ninvestigator Andrew McGregor wrote to management in May 2018 to alert it that \"we have an entity within our four \nwalls, which is totally non compliant to reasonable requests for basic -information. I'm going to call it out early. \nSuncity is operating a business model under our noses, which is problematic for Star -Entertainment Group with \nregard to AML CTF (anti-money laundering, counter terrorism financing) laws.\" Other board members Kathleen \nLahey, Richard Sheppard, Gerard Bradley, Sally Pitkin, Benjamin Heap, Zlatko Todorcevski, Paula Martin and Greg \nHawkins have been named in the lawsuit, which will be presided over by Federal Court judge Michael Lee.\nAll 11 former executives have denied the allegations against them in defence papers. Star Entertainment is not \nnamed as a party to the proceedings.\nFortescue's Andrew Forrest v Element Zero Mining giant Fortescue managed to keep an explosive lawsuit it \nlodged against some of its ex-senior executives secret for a while.\nBut in June, a judgment was quietly published that revealed the Andrew Forrest-led company obtained court orders \nto launch raids on the homes and offices that targeted former Fortescue chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk, long-\nterm Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman and former Fortescue staff member Bjorn Winther-Jensen.\nAfter the Federal Court initially granted Fortescue a suppression order, which kept the proceedings secret from late \nApril to early June, it was revealed that Fortescue - a $57bn listed company - accused Element Zero of \"industrial-\nscale misuse\" of confidential information concerning its green (carbon dioxide-free) iron technology.\nElement Zero denied the allegations, calling them \"spurious\". The dispute turned ugly after it was revealed \nFortescue paid a private investigator, Robert Lancaster, who spied on the wives and children of the former \nFortescue staff including by following them to Kmart, taking pictures of them leaving school and rummaging \nthrough their mail.\nIt is necessary to ensure the parties are aware if there are \"vulnerable\" people at the properties to be searched, \nsuch as children, but the Element Zero parties argued the level of surveillance they were subjected to was \nexcessive.\nThe case continues, after -Element Zero failed to appeal against a decision that granted the search orders. It will file \nanother appeal to overturn that decision, while Fortescue has applied to change its statement of claim against it.\nElement Zero has previously briefed Sydney-based barrister David Studdy, SC, while Fortescue has previously \nbriefed Sydney-based Julian Cooke, SC.\nRetailers defend 'fake' discount allegations The country's biggest grocery outlets, Coles and Woolworths, are \ndenying claims that they mislead consumers by promoting \"illusory discounts\" on hundreds of common supermarket \nproducts.\nThe ACCC's separate proceedings in the Federal Court alleged a breach of Australian Consumer Law by \n\"misleading consumers through discount pricing claims\" on the products.\nACCC chair Gina Cass-Gott-lieb said in late September that -social media sleuths who were tracking prices online \ntipped off the regulator, which claimed products such as tampons and fly spray were sold at regular long-term \nprices, before they were subject to an increase of at least 15 per cent for a brief period and then \"discounted\".\nWhen the products were placed in Woolworths' Prices Dropped promotion and Coles's Down Down promotion, the \nACCC alleged the prices were lower than during the price spike but higher than or the same as the regular price \nthat applied before the spike.\nBoth supermarkets have denied the allegations, and in defence papers said surging supplier commodity prices and \nother cost increases led them to pump up the value of household goods.Page 3 of 4\nLegal stoushes set to keep courts busy\nThe filing of defence papers is likely to mean a drawn-out court fight, unless the parties settle, as both supermarkets \nappear intent on fighting the allegations.\nTrial dates have not been set, but Coles, Woolworths and the ACCC could go head to head in the second half of \nnext year.\nPratt family in two fights The billionaire Pratt family is now embroiled in two court fights aimed at protecting its \nwealth.\nThe latest legal saga was launched by one of the Pratt siblings, Heloise, after she accused former husband and \nbillionaire investor Alex Waislitz of criminality and acting \"dishonestly\" by paying himself and his charitable \nfoundation $1.147m without her knowledge and approval.\nMr Waislitz responded on Christmas Eve, denying the allegations against him and claiming his former wife failed to \ninvolve herself in the affairs of their family business.\nMs Pratt and siblings Anthony Pratt and Fiona Geminder are children of the late Richard Pratt and own the Visy \ncardboard box-making and recycling empire.\nThe court case appears to centre on control of the $1.3bn stock investment empire run by Mr Waislitz but also \nowned by Ms Pratt for more than three decades.\n\"It appears to be a highly provocative and unbecoming action in response to failed negotiations which had up until \nnow been kept private,\" Mr Waislitz has previously said in response to news about the court case.\nMr Waislitz has briefed Sydney-based barrister Jeremy Stoljar, KC, and Melbourne-based Kane Loxley.\nThe latest legal saga to ensnare the family came after the late Pratt's love child, Paula Hitchcock, secured a partial \nwin in her bid to claim an equitable slice of the family trust in October.\nThe NSW Supreme Court ruled Ms Hitchcock would be -allowed to argue she is legally -entitled to a slice of the \nfamily fortune because she is a child not only of the late billionaire but his wife Jeanne.\nSydney-based barrister Christopher Withers, SC, has appeared for Ms Hitchcock in past hearings. Appearing for \nthe Pratt family trustee has been Melbourne-based barrister Allan Myers, KC.\nThe matter has dragged on since 2022, and could continue in 2025 after Ms Hitchcock asked the court to update \nher pleadings again.\nBoth cases are set to play out in the new year.\nASIC v Cbus After ASIC sued $92bn super fund Cbus over allegations it delayed insurance payments to vulnerable \nfamilies with a bang in November, the matter could slow down in 2025.\nASIC claimed Cbus took more than a year in some cases for the fund - which is chaired by Labor national president \nWayne Swan - to pay out death and disabilities payments. It prompted the regulator to warn that it would crack \ndown on the $4 trillion sector over failures to track end-to-end death benefit claims handling times and \"weak\" -\npractices.\nAccording to the latest court updates, Cbus will not be required to file a defence to the allegations until May 16, after \nASIC lodges a full statement of claim.\nThe case is then listed for -mediation on June 23.\nAlleged insider trading ASIC has at least two insider trading criminal court cases on foot, including one it lodged \nagainst Melbourne man Duncan Stewart and another against Perth man Vittorio Letizia.Page 4 of 4\nLegal stoushes set to keep courts busy\nMr Stewart is set to face a trial in Melbourne's County Court, after ASIC alleged in a committal hearing at the \nMagistrate's Court that he passed on inside information about possible takeover bids of Kidman Resources by \nChilean major SQM and separately Wesfarmers in 2019.\nASIC alleged Mr Stewart received information from his brother-in-law and Kidman Resources boss Martin Donohue \nabout the possible bids in 2019, which he used to buy shares in the company and urged his brother Ashley to do \nthe same. Mr Stewart has denied the allegations.\nMr Stewart's legal team have briefed Melbourne-based barrister Ruth Shann, SC in the matter.\nSeparately, the regulator revealed Mr Letizia faced Perth Magistrates Court after he was charged with five counts of \ninsider trading over purchases in mid-tier miner Genesis Minerals dating back to 2021. ASIC lost an insider trading \ncase lodged against ex-Vocus chair Vaughan Bowen in December. Mr Bowen was found not-guilty by a jury.\nLoad-Date: January 1, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 20\nLength: 3488 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nNews feature The next time a big miner such as BHP, Rio Tinto or Fortescue lobs a takeover bid for a small \nexplorer, the target will probably be one of the companies on this list, writes Peter Ker.\nWhen BHP launched a $3.2 billion takeover bid for copper explorer Filo Corporation in July, it was a reminder that \nmergers and acquisitions don't always involve the element of surprise.\nJust as South32 had done with Toronto-listed junior Arizona Mining in 2018, BHP had conspicuously sat on Filo's \nshare register for more than two years before it pulled the trigger, and the smart money was always expecting the \nAustralian company to launch a takeover bid for Filo's Argentinian asset.\nWhen the BHP bid finally came on July 30, Filo shares surged more than 10 per cent, suggesting there was still \nupside for speculators who bet in line with market expectations. Filo shares finished 2024 a solid 41 per cent higher \nthan they started the year.\nSo who's next? Here's a list of junior explorers that have a big miner such as Fortescue, BHP, Rio Tinto or South32 \nlurking on their register.\nSovereign Metals\nBig suitor: Rio Tinto\nCommodities: Rutile, graphite\nCountry: Malawi\nThere's an intriguing time limit buried in the commercial arrangement between Sovereign Metals and Rio Tinto \nwhich could tempt the big miner to move sooner rather than later on the rutile and graphite aspirant.\nPage 2 of 9\nWhere mining giants are ready to pounce\nRio and Sovereign signed an investment agreement in July 2023 which outlined the terms under which they would \njointly progress the Kasiya deposit that Sovereign found in Malawi. Rio has spent about $60 million so far \naccumulating a 19.9 per cent stake in Sovereign.\nOne of the clauses provides Rio with a host of exclusivity benefits for a period that expires 180 days after Sovereign \npublishes a definitive feasibility study (DFS) into the construction of a mine at Kasiya.\nThose benefits include anti-dilution rights if Sovereign launches a share issuance and matching rights if Sovereign \ntried to sell the asset. Sovereign is due to publish a DFS by October, which means Rio has the inside running on a \ntakeover offer until about March or April 2026.\nBeyond that time, the exclusivity benefits lapse and Sovereign can sell a stake in the project to help fund itself.\nAt stake is a rare piece of geology that can support production of rutile without having to go through the carbon- and \nenergy-intensive process of extracting it from ilmenite sands.\nRutile contains titanium dioxide, which goes into consumer products such as paint and toothpaste, as well as high-\nend steel production. Rio is already one of the world's biggest producers of titanium dioxide from South Africa and \nMadagascar. But Kasiya presents a way of making titanium dioxide with a much lower carbon footprint.\nKasiya will also produce graphite as a byproduct. While weak graphite prices are hurting incumbent producers such \nas Syrah Resources, the graphite made at Kasiya will effectively be a bonus - most of the production costs will be \ncovered by the rutile production.\nRio wants exposure to battery minerals such as graphite, and ownership of Kasiya will get it closer to that goal.\nAlta Copper\nBig suitor: Fortescue\nCommodities: Copper and gold\nCountry: Peru\nFortescue flexed its muscle at the Alta Copper annual meeting in June, voting four of the seven directors off the \nboard in a bid to \"accelerate\" development of the company's Canariaco copper and gold project in Peru.\nAlta's founder and former chief executive Joanne Freeze was among those removed and the new board has \nalready approved a placement of shares to Fortescue, suggesting the Perth company holds significant sway.\nBut Fortescue will need to influence the hearts and minds of local communities in Peru if it is to make a success of \nits investment.\nAlta's most recent study suggests the Canariaco mine would cost $US2.2 billion ($3.5 billion) to build. It would \nproduce an average of 134,000 tonnes of copper per year over its 27-year life.\n\"All in\" costs would be below $US2 per pound of copper, and if the copper price averages $US4 per pound, the \nmine would pay for itself in just over three years.\nDespite those robust economics and an obvious suitor such as Fortescue on the register, Alta's market \ncapitalisation remains small at just $C37 million ($41.4 million).\nThat's because many investors believe Alta will struggle to win support from local communities who fear Canariaco \nwill damage local forests, watersheds and farmlands. About 400 people blockaded the road into Canariaco 12 years \nago and the deposit has not been drilled since 2013.Page 3 of 9\nWhere mining giants are ready to pounce\nAlta told investors in October that dialogue with the community was \"frequent and continuous, which was not the \ncase during the period 2016 to 2022\".\nIf Fortescue and its talismanic leader Andrew Forrest can convince those Peruvian communities to host a copper \nmine, the Perth company might be on to a bargain.\nLifezone Metals\nBig suitor: BHP\nCommodities: Nickel, cobalt, copper\nCountry: Tanzania\nIt would be a bold call for BHP to launch a nickel acquisition barely a year after mothballing its nickel mines in \nWestern Australia, but that's the dilemma that could come within months when New York-listed Lifezone Metals is \ndue to deliver the contractual trigger that permits BHP to take majority control of Tanzania's Kabanga nickel project.\nKabanga has been on BHP's radar for more than 30 years. The Australian company drilled the high-grade nickel \nsulphide deposit between 1991 and 1995 before deciding to walk away.\nIt took until December 2021 for BHP to return to a project that is built on a new low-carbon method of processing \nnickel ores.\nBHP owns 1.5 per cent of Lifezone's New York-listed shares, but the Australian giant's exposure to Kabanga is \nmuch bigger at project level.\nThe asset is owed by a Tanzanian group of companies called Tembo, which is 16 per cent owned by the host \nnation and 84 per cent owned by a privately held British company called Kabanga Nickel (KNL).\nBHP owns 17.8 per cent of KNL, with Lifezone owning the rest.\nBHP has a deal with Lifezone that, under certain circumstances, would allow BHP to grow its shareholding in KNL \nto about 61 per cent, thereby giving the Australian giant a 51 per cent ownership of Tembo and the Kabanga mine.\nThe trigger for BHP to take that step to majority control is the delivery by Lifezone of a DFS into the mine and an \nagreed financial model for development.\nLifezone promised to deliver that study in the \"second half of 2024\" but failed to do so. Delivery is expected soon. \nLifezone continues to garner support for the project from governments in Japan and the United States, who are \nkeen to ensure some of Africa's critical minerals are developed by non-Chinese companies.\nAt a time when Indonesian miners are flooding nickel markets and BHP is preoccupied with its pursuit of Anglo \nAmerican, it would not be a surprise to see BHP walk away. Watch this space.\nAldebaran Resources\nBig suitors: South32, Rio Tinto\nCommodities: Copper, gold, silver\nCountry: Argentina\nCould Argentina's Altar copper project be the scene of the first bidding war between 10-year-old South32 and 151-\nyear-old Rio Tinto?\nRio has a special connection to the project, having discovered Altar's big copper resource between 1995 and 2004. \nBut it walked away in 2005 in the belief the copper grades weren't good enough.Page 4 of 9\nWhere mining giants are ready to pounce\nBy 2019 the Toronto-listed explorer Aldebaran Resources had stepped into the void, agreeing to gradually buy 80 \nper cent of Altar from its former owner Sibanye-Stillwater.\nAustralia's connection to the asset was revived in 2022 when South32 spent $C11 million buying 9.9 per cent of \nAldebaran's shares. South32 raised its stake to 14.8 per cent in 2023 with a further $C9 million.\nSince then, the pathway for South32 to acquire majority control of Aldebaran has looked achievable; 44 per cent of \nAldebaran shares are held by San Francisco hedge fund Route One Investment Company.\nA further 14.4 per cent are held by Sibanye, which is struggling under big debts and weak earnings at its flagship \nAfrican platinum mines.\nCash-strapped Sibanye would presumably welcome an offer for its Aldebaran shares.\nBut just when it looked like South32 was in pole position, Rio signalled in November that it still holds a candle for \nthe Altar copper mine.\nRio offered to pay Aldebaran $US250 million for a 20 per cent stake in the Altar project - as opposed to buying \nAldebaran shares.\nRio's money would be provided in increments over two years and Rio has already agreed to pay two increments \ntotalling $US30 million.\nThe Rio deal effectively values the Altar project at $US1.25 billion.\nWhere does this leave South32? Well, shares in Aldebaran have more than doubled over the past four months, so \nit's not all bad for the Perth company.\nSouth32 is also well aware that Rio is investing in neighbouring copper projects, meaning Aldebaran and Altar \nmight be just the start of a broader province play.\nMcEwen Copper\nBig suitor: Rio Tinto\nCommodity: Copper\nCountry: Argentina\nThe closest copper discovery to Aldebaran's Altar copper project is about 40 kilometres north at Los Azules.\nLos Azules is owned by private unlisted company McEwen Copper, which counts Rio Tinto as a 14.2 per cent \nshareholder and Melbourne's Victor Smorgon Group as a 3.2 per cent shareholder.\nIt is no coincidence that the Rio subsidiary that holds the stake in McEwen also struck the deal with Aldebaran in \nNovember.\nThe subsidiary, called Nuton, holds intellectual property specialising in the extraction of copper from mineralisation \nthat is relatively low grade. While Nuton will likely want to study the rocks at Los Azules and Altar before Rio does \nanything big, it's hard to resist the conclusion that Rio is building a province play in this part of the Andes.\nMagmatic Resources\nBig suitor: Fortescue\nCommodities: Copper, gold\nCountry: AustraliaPage 5 of 9\nWhere mining giants are ready to pounce\nA funny thing seems to happen to small companies once Fortescue gets on their share register: the resolutions at \nannual shareholder meetings become far more contested.\nSo it was for NSW copper explorer Magmatic Resources, which suffered a first strike against its remuneration \nreport in November. Almost 36 per cent of votes were cast against the report, up from less than 1 per cent in 2023.\nSome Magmatic directors saw opposition to their candidacy rise from less than 1 per cent last year to almost 27 per \ncent in November.\nWhat changed in the intervening 12 months to swing sentiment? We can't be sure, but one thing that did change \nwas 19.9 per cent of Magmatic shares falling into the hands of Fortescue in March 2024.\nIf more than 25 per cent of votes are cast against the remuneration report in November, Magmatic will be forced to \nhold a resolution over a boardroom spill. As discussed in the case of Alta Copper, Fortescue is not shy about \nthrowing its weight around in boardrooms of its target companies.\nAlthough in the case of Magmatic, it's not clear that Fortescue needs to play hardball. By simply spending $14 \nmillion on exploration drilling over six years, Fortescue will eventually take 75 per cent ownership of Magmatic's \nMyall exploration project near Narromine in NSW.\nMaybe Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest doesn't want to wait.\nBrixton Metals\nBig Suitor: BHP\nCommodities: Copper, gold\nCountry: Canada\nThe world's biggest miner does plenty of exploration partnerships with small companies, but it's not often BHP buys \nlisted shares in a small explorer.\nBrixton Metals was an exception in November 2022 when BHP paid $C13.6 million for 19.9 per cent of its shares.\nThe excitement around that transaction took Brixton shares as high as C30\u00a2, but the stock has slipped back to C6\u00a2 \nas the long process of drilling and appraisal has got under way.\nBHP's main interest is Brixton's huge land parcel of almost 3000 square kilometres in British Columbia. The land \nparcel is north of the \"golden triangle\" copper and gold province, which Newmont was keen to consolidate when it \nacquired Newcrest in 2023.\nBrixton's latest batch of drilling results from its flagship Thorn project didn't set the world on fire, but it is still early \ndays.\nBHP's purchase of Brixton shares in 2022 was done at C18\u00a2, well above the C6\u00a2 the stock was fetching this week. \nThat means BHP can dramatically lower its average entry price should it choose to double down on Brixton in 2025.\nAmerican Eagle Gold\nBig suitors: South32, Teck\nCommodities: Copper, gold\nCountry: Canada\nSouth32 joined BHP in British Columbia in November when it paid $32.7 million for a 19.9 per cent stake in \nAmerican Eagle Gold.Page 6 of 9\nWhere mining giants are ready to pounce\nThe deal allows South32 to leapfrog Teck Resources, which was sitting on more than 15 per cent of American \nEagle's shares.\nThe two big miners are focused on the NAK exploration project in the province, which has delivered impressive hits \nof copper, gold and molybdenum. It's early days, but with two big miners on your register, things can happen fast.\nLiontown Resources\nBig suitor: Hancock Prospecting\nCommodity: Lithium\nCountry: Australia\nIf Gina Rinehart liked the look of Liontown shares at $3 a pop barely 15 months ago, then surely she can see merit \nin paying the market price of 52\u00a2 a share now.\nHancock has bided its time while Liontown has valiantly brought Kathleen Valley into production amid very weak \nlithium prices.\nDespite the good work of the Liontown team, if prices for spodumene concentrate stay at current levels, the \ncompany could be broke within a year.\nPerhaps Mrs Rinehart thinks she can wait and buy the company cheaper off the liquidators? But that's a risky \nstrategy; lenders such as Ford have security over Liontown's Kathleen Valley mine in the event of default, and \nlithium prices have a habit of turning hard and fast when the boom times return.\nWhat Liontown needs is a patient owner who can absorb the near-term pain and take a long-term view of \ndevelopment at Kathleen Valley to ensure it is built right to vomit cash when the next lithium boom comes.\nIn Mrs Rinehart, Liontown has found the perfect owner; just as she did with Atlas Iron, she can wait for the cycle to \nturn and harvest profits.\nSo what exactly is Australia's richest person waiting for?\nWestern Copper and Gold\nBig suitor: Rio Tinto\nCommodities: Copper, gold\nCountry: Canada\nRio collected a bunch of rights as it was building its 9.7 per cent stake in Western Copper and Gold over five \ntransactions in the past four years.\nSome of those rights ensure Rio can't be diluted in share issuances, while others give Rio the right to have \nobservers sit in on the company's board meetings and technical committee meetings.\nBut those rights will expire in May 2025, meaning the dual-listed miner has some degree of incentive to move fast if \nit wants to own the Casino copper and gold project that Western has found near the border of Alaska and the \nCanadian Yukon territory.\nCasino would cost more than $4 billion to build; a near-impossible task for an explorer with a market capitalisation \nof $337 million.\nRio is not the only cashed-up global player sitting on Western's register; Japanese firm Mitsubishi owns 4.1 per cent \nof the explorer and has similar rights, which will expire in March.Page 7 of 9\nWhere mining giants are ready to pounce\nRio has spent about $44 million buying shares in the explorer and no one will be surprised if it buys more in 2025.\nTrilogy Metals\nBig suitor: South32\nCommodities: Zinc, copper\nCountry: USA\nOne interpretation of the 230 per cent rise in Trilogy Metals shares since Donald Trump won November's US \npresidential election is that South32 missed a chance to acquire the explorer while it was cheap.\nSouth32 owned 11.6 per cent of Trilogy shares and 50 per cent of its flagship Ambler exploration project in Alaska \nduring Joe Biden's presidency, meaning the Perth company was close to the action as Biden's blocking of a road to \nthe Ambler site triggered a collapse in Trilogy's share price.\nA more philosophical way of looking at Trilogy's Trump bump is to say that South32 is historically willing to pay \nmore for something that it has greater certainty about.\nThat was true for Arizona Mining, the copper explorer South32 acquired over two years between 2017 and 2018, \nwith little concern about whether it was telegraphing its intentions to the market too clearly.\nIn the case of Trilogy, South32 wants to see more progress made in Alaska before it considers stepping up its \ninvestment. It will want to see all the region's First Nations groups express their support for the project.\nIt will want to see political change in the White House manifest in more permitting access to the Ambler region.\nSouth32 will also want to see further drilling to better understand the geology.\nThe Trump bump has taken Trilogy's market value to about $300 million - almost three times higher than a year ago \n- but still small enough that South32 can afford to wait for all the Alaskan ducks to be in a row.\nEntree Resources\nBig suitor: Rio Tinto\nCommodities: Copper, gold\nCountry: Mongolia\nSome type of deal will happen between Entree and Rio, the only question is whether Rio buys Entree's stake in \ntenements adjacent to its Oyu Tolgoi copper mine, or whether it buys Entree outright.\nRio has owned 16.1 per cent of Entree shares for more than a decade, but it needs to act soon because the \ntenements that are minority-owned by Entree are scheduled to be mined by Oyu Tolgoi within the next 12 to 18 \nmonths.\nUnder that schedule, preparatory work should be happening on the Entree tenements right now, but it is being \nfrustrated by the need to strike a commercial deal first.\nEntree had a win over Rio on December 19 when an independent arbitration tribunal adopted Entree's \ninterpretation of how certain transactions between the two companies should be struck.\nEntree shares have risen tenfold since March 2020, demonstrating how Rio could have fixed up this mess much \ncheaper had it acted sooner.\nEntree shares have more than doubled over the past year and are up 68 per cent in the past six months.Page 8 of 9\nWhere mining giants are ready to pounce\nIt's hard to see the value equation getting better for Rio if it holds out long enough to start sabotaging Oyu Tolgoi's \ngrades and volumes.\nSolGold\nBig suitors: BHP, Newmont\nCommodities: Copper, gold\nCountry: Ecuador\nIt has been eight years since BHP showed its liking for SolGold's Cascabel project, and even though the Big \nAustralian still owns 10 per cent of SolGold shares, a takeover bid seems less likely than ever.\nPut simply, SolGold's Cascabel project is being developed and funded in a way that is diametrically opposite to how \nBHP would like it developed.\nRather than building the mine to maximise its long-term potential and cashflows, the loose coalition of colourful \ncharacters that controls SolGold is thinking smaller, cheaper and faster.\nAn updated plan for the mine published in 2024 slashed close to $1 billion off the construction costs. The new plan \nenvisages a smaller mine that will cherry-pick the highest-grade zone of the resource first, meaning Cascabel's \nsecond and third decades will rely on extracting the lower-grade material.\nRather than fund construction via share issuances, Cascabel is being funded via a series of debt instruments that \nrequire the mine to provide a \"stream\" of gold or a royalty to the lender at a future date in exchange for immediate \ncash. This approach is common for small miners without deep pockets; but with every royalty streaming deal that is \nplaced on Cascabel, the project becomes a bit less attractive to BHP.\nPerhaps that's why SolGold shares slumped 30 per cent over the past year, despite strength in gold and copper \nprices; the \"event driven\" investors in SolGold are becoming less convinced that a takeover \"event\" will occur. The \nstock is down 82 per cent since April 2022.\nAccording to RBC numbers, the Filo Del Sol asset that BHP acquired for $3.2 billion in July is a bit better than \nCascabel in most ways; it contains more copper and is a bit higher grade. BHP certainly likes the Filo project \npartners - the Lundin family - better than the SolGold crew.\nNewmont inherited a 10 per cent stake in SolGold from Newcrest, but seems far less interested in SolGold.\nSolGold will likely make a final decision to build Cascabel according to the smaller, faster, cheaper strategy within \nthe next two years. For BHP, that will be the moment to speak up or forever hold its peace.\nHyterra\nBig suitor: Fortescue\nCommodities: Hydrogen, helium\nCountry: USA\nFortescue may have cooled its hydrogen jets in 2024, but in December it showed it was still the world's biggest \nhydrogen bull, buying 39 per cent of natural hydrogen explorer Hyterra for $21.9 million.\nUnlike most of Fortescue's hydrogen projects, Hyterra does not plan to manufacture the flammable gas by zapping \nwater with electricity. Rather, Hyterra plans to extract naturally occurring hydrogen from underground in Kansas.\nIt hopes to find some helium down there too.Page 9 of 9\nWhere mining giants are ready to pounce\nHyterra's work is more akin to oil and gas extraction than hard rock mining, and given the nascent nature of natural \nhydrogen extraction, Fortescue is unlikely to face a bidding war for control of Hyterra any time soon.\nBut like all things Fortescue, it will be fun to watch.AFR\nLoad-Date: January 6, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Hydrogen producers now have two extra years to find adequate \nrenewable power, deferring a problem that proponents had feared would stymie the industry's formative years.\nThe original proposal required producers to run their electrolyser machines - which split hydrogen from water - \nstrictly during the operating hours of wind or solar farms. Producers now have until 2030.\nSeveral Australian companies have hydrogen interests in the US including Woodside Energy's H2OK project in \nOklahoma and Fortescue's Arizona Hydrogen, both of which stand to potentially benefit from Washington's tax \ncredits.\n\"Will it be a shot in the arm [for the sector]? Yes, overall, it's positive,\" said Nick O'Loughlin, managing director at \nhydrogen start-up Sparc Technologies, which has a joint venture with Fortescue and the University of Adelaide.\n\"But unless we can get power prices down, the cost of green hydrogen will remain above the cost at which people \nare willing to purchase it. That is a fundamental barrier that the industry is facing to get these projects up and \nrunning, with or without credits.\"\nThe Albanese government is pouring billions into green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable energy, \nthrough its $4 billion Hydrogen Headstart Program.\nDespite the push headed by Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen, multiple homegrown projects were \nshuttered or downgraded as the sector's economics came into question.\nPage 2 of 2\nAussie hydrogen hopes buoyed by US rule change\nIn July, Fortescue axed 700 jobs and slowed its push into green hydrogen and ammonia by pulling back from its \nlarge-scale complex at Gibson Island in Queensland.\nOther local setbacks included Woodside icing two projects in Australia and New Zealand, Province Resources \nputting its Western Australian facility on hold, while Origin Energy abandoned its hydrogen venture in the NSW \nHunter Valley.\nWoodside said it was reviewing the new US tax credit regime and \"how it may impact our project in Oklahoma\", but \ndeclined to comment further yesterday.\nThe group's flagship green energy project has been repeatedly delayed since it was first earmarked for board \nsanction in 2022 and remains idled. The oil and gas producer hopes to produce up to 60 tonnes a day of liquid \nhydrogen through electrolysis and liquefaction at the US plant.\nFortescue, which has an ambitious strategy to become a major force in hydrogen and renewables, was contacted \nfor comment.\nExecutive chairman Andrew Forrest last year criticised the Biden administration's scheme, specifically the eligibility \nrules that may affect its $US550 million Arizona operations. Fortescue began constructing its Phoenix-based plant \nin 2024, with the goal of producing of liquid green hydrogen by mid-2026.\nSparc Technologies has invested $5 million in their hydrogen joint venture, which uses photocatalysis, rather than \nthe more widely adopted technology of using an electrolyser.\nLoad-Date: January 8, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: NEWS; Pg. 1\nLength: 865 words\nByline: Tom Rabe\nBody\nExxonMobil, one of the world's largest oil companies, has accused a charity linked to billionaire businessman \nAndrew Forrest of orchestrating a campaign to damage the commercial interests of his rivals.\nThe New York-listed energy giant is not suing Dr Forrest directly, but accusing several environmental groups, \nincluding Australia's Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund, of conspiring with officials in the California Justice \nDepartment to harm the company's prospects.\nIn filings with a federal court in Texas, Exxon says the IEJF is really a subsidiary of Minderoo, a charitable \norganisation set up by Dr Forrest. Minderoo has campaigned for action to prevent climate change and for a levy on \nusing fossil fuels to make plastic.\nExxon's lawsuit accuses Dr Forrest's charities of working to turn \"the wheels of American justice to [Fortescue's] \nself-interested purposes\".\nThe Forrest family has a major stake in ASX-listed Fortescue, the West Australian iron ore mining group, which \nhas been attempting to expand into clean energy. Although the company has pushed back plans for the large-scale \nmanufacture of green hydrogen, it has other projects around the world that it hopes will reduce the demand for \nfossil fuels. Green hydrogen is widely seen as a potential competitor to oil and gas.\n\"Fortescue appears to have adopted a novel strategy for competing against American oil and gas producers like \nExxonMobil,\" the court filings read.\n\"It is also a case about the corrupting influence of foreign money in the American legal system and about the sordid \nfor-profit incentives and outright greed that tries to hide behind so-called public impact litigation.\"\nExxon claims the IEJF, along with the Sierra Club, San Francisco Baykeeper, Heal the Bay and the Surfrider \nFoundation, have worked together and also with Californian authorities to bring lawsuits against the company. \nCalifornia's attorney-general, Rob Bonta, accused Exxon of a \"campaign of deception\" by suggesting single-use \nplastics made from fossil fuels could be reused through \"advanced recycling\" when they could not.\nPage 2 of 2\nExxon accuses Forrest-linked charity of helping his interests\nThe lawsuit is an escalation in a long-running stoush between Dr Forrest - who founded Fortescue and now has a \nfortune of $16.76 billion, according to the Financial Review Rich List - and the oil and gas industry.\nIn late 2023, Dr Forrest told a Perth radio station that Meg O'Neill, the chief executive of the largest ASX-listed oil \nand gas company, Woodside Energy, had been \"hard-edge trained by the biggest liar we've ever seen around \nclimate change over the last 40 years, and that's ExxonMobil\". \"She's been parachuted in here, bringing in all \nExxonMobil's ways,\" he said, adding that she was \"peddling poison all the time\".\nIn response, Woodside accused Dr Forrest of \"personal vitriol\" and \"using violent imagery\", describing it as a \n\"terrible example for public debate\".\nYesterday, Dr Forrest said the lawsuit against the environmental organisations was \"right out of the oil and gas \nindustry playbook\".\nFortescue and Minderoo have denied that they own or operate the IEJF, and they are not named as defendants in \nthe matter.\n\"I am personally delighted Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-\nexamination,\" Dr Forrest said in a statement. \"The fossil fuel industry is getting increasingly desperate at \nmaintaining its toxic grip on society. My conflict is that I am dedicated to steering the world away from a future \nreliant on fossil fuels.\"\nA Fortescue spokesman said the company rejected assertions that it had orchestrated litigation against Exxon for \nits advantage. \"Fortescue remains fully committed to green hydrogen and the establishment of a global green \nhydrogen industry, and rejects any claims to the contrary,\" he said.\nA spokesperson for the California Justice Department said: \"This is another attempt from ExxonMobil to deflect \nattention from its own unlawful deception. The attorney-general is proud to advance his lawsuit against \nExxonMobil.\"\nExxonMobil claims Dr Forrest visited the company's Texas offices in 2019 as he toured the world promoting the \nidea of a levy on new plastic, which he wanted to put in place to make recycled plastic more attractive. \"During that \nvisit, representatives of ExxonMobil explained that, while perhaps well intended, a voluntary agreement among \nindustry competitors to inflate the price of their goods would be a clear violation of US antitrust law,\" the company \nsaid in its filings with the Texas court.\nIt also alleges that Minderoo has repeatedly made \"several false and deceptive statements\" about Exxon's plastics \nand recycling processes. It alleges, without providing evidence, that Minderoo founded IEJF in 2022.\n\"The majority of the wealth used by Minderoo comes directly from its holdings in Fortescue,\" the filings read. \"The \nIEJF and Minderoo share executives with Fortescue. All of which leads to the conclusion that the IEJF's interests \nare directly tied to those of Fortescue.\"\nAccounts for the 12 months to June 30 show the charity received $600,000 in donations, up from $250,000 one \nyear earlier.\nMinderoo said it had been \"incorrectly referred to in the complaint as owning and controlling\" the IEJF.\nLoad-Date: January 11, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Mr Bonta has branded Exxon's recycling ambitions as a \"myth\" and a \n\"sham\".\nPage 2 of 3\n'Foreign agent': Forrest named in Exxon lawsuit\n\"Why would Mr Bonta or -anyone who claims to be serious about cleaning up the environment and helping solve \nthe plastic-waste issue take such extreme measures to shut down the emerging and developing advanced recycling \nindustry?\" the Exxon complaint said \"The answer is foreign influence, personal ambition, and a murky source of \nfinancing rife with conflicting business interests.\n\"With apparently no appreciation for the irony of their claim, Mr Bonta and his cohorts are now engaging in reverse \ngreen-washing; while posing under the banner of environmentalism, they do damage to genuine recycling programs \nand to meaningful innovation.\" Exxon noted in its complaint that Dr Forrest was the largest shareholder in \nFortescue, which it said was competing with Exxon in the low-carbon-solutions and energy-transition sector.\nThe company described efforts by Dr Forrest and Fortescue to transform the miner into a green-energy \npowerhouse, including its ambition to sell green hydrogen to the world in competition with American oil and gas \nproducers. Those plans have since been radically scaled back.\n\"Having failed to successfully compete against ExxonMobil in the marketplace, Fortescue has, on information and \nbelief, orchestrated a campaign to compete by turning the wheels of American justice to the company's self-\ninterested purposes,\" the Exxon complaint said. \"More specifically, Fortescue funds Minderoo, which owns and \ncontrols the IEJF, which hired an American law firm to bring claims against ExxonMobil on behalf of the US \nProxies.\" (Minderoo says Exxon's description of its relationship to IEFJ is incorrect.) Exxon said the scale and \nnature of IEFJ's engagement with US law firm Cotchett was significant enough to require the firm to register itself as \na foreign agent under the US Foreign Agents Registration Act.\n\"Together, Bonta and the US Proxies - the former for political gain and the latter pawns for the Foreign Interests - \nhave engaged in a deliberate smear campaign against ExxonMobil, falsely claiming that ExxonMobil's effective and \ninnovative advanced recycling technology is a 'false promise' and 'not based on truth',\" the complaint said.\nMr Bonta has accused Exxon of simply stockpiling, rather than recycling, plastic waste it had collected and has \nlabelled Exxon's advanced recycling \"a false promise\". Those attacks, Exxon said, had had a \"chilling effect\" on its \nability to attract third-party customers and secure permits.\nExxon noted in its lawsuit that Dr Forrest himself had in a 2019 TED Talk talked up the merits of advanced plastics \nrecycling, when he called for a voluntary levy on virgin plastics to help make the economics of advanced plastics \nrecycling more competitive.\nDr Forrest's Fortescue, while named in the complaint, is not a party to the lawsuit.\nThe accusations of foreign influence driving legal activism against the oil and gas sector echo accusations levelled \nagainst Australia's Environmental Defenders Office in the wake of its failed legal challenge against Santos and its \nBarossa gas project.\nThe EDO receives a significant portion of its donations from foreign sources. Opposition resources spokeswoman \nSusan McDonald has repeatedly called for greater transparency over the origins of that offshore funding.\nDr Forrest said he was dedicated to steering the world away from a future reliant on fossil fuels, and said any \naccusation of commercial benefit was completely false. \"The fossil-fuel industry know they are on borrowed time \nand that technological solutions exist to phase out fossil fuels,\" he said. \"If the company I founded, Fortescue, one \nof Australia's biggest polluters and most successful companies can profitably cease the use of fossil fuels and go \n'real zero' by 2030 - in just five years - heavy industry will be quick to follow.\" A Fortescue spokesman said the \ncompany rejected the assertions made against it in the lawsuit, including that it had orchestrated litigation against \nExxon to gain a competitive advantage.\n\"While the world was in turmoil in 2021, Fortescue seized the opportunity to meet with governments around the \nworld to begin its green transformation and this has been pivotal to setting the company up for its future success,\" \nthe spokesman said.Page 3 of 3\n'Foreign agent': Forrest named in Exxon lawsuit\n\"Fortescue has an industry-leading plan to stop burning fossil fuels and achieve 'real zero' across its Australian iron \nore operations by the end of the decade. It is this commitment that continues to set the bar for other companies - \nincluding those in the oil and gas industry - to follow.\" A Minderoo spokesman said it was clear that recycling was \nnot an effective means to curb the environmental and human health harms of plastics. \"Minderoo Foundation is \ncommitted to reducing the production of plastics which have a devastating impact on human health, with exposure \nto chemicals found in plastics increasing risks throughout the entire human life cycle, including impacting birth \noutcomes, child neurodevelopment, reproductive health, and metabolic, endocrine and nutrition systems,\" the \nspokesman said.\nLoad-Date: January 8, 2025\nEnd of Document",

It is unclear what he \nmeant by the comments, which came as he reiterated that Fortescue intended to spend \"at least $US6.5bn\" to \ndecarbonise its iron ore operations.\nCiti analysts said it had been a strong quarter in the core iron ore business based on output and lower production \ncosts, but disappointing in terms of cash generation as there was only a slight reduction in net debt.

Its rival iron ore miners - Rio \nTinto and BHP - also reaffirmed their full-year targets in quarterly filings earlier this month.\nStill, shares in Australia's resources giants have fallen since US President Donald Trump threatened to impose 10 \nper cent tariffs on China, potentially wrecking steel demand from the world's largest iron ore customer.\nFortescue shares fell 2.2 per cent to $18.62 yesterday, for a decline of 4 per cent since January 21 when Trump \nmade the threat.\nThe benchmark price of iron ore is tipped by analysts to trade at or below $US100 a tonne for most of this year as \nnew supply adds to stockpiles at Chinese ports, coupled with the threat of tariffs.\nThe benchmark spot price for ore containing 62 per cent iron fetched an average $US103 a tonne over the \nDecember quarter and was at that level yesterday.\nFortescue produces lower-grade ore than the benchmark, meaning it fetches lower prices. Over the December \nquarter, prices received fell shy of broker UBS' expectations; the miner realised an average price of $US87 a dry \nmetric tonne.\nHigher-grade ore from Iron Bridge fetched a premium to the benchmark of about 113 per cent.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue posts record tonnes amid tariff threat\n\"While we have seen improvements in demand and pricing for concentrates and pellet feed for Iron Bridge in this \nquarter, the market overall remains quite volatile,\" said Graham Howard, Fortescue's Iron Bridge operations \ndirector.\nMoreover, Morgan Stanley analysts warned earlier this week that proposed new environmental rules in China \nrequiring steel mills to switch to a higher-grade ore could pose a threat to Fortescue. Iron Bridge was developed to \nenhance Fortescue's product mix by blending its higher-grade ore with its majority lower-grade output.\nHowever, even with Iron Bridge output in the mix, Fortescue will still be a majority low-grade producer, Morgan \nStanley analysts concluded in their research. By the 2027 fiscal year, they estimate the group grade with the benefit \nof Iron Bridge will be about 59.1 per cent.\nFortescue's cost of production dropped 10 per cent to $18.24 a tonne. But net debt falling to $US2 billion ($3.2 \nbillion) was still a higher balance than expected, with market consensus at $US1.4 billion.\nLoad-Date: January 26, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Fortescue requires the support of the \ntarget's shareholders to secure the deal.\nAn independent expert evaluating the offer deemed it fair and reasonable, noting that the bid of $1.05 a share will \nincrease to $1.20 a share if Fortescue secures 75 per cent or more of the Red Hawk shares by February 4.\n\"We consider the offer to be fair for shareholders because the value of the offer for consideration under both \nscenarios is greater than the entire assessed valuation range of a Red Hawk share prior to the offer,\" said advisory \nfirm BDO.\nThe offer is a 28 per cent premium to Red Hawk's closing share price of 82\u00a2 on Friday, the last day it traded before \nthe deal was announced yesterday. The higher offer represents a premium of 46 per cent.\nSteven Michael, Red Hawk chief executive, said the decision to sell to Fortescue allowed shareholders to accept a \nchunky return on their investment and avoid the risks of developing an iron ore project.\n\"For a single asset junior, such as Red Hawk, to develop a major project there is a considerable funding burden. \nThere are also question marks over the timing of development of the project - to go to first production in the next 12 \nto 18 months requires many things outside our control to happen,\" he said.\n\"Fortescue has billions of dollars invested in infrastructure only 30 kilometres from our project. For them, this is an \nattractive bolt-on transaction. They can realise value that Red Hawk could never have realised.\"\nFortescue has the backing of Red Hawk shareholders TIO (NZ) and OCJ Investment (Australia), which own 70 per \ncent of Red Hawk. These agreements grant Fortescue the right to purchase 19.99 per cent of Red Hawk's shares \nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue offers $254m for Pilbara neighbour\nat the same price offered in the takeover bid, $1.05 a share. The remaining shares will be priced at $1.20 each if \nRed Hawk shareholders agree to sell 75 per cent of the company's register to Fortescue by next Tuesday.\nRed Hawk's Blacksmith iron ore deposit is estimated at 243 million tonnes with an average iron grade of 59.3 per \ncent, slightly below the 62 per cent benchmark typical for Pilbara operations. While the lower grade poses pricing \nchallenges, the deposit reinforces Fortescue's iron ore portfolio in the Pilbara and can link with its infrastructure.\nRBC analyst Kaan Peker said Fortescue was the natural owner of the Blacksmith plot. \"[The deal] consolidates \nsome of the last available tenements resources in the region which sits outside the major miners,\" he told clients.\nIn last week's quarterly update, Fortescue said it fetched an average price of $US87 per dry metric tonne of iron \nore, lower than the average benchmark spot price of $US103 a tonne over the December quarter.\nFortescue's troubled Iron Bridge project was developed to enhance the company's product mix by blending its \nhigher-grade ore with its lower-grade output. However, even with Iron Bridge in the mix, Fortescue will still be a \nmajority low-grade producer, Morgan Stanley analysts concluded. They estimate that by the 2027 fiscal year, the \ngroup grade with the benefit of Iron Bridge will be about 59.1 per cent, below the 62 per cent benchmark.\nMr Michael, who led Vimy Resources when it was taken over by uranium miner Deep Yellow, said the quality of \nRed Hawk's deposit compared favourably Fortescue's.\nLoad-Date: January 31, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Red Hawk shares jumped early and stabilised to close 44.5 per cent higher \non Tuesday at $1.18. Fortescue closed 0.37 per cent higher at $18.88.\nLoad-Date: January 29, 2025\nEnd of Document",

What better time to sink a cocktail and stuff \nyour face with fondue - or shimmy around to a live performance by Duran Duran at the big Salesforce party, which \nScott, hungry like the wolf, dutifully -attended.\nCatch was acquired in 2019 for $230m, but apart from a growth spurt during the Covid-19 pandemic it's done \nnothing but tank hard and fast in the face of Amazon, Shein and Temu, the Chinese purveyor of cheap, breakable \ncrap people are buying by the buttload.\nScott's eulogy of Catch to the ASX tried to smear out the bloodbath. Yes, the business sucked, and yes, our pet \ngoose got the axe but, hey, Wesfarmers still gained \"valuable insights and capabilities that have accelerated the \ngroup's digital transformation and supported the \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" We'll spare you the guff, you get the idea.\nAccording to Wesfarmers' accounts, Catch shed $96m during the last financial year, and Scott told investors that \nwinding it down would soak up another $60m in exit costs, bringing total losses for the business, or so we hear, to a \nballpark figure of about half a billion dollars. Small change for some in Davos, but we doubt Scott was making any \nof this unpleasantness known while hoping to bump into someone high-status around the staircase of the Congress \nCentre.\nIt's obvious what Scott was hoping to gain from Davos. Doesn't every small pond CEO want to kick back in the end \nzone with Jamie Dimon and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman? Doesn't everyone want to see Yo-Yo Ma get \ngently dusted with cloud-soft snow while performing Bach on a mountainside?\nPage 2 of 3\nScott lives high life as Catch dies\nOf course Scott didn't need to be there. Wesfarmers doesn't have a tonne of assets outside of Australia and New \nZealand, and its forays into offshore markets have been absolute duds. Remember Bunnings UK and Ireland? Yet \nanother dog, sold for a British pound by the time the shades were drawn. Woof.\nLet's not even mention Wesfarmers' acquisition of a West Australian mining site, a most unprofitable venture given \nthe current prices of lithium hydroxide. The commodity has crashed from highs of $US84,000 a tonne, in 2022, to \nas low as $US10,550 in October - and the numbers have barely eked upwards since.\nWesfarmers' response to our questions on this Davos caper was equally puzzling. All we wanted to know was how \nmany company representatives attended with Scott and how much it all cost.\n\"Unfortunately, we are in a full media blackout in the lead-up to our half-year results in Feb, so we can't comment \non your below request,\" a Wesfarmers spokesman said.\nSure, because the boss's attendance at the World Economic Forum has such a pivotal bearing on the company's \nearnings. Give us a break.\nGame for a laugh A press release landed in our inbox on Thursday announcing the launch of Monopoly: Central \nCoast Edition, named in honour of the retiree haven of NSW nestled between Sydney and Newcastle (also known \nas God's Waiting Room).\nThis is where Anthony Albanese recently bought a $4.3m house atop a cliff in Copacabana, a suburb whose \nstreets, we imagine, are a shot at being located at the Mayfair and Park Lane sector of the board, thanks to their \nglow-up from Albo's arrival. Woy Woy's less-salubrious Railway Street is shaping as a lock for the lesser-loved \nbrown tiles of Whitechapel and Old Kent Road. They're the one just after \"Go\", where even a proud row of hotels \nwon't even come close to winning you the game. Only an idiot buys up that real estate.\nBesides, everyone knows the smarter money trains its eye on the yellow or green tiles closer to Free Parking, and \nwe're guessing they'll be named after streets in Avoca Beach, where Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar bought a \nmansion two years ago, or perhaps Terrigal, where rich-lister Tony Denny listed a penthouse last year.\nOf course, there'll still be a square stipulating a payment on Income Tax, with the usual fine of $200 expected. But \nin this edition we imagine the retiree players get a pass; instead they actually get money back from all their franking \ncredits.\nHydrogen hope lost Another day, and another one of Andrew Forrest's hydrogen projects bites the dust.\nNews that Incitec Pivot has officially put the site of its mothballed Gibson Island ammonia plant on the market \nshould finally put a tombstone on the project that was for years supposed to be Fortescue's flagship Australian \ngreen ammonia play.\nNot that you'd know it from Fortescue's disclosures. The mining major put Gibson Island on the backburner 15 \nmonths ago citing high electricity costs. Despite missing multiple deadlines for the financial close on the multibillion-\ndollar project last year, Fortescue refused to admit that the horse was dead, telling the world it was still working to \nreduce costs.\nEven when Incitec flagged plans to sell the Brisbane site in November, Fortescue would only say it remained \ncommitted to green hydrogen but energy costs in Australia are too high, and it would never commit to a project that \nwasn't commercially viable, etc etc.\nAnd on Thursday the company still wasn't going any further, despite the sight of real estate agents spruiking the \nvalue of the land.\nPretty much everyone else involved has abandoned ship. Even the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which \nchipped in $13.7m of taxpayer cash into the $55m spent on feasibility studies. ARENA's website, as of this week, \nsays the project was completed on December 18.Page 3 of 3\nScott lives high life as Catch dies\nNo mention of the project's presumed abandonment in Fortescue's most recent quarterly production report, \nalthough iron ore boss Dino Otranto promised analysts \"a more comprehensive view\" of the status of its green \nenergy projects at Fortescue's half-year financial results in February last year.\nFortescue's own website still lists Gibson Island as a viable project, with commercial production planned for 2026.\nForrest himself was still banging the drum at Davos this month, telling Bloomberg he believes the dream is still \nalive, even after Fortescue sacked 700 people last year as it rationalised its energy and mining divisions.\n\"There is a new form of hydrogen, which will come onto the marketplace, which will be a lot cheaper,\" he said. \n\"We're not yet in a position where I want to talk about it publicly.\" We can't wait to hear about it.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Another of Twiggy's hydrogen projects bites the dust\nLoad-Date: January 30, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: CHANTICLEER; Pg. 32\nLength: 1335 words\nByline: MARK DI STEFANO and HANNAH WOOTTON\nBody\nForrest's Minderoo is sitting on billionsAndrew Forrest didn't become one of Australia's richest men, or make \nFortescue one of its most valuable companies, by spending all his money.\nBut while he's been happy to enjoy the finer things in life since making his riches - private jets, yachts and luxury \nhotels abound - it seems his charity Minderoo is still taking a spendthrift approach.\nThe Minderoo Foundation's net assets jumped $500 million last financial year to $8.1 billion, its latest accounts \nshow, largely funded by its surprise status as the biggest beneficiary of Twiggy and Nicola Forrest's divorce. \nDespite this, its \"impact expenditure\" (which is how Minderoo's bean counters phrase what money it hands out to \nthe various good causes it supports) fell $20 million to $229 million.\nSmall change when you consider the 2024 financial year was its first full year of reaping the rewards of the $5 \nbillion in Fortescue shares it received as part of the former Forrest couple's divorce settlement.\nAt the time, the donation of shares was touted by this masthead as the biggest philanthropic gift in Australian \nhistory. But does it count as philanthropy if a charity, especially one owned by the donors - just banks the cash?\nThe accounts show the trust got a tidy $775 million in Fortescue dividends for the year despite the iron ore price's \nfreefall. Add in a surplus of $537 million, and you'd be forgiven for thinking Minderoo might have loosened its purse \nstrings a little.\nBut the charity has been in simplification mode since the split. Its corporate wages bill was down more than $2 \nmillion for the financial year after it cut about a third of its workforce last April. We hear several future projects are \nalso n the works. It's trying to do fewer things, but do them better. A familiar mantra for Fortescue's recently \njobless, too.\nGiles adds to her\nbulging workload\nPage 2 of 3\nREAR WINDOW Forrest's Minderoo is sitting on billions\nAt the apex of the nation's professional fixers is there ever a lack of demand for services rendered by lawyer \nRebekah Giles? She and a handful of others (including Melbourne's Leon Zwier) are on speed dial from corporates, \ncelebs and corporate celebs who need reputation help, or a rapid defamation notice drafted.\nTake Taylor Auerbach, the steak-and-cocaine TV producer who went nuclear on the Seven network and rapist \nBruce Lehrmann at a key moment in the latter's defamation trial last year. Barrister Sue Chrysanthou was already \nrepresenting former Ten presenter Lisa Wilkinson in her defence against Lehrmann, so it fell to Giles to front Justice \nMichael Lee on behalf of Auerbach. Less than 24 hours after the infamous Lehrmann judgment, Giles followed it up \nby negotiating a large defamation settlement for Jewish student Ben Cohen from Seven after the network \nmisidentified him as being behind the Bondi Westfield attack.\nPoint is, she always seems busy, which is why her recent addition to an arcane racing position seems strange. Last \nmonth, Giles was appointed to the board of Racingcorp Pty Ltd.\nRacingcorp was established after the privitisation of Tabcorp in the 1990s, and operates as the gathering place for \nracing bigwigs to negotiate for their slice of gambling revenues. The corporate entity's other directors include \nRacing NSW chief executive Peter V'landys, chairwoman Saranne Cooke, Australian Turf Club chairman Peter \nMcGauran and Harness Racing NSW chief executive Peter Buckman.\nGiles was added to the Racingcorp board because she's also the deputy chair of Greyhounds NSW. Not for us to \nquestion whether she has a secret love for the dish lickers, but Giles has been on the sport's board since 2019. The \npeak organisation is mired in a full-scale inquiry into the sport's welfare and integrity. There's no better hired gun \nthan Giles at a time like this.\nRacingcorp is in effect a holdover corporate entity that we're told rarely meets because the separate racing bodies \ndo their own negotiating direct with Tabcorp. So while Giles' addition might be a formality, it does signal her \nimportance to Greyhounds NSW in matters like its commercial talks. The organisation collected $31 million in Tab \nrevenues in 2024 - its second-largest source of income.\nAnd like a short-priced bolter at Wenty Park, Giles has form. In November, she strode out of the Fair Work \nCommission alongside Adam Rytenskild, the recently ousted CEO of Tabcorp. Rytenskild got a green light to sue \nhis former employer, which he argued left him no choice but to resign over a disputed vulgar remark he made \nearlier in the year. It was Rytenskild's swift exit that led to former AFL chief Gil McLachlan's coronation at the ASX-\nlisted company.\nRytenskild became Tabcorp CEO in 2022 after an audacious (failed) bid from Matthew Tripp's Betmakers to take \nover the company. Around the same time Betmakers added Giles to its board. As we've noted before, Betmakers \ndoesn't deal with Tabcorp directly, but it does make betting tech for its online gambling rivals. That is, Giles is \nrepresenting a star client suing Tabcorp, she sits on a board that helps companies take market share from Tabcorp, \nand is now the figurehead of a sport that negotiates revenue from Tabcorp.\nNIMBY or YIMBY? Charlton's identity crisis\nWhether getting called a NIMBY or a YIMBY is an insult or a badge of pride depends on what circles one moves in. \nHow confusing for federal Parramatta MP Andrew Charlton, then, that voters are calling him both.\nThe former Accenture executive, who is touted as a future Labor leader, is sticking his neck out to oppose \ndevelopment plans for 2500 new homes in North Parramatta. He's even launched a petition.\nThe (Labor) state government thinks the development will help enable a plan for 12,000 more jobs along Sydney's \nfavourite new toy, the light rail, and a new Sydney University campus that will support Westmead Hospital. All good \nthings, you'd think.\nNot to Charlton and others. He's worried it will jeopardise a world heritage application - it's already got a national \none - for the Female Factory, an 1818 prison, workhouse and hospital for unmarried female convicts in Sydney.Page 3 of 3\nREAR WINDOW Forrest's Minderoo is sitting on billions\nCue the YIMBY frenzy online. It's whiplash for Charlton, who is usually painted as positively socialist in terms of \nhousing development plans by the Liberal Party and its supporters.\nNo wonder, amid a flurry of social media posts on the issue in recent weeks, he declared on LinkedIn: \"I'm no \nYIMBY or NIMBY\".\nWe aren't arguing against the worthiness of heritage listings - as Charlton says, you can \"build Parramatta's future \nwhile preserving its past\". He also has a fairly strong track record on housing - his seat boasts the No.1 local \ncouncil in NSW for new housing approvals, and he's backed projects to build around 20,000 new homes. Just \nsomewhere else.\nAfter all, he knows better than most the perks of cracking the property market. He moved from a $16 million \nBellevue Hill house to a four-bedder in North Parramatta when he dropped into the seat, then added an apartment \n(just the sub-penthouse - he's a man of the people) to his $4 million western Sydney property portfolio when he \ncouldn't renovate as planned. He also dropped a cool $12 million on a Palm Beach home last March.\nBut opposing more housing is an interesting move from an MP who was accused of not understanding western \nSydney when he was parachuted from the eastern suburbs into his safe Labor seat. Some locals are keen for the \nheritage application to be prioritised, but for many, the housing and cost of living are most in front of mind.\nThe powers that be in Canberra know this. Last week, Albo swung by Parramatta with Charlton to spruik new \ntransport infrastructure funding. The goal? More housing in the west!\nCharlton is happy to compromise. He says he will be satisfied with just \"pressing pause\" on the rezoning until \nUNESCO makes its decision on the heritage application.\nOr he's happy for it to go ahead now, just 200 metres down the road - but the bureaucrats at Macquarie Street don't \nlike that.\nThat deadline is in 2029. There are two federal and one state election before then.\nLoad-Date: February 2, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: FEATURES; Pg. 36\nLength: 2513 words\nByline: Mark Wembridge and Tom Rabe\nBody\nIndustrial relations Changes to laws have revived the prospect of unions in 'the engine room' of the economy, write \nMark Wembridge and Tom Rabe.\nThe blazing January sun is still below the yardarm as a lingerie-clad barmaid serves $11.50 pints of icy Great \nNorthern lager to three fly in, fly out workers at the Redcliffe Tavern, a nondescript bar near Perth airport.\nShifting their gaze from the $20 notes tucked into various lacy straps, the FIFO workers turn to another burning \nissue that has been out of mind for more than three decades: unions in Western Australia's Pilbara.\nEager to down a few beers after their eight day \"swing\" at BHP's iron ore operations in Newman, Charlie, Jack and \nCody say they have been \"watching and waiting\" to see how Pilbara negotiations between unions and the big \nminers unfold.\n\"A union will mean there's a standard for everyone. No differences between what is happening on one site \ncompared to another,\" says Cody, an Indigenous man who has worked as a FIFO mine operator of excavators, \nloaders and bulldozers for more than a dozen years. \"I've got mates at FMG, at Rio [Tinto], and they're all thinking \nthe same.\"\nJack, a 25-year mining veteran with tattoos up to his chin who says FIFO work has cost him three long-term \nrelationships, nods in agreement. \"An EBA [enterprise bargaining agreement] is the big one,\" he says. \"Because \nthat's the one at the moment where a lot of companies are just walking over people. They've got no representation.\"\nChanges to industrial relations laws have revived the prospect of re-unionisation in a region dubbed \"the engine \nroom\" of Australia's economy, nearly four decades after the infamous Robe River brawl in effect eliminated \norganised labour in the Pilbara.\nMining companies, conservative politicians and corporate lobbyists say unionisation will return the Pilbara to its \nunproductive and strike-prone past, undermining tax revenue and driving investment abroad.\nPage 2 of 5\nFIFO workers mull unions' return in Pilbara\nUnions want to represent staff who work long hours on variable rosters, face workplace safety concerns and \nincidents of sexual harassment, lack widespread enterprise bargaining agreements and endure long periods away \nfrom their families.\nBut unionisation in mining is thin. Union members comprised 10 per cent of Australia's mining workforce in 2022, \ndown from 16.5 per cent in 2016, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Union membership on Australian \nmine sites was 44 per cent in 1994.\n\"In the mining industry in Australia over the past 25 years, productivity has moved sideways as wages have \ndoubled,\" says Mike Henry, chief executive of BHP, one of the Pilbara's biggest employers. \"That is not a route to \nremain competitive, and this industry has to remain competitive globally under the 'same job, same pay' policies.\"\nThe Pilbara's wealth has supercharged the fortunes of billionaires such as Gina Rinehart and Andrew Forrest, as \nwell as feathered the superannuation nests of millions of Australians.\n\"At a time when everyone recognises that we've got a cost-of-living crisis, who is making the most noise [about \nindustrial relations changes]? Companies earning $20 billion a year,\" says Paul Farrow, national secretary of the \nAustralian Workers' Union.\nThe dispute was sparked by the Albanese government's laws, part of the \"secure jobs, better pay\" workplace \nreforms introduced in 2022, that have eased union access to mine worksites.\nThe laws mean unions must no longer demonstrate that the majority of the workforce supports collective \nbargaining, as long as an existing agreement is within five years of expiration. Before those changes, unions had to \nestablish that they represented most workers before employers were obliged to negotiate.\nThis change enabled the AWU to drag BHP to the bargaining table to negotiate wages and conditions.\n\"In the Pilbara, we've got a bizarre situation whereby we're being compelled by law to bargain with the union when \nneither the company nor employees have sought that. That's the bizarreness of it,\" says Geraldine Slattery, BHP's \ncountry boss in Australia.\nThe Western Mine Workers Alliance wishlist presented to BHP includes a $10,000 annual bonus per employee, \nannual pay rises of 5 per cent or WA's consumer price index plus 1 per cent, and uniform conditions and \nentitlements across all BHP iron ore mine sites. Based on the company's 14,000-strong iron ore workforce, the \nretention bonus alone could cost BHP $140 million a year.\nThe Mining Council of Australia, the industry's peak lobbying body, says the laws \"open the door to industry-wide \n'bargaining' and industry-wide strikes - and a return to 1970s-style industrial confrontation and disruption\".\n\"There is not a single element of these measures that will either enhance productivity or co-operation in workplaces. \nThey are all doing the opposite.\"\nThe industry group says the laws give unions \"more coercive powers, including the increased right of entry powers, \nwith deliberate loopholes that facilitate their abuse; the ability to force businesses and workers into bargaining with \nno worker support; vastly expanded powers for union delegates, even in non-union workplaces.\n\"This scenario is only the beginning. Hundreds of companies, in a broad range of sectors, could soon be hit with \nsimilar claims in this race to control workforces.\"\nUnions dismiss criticism of the laws as fearmongering and cite the need to more fairly distribute the immense \nwealth generated from one of the country's most profitable industries.\n\"We've heard [miners] saying the sky is going to fall in with these laws. They have been in place for quite some time \nnow ... and nothing's changed,\" says Farrow. \"[Mining companies] are still making billions of dollars of profit, and \nworkers are still in the same situation.\"Page 3 of 5\nFIFO workers mull unions' return in Pilbara\nOne big miner says it has been forced to hire staff to chauffeur union officials between mine sites to facilitate their \nmembership drive.\nMichaelia Cash, federal opposition leader in the Senate and opposition spokeswoman on workplace relations, says \nthe Albanese government has betrayed the mining sector, after initially promising that its IR reforms would not \nextend into the Pilbara.\n\"In all the conversations I have had with miners over here, they've been clear that the industrial relations legislation \nhas been set up to lower productivity and efficiency,\" she says, adding that a union push into the region will damage \nthe economy.\nThe foundations of Australia's prosperity can arguably be traced to the 1986-87 Robe River industrial brawl. Former \nWA premier Brian Burke had a front-row seat to the now infamous row, a conflict he says escalated almost \novernight and was inflamed by obstinacy on both sides.\n\"Robe River, that was the start, the origin, the foundation of everything,\" he says. \"It was high noon with people 10 \npaces apart wearing guns.\"\nReflecting on what some describe as the Pilbara's \"reformation\", Burke says the conduct and approach of Robe \nRiver boss Charles Copeman and the unionists opposing him meant sensible negotiations were never an option.\n\"Copeman was like Tony Abbott on steroids, not just a conservative, but someone who was almost physically wired \nthat way,\" he says. \"He was completely intractable, and so the unions adopted an equal and opposite force. They \nbecame completely intractable.\"\nBurke, who fell from grace after being jailed for fraud, said Copeman's approach was \"detached from reality\", but \nhis elimination of unions from the Pilbara occurred because \"the conditions for working people in the Pilbara were \nso good that the need for unions ceased to be in the front of their mind\".\nThe bulk of iron ore royalties are generated from the largely union-free mines in the Pilbara of Rio Tinto and BHP. \nFortescue, Roy Hill and Mineral Resources also mine the steel-making ingredient in the region.\nThe industry creates enormous personal fortunes:the Forrests last year took home $2.2 billion in dividends from \nFortescue, while Rinehart pocketed $2.8 billion largely through her company Hancock Prospecting's stake in Roy \nHill.\nHowever, the industry is slowing. WA has forecast iron ore royalties to shrink by one-third, or $3.5 billion, in 2024-\n25, as prices wobble.\nWestpac warned that iron ore prices could collapse 30 per cent this year to about $US70 a tonne when Rio floods \nthe market with supply from its burgeoning Simandou mine in Guinea. Recent monsoon-like rains have also \ninundated the region and flooded infrastructure, slowing exports.\nSimon Trott, Rio Tinto's iron ore boss, says \"productivity should be the central theme of any reform\" of IR laws. \n\"Productivity drives jobs and wage growth, it encourages new investment and boosts the Australian economy. \nThese reforms will become a handbrake on the economy over the long term and put Australia on a path to lower \nliving standards and lower wage growth,\" he adds.\nThe warning of lower productivity comes as Treasurer Jim Chalmers singled out the private sector to pull Australia \nout of a tailspin, after the economy eked out a weaker-than-expected gain of 0.3 per cent last quarter.\nThe battle between the federal Labor government and industry echoes the fight over the Minerals Resource Rent \nTax imposed in 2010 and revoked three years later following a bitter campaign.\nLabor may have lost that fight, but it is digging its heels in on this battle, despite the potential for alienating voters \nahead of state and federal elections, where WA seats will play a pivotal role.Page 4 of 5\nFIFO workers mull unions' return in Pilbara\nFederal Resources Minister Madeleine King dismisses criticisms of the government's IR reforms from miners as \n\"hysteria\".\nWhile opponents to enterprise bargaining point to the high wages and low union density as a sign of a content \nPilbara workforce, FIFO workers have told The Australian Financial Review that their wish to see unions in the \nPilbara was mostly due to the desire to see equal conditions across the industry.\nUnfriendly rostering, unpaid travel time at some mines, workplace safety concerns, and variable pay and conditions \namong colleagues are all sources of contention. \"If we are talking sacrifice in mining ... I have missed a total of five \nChristmases with my family, it's just how my roster has been rolled out,\" says FIFO worker Cheryl.\nShe predicts membership will swell if unions prove they can negotiate a deal with a major miner.\n\"People fear the ramifications. There is not much fight in the mining workers lately because of the cost-of-living \ncrisis. Men and women go to work to make ends meet,\" Cheryl says.\nAfter six years working FIFO in Pilbara mines, Ryan has seen his salary grow from $80,000 as a graduate engineer \nto more than $250,000 as a construction manager. However, his hefty pay does not erase his feelings of isolation \nnor compensate for spending long periods away from his young family.\n\"People [in Perth] start to forget about you. You stop getting included in plans - not on purpose, but just because \nyou're not around. It's taxing and can be quite isolating. When I started six years ago, I was doing four weeks on, \none week off,\" he says.\nCheryl and Ryan say unions have a role to play in the Pilbara by advocating for better conditions.\nRyan agrees that organised labour could find fertile ground in the Pilbara.\n\"Unions have their place. It would be better for workers as a whole to have them [in the Pilbara], but it certainly \nwould probably make work harder for me [as a manager],\" he says. \"Unionisation is common in metro construction \nsites, but not in mining. People float between those industries all the time. I can see people definitely thinking that it \nwould be a good thing to join [a union].\"\nCheryl agrees that some FIFO colleagues struggle with the isolation. \"Where I work there is no such support for \ngetting women back into a flexible roster after she has come off maternity leave. I have seen women struggle and \nrelationships deteriorate because of it.\"\nAlthough some miners have extolled their efforts to increase female staff numbers, the likes of Macmahon - an \nASX-listed mining contractor that has nearly 10,000 staff - does not offer any paid parental leave.\nThe pressure to increase wages, conditions and benefits comes at a time of heightened global competition for iron \nore producers, with the likes of Rio's Simandou poised to take market share and siphon away investment.\n\"Our engine room, the huge contributor to our country, Australia's mining industry, faces higher regulatory burdens \nand bureaucratic risk and expense,\" says Australia's richest person, Rinehart, whose $40 billion fortune was built on \nthe Pilbara's iron ore.\n\"Australia's increasing government intervention combined with ideological and expensive or impractical policies is \nnegatively effecting new mining investment. Reduced investment will lead to lower living standards.\"\nEmployment and Workplace Relations Minister Murray Watt downplays miners' concerns about the laws, saying \n\"the facts just don't back them up\".\n\"On every measure, the WA economy is performing strongly, so I find it difficult to see how our industrial relations \nchanges have been hurting the mining industry or the WA economy,\" Watt says. \"We want mining companies to do \nwell, but we also want mining workers to do well. It's their hard work that delivers the profits for these companies.\"Page 5 of 5\nFIFO workers mull unions' return in Pilbara\nWhile the five-year expiration requirement has forced BHP to negotiate with unions, other miners have - at least so \nfar - avoided talks.\nUnlike BHP, Rio is not compelled to negotiate with unions because its enterprise agreements expired before 2019. \nFortescue has not struck a collective agreement in more than a decade. MinRes declined to comment.\nForrest says Fortescue has a \"freedom culture\" whereby staff can come directly to management to raise their \nconcerns, and that employees admire him too much to unionise.\nBran Black, Business Council of Australia chief executive, describes the Pilbara as \"the engine room of our \neconomy\" and says unionisation of the region \"will hurt all Australians\".\n\"The region's contribution is immense, providing economic prosperity and higher living standards for every \nAustralian, and we cannot allow unions to override this for their own selfish purposes,\" he adds.\nHowever, the AWU's Brad Gandy, who is WA state secretary, says the pace at which an industrial wave is \nsweeping across the Pilbara has surprised many.\nRe-unionisation of the Pilbara will not mean a return to the 1980s, he adds. \"If you look back at the tactics that the \ncompanies used in the 1980s, that wouldn't work again. I think both parties have a responsibility in either going \nback to the '80s or staying in 2024 and saying, 'How can we work together?\"'\nHowever, Burke says the high salaries, paired with a fragmented and dispersed FIFO workforce, will prove too \nmuch of a challenge for unions to overcome in the Pilbara.\n\"When people in the Pilbara are earning $190,000 a year for sitting on their backside in an airconditioned truck and \ndriving 200 metres there, then 200 metres back, they don't see the need for a union, do they?\"\n\"I think it's akin to throwing seed on stones.

They do, and I love it,\" he said, when asked \nby The Australian Financial Review whether it would welcome unions onto its Pilbara mine sites.\n\"If unions want to come in, they are completely welcome. [But] is there a job for unions to come and speak to me \nabout the troops? No, they can come and speak to me directly. We stay really close because we love our people.\n\"You don't get workers running up to leaders wanting selfies and heart-to-hearts [at other mining companies], but \nthat's stock-standard here.\"\nMost Pilbara worksites became largely union-free in the 1980s, after years of militant industrial action and rolling \nstrikes provoked a stand-off with intransigent management that in effect eliminated collective bargaining.\nUnion members comprised 10 per cent of the mining workforce in 2022, down from 16.5 per cent in 2016, according \nto the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Three decades ago, union membership on mine sites was 44 per cent.\nWhile union membership remains strong at mines where the workforce lives nearby, such as Queensland's \ncoalfields, unions have struggled to get a foothold in the Pilbara, where the vast majority of workers fly in and out. \nUnder the Albanese government's \"Secure Jobs, Better Pay\" workplace reforms, unions are not required to \nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue heart-to-hearts make unionisation redundant: Forrest\ndemonstrate that the majority of the workforce supports collective bargaining, as long as an agreement is within five \nyears of expiration.\nThis has enabled unions to bring BHP to the bargaining table to negotiate wages and conditions.\nThe Western Mine Workers Alliance has presented BHP with a list of demands that include a $10,000 annual \nretention bonus per employee, annual pay rises and uniform conditions and entitlements across sites.\nOther producers in the region - Rio Tinto, Fortescue, Roy Hill and Mineral Resources - fear that unionisation will \nspread to their mines and eat into their margins.\nIron ore mining in the Pilbara has fuelled the wealth of billionaires such as Dr Forrest and Gina Rinehart, the \ncountry's richest person. Unlike BHP, Rio is not compelled to negotiate with unions because its enterprise \nagreements expired before 2019, while Fortescue has not struck a collective agreement in more than a decade.\nThe Minerals Council of Australia has warned that the laws could \"open the door to industry-wide 'bargaining' and \nindustry-wide strikes - and a return to 1970s-style industrial confrontation and disruption\".\nDr Forrest said unions were vital to some workplaces, but their services were redundant at Fortescue.\n\"Unions have a serious role when there is a breakdown between troops and managers, but there is strong \ncamaraderie here. The troops come straight to people like me. We have no issue with unions, but the troops decide \nfor themselves,\" he said.\nLoad-Date: February 5, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: CHANTICLEER; Pg. 32\nLength: 1282 words\nByline: MARK DI STEFANO and HANNAH WOOTTON\nBody\nBusiness figures and lobbyists filed down Melbourne's Bourke Street last week for a closed-door fundraiser with Jim \nChalmers. It was at SEC Newgate's office and billed as a private dinner with the federal treasurer, with proceeds \nflowing to Victorian Labor.\nBefore the event, Responsible Wagering Australia's Kai Cantwell got a call telling him he wouldn't be allowed in the \nroom despite paying for a ticket.\nSure, Cantwell is a former Nationals adviser (and his boss is Liberal greybeard Nick Minchin) but lobbyists across \nthe party divide attend these cash-for-access do's. That's what the money is for.\nCould it be because the RWA's key client is Sportsbet, the foreign-owned bookmaking giant sweating the most on \nmooted changes to gambling advertising laws?\nTo be blackballed from one event might be seen as unlucky. But word's gotten out among gossip-hungry lobbyists \nthe RWA has been shut out of several Federal Labor Business Forum events. One featuring Prime Minister \nAnthony Albanese, another starring Communications Minister Michelle Rowland.\nHow both parties run their business forums is a galling exercise in regulatory runaround. Annual disclosures \nreleased this week plainly show the individuals like billionaire Anthony Pratt who stump up large party donations.\nBut business donations through annual subscriptions to the forums are kept fuzzy. Millions of dollars in cash \ndumped into a washing machine. It's up to journalists to piece together exactly who is forking over the suitcases \nthat give them privileged access to the country's elected officials.\nRWA is a paid subscriber of Labor's forum. Those subscribers usually pay something like $60,000 annually, and in \nreturn get a wad of tickets to budget night and passes to other talkfests. That's a fair wedge, to not be getting \nanything for it.\nOne possible reason for its exclusion is that, given the government is apparently at the pointy end of developing its \nbookmaker ad ban policy, it would be inappropriate for RWA to be in the room.\nPage 2 of 3\nREAR WINDOW Chalmers, Labor leave bookmaking giant in cold\nAnd that sounds well and nice, but what of all the other blue-chip companies whose commercial futures are \ninfluenced by any pending government policy? Do you reckon Resources Minister Madeleine King is being shielded \nfrom BHP and Rio's lobbyist operations? Does Chalmers have the discipline to screen late-night calls from CBA's \nMatt Comyn? Of course not.\nPerhaps they have wised up to the not-a-good-look factor of going off-record with bookmakers.\nIn 2023, this masthead revealed the RWA (then on behalf of Sportsbet and Entain) picked up the tab for a private \nsteak dinner for Rowland the year prior. This was later excused as a \"policy briefing\", which coincidentally fell on \nher birthday. She faced calls to resign.\nIn 2022, Sportsbet also footed a $8960 bill for a dinner to support Rowland's election campaign at Rockpool. She \nwas then the shadow minister in charge of online betting. The Minister for Sportsbet tag has stuck.\nAny wonder Labor is running around blacklisting the bookmakers. If it is serious, it can give the subscription money \nback.\nTech visa lobby foots bill for Bragg's bash\nLiberal senator Andrew Bragg's 2023 Christmas party was a glitzy affair, sponsored by Sydney's billionaire party \nking Justin Hemmes. It had the venue (not disclosed), drinks and canapes you'd expect of a Merivale shindig.\nHis 2024 Christmas bash was a less glamorous affair, according to Bragg. The venue (not disclosed, again) was \nsomewhere in Barangaroo and the senator's parliamentary disclosures show the sponsor was the Australian \nComputer Society.\nWho doesn't want to talk about IT over an eggnog margarita?\nGiven the ACS's financial stake in several policies that could become key election issues, footing the bill for a \nChristmas party for Liberal Party operatives may prove a smart investment.\nThe organisation pitches itself as a \"leading professional association representing Australia's technology \ncommunity, across industry, government and education\". It has nearly 50,000 members and releases reports on \nprofessional skills and trends.\nBut it is also an accredited provider of skilled migrant assessments for IT professionals hoping to move to Australia.\nAnother revenue stream is its \"ACS Professional Year\", which it pitches as \"a job-readiness program that bridges \nthe gap between full-time study and employment in Australia's tech sector\". Graduates can claim an additional five \npoints towards visa applications.\nIf only there was an event where the ACS could speak to politicians about the important issues of skilled migration \nand international student caps in the lead-up to Christmas ...\nOn the ACS front, a spokesman says the party was \"part of our regular government relations outreach program\". It \nspreads its Christmas cheer without partisanship too: \"We do it with politicians from all parties and the \nindependents as well,\" he says.\nFrom Bragg's end, he says he was just keen to celebrate Christmas in Sydney as, in his view, the city's Lord Mayor \nClover Moore had tried to shut it down. \"Clover Moore hates Christmas, I love Christmas,\" he says. \"I think it's good \nto celebrate, and I'm grateful to the ACS for putting on a nice event where I can thank my long-suffering \nsupporters.\"\nAt Fortescue, you really can ask anythingPage 3 of 3\nREAR WINDOW Chalmers, Labor leave bookmaking giant in cold\nAll-staff meetings are fertile ground for workplace drama, especially when the floor is opened for questions to \nmanagement. Never one to back down from a fight, Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has instituted a permanent \"Ask \nUs Anything\" portal.\nRank-and-file staff post anonymous questions to management, which are then posted in a public forum. They can \nbe \"liked\", with the most popular then answered in a weekly meeting. It also includes any written responses from \nthe bosses.\nUnsurprisingly, some silliness has ensued. In one post, an employee asks for an in-house lottery; 81 staffers back \nthe request, which bears a striking resemblance to Gina Rinehart's in-house loyalty program. \"For each year with \nFMG, can we be given a token that is placed into a barrel and have ten tokens drawn out yearly with the winners \nget [sic] 100k prize,\" the Fortescue workers asked.\nGiven Twiggy is convinced Rinehart has spent her life copying his ideas, we don't reckon there is much chance he \nwill return the favour by replicating her annual Christmas cash giveaway, in which random staff members are gifted \n$100,000.\nOther requests included table tennis and a pool for FMG's new corporate digs on St Georges Terrace in Perth. \n\"Would be lovely to have a quick dip during breaks or after a hard day's work,\" one staffer said.\n\"Can males wear formal shorts to the office on hot summer days please?\" was another plea. Some decorum, \nplease!\nThe raffle may not be flying, but other FMG \"troops\", as Twiggy calls them, have had more luck in getting action \nfrom managers. Some correspondents used it to complain that FMG's recent austerity drive had robbed them of \nbiscuits and fruit in staff kitchenettes, and tampons in the toilets. The tampon question was especially popular, with \n184 likes.\nA Fortescue spokesman assured us that those essentials were on the way back, with an alternating roster between \nfruit and biscuits. Tampon dispensers are also in the works.\nSome of the questions have a lot more edge. A common theme in many submissions has been frustration at \nFortescue's diversity policies. The company has been an industry leader in improving diversity within its workforce \nand is one of the few ASX20 companies to publicly stand by its approach since Donald Trump's anti-inclusion push.\nYet many of the questions posed on the Ask Us Anything portal suggested that women and ethnic minorities were \nwinning promotions undeservedly. Those questions have upset some staff.\nLoad-Date: February 7, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Well, actually, not all of them are nameless; the bland \nresponses, the most banal and corporate, come with a name. But rest assured, this lark is completely consuming \neveryone at the organisation.\nIt's Frank Costanza's airing of grievances but on an enormous scale, a Festivus ritual open to more than 20,000 \nparticipants across the Forrest empire.\nThere's snark, there's banter. There's outrage over a tampon and sanitary pad dispenser that's gone missing from a \nbathroom.\nThere's righteous indignation over women who can swish around the office in skirts during the summer while poor, \nsuffering dudes have to wilt in their neckties and suit jackets.\n\"Biscuits \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. We want biscuits in all kitchens \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Nothing better than a cuppa and a biccy,\" said one employee, \nreceiving 37 upvotes from their peers. Meanwhile, someone's idea for a masala chai machine in the kitchenette \nreceived only four upvotes. Philistines.\nWhat better window into a company's culture?\nFortescue CEO Dino Otranto addressed the most pressing questions at a recent \"team huddle\", although it's hard \nto tell whether he took this all seriously. Otranto prefaced one response by saying, \"this is probably the politically \ncorrect answer I need to give\", and then he told everyone that he likes to sit back and brace himself for the \nquestions \"with a nice bottle of scotch\".\nNo shade on knocking back a dram of whisky, which Dino can happily afford with his $1.75m salary (not including \nperformance rights, themselves worth a few dinero) but what of the Fortescue underclass? They're getting punted \nPage 2 of 3\nSome home truths for Fortescue\nbecause of Forrest's failing green energy vision. Remember the secret membrane, or the magic beans of green \nhydrogen? So much heat, yet so little light. Pretty soon we'll get an announcement of major advancements out of \nFortescue HQ. Their newest secret weapon? Eye of newt.\nSome 700 employees were let go in July, supposedly to lean up the business and not at all because of this flunking, \nexpensive project that's subsidised by the long-suffering shareholders of Fortescue's actual rainmaking business: \nmining. \"Most of us can't afford a nice bottle of scotch,\" one staffer said.\nOtranto's \"huddle\" mustn't have gone down a treat, which explains why chief operating officer Shelley Robertson, \npoached from the dum-dums at MinRes, fronted the second town hall instead to answer questions, one of which \nconcerned Fortescue's very cluttered organisational chart.\n\"Can someone explain the org structure? We have CEOs reporting to CEOs, directors to directors, and varying \ntitles, despite being told it would be 'flattened'.\" Now who might have asked that except for someone clearly trying to \nMarie Kondo the place? Looking at you, Otranto.\nSome insight, as well, into the workforce hardships that have followed the screw-tightening of July.\n\"Why is the budget so tight at the minute? Are we expected to deliver world class service on a shoestring budget? \nRecruitment restrictions are leaving departments short and the people picking up the slack are getting burned out,\" \nsaid one aggrieved Fortescue worker. Another sarcastically wrote: \"Is there an opportunity in the future to expand \non the CEO for a day initiative and participate if you are not a First Nations -employee?\" And then this from a \nperson who clearly hasn't kept an eye on iron ore prices: \"Instead of a Christmas party, can you give each \ndepartment $150 per person to hold their own team party?\" A popular idea with 211 upvotes, but hopelessly \nunrealistic, to be sure. Reminder: it's Fortescue, people, not Hancock. Don't hold your breath for a cash giveaway.\nA spokeswoman said the whole point of the exercise was to promote transparent communication within the \norganisation.\n\"This is just one avenue we are using to ensure our staff can continue to engage and interact with the leadership \nteam, getting answers to the topics that matter the most to our people,\" which apparently doesn't go much higher \nthan biscuits and air conditioning.\nDonations dry up Good retail politics, or a fundraising own goal?\nThe outrage over PwC's tax leaks scandal generated plenty of headlines for both major parties but their backroom \noperators might be ruing the point scoring as they tally up their respective election war chests. Not that many \npeople outside of the party backrooms will be crying, but those inside the tent might be another victim of the PwC \nscandal.\nThe Australian Electoral Commission's annual release of political donation data suggests the major parties' coffers \nhave been left with a $700,000 black hole after the \"big four\" firms - PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY - dramatically \npulled back their support last financial year.\nThey collectively donated almost $1m to both major parties in 2022-23 before revelations emerged that PwC used \nits position inside the tax office tent to enrich itself and its clients, at the (probable) expense of taxpayers.\nHowever, after politicians turned the screws on the bastardry, most of the firms shied away from making political \ndonations.\nPwC coughed up $369,973 to the major political parties in 2022-23, but didn't make any political donations in 2023-\n24 after banning them entirely. KPMG donated just $22,631, which was down 83 per cent on the previous year, \nwhile Deloitte donated $47,497 - down 73 per cent.\nOnly EY is an outlier, seemingly unaffected by the scandal. EY donated $180,172 in 2023-24, which was slightly \ndown on the $227,853 it donated the previous year.Page 3 of 3\nSome home truths for Fortescue\nAll up, donations to the major parties from the big four in 2023-24 were down more than 73 per cent, which was a \nbit of a blow to the coffers of the major parties.\nAnother oddity stands out among the financial services sector, after banking major ANZ pulled its donations to the \nmajor parties. The bank kicked in $90,000 to the major parties in 2022-23 but made only a single donation of $5500 \nthis current disclosure round.\nCuriously enough, that was to the Nationals, traditionally the party of bashing the banks.\nThe donation appears to have been made just a few months after the bank appeared at a hearing as part of \nNationals senator Matt Canavan's inquiry into branch closures in regional Australia. Purely a coincidence, no doubt.\nOf course, the AEC disclosures don't tell the whole story; notoriously so. Only direct donations are recorded under \nthe giver's name. Left off the disclosures are the names behind the millions of dollars raked in through business \nforums run by the major parties, which have annual membership rates of $30,000 to $120,000 and run dozens and \ndozens of breakfasts, lunches, dinners (and even the odd afternoon tea) to give access to ministers and their \nshadow counterparts for those able and prepared to pay. Margin Call would be shocked if the big four (banks or \naccounting firms) weren't booking in for the odd spot of lunch with a minister or three during the year, but you won't \nknow it from the AEC disclosure list.\nLoad-Date: February 4, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 15\nLength: 567 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue's billionaire chairman Andrew Forrest blasted his executives about their plans to acquire a coal-to-\nhydrogen project, describing it as \"the most stupid\" deal he had seen in a long time in private messages that have \ncome to light through litigation in the United States.\nIn 2022, Fortescue worked with Kid Shelleen, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' flagship investment vehicle, on a joint \nbid for gas-fired power stations in Texas and coal plants in Ohio and West Virginia. The companies wanted to \nconvert the plans to produce clean-burning hydrogen fuel. The relationship soured late in the year, with Fortescue \nlodging an unsuccessful unilateral takeover bid for the assets, refusing to pay due diligence costs accrued by Kid \nShelleen and its advisors.\nMr Tudor Jones' company is now suing Fortescue for $US6.25 million ($9.95 million) compensation. Fortescue, \nwhich has dramatically scaled back its intentions to become a hydrogen giant, has been forced to hand over \ninternal documents, emails and messages during the litigation process.\nAmong those messages is a July 2022 missive from Dr Forrest to Fortescue executives in which he describes the \nplans to buy the assets in Ohio and West Virginia as \"at least the most stupid deal I have seen for a long while.\"\nThe bid with Kid Shelleen had been devised and led by Fortescue's then-chief commercial officer David Hunt, and \nthe then-president of Fortescue's North American clean energy unit, Paul Browning. In another message sent on \nWhatsApp, Dr Forrest said the proposal \"in itself makes me wonder deeply about the commercial nous of Paul \nBrowning\".\nThe comments were made near the peak of Fortescue's interest in green hydrogen, when the company was \npromising to produce 15 million tonnes of the commodity by 2030. Fortescue has since acknowledged it will not \nachieve that goal given the slow adoption of hydrogen around the world, but continues to develop a hydrogen \nproject in Arizona and much smaller trial-scale hydrogen projects in Western Australia and Queensland. Kid \nShelleen told the court that Fortescue's attitude towards the bid appeared to change around July 2022, the same \nmonth as Dr Forrest's messages.\nPage 2 of 2\nForrest blasts executives over 'most stupid' deal\nMr Browning and Mr Hunt exited Fortescue in August 2022.\nKid Shelleen claims it was told by Mr Hunt in late August that Fortescue would make a solo bid for the assets, \nrather than continue with the joint bid.\nKid Shelleen claims that Mr Hunt offered to pay for the due diligence costs. Fortescue disputes that such a verbal \npromise was made, and says it would not be legally binding even if it were made.\nMr Browning was replaced as Fortescue's top clean energy executive in North America by former AGL Energy \nchief executive Andy Vesey, who also gave testimony to the court shortly before Christmas.\nMost of Mr Vesey's testimony is inaccessible to the public. However, a snippet made available by the Connecticut \ncourt shows Mr Vesey carried a second phone with him in case he lost his primary device.\nFortescue has declined to submit messages from that second phone to the court, arguing instead that they are \nidentical to those on his primary device.\nKid Shelleen has disputed that claim, saying that while messages may be mirrored, the two phones have different \nWhatsApp messaging accounts.\nKid Shelleen has asked for Dr Forrest and Fortescue energy boss Mark Hutchinson to also give testimony, \nalthough this has not yet occurred.\nLoad-Date: February 9, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 819 words\nByline: Michael Bachelard\nHighlight: The iron ore giant says the public is being misled into believing that low-quality carbon offset schemes \nwill lead to net zero, despite evidence that only reducing fossil fuels will work.\nBody\nAustralians are being misled into believing that low-quality carbon offset schemes will lead to a net zero future, \ndespite evidence that only reducing fossil fuels will work, iron ore mining giant Fortescue says.\nThe federal government's Safeguard Mechanism forces companies to either begin decarbonising or buy carbon \noffsets to meet legislated net zero goals.\nLink to Image\nTrevor Collens\nBut Fortescue's chief climate scientist, Dr Shanta Barley, said in a speech in Canberra on Wednesday that many of \nthe offsets they were forced to buy were \"dodgy\", which had led to a lack of trust in the system. Their use in the \nSafeguard Mechanism must be capped, she said.\nBarley's comments, the strongest ones yet from Fortescue on carbon offsets and climate change, come as serious \nquestions are being raised by scientists about whether schemes such as Human Induced Regeneration (HIR) \nachieve any real carbon reduction in the atmosphere.\nThey also coincide with the publication of two major studies that say a record-hot 2024 suggests the globe has \nalready exceeded the 1.5 degree temperature increase limit laid out in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. \nMeanwhile, Australia's emissions continue to rise.\nFortescue has a policy of reaching \"real zero\" by building renewable energy and battery and storage schemes to \npower its multi-billion dollar Pilbara iron ore operations.\nBarley told the Climate Integrity summit, organised by the Australia Institute, that \"multiple, independent and peer-\nreviewed lines of evidence have now come to the same conclusion\" about carbon sequestration schemes in \nAustralia and around the world.\nPage 2 of 3\nAustralians are being misled by 'dodgy' offsets, say Fortescue\n\"Many offset projects are now known to be low quality and failing to deliver the emissions reductions they promised \n... We are, in other words, largely being duped.\"\nUnder the Safeguard Mechanism, companies that cannot meet legislated emissions reduction targets - by actually \nreducing their emissions or shutting down - are legally required to buy Australian offsets, including those generated \nby farmers allegedly growing forests on Australia's dry rangeland farms.\nThese HIR credits now make up about a third of the total Australian Carbon Credit Units available on the market \nand will grow to be around half in future years.\nAs a result of the Safeguard Mechanism policy, big mining companies such as Fortescue are required to spend \nmillions of dollars a year buying these offsets. Fortescue says this is a bridging issue until it can reach \"real zero\" in \n2030.\nBarley hinted in her speech that this might, in future, prompt legal action, as companies could explore the legal \nimplications of being required to buy products that \"aren't doing what they say on the tin\".\nA community group recently launched legal action in the Federal Court, alleging misleading and deceptive conduct \nagainst Energy Australia over its claim its power - generated largely by coal and gas - was carbon-neutral because \nit had bought offsets on the voluntary market.\nNo company has yet sued over the offsets they are forced to buy on the compulsory or \"compliance\" market.\nIn her speech, Barley drew particular attention to HIR offsets - including questions raised in a series of articles in \nthis masthead over recent days. She also said there were integrity concerns over other government-approved offset \nmethods, including landfill gas, carbon capture and storage and herd management.\nBarley said the answer was for the government to cap the number of offsets that companies could use in pursuit of \nreducing emissions. In Australia, there is no cap on the use of offsets, but in other territories' carbon reduction \nschemes, including in California and the European Union, the use of offsets is limited.\n\"If 90 per cent of our decarbonisation had to be real, a few dodgy offsets wouldn't matter. We would laugh them off,\" \nBarley said. \"The problem lies in the fact that there are currently no limits to using them.\"\nIn answer to questions from this masthead recently, a spokesperson for Environment Minister Chris Bowen said \ncarbon credits such as those derived from HIR - one-third of the total in Australia - were \"a critical part of the 'net' in \nnet zero\".\nAccording to Barley, with a profit of $9 billion per year, Fortescue could easily afford a few million for offsets to \nallow it to claim it has decarbonised.\n\"At the end of the day, the financial impost placed by offsets on big companies is water off a duck's back. To force \ncompanies to do the right thing, many countries have had to set strict limits on offset use. Australia should consider \ndoing the same.\"\nFortescue this week organised an open letter, signed by multiple companies, which now includes $49 billion \ntechnology company Canva, calling for \"real zero\" policy that would \"mandate clear phase-out timelines for fossil \nfuel use\".\nThe Morning Edition newsletter is our guide to the day's most important and interesting stories, analysis \nand insights.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: OPINION; Letters; Pg. 35\nLength: 676 words\nByline: Michael Woodley\nBody\nFor the past 15 years, my community in the resource-rich Pilbara region has been engaged in a David and Goliath \nbattle against Fortescue, which has mined without our free, prior and informed consent and without a native title \nland use agreement, despite having our rights affirmed by the High Court of Australia.\nWe are often asked why the Yindjibarndi are so determined to battle a mining giant that can engage in limitless \nlawfare against Aboriginal people with meagre resources.\nWe fight because we owe it to our ancestors and future generations to ensure that Yindjibarndi people's long, hard \njourney to prove our legal rights under the Native Title Act is seen and respected, and because the law must lead to \nconsequences if a proponent chooses to disrespect First Australians.\nWe are proud of what we have accomplished over the past 10 years without having an agreement with Fortescue. \nAny visitor to the bustling mining town of Karratha can't help but notice the dozens of vehicles owned by our \ncontracting business, Yurra. This business, founded in 2013, has grown to employ more than 430 people working in \ndiversified sectors, including contracts with Rio Tinto, Woodside and the City of Karratha. We have also established \ncultural organisations that promote and preserve our traditions for the benefit of our young and to share with non-\nIndigenous Australians.\nThe Yindjibarndi have achieved all this despite the absence of a native title agreement with Fortescue for its \nSolomon Hub mine - which operates on our land and has generated more than $80 billion in revenue since 2013.\nOur main source of income is a rail tariff paid by Rio Tinto from a modernised agreement signed in 2022. This is the \nresult of a positive relationship with Rio Tinto Iron Ore on an Indigenous Land Use Agreement that was executed in \ngood faith.\nOur renewable energy business, Yindjibarndi Energy Corporation, has breathtaking plans to drive the \ndecarbonisation of the Pilbara through projects that could generate up to three gigawatts of green energy in coming \ndecades. YEC's projects are some of the most advanced Indigenous-led developments in Australia.\nPage 2 of 2\nWhy we're still fighting Goliath Talking point\nYEC is the result of a joint venture with the global green energy player ACEN, and our agreement allows the \nYindjibarndi people to take an equity share of up to 50 per cent in projects. Our people have already benefited \ndirectly by taking part in heritage and environmental surveys that are required for all government approvals.\nWe also want to invest in our majority-owned Yindjibarndi Water, which is looking at alternative groundwater \nsupplies to the Millstream aquifer, water treatment initiatives for YEC and support for carbon farming and \nagricultural pursuits.\nWith fair compensation for the impact of mining on our Ngurra (country), the Yindjibarndi people will be in a strong \nposition to achieve even greater results in the decades to come.\nNext week, the Federal Court will hear final submissions in a case that the Yindjibarndi people initiated. This flowed \non from our 2020 win in the High Court, which affirmed our exclusive native title possession over the land where \nSolomon Hub operates.\nThe respondents in this case, the state of Western Australia and Fortescue, both agree that we are entitled to \ncompensation, though we disagree on how much.\nAt the heart of the case is whether the courts should take a real-world view and award compensation based on the \ntypes of agreements that fair-minded corporations have reached with traditional owners. We certainly think this \nshould be the case.\nEconomic compensation based on this approach, plus reparations for the damage to heritage, spiritual values, \nenvironment and social disruption, are before the courts and perhaps that will set the bar on native title agreements. \nThis is why our legal team believes our Federal Court case is arguably the most significant litigation brought by an \nIndigenous community since Eddie Mabo's case in 1993.\nMichael Woodley is the CEO of the Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation, the plaintiff in the Federal Court \ncase.\nLoad-Date: February 15, 2025\nEnd of Document",

However, many roads remain closed and remote \ncommunities and cattle stations have been hard hit by flooding.\nRio was able to get iron ore carriers back into the ports of Cape Lambert and Dampier late on Saturday and there \nare no indications of damage to its 2000km-long rail network.\nHowever, the latest disruption means Rio's port operations have been out of action for almost two weeks since late \nJanuary.\nRio shipped 328.6 million -tonnes of iron ore from its Pilbara ports in 2024, in line with production guidance, which \nremains unchanged for 2025 despite its recent setbacks.\nCyclone Zelia crossed the Pilbara coast northeast of Port Hedland on Friday and weakened into a tropical low that \ndumped heavy rain on the minerals-rich but sparsely populated Pilbara region.\nThe cyclone's eventual path took it away from a direct hit on Port Hedland or Rio's ports, and also spared the LNG \nindustry from major damage.\nBHP said it mines, rail and infrastructure at Port Hedland had fared better than expected as it hunkered down for \nCyclone Zelia.\n\"The experience of our teams in managing cyclones in the Pilbara meant we were well prepared,\" a spokesperson \nsaid. \"Our teams are now progressively returning to site, with recovery and ramp-up operations underway.\" \nFortescue said all non-essential travel to its mines remained suspended and that all its workers on the ground were \nsafe.\nPage 2 of 2\nPilbara miners dodge worst of cyclone\n\"While some of our operations have experienced temporary disruptions, we are working to resume normal activities \nas quickly and safely as possible,\" a Fortescue spokesperson said.\nBHP is due to hand down its first half results on Tuesday, followed by Rio's full-year results on Wednesday and \nFortescue's first- half numbers on Thursday.\nLithium miner Pilbara Minerals, which reports first-half results on Thursday, appears to have dodged a bullet after \nearly modelling showed Cyclone Zelia tracking straight at its Pilgangoora mine. \"Initial assessments indicate no \nmaterial damage to our operation, and our on-site team continue to conduct infrastructure checks,\" a spokesman \nsaid.\nPilbara Minerals has offered support to surrounding communities, including Strelley and Warralong, caught up in \nflooding and other fallout from the cyclone.\nMineral Resources shut down operations at it Wodgina lithium mine and flew non-essential staff to Perth in advance \nof the cyclone.\nIt said initial assessments indicated minimal impact at Wodgina with workers returning to site.\nCyclone Zelia hit the Pilbara with Rio still carrying out repair work in the wake of Cyclone Sean, which flooded key \nparts of its operations in January and also hit BHP, Fortescue and MinRes.\nEven before the latest storm, Rio admitted first-quarter shipments would be affected by the impact of Cyclone Sean, \nand subsequent closures from Cyclone Taliah and Cyclone Vince.\nThe most northern of Rio's 17 mines in the Pilbara, including Gudai-Darri, appear to have copped the brunt of the \nlatest downpour and may still have water sitting in the bottom of pits.\nThe mines would normally be better prepared to cope with cyclone disruption but they were soaked by heavy \nrainfall in the December quarter, forcing Rio to draw down on stockpiles. Rio's export terminal at East Intercourse \nIsland remains out of action after flooding caused by Cyclone Sean, which dumped a record 274mm of rain on parts \nof the Pilbara in a 24-hour period. The operations are scheduled to come back online this week.\nLoad-Date: February 16, 2025\nEnd of Document",

On Monday the Greens \nsenator called for a \"full and frank inquiry\" into Creative Australia's decision to withdraw its selection of Khaled \nSabsabi as Australia's artist representative to the Venice Biennale 2026.\nMany of you will never have heard of Sabsabi, or the Venice Biennale, or Creative Australia, an agency rat-holed in \nthe nether reaches of government and armed with wheelbarrows of taxpayer slush. Yes, some of you might even \nhave thrown your iPads across the room at the temerity of our suggestion that a Greens senator might actually be \nright about something. Because they never are.\nBut it's true, there really should be an inquiry into Sabsabi's humiliating board retraction and it should also probe the \nideological capture that's hijacked decision-making at Creative Australia.\nThe agency's CEO, Adrian Collette, will appear before a Senate Estimates hearing next week to talk more about \nthat.\nIn the meantime, the fallout from this affair keeps expanding. Staff have walked out of Creative Australia offices. \nArtists have huffed and torn their smocks and signed petitions in protest (which never, ever happens). Lindy Lee \nresigned from the Creative Australia board despite reiterating her support for Sabsabi to be nixxed in her exit letter - \na decision in which she participated, after all.\nAnd then there's Simon Mordant, co-chairman of Luminis Partners, who resigned as a biennale ambassador and \ntold The Guardian that he'd pulled a \"significant\" funding pledge for the project. We hear it was $40,000, roughly \nwhat Simon spends on Cohiba's and Brunello each month at his villa in Italy. His business partner Ron Malek spent \nthe weekend shaking his head in embarrassment at Mordant's unalloyed sanctimony.\n\"It's outrageous,\" Mordant wrote of the Sabsabi decision on Instagram. \"I have resigned as an Ambassador to the \nnow cancelled project and withdrawn my financial support - this situation is unacceptable. Maybe the Pavilion \nshould remain empty in solidarity with Khaled. A very dark day for Australia and the Arts.\" Mordant, who is Jewish, \nhasn't posted any messages of solidarity for Jewish artists who've been doxxed, abandoned and relentlessly \nPage 2 of 3\nFallout over CA decision continues\nexcluded since the October 7 massacres. Not a word from Mordant until Monday when he suddenly sought to \nclarify his support for Sabsabi - an artist who boycotted the 2022 Sydney Festival because the organisers received \n$20,000 of Israeli funding to stage an Israeli choreography display - and posted a whimpering statement saying he \nwould never support an artist \"that glorifies terrorism, racism or antisemitism\".\n\"I think everybody has to be very careful about the insidious rise of racism and anti-Semitism which has become \nparticularly prevalent in Australia,\" Mordant said. Well Simon, when even Sophie McNeill is lavishing you with \npraise and thanking you for your \"leadership\", as she did online, it might be time for a walk through the hall of \nmirrors.\nMikala Tai was the other prominent figure to walk out of Creative Australia \"in support of Sabsabi and curator \nMichael Dagostino\", as she wrote on Instagram.\nSabsabi is friendly with Tai. When Creative Australia announced his selection as the Venice Biennale \nrepresentative, Tai posted a video of them celebrating.\nJoining them in that video was Creative Australia program manager Tahmina Maskinyar, who resigned alongside \nTai, and whose posts online have included calls for the eradication of Israel (\"From the river to the sea ...\") and \n\"intifada until victory\", which Liberal senator Sarah Henderson called \"grossly offensive anti-Semitic content\".\nCreative Australia said these sentiments didn't breach the agency's code of conduct.\nNothing wrong with a bit of dancing, and nothing wrong with members of Sabsabi's artist group, Eleven Collective, \nbeing friendly with Tai. It is a fact, however, that some of these people have sat on Creative Australia panels that \nadjudicated the provision of taxpayer-funded grants, or been grant recipients themselves.\nLike Shireen Taweel, who we mentioned last week - she's affiliated with Tai and received Creative Australia grants \nof $45,200 in 2023 and $32,500 in 2022; Anna Louise Richardson, the wife of artist Abdul-Rahman Abdullah, a \npanel assessor, received $31,729 in March 2021; Amrita Hepi received $35,715 in 2023; and Sabsabi was awarded \nthree grants of $8500, $5000 and $7680 between March 2022 and October 2023 (he also received much larger \ngrants in 2018, 2019 and 2020, prior to Tai taking up work at Creative Australia).\nWe're not suggesting any of this is evidence of a conflict, nor that Tai had any involvement in furnishing these \ngrants; plus, within Australia's shallow artist pool, decision-making will inevitably involve people who wind up \nknowing each other.\nBut wrinkles remain. In the video of Sabsabi dancing, Abdullah left behind a comment that drew our attention: \"I \nlove everything about today's announcement. Thank you MT!!!!\" It would be telling to discover what role, if any, Tai \nmight have played in the backing of Sabsabi during discussions of the Biennale. One for next week's senate \nestimates hearing to tease out.\nOngoing process It's been six months since Andrew Forrest's Fortescue bowed to the inevitable and wound back \nthe exponential growth of its green energy hiring, sacking as many as 700 staff in the process. But Margin Call \nhears Fortescue staff have been attending a fresh round of leaving parties, as the company again hacks away at \nits management ranks.\nThe latest to go is general manager of community and government engagement, Sasha Pendal - a well known \nfigure in Perth business circles, not least for her role on the board of the hapless Fremantle Dockers football club.\nPendal's departure is said to be amicable, but appears part of another round of redundancies among senior \nmanagers.\nUnder the turmoil caused by Fortescue's pivot to green energy, the company somehow managed to insert an \nentire new level of management - the number of general managers at Fortescue blew out from 30-odd a few years \nago to as many as 130 in 2024.Page 3 of 3\nFallout over CA decision continues\nThe massive cull last year, when Fortescue announced it would lay off 700 staff, was supposed to reduce that total \nto around 40. The process is clearly still ongoing, with a few more departing in recent months, Pendal among them. \n(Not that all of last year's round of 700 came from Fortescue Energy, of course, as the company has been at pains \nto tell anyone that dares suggest it.) Also departing Fortescue this year is the former commercial manager for \nFortescue's hydrogen systems unit, Samantha Buchanan, who took a promotion to become a Shell Australia vice-\npresident in January.\nFortescue will deliver its first-half financial results on Thursday, and the company is (again) on a promise to update \nshareholders on the progress of its energy projects - primarily its Holmaneset green ammonia project in Norway \nand the Pecem green hydrogen development in Brazil.\nFair to say the going has been getting tougher in Europe, where Fortescue's plans are facing growing public \nopposition - not least because Holmaneset will draw down about 2 per cent of the total power produced in the \ncountry, at a promise of only a small number of jobs.\nAnd as for Fortescue's plans in the US, where it wants to build a hydrogen production plant to fuel trucks? That, \nlike every other renewable energy project in the country, is now prisoner to the new priorities of Donald Trump's \n\"drill, baby drill\" administration.\nBut also in need of a market update is the progress of Forrest's green fundraising arm, Fortescue Capital, which, \nsince its 2023 launch under the guidance of Robert Tichio, has built up a leadership group of no less than eight \nmanaging directors - all lured away from well-paid gigs at investment banks.\nFortescue Capital was launched with a mandate to attract external investment into the company's green energy \narm.\nOnly Fortescue's board really knows what the gang has been up to since, but Margin Call's quick math suggests \nFortescue is currently paying 2.7 managing directors for each green energy project that it still hasn't decided to \nbuild.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL The big changes continue at Andrew Forrest's Fortescue\nLoad-Date: February 17, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 17\nLength: 485 words\nByline: Elouise Fowler\nBody\nFortescue and the state of Western Australia have been hit with a $1.8 billion native title claim in an extraordinary \nescalation of a long-running battle over the Yindjibarndi lands on which the company built its Solomon iron ore \nmining hub.\nThe miner is expected to report a $2.6 billion half-year profit today, but now must factor in the risk of a dramatically \nhigher than expected claim by the Yindjibarndi people.\nThe Yindjibarndi people have sued Fortescue and the state to compensate for lost economic benefits and cultural \nand spiritual damage caused by the Solomon project, three-quarters of which sits in Yindjibarndi land that also \ntakes in the gorges and rock pools of Millstream Chichester National Park. The Federal Court will decide whether \nWA or Fortescue, which has mined the Yindjibarndi land for iron ore without permission nor agreement with the \nYindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation for 10 years, will pay the compensation bill.\nThe Yindjibarndi were found to be native titleholders of the land in 2017.\nWestern Australia is a co-defendant alongside Fortescue in the lawsuit, filed by the Yindjibarndi in March 2023, \nbecause it issued Fortescue's mining licence and collects royalties from its iron ore shipments. Under the state's \nmining code, the government has the authority to compel Fortescue to cover any compensation claims. However, \nFortescue will likely challenge this.\nCourt documents released yesterday show the compensation claim, initially estimated at around $1 billion, has \nnearly doubled to $1.8 billion.\nThe lion's share of the bill is linked to the mine destroying culture through loss of connection to the land. For this the \ngroup, led by Michael Woodley, is claiming compensation of $1.1 billion. \"On the assumption that there are 1000 \npeople in the Yindjibarndi community, this amount would compensate each Yindjibarndi person $1 million,\" \naccording to the court filing.\nEconomic loss - due to a failure to receive royalties - is claimed to be $678 million.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue faces $1.8b native title compensation claim\nAnother of the traditional owners' claims for compensation, previously untested under Australian law, is around \nsocial disharmony caused by Fortescue opting to throw its support behind a breakaway group, Wirlu-murra \nYindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation, which has separately struck deals with the miner. The court filing points to \n$880,000 in receipts paid by Fortescue to the breakaway group.\nTo compensate for this, the Yindjibarndi are asking for $112 million.\nDuring the hearings, Fortescue denied it stoked community tension and rejects claims it is liable for \"cultural loss\" \nin relation to community division. The Yindjibarndi are also seeking recompense of $34 million for specific \ndestruction of sites that formed a core spiritual connection to the land.\nFortescue says it recognises the group's right to compensation, but disputes the amount. Fortescue will submit its \nwritten closing arguments by the end of the month.\nLoad-Date: February 22, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 25\nLength: 650 words\nByline: Alex Gluyas\nBody\nInvestors are preparing for a new era of slumping profits and hefty dividend cuts by the world's largest miners as \niron ore markets brace for a flood of supply to trigger a collapse in prices.\nFortescue and Rio Tinto became the latest mining giants yesterday to reveal the full effect from China's property \ncrisis, which caused iron ore prices to plunge nearly 30 per cent last year, forcing boards to slash shareholder \npayouts.\nRio will pay its lowest dividend in seven years while Fortescue sliced its payout by more than 50 per cent after its \nfirst-half profit slid 53 per cent.\nEarlier in the week BHP said it would pay its lowest interim dividend in eights years after a 23 per cent profit slump.\nThe results triggered a sell-off in the sharemarket with Fortescue diving 6.2 per cent to $18, Rio Tinto 1.5 per cent \nto $120.09 and BHP 2 per cent to $40.15. That extended last year's rout which saw the S&P/ASX 200 Resources \nIndex plunging nearly 20 per cent.\nFund managers are expecting further pain for the heavyweight mining sector, which could accelerate the local \nsharemarket's retreat this week from record levels.\n\"We're not even close to the end of these sorts of results,\" warned Perennial fund manager and resources analyst \nSam Berridge.\n\"The slump in iron ore prices over the past 12 months is largely a result of weak demand from China ... we haven't \neven had a meaningful increase in supply yet.\"\nBerridge, who runs Perennial's Natural Resources Fund, believes iron ore prices will average $US80 a tonne next \nyear - compared with current levels of around $US106 a tonne in Singapore - and is happy to not own any iron ore \nminers despite analysts declaring they are too cheap to ignore.\nPage 2 of 2\nInvestors dump big miners as iron ore heads for a glut Resources\nWestpac is even more bearish, warning that prices could collapse to $US70 a tonne this year as Rio Tinto's \nmassive Simandou project in Guinea adds a fresh wave of supply to the physical market.\n\"There's high-cost production still online today which needs to get bumped off the end of the cost curve by that \nincoming supply from Guinea,\" added Berridge. \"That suggests prices are going to tick down further.\"\nSupply disruptions at Australia's biggest iron ore port caused by Tropical Cyclone Zelia have helped keep prices \nwell north of $US100 a tonne.\n\"It's clear that exports from Australia will definitely have been impacted at the same time as heavy rainfall in Brazil \nhas added to concerns about supply,\" said Westpac head of commodity strategy Robert Rennie.\nThat has coincided with hopes that Beijing will announce further stimulus at next month's Two Sessions - an annual \nmeeting of China's top legislative and advisory bodies - which Rennie believes will keep iron ore trading in the \n$US105 to $US110 range before crashing later this year.\nIndeed, BHP has noted that supply is already outpacing demand - it expects the combined annual shipments from \nleading producers to have hit record levels in 2024, which has only added to the huge stockpiles sitting at Chinese \nports.\nEven so, BHP is studying options to raise its Australian iron ore output higher still in the long term and Fortescue is \nramping up production at its Iron Bridge project. Rio Tinto said it was on track to deliver first production at Simandou \nlater this year.\n\"Supply growth from major producers is anticipated to continue in the coming years,\" Rio Tinto warned. \"New iron \nore projects in Africa and potentially some mine restarts are expected to bring further supply pressures from 2026.\"\nHowever, BHP chief executive Mike Henry said he was seeing \"early signs of recovery\" in the Chinese economy. \nIndeed, data this week showed the decline in new home sales ease for a fifth month in January, suggesting values \nwere beginning to stabilise.\nWhile the figures offer a glimmer of hope for the beleaguered property sector, a pick-up in sales and new \nconstruction will be needed to support demand for the steel-making ingredient, according to ANZ.\nLoad-Date: February 23, 2025\nEnd of Document",

There's uncertainty globally for them too and until we have a project \nwhich is economically viable, we won't take those to the board.\" Fortescue announced last July that it was \nshedding 700 jobs and pulling back on green hydrogen. The company has never disclosed how many of the job \nlosses were in green energy and Mr Hutchinson again refused to discuss staff numbers when questioned on the \nissue on Thursday.\nMr Hutchinson said the Trump administration was instructing federal agencies to pause grant payments under the \nInflation Reduction Act and that had implications for its $US550m Arizona project.\n\"While we do remain confident in the long-term viability of green energy, we must be realistic about the current \nchallenges the industry faces. Right now the world is in an uncertain place,\" he said.\n\"This does include looking at timelines on the FID (final investment decision) projects we have previously \nannounced. These changes are what happens when you have an unstable government policy which creates \nuncertainty for investors.\" The Fortescue share price plunged more than 6.2 per cent to $18.24 on Thursday on the \nback of weaker than expected results and dividends.\nPage 2 of 2\nFortescue raises doubts over ambitious green energy projects\nAlthough the interim dividend of 50c is down from $1.08 last year and lower than forecasts, Andrew and Nicola \nForrest will still share in about $558.4m.\nThe separated couple control about 36.7 per cent of Fortescue stock. The dividend dip came as Fortescue \nforeshadowed more delays to the $US3.9bn Iron Bridge mine in the Pilbara reaching nameplate capacity of 22 \nmillion tonnes a year.\nIron Bridge had been scheduled to hit that milestone in September, but Fortescue said that timetable was under \nreview as it looked to make changes to the processing plant.\nIt is now almost two years since Dr Forrest, Fortescue's executive chairman, declared first production at Iron \nBridge and described it as the biggest relief of his career.\nPerth-headquartered Fortescue's first half profit fell 53 per cent to $US1.55bn, below consensus estimates of a \n$US1.8bn. Revenue fell 20 per cent to $US7.64bn and underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and \namortisation tumbled from $5.9bn to $3.64bn. Fortescue shipped a company record of 97.1 million tonnes of iron \nore in the first half, but the average price for its hematite product fell 21 per cent year-on-year to $US85 a tonne and \nproduction costs increased slightly.\nThe company maintained full-year shipment guidance of 190-200 million tonnes, including 5-9 million tonnes from \nIron Bridge, despite recent cyclone activity in the Pilbara that has also hit bigger rivals BHP and Rio Tinto.\nFortescue metals chief executive Dino Otranto backed Iron Bridge to eventually hit its straps after various setbacks \nin the past two years, including WorkSafe issuing improvement notices related to the management of dust with high \nlevels of crystalline -silica. Analysts at Jarden highlighted possible \"dividend stream pressures\", including costs \naround replacement of heavy mining equipment, decarbonisation and an increasing need to step up resource and \nreserve replacement drilling against the backdrop of the weak outlook on iron ore prices. Guidance for FY25 energy \ncapital expenditure was revised to $US400m (previously $US500m) reflecting reduced spend.\nLoad-Date: February 20, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 17\nLength: 803 words\nByline: Mark Wembridge\nBody\nFortescue is considering pausing almost $1 billion of approved hydrogen projects in Australia and the United \nStates as it assesses the second Donald Trump administration's attitude to clean energy.\nThe mining group, controlled by Andrew Forrest, cut its full-year capital expenditure forecast by one-fifth to $US400 \nmillion ($630 million) at its energy division, reflecting reduced spending on green fuel projects and their slow \nadoption.\nFortescue warned that Trump's return as US president has called into question the development timeline for its \n$US550 million green hydrogen project in Arizona, after grants promised under the Biden administration had been \nthreatened.\nThe miner is also considering the time frame for its $150 million electrolyser manufacturing facility in the \nQueensland city of Gladstone.\n\"For the Arizona project, the Trump administration has been a flurry of executive action around some sections of \nthe [Inflation Reduction Act] from the grants that come into question and including hydrogen production tax credits,\" \nsaid Fortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson.\n\"Until we have a much clearer view on that, we are being quite cautious about what we're doing. We've spent about \none-fifth of the capex on Arizona, so we're being very cautious, very disciplined about the money we spend. We're \nwaiting on the outcome of several elections globally.\"\nHe said Fortescue remained \"fully committed to hydrogen\", and that more clarity on the projects would be \nannounced at the financial year-end.\nLast July, Fortescue cut 700 jobs and slowed its push into green hydrogen and ammonia by pulling back from its \ncomplex at Gibson Island in Queensland. The miner declined to confirm how many of those job cuts were specific \nto its energy division.\nPage 2 of 2\nHydrogen rethink for Fortescue\nFortescue hopes its Arizona Hydrogen plant, scheduled to begin production in 2026, will spur the decarbonisation \nof heavy transport in southwestern US. Low-carbon \"green\" hydrogen is made by using renewable energy to split \nwater into its constituent parts.\nHowever, Fortescue and rival Woodside Energy have had their commitment to US hydrogen projects questioned \nafter new rules that made it tougher to access government tax credits.\nHutchinson also poured cold water on the outlook for Fortescue's green ammonia projects in Norway and Brazil, \nwhich may not be progressed unless customers are found. \"We're not going to bring [the projects] to the board until \nwe've locked in the buyers,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, South Australia has scrapped its plans to build a green hydrogen plant at Whyalla, marking a blow to \nthe Albanese government's vision for the energy source.\nYesterday's hydrogen setback came as Fortescue's interim profit fell by more than half, prompting the miner to \nslash its dividend. Its shares, which have lost more than one-third of their value over the past 12 months, ended \n6.22 per cent lower at $18.24.\nThe Perth-based Fortescue increased iron ore production to a record high during the December half, shipping 97.1 \nmillion tonnes, as commodity prices sagged.\nThe wobbling Chinese property sector has weighed on prices of the key steel-making ingredient, forcing Australian \niron ore miners to increase production to underpin revenues.\nFortescue posted net profit after tax of $US1.55 billion - less than half the $US3.3 billion reported a year ago and \n12 per cent lower than what analysts expected. Revenue during the final six months of 2024 was down by one-fifth \nat $US7.6 billion.\nInvestors will receive less than half the $1.08 payout they pocketed a year ago. Fortescue proposes to pay a fully \nfranked interim dividend of 50\u00a2 a share. The payout ratio of 65 per cent of Fortescue's net profit was unchanged.\nThe dividend is worth about $560 million to Andrew and Nicola Forrest, who separated in 2023 and collectively \ncontrol 36.7 per cent of the miner.\nFortescue reported higher costs at its troubled $US3.9 billion Iron Bridge project, which the miner warned was \nunlikely to reach its production capacity of 22 million tonnes by its September deadline. Guidance for Fortescue's \nfull-year iron ore shipments remained unchanged, despite disruptions from cyclones in the Pilbara region.\nJarden analyst Jon Bishop said the results undershot consensus expectations, and warned that the falling iron ore \nprice could place future dividends under pressure.\nThe miner did not offer an update on a native title claim that was filed against it and the state of Western Australia. \nThe claim has almost doubled to $1.8 billion.\nThe Yindjibarndi people have sued Fortescue and the state of WA to compensate for lost economic benefits and \ncultural and spiritual damage caused by its Solomon project in the Pilbara.\nFortescue mining boss Dino Otranto declined to discuss the claim, but said the miner had \"never shied away from \nthe right compensation outcome\".\nLoad-Date: February 23, 2025\nEnd of Document",

The case \nagainst the trio is still grinding its way through the Federal Court.\nNow we hear of an even bigger billionaire, Atlassian's Mike Cannon-Brookes, who's suing the absolute pants off of \na once-trusted family office executive, Kevin Chiu, claiming corporate skulduggery has been afoot.\nChiu worked for years alongside Cannon-Brookes and his ex-wife Annie but left the business suddenly, and \nrecently, over accusations that he downloaded sensitive documents to a personal storage account.\nWhat documents? We don't know, and Cannon-Brookes' people wouldn't tell us. What we've confirmed is that this \nwas all allegedly uncovered a few weeks ago and everyone then rushed off to the NSW Supreme Court to climb all \nover Chiu and stop the alleged spread of these files. The matter was briefly mentioned on Thursday.\nBut while Chiu may be technically out the door his name is still listed on a raft of corporate documents for Cannon-\nBrookes entities. By that we mean the fashion business - Playdate Studios - run by Annie, and the insect one - \nKangaloon Crickets - which has a defunct website and was supposed to sell bugs dipped in secret herbs and spices \nto very credulous people. Stick to software, dude.\nChiu's name is also still on the papers for the Sun Cable project, for Dunk Island Philanthropy - named after the \nQueensland isle where Annie bought a $24m resort in 2022 - and for Boundless Earth, a not-for-profit that donated \nto the political campaign of former Liberal National Party minister Jack Dempsey. Are charities allowed to do that?\nSo the court's ordered Chiu to hand over his phones and iPads and computers and every username and password \nhe's ever had created to FTI Consulting for forensic analysis. As far as humiliations go, you'd rather be forced to eat \na toenail.\nPage 2 of 3\nAtlassian boss sues employee\nBut bear in mind this is all playing out amid Mike and Annie's ongoing break-up - they split in 2023 - and the carve-\nup of their $23bn in assets, all quietly being nutted out by lawyers on both sides. And it's not exactly all copacetic.\nNot only have the two billionaires split their family office but factions are forming among the staff - Team Mike and \nTeam Annie. Might Chiu be caught in the middle of this? He's not the only senior family office official to leave the \nbillionaire's realm of late. Catherine Manuel is the other major casualty of the marriage split, coming off the board of \nCannon-Brookes Services Pty Ltd in November, and seemingly pushed out by Mike as he cleans house and tests \neveryone's fealty.\nHydrogen hype It's the end of an inevitable decline for would-be hydrogen truck maker Nikola, which filed for \nbankruptcy protection in the US on Wednesday night.\nHardly a surprise, and arguably a bit overdue given founder Trevor Milton got banged-up after being convicted of \nsecurities and wire fraud by a New York City jury four months ago.\nThat was because Nikola's early promotional videos featured - among other lies - a truck the company claimed was \nrunning on hydrogen, but was actually just rolling down a hill.\nNikola actually went on to produce hydrogen-powered trucks - 83 in the September quarter last year. Not nothing, \nbut still not enough to stem losses of around $US200m in three months.\nStill, the hydrogen subsidies on offer from the administration of then US president Joe Biden are likely to disappear \nnow Donald Trump has taken charge, snuffing out Nikola's last hope.\nBut for Australian investors it's also a timely reminder of the rapid retreat of the hydrogen hype championed by \nAndrew Forrest's Fortescue.\nThere's a direct link here. Fortescue bought its hydrogen project in Phoenix, Arizona from Nikola in 2023, and \nFortescue's US energy boss Andrew Vesey was on the Nikola board when the company collapsed this week.\nNo suggestion of any wrongdoing by Vesey. He only joined the Niloka board last year - long after concerns about \nthe company's business practices had been well ventilated.\nIt also extends the run of senior US Fortescue executives that have been in proximity to green energy collapses. \nFortescue Capital boss Robert Tichio was also the chairman of collapsed battery charging company Tritium, and \nkey figure behind the float of collapsed hydrogen vehicle company Hyzon.\nAgain, no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Tichio. Surely it's time that Fortescue conceded its hydrogen foray is \nover?\nDespite edging ever-closer, Fortescue still can't admit it.\nFortescue's half-year results say that two of the four remaining hydrogen projects in its portfolio are being \n\"reconsidered\" - the one it bought from Nikola in the US, and a small-time production centre in Queensland, both \nunder threat from changes in government.\nBut Tichio's Fortescue Capital team is still being paid to raise capital for projects that no longer exist, and \nFortescue Energy boss Mark Hutchinson is still dodging questions about how many of his team remain after last \nyear's cull of 700 Fortescue staff.\nPlus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose, we suppose.\nINSIDE MARGIN CALL Fortescue should call time on its hydrogen hype\nLoad-Date: February 20, 2025Page 3 of 3\nAtlassian boss sues employee\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 27\nLength: 1407 words\nByline: James Thomson and Anthony Macdonald\nBody\nThe big result | There's a little bit of Commonwealth Bank in the strategic shift announced by Telstra yesterday, \nwhich will have the telco prioritise capital investment in its mobile business by pumping another $800 million into the \nlatest hardware and software under a new deal with Ericsson.\nLike CBA, Telstra is a dominant player in the Australian telecom market, and in the December half, it increased its \nmobile handset customers by 2.45 per cent to 14.6 million. But like CBA boss Matt Comyn, Telstra chief Vicki Brady \nwants to hammer home her leadership through investment in technology. The new Ericsson kit will increase the \nspeed, efficiency and reliability of Telstra's 5G network.\nCombining increased investment in the company's profit engine is what investors want to see. But doing this while \nlifting the interim dividend by 5.6 per cent and announcing a $750 million share buyback suggests Brady is handling \nTelstra's eternal juggling act - between customers, shareholders, regulators, staff and the broader community - \npretty well. The stock surged 5.3 per cent, the best jump on reporting day in almost seven years.\nTelstra was arguably the bluest of the cavalcade of blue chips reporting yesterday, including Wesfarmers, \nTransurban, Fortescue and Rio Tinto. Overall, Super Thursday continued the broad theme of reporting season: \nresilient but unspectacular earnings, cautiously optimistic guidance statements and mixed performance on \ndividends - Telstra's capital management clearly pleased the market, but lower commodity prices are weighing on \ncapital returns at Fortescue and Rio.\nThe next question for investors is where Brady will go next. When she was appointed in September 2022, she \ninherited the T25 strategy set out by her predecessor Andy Penn; in the next few months, Brady will get the chance \nto lay out her own big, five-year strategy.\nExpect evolution rather than revolution. And if you think about how much the world of technology has changed in \nthe past five years, Telstra will need to remain agile.\nChart of the day:\nPage 2 of 3\nDominant Telstra's investment strategy lifts investor spirits CLOSING BELL\nWhitehaven Coal\nIt can be easy to overlook Australia's second-biggest export, coal. The big coal miners don't get the attention they \nused to, even though they've printed big profits in recent years.\nPart of that is ESG-related - investing in coal isn't for everyone, particularly thermal coal used in power stations.\nBig thermal coal miner Whitehaven Coal, which owns mines in NSW and Queensland, went in to bat for itself at its \nresults yesterday. It pointed out how much more energy-rich its coal was compared with other Australian miners \nand other parts of the world. If you're going to burn coal - and the world needs to for power - then you may as well \nburn the good stuff.\nSell-side surprise\nTabcorp shares have quietly gained 80 per cent since last September, and rose another 4 per cent yesterday after \nchief executive Gillon McLachlan delivered a result that showed he could swing the axe; earnings came in just \nahead of market expectations, thanks to aggressive cost-cutting McLachlan also unveiled his long-awaited strategic \nrefresh yesterday, but there wasn't exactly a lot of meat on the bones, and UBS analyst Bradley Beckett quite \nrightly put him on the spot by asking which of Tabcorp's assets would be the big profit driver in the next two years.\nMcLachlan hedged his bets, declaring that all the group's assets held promise, with the near-term growth likely to \narise from new omnichannel offerings and \"structural change\" in the retail business, which is likely to materialise in \nthe coming months. The market will wait for more detail, but Tabcorp's share price suggests investors are expecting \nsome corporate action in the not-too-distant future.\nWhat caught our eye\nWesfarmers: You'd be hard-pressed to find a more passionate advocate in Australian business for reform, \nderegulation and productivity growth than Wesfarmers chief executive Rob Scott. But while he continues to push for \nchange at a national level, he's using these same big themes to make the group more efficient and profitable.\nIn its all-conquering Bunnings division, it is pouring investment into technology, rostering and supply chain initiatives \nto reduce costs.\nIn the Kmart Group, the systems and processes of the Kmart and Target chains have been integrated and digitised \nto lower costs. In the chemicals division, work goes on to de-bottleneck the group's nitric acid plant to lift ammonia \nnitrate production. And across the business, Scott is hunting for improvements for what he calls decision forums, so \nWesfarmers can move faster. \"I'd say that's a form of deregulation - we're letting people just get on and do the job,\" \nhe said, before politely deflecting our suggestion that he could become Australia's answer to Elon Musk. Scott's \nwork on productivity improvements was well received by investors and the stock was back near its record levels.\nBut with Wesfarmers trading on an eye-watering multiple of 89 times forward earnings, it's the group's growth \nprospects over the next five years that matter. Scott says the conglomerate's health business, its budding retail \nmedia business and the nascent (and currently loss-making) lithium business can provide the next phase of growth.\nTransurban: CEO Michelle Jablko is trying to turn the notion that Transurban is \"ex-growth\" on its head. Just \nbecause it's 3 years between big road acquisitions, and just because Transurban is under political pressure in its \nthree Australian markets, that doesn't have to mean Transurban's earnings and distributions will stop growing. Her \ntool - and it was laid out neatly in one slide in yesterday's half-yearly result - is population growth.\nShe says the population within 15 minutes of Transurban's Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane roads will increase by \n16 per cent to 17 per cent in the coming decade. If that brings more congestion to roads, and it's not a stretch to \nimagine it will, Transurban should be able to increase traffic by at least that much. Meanwhile, she's on a mission to \ndrive home to customers how much time they save by paying Transurban $6/$7/$8 or more to use the roads.Page 3 of 3\nDominant Telstra's investment strategy lifts investor spirits CLOSING BELL\nJablko's been working this population growth/value angle for 12 months now - it's not step-change growth in the \nway that buying WestConnex/Queensland Motorways was in the past, but can still be solid. The actual half-year \nresult was strong - costs fell 3 per cent versus expectations of a 5 per cent increase.\nFortescue: Australia's third force in iron ore bit the bullet at its new Iron Bridge project in the Pilbara, confirming it \nwold not hit full nameplate capacity production by September. Fortescue Metals boss Dino Otranto told investors \nthe nameplate capacity (22 million tonnes) wasn't under review, just when it would get there. He said the problem \nwas with the air classification circuit and downstream aerobelt conveyor - \"a key part of the process plant\" \ncontaining a dozen separate units.\n\"It has taken a bit longer to get up to where we want,\" he said on the investor call. Fortescue shipped 97.1 million \ntonnes of iron ore in the six months to December - whether it gets to nameplate at Iron Bridge this year or next, it \nwill be OK. However, there was a fair bit of analyst interest in it on the call - this hasn't been an easy project for \nFortescue to get up and running. Fortescue shares sold off heavily (more than 5 per cent), as the result missed \nprofit and EBITDA expectations for the first half. The 50\u00a2 a share dividend was also less than the 54\u00a2 analysts \nexpected.\nMagellan Financial Group: Losing a big-name fund manager is never good for business - Magellan knows that \nbetter than anyone. So watch what happens to its listed infrastructure strategy, which will lose long-time boss \nGerald Slack in July. You'd have to think some money follows him out the door. Is there any sign of it yet?\nAt the half-year results yesterday, Magellan boss Sophia Rahmani told investors that was not the case, although \nher team was aware of the risks and had been talking to clients and consultants to keep them invested. It's \nimportant because the well-regarded Slack and his team have gone from being a nice little money-spinner to an \nimportant contributor to Magellan's bottom line in the past three years. They now account for more than 40 per cent \nof its assets under management - more through the global equities strategy shrinking than their own growth.\nUp next: tomorrow | Guzman y Gomez; Jumbo Interactive; Superloop\nLoad-Date: February 23, 2025\nEnd of Document",

It's just a number that they can afford \nto get their ESG (environment, social and governance) approval under their belt.\n\"Pretty much anybody who has done a compensation deal is paying more than the Federal Court will award (in the \nYindjibarndi case).\nPage 2 of 3\nNative title surprise for WA miners\n\"There is a lot of water to go under this particular bridge, but if the court lands on a figure of $5m to $10m, then a lot \nof people are going to be needing to look very carefully at what they're offering moving forward.\n\"Because it's great to be a nice guy but if you're a director of a company, you've actually got to look after your \nshareholders as well.\" Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation boss Michael Woodley said the government's \nassessment was shameful and hypocritical.\nThe Yindjibarndi allege Fortescue destroyed more than 240 culturally significant sites - including rock shelters \nsimilar to those at the centre of Juukan Gorge debacle involving Rio Tinto - in building and operating the Solomon \nmine. The group's total claim, including factors like economic loss and community division, is $1.8bn.\nMr Woodley said that by devaluing Aboriginal heritage the WA government risked a backlash that could see \ntraditional owner groups withdraw from other negotiations with miners.\nNational Native Title Council president Kado Muir condemned the WA government and accused it of \"low balling\" \nthe deep pain and suffering caused by the destruction of important heritage and spiritual sites.\nThe WA government did not respond to questions from The Australian on the issue, including whether its position in \nthe Yindjibarndi case delegitimised the much larger sums of money it had paid out in striking far-reaching native title \nsettlements in the South West, Mid West and Goldfields regions of WA.\nFortescue and the WA government were left exposed to the Yindjibarndi compensation claim in 2020 when the \nHigh Court denied the Forrest-controlled mining company special leave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings that \nin effect meant a large part of Solomon was built without the permission of the traditional owners.\nThe Federal Court had granted the Yindjibarndi exclusive native title over 2700sq km in the iron ore-rich Pilbara, \nwhich in effect recognises them as private owners of the highest legal standing with a spiritual connection that \nallows them to decide who mines the land.\nMr Woodley, who has been leading the Yindjibarndi battle with Fortescue for about 18 years, said he was appalled \nthe WA government could argue the destruction of hundreds of heritage sites amounted to such a small financial \npenalty in terms of compensation.\n\"This position of the state government takes us back 50 years to that colonial mentality and attitudes that they can \ncome in and take what they want,\" Mr Woodley said.\nFortescue has exported more than $50bn of iron ore from Solomon since 2013 and the mine is expected to \ncontinue operating for decades. The WA government has pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties from \nthe mine.\nFortescue was granted approval to damage or destroy 249 sites across the area under section 18 of WA's \nAboriginal Heritage Act, the same legislation that gave Rio the legal authority to destroy the Juukan Gorge rock \nshelters in 2019.\nArchaeologists have told the court there were five rock-shelter sites within Solomon \"which by virtue of their great \nage and repeated occupation through time are, in our opinion, based on our study, training and experience as \narchaeologists, of national significance\".\nMr Woodley said: \"This is a big area of land that has been cleared for mining. There's been interference with river \nsystems and the environment, not to mention our heritage sites, some dating back 50,000 years, and that's worth \n$5m-$10m? Come on. The state government may as well say in its argument that we don't exist or shouldn't exist.\n\"There are implications on both sides. There is the miner who might think that he's paying too much now that the \nstate government has set a bar this low. Then there are implications for First Nations groups.\" Mr Woodley said \ntraditional owners might question their involvement in discussions and approval processes.Page 3 of 3\nNative title surprise for WA miners\n\"We might even use this as a gathering of First Nations to stand up now for our rights and say we're going to put a \nstop to all mining activities on our land and not partake in any form of approval process,\" he said.\nMr Muir accused the WA government of trying to cover its backside in terms of compensation, despite the royalty \nriches it reaped from mining on land covered by native title.\n\"It is just a poor reflection on their thinking and where they're at,\" he said. \"Low-balling the deep pain and suffering \nof spiritual value is poor form but not unexpected given the atrocious track record of this WA government approval \n(of) wanton section 18 destruction and desecration of sites, compounded by their ridiculous backflip in heritage \nprotection reform.\" The WA government spent five years working on new Aboriginal heritage laws that scrapped \nsection 18 powers to damage heritage sites without consent, but scrapped the legislation just five weeks after it was \nrolled out. Fortescue has argued any compensation due to the Yindjibarndi should be funded by the state because \nit granted the mining tenements covering the traditional lands of the Yindji-barndi. The WA government maintains \nFortescue should pay.\nThe Yindjibarndi rejected a Fortescue's offer of a $4m annual payment over the anticipated life of the Solomon \nproject, worth around $120m at one point in the long-running dispute. It is understood BHP and Rio pay royalties of \nabout 0.5 per cent of mining revenue to traditional owner groups in the Pilbara.\nThe WA government is liable to pay compensation to the Yindjibarndi under the terms of the Native Title Act but \nclaims any liability shifts to Fortescue under a provision in the WA Mining Act. Fortescue has said the relevant \nsection of the Mining Act is unconstitutional. Gilbert + Tobin's Mr McKenna said there were valid reason why \nresource companies would reach agreements with traditional owner groups that took into account more than just \nexposure to compensation claims, including the importance of social licence to operate and a desire to avoid \nlengthy delays.\nLoad-Date: February 23, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 24\nLength: 1041 words\nByline: Cecile Lefort\nBody\nA bet on Fortescue when the iron ore miner was in deep trouble is one of the proudest moments of fund manager \nSean Sequeira's career.\nIt was early 2016 and Fortescue had just posted its earnings result.\n\"Everyone thought it was going bankrupt,\" says the Australian Eagle Asset Management chief investment officer \nand portfolio manager. But Sequeira saw something that many of his peers had missed: strong cash flow and \nconsistent progress in debt reduction. And all that was happening in spite of low iron ore prices, which were \nhovering at about $US39 a tonne.\n\"We thought the risks were overblown, and the opportunity was presenting itself for the potential upside on a world-\nclass asset that the market was overlooking,\" he says.\nIron ore is now trading at $US106 a tonne.\nJust as importantly, Sequeira, then deputy to chief investment officer Albert Hung, also noted the dramatic \nimprovement in Fortescue's so-called C1 unit costs, the primary measure of expenses for an iron ore producer. \nThey had fallen below that of mining giant BHP. For the investment team, this was the development they had been \nlooking for. The fund scooped up the stock at $1.60 a share and the bet paid off.\nSix years later, Fortescue stock climbed to $25. That's when Australian Eagle started to reduce its stake, and \nagain in 2023, arguably too early, as Fortescue's share price hit $29.30 a year later.\nTakeover target Altium was also a big moment in Sequeira's 30-year career. The fund had built a stake of more \nthan 5 per cent in the company, which designs printed circuit boards used in electronics. The investment manager \nfirst bought the stock in 2017 at $11, emboldened by the \"superb\" 10-year track record of Altium's management \nteam. Their new five-year business plan looked just as promising, with ambitious expansion into new markets \nplanned.\nPage 2 of 3\nIt's all about change - the good and the bad; Monday Fundie\nHappily, a bigger player recognised that potential and took Altium out. Japanese semiconductor company Renesas \nElectronics offered $9.1 billion for Altium at $68.50 a share. The stock was delisted last year.\n\"Even in our best scenarios, we didn't come out with that type of price,\" recalls Sequeira.\nAustralian Eagle, which used to be Alleron, is a boutique investment manager focused on large-cap Australian \nequities. Its team of seven oversees $1.1 billion across a long-only fund and a long-short fund, meaning it can bet \non share prices going down.\nThe fund's signature strategy is to identify signs of change in a business - good and bad - and anticipate what this \nmeans for earnings growth or quality.\n\"We want that improvement to be the thing that drives our investment returns and what will affect the company over \nthe next three or five years,\" explains Sequeira. This means Australian Eagle typically holds a stock longer than its \npeers (it has owned hearing implant company Cochlear for more than 20 years). Investments typically start as a \nsmall position - 1 per cent - and build over time.\nLikewise, when things look bad it's time to exit or even short the stock.\nAustralian Eagle will cut its losses and move fast when companies don't meet its expectations. \"We get out \nrelatively quickly because that means we don't know what's going on,\" Sequeira says.\nThe long-only strategy has a 20-year track record and returned 12 per cent before fees since inception, compared \nwith the S&P/ASX 100 Accumulation Index's 8.4 per cent. The fund is only available to wholesale investors.\nThe long-short strategy, after fees, has returned 14.6 per cent a year on average, or 4.1 percentage points above \nthe benchmark. As well as Cochlear, it owns QBE Insurance and Telix Pharmaceuticals.\nA short bet on Paladin Energy and a long position in infrastructure investment company Infratil were among the \nbiggest detractors in January.\nIn 2022, Australian Eagle partnered with Montgomery Investment Management to manage its Australian large-cap \nportfolios and distribute the Australian Eagle long-short fund to a broader set of investors.\nSequeira is bullish on property developer Dexus, and nuclear and silicon enrichment technology company Silex \nSystems. The stocks are among the portfolio's most undervalued companies, in his opinion, and a reason the fund \nincreased its stake in both last month.\nSequeira expects big returns from Dexus should management execute its strategy of growing funds under \nmanagement.\nAs for Silex, in which the fund holds a tiny position, Sequeira anticipates significant benefits should its laser \ntechnology be proven or adopted by the United States to counter Russian dominance in the sector.\nIn September last year, Sequeira sold Ramsay Healthcare shares after realising the company would not succeed \nas quickly as the fund hoped in a strategic turnaround. Australian Eagle had bought Ramsay shares on the belief \nthat the private hospital operator would rationalise its asset base by selling assets in Europe. But when Ramsay's \nmanagement team decided to keep them, the fund manager exited at $43.\n\"We started a small position that didn't work out according to our plan, and we got out at a small loss,\" says \nSequeira, who bought in at $54 in 2023.\nAs chief investment officer, he has final say in all portfolio decisions.\nGrowing up in the western Sydney suburb of Pendle Hill, Sequeira wanted to be a petroleum engineer until he got a \ntaste for financial markets working at Citibank after his year 12 exams.Page 3 of 3\nIt's all about change - the good and the bad; Monday Fundie\nCrossing over into investment management he was mentored by Hung, one of the founders of Australian Eagle and \nstill a sounding board as chairman of the investment firm. Sequeira was part of the team that started out in 2005 \nwith $15 million in seed money from St George Bank. This month, the fund celebrated its 20-year anniversary.\nOne of his biggest regrets is having sold out of software company Technology One too soon. He first bought the \nstock in 2006 at 70\u00a2 and sold it at $1 in 2010, only to watch Technology One transform into a $10 billion company. \nLast year, Australian Eagle decided to buy back in at $16.50.\nThe team is still reviewing what it missed in the first run.\nFor Sequeira, selling too early is more painful than getting a stock wrong because the missed opportunity is more \ncostly to portfolio performance than divesting at a small loss. \"That's something you learn from,\" he says.\nLoad-Date: February 26, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Such a sum involves a very generous assessment.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, Brahma Dharmananda SC, acting for Fortescue, argued that cultural and spiritual loss must be \nconsidered appropriately and in line with public sentiment in society.\n\u201cValue judgment, in our submission, should not be coloured by false questions about the preparedness of mining \ncompanies in other cases, to share a royalty percentage of their gains from minerals.\n\u201cOur submission, properly focused on the impact of the attachment to the land and or connection to Country, \ncultural loss cannot include a claimed loss if it does not show an impact on the Native Title holders spiritual \nconnection to the land.\u201d\nIn its final submission to the federal court earlier this month, the WA government argued compensation for cultural \nlosses under current legislation was not a \u201cmathematic equation\u201d but should be in line with community expectations \nwith the compensation valued at between \u201c$5-10 million\u201d.\nCompensation for economic loss of the land loss \u201camounts to $92,957.31,\u201d it said.\nThe WA government, in its statement also argued that the arguments for compensation were \u201cfundamentally \nflawed\u201d, with compensation being sought under grounds that were not covered by native title legislation.\nThe Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation chair and lead applicant, Michael Woodley, told Guardian Australia \nthat he believed the case was a landmark in that it had the power to reshape how mining\u2019s cultural, social and \neconomic impacts on First Nations people are understood.\nWoodley said that mining companies could pay a far greater share of their profits to traditional owners if they were \nsuccessful in their claim: \u201cIf resource developments are coming on to our land, then they\u2019ll have to acknowledge \nthat now the courts have established there is a certain percentage of royalties or resource benefit [to traditional \nowners].\u201dPage 3 of 3\nFortescue and WA government say traditional owners\u2019 $1.8bn compensation claim is worth $8m\nBut he said that as outlined in court, the impact on the once pristine lands, waters and hundreds of important \ncultural sites had taken a psychological toll on him and the Yindjibarndi people: \u201cThe emotion of the land being \npicked up, blown up and exploited, impacted on \u2026 That\u2019s a heavy burden for us to carry, both in a physical and a \nspiritual sense.\u201d\nThe Yindjibarndi people were awarded exclusive native title rights to their land, including where Solomon Hub sits, \nin 2017.\nThe final submissions were continuing this week with a judgment expected later this year.\nLoad-Date: February 25, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: OPINION; Pg. 31\nLength: 1505 words\nByline: MARK DI STEFANO and HANNAH WOOTTON\nBody\nAndrew \"Twiggy\" Forrest beams out from the cover of the latest edition of TIME magazine. Hand on hip, Canadian \ntuxedo, he is shown emerging from the dust at Fortescue's Christmas Creek mine site in Western Australia: \"The \nplanet's unlikely ally\".\nTIME's slow descent from the world's most influential magazine to Boomers' outdated bathroom read is complete.\nAs TIME was pitching Twiggy for leading the global green revolution, the hydrogen bubble he has invested billions \nin is suffering. Last week, Fortescue announced it was considering halting its commissioned hydrogen projects. \nThis included its only significant project in the space: a green hydrogen refuelling plant in Arizona it has sunk \n$US550 million of capex into.\nBy sheer coincidence, last week was also when Nikola Motors filed for bankruptcy in the US.\nNikola had promised to be the Tesla of hydrogen-powered vehicles. At its peak in 2020, the car start-up was worth \n$US13 billion. It was pitching carbon-free trucks, and soon had a partnership with General Motors. Reservations \nwere coming out of its ears.\nNikola's hydrogen trucks (which are still relatively rare at a commercial scale) gained unwanted notoriety because \nof a 2018 video promo, showing one of them gliding through the desert. See it was true Nikola trucks were running \nwithout carbon-spewing engines, as the promo promised, but they weren't doing so on hydrogen. Instead, the \ncompany would admit in 2020, they were just rolling down gradual inclines.\nThen-CEO Trevor Milton was jailed for fraud. Nikola tried to push on with the hydrogen dream. It found a willing \nbuyer for its Arizona hydrogen refuelling plant in Fortescue, which paid $US24 million for the facility in 2023.\nBut any hope their trucks would one day exist at-scale was buried when the bankruptcy notice was signed by the \nhand of Nikola's former director Andy Vesey last week.\nVesey's a former CEO of AGL Energy. His current role is as the top clean energy executive in North America for \nFortescue.\nPage 2 of 4\nREAR WINDOW Twiggy's hydrogen bets might be nothing but 'philanthropy'\nTo complete the hat trick of hot air howlers, European hydrogen-powered truck outfit Hyvia also went into liquidation \nlast week. Hyvia was a joint venture by French carmaker Renault and US power company Plug Power - where \nTwiggy's interests make an appearance.\nFortescue had a memorandum of understanding to buy a stake in Plug's Texas green hydrogen project as part of \nits now-defunct expansion plans. They also planned to be partners for Fortescue's Gladstone hydrogen \nelectrolyser factory in Queensland. Neither deal eventuated.\nYou wouldn't know from the TIME article that Forrest's hydrogen plans have all the appeal of an inert gas. Instead, \nreaders bathe in marvelling at the \"climate activist-meets-zealous prosecutor\" who has \"rugged features\". It's funny \nhow these big features about Forrest are usually in northern hemisphere media. Local journos take his claims with a \nbigger grain of salt.\nTwiggy's \"crown jewel\", the TIME piece continues, is a $4 billion deal with German company Liebherr to turn \nFortescue's mining fleet green with battery and hydrogen-powered trucks. The first prototype of the latter arrived, \nnaturally, at TIME's photoshoot location in the Pilbara last year. Testing is still under way. Hopefully, there are a few \nhills around Christmas Creek he can push them down.\nBut if it doesn't work out? There is one telling concession in the TIME piece that Twiggy may be concerned that \nhydrogen is not the green money dream he envisaged. Dismissing quarterly returns as a \"lazy\" corporate fixation, \nhe tells TIME that people need to look to the medium or long term in their bets on decarbonisation. The company \nhas separately reiterated that while the timelines of its hydrogen projects have changed, the overall ambition has \nnot.\n\"And if we lose money on this in the long term, people say, well, that's philanthropy.\"\nThat is not a word you hear used to describe billions of dollars of shareholder investment for a listed company.\nNikola and Hyvia must be kicking themselves they didn't shrug off their bankruptcies to investors: Well, that's \nphilanthropy!\nAmbulance chasers circle Slater and Gordon over email leak\nIt's the circle of life, or at least of plaintiff law. The ambulance chasers at Slater and Gordon have become the \nchasees as rival compensation firms pitch for victims of the firm's mass data leak to become their clients.\nPersonal injury firm AC Lawyers, a boutique outfit on the New South Wales South Coast, posted a callout on \nFacebook. \"Impacted by the Slater & Gordon email leak? You may be able to make a claim for compensation. \nContact us for a confidential discussion,\" it shared with a link to its site.\nRivals were more subtle. Two Slaters employees affected by the leak told us they have been privately contacted by \ndifferent law firms inquiring whether staff were considering taking action.\nIt could even turn into a class action. More than 900 staff members were included in the privacy breach, which \ninvolved a \"fraudulent\" all-staff email.\nThe scandalous email, sent on Friday purportedly by the outgoing head of human resources Mari Ruiz-Matthyssen \n(which she denies sending), contained a spreadsheet detailing the salaries, bonuses, performance ratings and \ntenures of 906 staff members.\nThough Slaters has dismissed the email as full of inaccuracies, more than a dozen staffers confirmed the \ninformation it contained about their pay was correct.\nIt also contained serious allegations of misconduct by staff members within the human resources division, scathing \nassessments of their competency, and personal details. If they're true, it's a privacy complaint waiting to happen.Page 3 of 4\nREAR WINDOW Twiggy's hydrogen bets might be nothing but 'philanthropy'\nMaurice Blackburn, Slaters' main competitor, is already acting for the firm's former HR boss Alicia Gleeson in an \nemployment claim. It also took on former Slaters payroll manager Bridget Maddox's similar claim this week. Both \nmatters are unrelated to the email.\nSlaters has fought a few data breach court cases for victims before. It's even got one on foot with a massive class \naction on behalf of victims of the Optus hack. It was running one on the Medicare breach too, before it was wrapped \ninto Baker McKenzie's.\nSlaters has built its reputation on protecting employees who have been harmed in the course of their employment. \nThere must be a few corporates on the receiving end of the firm's class action tactics who are ready to watch this \nunfold with some healthy schadenfreude.\nPerhaps Slaters has picked up a few tricks on how to handle these matters if they're on the other side.\nBarrenjoey star's home sale after domestic fight\nBarrenjoey's co-head of equity markets, Dyson Bowditch, and his TV presenter wife, Jessica Bowditch, have hung \nthe \"for sale\" sign on their Victorian terrace home on Sydney Harbour.\nThe four-bedroom, four-bathroom house at Darling Point was recently listed by Sotheby's.\nBought by the pair for $7.9 million in 2021, it is listed for auction in a month's time. Considering its prime location, \nthere's talk that the agents and vendors are eyeing eight figures.\nDyson is one of the most high-profile bankers in Barrenjoey's stable, one level below founders Guy Fowler and \nMatthew Grounds. Jessica is a former TV presenter on Channel Seven and Ten. A night at their home has been the \ntalk of the finance community.\nIn November last year, police were called by Jessica to the home to respond to a domestic incident. A statement \nfrom police said the officers were told Jessica had allegedly assaulted Dyson. She was then charged with assault.\nThere were media reports the argument started over a watch bought overseas. There's not much more to say \nbecause Jessica is facing court in a few weeks, where it is understood she will deny the charge.\n\"The allegation is extremely minor and involves Ms Bowditch picking up a pillow and hitting Mr Bowditch with it,\" \nJessica's lawyer Paul McGirr said in a statement. \"Certainly this is not the crime of the century.\"\nDyson runs Barrenjoey's ECM unit with Jabe Jerram, with the two forming an inseparable double act in some of the \nlargest recent equity raises.\nDyson and Jabe co-ran the book on Barrenjoey's successful IPO of Guzman y Gomez last year. The duo were \nworking the room on the ASX floor in June.\nSome deals have been more successful than others. The ECM twins were behind the scenes for Star \nEntertainment's more than $1.5 billion of new equity in 2023. The first, in February, raised $800 million at $1.20 a \nshare; the second, in November, was priced at 60\u00a2 a share for $750 million. The casino group is close to \nbankruptcy, and shares are now trading at 13\u00a2. They don't all soar like the burrito rocket!\nDyson and Jabe's appetite to take on deals others won't touch means they're in the orbit of the city's largest fund \nmanagers. Dyson has been spotted a few times grabbing coffee with Regal's Phil King down by Circular Quay.\nJessica has been keeping a low profile, raising the pair's two children. Both declined to comment. Friends say \nthey're now going through a divorce, and selling the house at the centre of last year's fight is part of that.\nLoad-Date: March 2, 2025Page 4 of 4\nREAR WINDOW Twiggy's hydrogen bets might be nothing but 'philanthropy'\nEnd of Document",

Everyone's hopes around market development and customers \ncommitting just haven't materialised.\" As part of its flagship Future Made in Australia plan, the -Albanese \ngovernment in 2024 provided a budget allocation of $6.7bn to provide a $2 incentive for every kilogram of green \nhydrogen produced from 2027-28. It also committed $2bn for new projects under the Hydrogen Headstart program.\n\"That $2 per kilogram hasn't been enough to make a difference,\" Mr Scaysbrook said. \"It certainly doesn't appear to \nbe making enough difference for the projects that are now falling over.\" In the US, green hydrogen producers were \nexpecting to tap into a $US3/kg tax incentive. But Mr Trump has indicated the Inflation Reduction Act which \ncontained the subsidy is likely to be wound back.\n\"Probably under this administration no one will be developing green hydrogen projects in the US even with the \n$US3 /kg leg-up - even if it remained,\" Mr Scaysbrook said.\nGreen hydrogen - produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen through zero-emissions technologies - has \nso far proven to be more hype than a major new energy source, its critics maintain.\nThe battle to build a hydrogen export industry from scratch also looms as a major political divide ahead of the \nfederal election. Labor has included green hydrogen as a central plank in its plan for Australia to become a \nrenewable energy superpower. Energy Minister Chris Bowen said in September it was \"no exaggeration\" to say \ngreen hydrogen would be on the ballot paper.\nLoad-Date: March 5, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 14\nLength: 1313 words\nByline: Peter Ker\nBody\nFortescue pursued a $200 million deal to buy West Virginia coal assets in 2022 because chairman Andrew Forrest \nwanted to cultivate a relationship with a key Democratic senator who was playing kingmaker to the Biden \nadministration's flagship climate and energy legislation at the time.\nInternal documents provided to a Connecticut court as part of a dispute between the mining giant and its one-time \nUS partner show Democrat senator Joe Manchin was personally trying to broker a deal between Fortescue and the \nAmerican company that owned the coal-fired generators in the same week he cast the deciding vote on the \npassage of the $US369 billion Inflation Reduction Act.\nKnown as the IRA, the scheme had the potential to unlock billions of dollars worth of taxpayer support for the sort of \ngreen hydrogen projects that Forrest wanted Fortescue to build. The documents show Forrest lost interest in plans \nto buy the West Virginia assets from Energy Harbor as soon as Manchin used his vote to secure the passage of the \ngreen subsidy scheme.\nEvidence of a close relationship between Forrest and Manchin has emerged from the lawsuit filed by Fortescue's \nformer partner in the bid for the assets, the family office of US billionaire Paul Tudor Jones.\nThe Tudor Jones camp is seeking compensation from Fortescue for costs incurred during their short partnership, \nand has argued that the ASX-listed company was interested in buying the coal-fired power stations as a way of \nwinning influence over Manchin and, by extension, the IRA.\nAs evidence, Tudor Jones' flagship company Kid Shelleen presented an email sent by Fortescue's then-North \nAmerican energy president, Paul Browning, to Forrest and other company executives on July 27, 2022.\n\"We pursued Energy Harbor at AF's [Andrew Forrest's] request based on his Manchin relationship, but there are \nplenty of other retiring coal assets we can pursue in areas with better renewable resource,\" Browning said in the \nemail to executives Julie Shuttleworth and David Hunt.\nPage 2 of 3\nForrest's $200m bid to 'influence' senator\nBrowning informed them that Fortescue leaders - including energy boss Mark Hutchinson, energy executive Andy \nVesey and finance boss Guy Debelle - had decided to walk away from the deal \"unless AF wants us to proceed \nbased on Manchin relationship\".\nThe email about Fortescue \"walking away\" from the deal was sent on the same day that Manchin agreed to join his \nfellow Democratic Party representatives in supporting passage of the IRA through the US Senate.\nManchin's support was critical, and could not be taken for granted because he had defied his Democrat colleagues \nby blocking earlier versions of the IRA - formerly known as the Build Back Better Act - on three occasions.\nThree days after voting for the IRA, Manchin wrote to Forrest asking why Energy Harbor had not heard from \nFortescue to finalise the transaction.\n\"[Energy Harbor executive] Jay Bellingham with Pleasants Power Station says he hasn't heard anything from your \nteam in two weeks concerning the sales agreement with you, please reach out and let me know, thank you, Joe \nManchin,\" said a copy of Manchin's message to Forrest on July 30, 2022.\nThe original $US135 million offer lobbed by Fortescue in May 2022 was downgraded to about $US50 million in July \n2022, much to the displeasure of Bellingham.\nVesey told the court in December that he was involved in a call with Forrest, Manchin and Bellingham as they \nattempted to solve disagreements over the deal. At the time, Vesey said Forrest was reluctant to take on the cost of \nrehabilitating land at the coal assets.\n\"Andrew [Forrest] said, 'we're not cleaning up their mess and that's their responsibility', and Joe Manchin talked to \nJay Bellingham and agreed with Andrew and said 'it's not their [Fortescue's] responsibility to clean it up, it's yours', \nand that was fundamentally the end of the call,\" Vesey said.\nFortescue planned to buy the plants and convert them to produce clean hydrogen, which can be burned as a fuel \nor used as a chemical catalyst.\nNegotiations with Energy Harbor came amid a frenetic three-year period when Fortescue was striking scores of \npreliminary agreements for clean energy projects around the world.\nVesey told the court that Forrest had targeted West Virginia - a big coal-producing state - so he could demonstrate \nto the world how carbon-intensive economies could be retrofitted to thrive on cleaner industries.\n\"The opportunity in West Virginia was important to demonstrate we could go into a heavily [coal] dependent state, \ntake a ... coal asset that was operating, close it down, turn it into a green hydrogen facility, continue to provide the \neconomic benefits to those employees in that community and to have the political support of the two senators and \nthe governor at that time,\" he said.\n\"The fact that Joe Manchin supported and took a high-risk political position of supporting a conversion of a coal \nplant ... we thought we should participate in making this a reality.\"\nIn May 2022, Forrest's close relationship with Manchin was cited by Browning as one of the reasons Energy Harbor \nhad selected Fortescue as its preferred bidder, despite the company not being the highest bidder.\n\"We will now move into exclusive negotiations. I'm sure your visit and Senator Manchin's support were important to \ntheir decision,\" Browning wrote in an email sent to Forrest and other executives on May 17, 2022.\nFortescue's $US135 million preliminary offer to Energy Harbor had not been disclosed to any sharemarkets at the \ntime of the May 2022 email, but regardless, Browning suggested to Forrest that he should let Manchin know that \npreferred bidder status had been secured.Page 3 of 3\nForrest's $200m bid to 'influence' senator\n\"You might want to drop a note to the senator. Something like 'Joe, in confidence I want to let you know that we \nrecently submitted our bid for Pleasants and Sammis power plants and Energy Harbor has accepted it and informed \nus that we will now move into exclusive negotiations. Your interest and support made all the difference and I thank \nyou.',\" Browning said in the same May email to Forrest and other Fortescue executives.\nOn July 10, 2022, Hunt, who at the time was Fortescue's chief commercial officer for the North American energy \ndivision, wrote to Vesey, Browning and former Fortescue executive Felicity Gooding about the fact Fortescue had \nlowered its offer to Energy Harbor from $US135 million to about $US50 million.\nHunt implied that Fortescue would have driven a harder bargain were it not for its desire to foster a relationship \nwith Manchin. \"If it were not for the Manchin angle, I'd be advocating for taking an aggressive stance, but I think that \nwe need a wider view on the decision,\" Hunt wrote.\nFortescue declined to comment.\nManchin announced in November 2023 that he would not seek re-election, and is now an adviser at Bondi Partners, \na lobbying firm run by former federal treasurer Joe Hockey, and Apollo Global Management.\n\"Connecting businesses to West Virginia has been a top priority because our state has always been, and must \ncontinue to be, a powerhouse for America's future,\" Manchin said when asked about the transaction.\n\"I am proud of the work we did in passing the IRA to strengthen America's energy independence. Today, we are \nproducing more fossil and renewable energy than at any point in our history. I have remained steadfast in my \ncommitment to an all-of-the-above energy strategy - one that embraces every resource at our disposal while \nensuring economic growth and national security.\n\"I have always believed that hydrogen is one of the most promising clean fuels for the future, and as we continue to \nadvance and mature the technology, it has the potential to play a major role in our energy landscape.\"\nManchin and Forrest eventually dropped their support for the IRA.\nFortescue said in February that it was considering pausing its hydrogen projects, including a $US550 million \nhydrogen refuelling station it was building in Arizona.\nLoad-Date: March 9, 2025\nEnd of Document",
