Highlight: Normal railway operations for Andrew Forest's Fortescue Metals Group are expected to be up and 
running again on Wednesday after an incident on the line between Newman and Port Hedland on Saturday 
suspended operations.
Body
Rail operations at Andrew Forest's Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) have been hit following the derailment of 
multiple ore cars over the weekend.
The incident happened on Saturday about 150 kilometres south of Port Hedland in Western Australia's remote 
Pilbara region. 
Fortescue declined to be interviewed but in a statement a spokesperson said an internal investigation was 
underway to determine the cause.
"No one was injured in the incident and there is no impact to members of the community," the spokesperson said.
December iron ore exports were not impacted, but the spokesperson declined to respond to questions about any 
impacts on January shipments.
Rail operations are expected to resume tomorrow.
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau has been contacted for comment.
2023's second major derailment 
It was the second major derailment to have occurred in 2023, with Rio Tinto reporting an incident 20 kilometres 
south of Dampier in June.

Rio Tinto said that incident involved a loaded autonomous train with 30 wagons and resulted in the train line being 
out of action for three days.
BHP in 2018 deliberately derailed a fully loaded train near Port Hedland after it took off without the driver. 
The train was pulling 268 wagons and carrying 30,000 tonnes of iron ore between Newman and Port Hedland.
The incident is believed to have cost the mining company hundreds of millions of dollars.
Fortescue exported 192 million tonnes of iron ore last financial year.
It has rail operations running from three major mining hubs, Eliwana, Solomon and Christmas Creek.
FMG in May 2023 began production of magnetite iron ore at its Iron Bridge operation south of Port Hedland, which 
is transported from the mine to port via a 135-kilometre slurry pipeline.

Fortescue has launched an internal investigation into a derailment that cut the supply of iron ore into its port 
operations in Western Australia.
Rail safety authorities have also been alerted to the derailment which happened between Port Hedland and the 
company's mines on Saturday.
The Fortescue rail line into Port Hedland, Australia's iron ore export epicentre, remained out of action yesterday.
Andrew Forrest-led Fortescue said the derailment involved multiple wagons but declined to say how many or 
reveal additional details on the extent of the damage. It is understood it happened about 150 kilometres south of 
Port Hedland, but Fortescue would not comment on the location.
A Fortescue spokeswoman said no one was injured in the incident and there was no impact on the public. 
Fortescue expects to reopen the rail line today.
It said the derailment and four-day supply chain outage would not affect its iron ore shipments for December or the 
half-year to December 31. The company declined to comment on whether January shipments would be affected.
The Fortescue share price was at a record $29.39 yesterday, fuelled by a surge in iron ore prices and market 
optimism around the Chinese economy. Fortescue shipped 45.9 million tonnes of iron ore from Port Hedland in the 
September quarter, 3 per cent lower than the same three-month period a year earlier.
The $89.3 billion company is targeting shipments of 192 million to 197 million tonnes in 2023-24, including about 5 
million tonnes from its Iron Bridge magnetite operations connected to Port Hedland via a slurry pipeline..

Fortescue says a heat-related buckle in its railway line led to a derailment that cut the supply of iron ore into its port 
operations for four days.
The company is investigating the factors behind the heat buckle that led to the derailment of multiple wagons on 
December 30 - when the maximum temperature in some towns in Western Australia's iron ore-rich Pilbara region 
reached almost 50 degrees.
The wagons were empty when they derailed about 150 kilometres south of Port Hedland and there were no injuries 
reported from the incident.
Bureau of Meteorology records show the maximum temperature in Marble Bar, about 170 kilometres south-east of 
Port Hedland, reached 49.3 degrees on the day of the derailment.
Fortescue said rail operations resumed on Wednesday after a four-day disruption in sending iron ore from its 
mines to port.
The Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator was notified, but advised Fortescue it didn't need to send 
investigators to the site.
Fortescue is assessing the damage bill and cost of track repairs as part of its internal investigation into the 
derailment, which will include weather and track conditions.
A company spokeswoman said teams "worked safely and swiftly" to ensure operations resumed on Wednesday. 
Fortescue's executive chairman, Andrew Forrest, has spent the past few years warning about the threat of global 
warming and more recently lethal humidity.
Rail operators around the world, including in the Pilbara, take precautions to manage the risk of buckling as steel 
rail lines expand in hot conditions.

In response to questions about whether the derailment would affect the company's March quarter iron ore 
shipments, Fortescue said: "We believe we will meet our market guidance."
Fortescue is targeting shipments of 192 million to 197 million tonnes in 2023-24, including about 5 million tonnes 
from its newly-opened Iron Bridge magnetite operations connected to Port Hedland via a slurry pipeline. It shipped 
45.9 million tonnes from Port Hedland in the September quarter, 3 per cent lower than the same three-month period 
a year earlier.
Fortescue shares closed at $28.93.

Two of the original architects behind Fortescue's clean energy pivot believe their start-up can solve the carbon 
footprint of the Australian iron ore industry without using the hydrogen and membrane technology being popularised 
by their former employer.
One of Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest's most senior lieutenants of the past 25 years, Michael Masterman, 
has joined forces with former Fortescue chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk to create a metals processing start-up 
that is already turning iron ore into pure iron at laboratory scale.
Dubbed Element Zero, the new company has a patented method of "electro-reduction" that uses an alkaline 
solution and electric current to separate pure iron from the waste products in iron ore such as silica, alumina and 
oxygen.
Mr Masterman and Mr Kolodziejczyk say Element Zero's patented process can work for the hematite ores that 
dominate the Australian iron ore industry, plus other metals such as nickel.
"Everything we do was developed after Fortescue and doesn't bring anything from Fortescue," said Mr 
Kolodziejczyk.
Element Zero is part of a rush to develop "green iron" technologies that could help Australian miners reduce the 
scope 3 emissions created when their customers cook iron ore and coking coal together to make steel.
The oxygen in iron ore combines with the carbon in coking coal during the steel-making process to make carbon 
dioxide.
Big miners Rio Tinto, Fortescue and BHP are investigating future options to export pure iron from Western 
Australia rather than iron ore, by removing the oxygen and other waste products.
Pure iron has traditionally been extracted from iron ore in some parts of the world using the potent greenhouse gas 
methane, under a process called direct reduced iron.
Page 2 of 3
Ex-Fortescue duo's green-iron play
Miners such as Fortescue have studied whether they can make carbon-free DRI by using green hydrogen rather 
than methane to remove the oxygen.
But experts have warned that converting the Pilbara iron ore industry to hydrogen DRI would be extremely 
expensive, costing up to $30 billion and requiring the installation of enough renewables to double Australia's power 
generation capacity.
Hydrogen DRI also struggles to work on the hematite ores that dominate the Australian export industry.
Part of the breakthrough at Element Zero "is being able to show that we can process the iron ore of all the majors 
and all the magnetite miners," said Mr Masterman, adding that the company had trialled ore from several miners, 
including Fortescue.
"Importantly for Australia's future, because iron ore grades are coming down, our technology works very efficiently 
on the currently sub-economic, sub-55 per cent iron ores."
Under Element Zero's process, iron ore is dissolved into a clear, alkaline solution that does not include water. When 
renewable electricity is passed through the solution, the pure iron plates on to a cathode, from where it can be 
collected for sale.
Element Zero is commissioning a green iron pilot plant in the Perth suburb of Malaga, where 100 kilograms of iron 
ore will be fed into the process each day.
Mr Kolodziejczyk received an Order of Australia in 2022 for services to hydrogen energy science.
But he said the lack of hydrogen in Element Zero's process was an advantage because it lowered capital costs and 
allowed for a more direct and efficient use of renewable power.
Fortescue announced last February that it had developed a method for making green iron without requiring 
hydrogen, but Dr Forrest said that breakthrough was based on Fortescue's secret membrane technology.
Mr Masterman said he believed technologies reliant on membranes would be hard to scale up, and stressed that 
Element Zero did not use membranes.
"If you want to build a plant that is say 5 million tonnes per year, you can't pass 5 million tonnes a year through a 
very expensive piece of plastic," he said, in reference to membranes.
Mr Masterman's association with Dr Forrest goes back to the late 1990s when he was the finance boss at troubled 
miner Anaconda Nickel.
He later held senior roles at Fortescue, including as international projects boss, before serving as chief financial 
officer and chief investment officer within Fortescue's Future Industries division between 2020 and 2022.
He was also chairman of Dr Forrest's private company Squadron Energy until late 2021; Squadron is now 
Australia's biggest owner of renewable power assets.
During their time at FFI, Mr Masterman and Mr Kolodziejczyk were among the small group that spent most of 2020 
travelling on Dr Forrest's private jet to more than 30 nations on the hunt for clean energy projects.
Mr Masterman said leaving Fortescue better enabled him to focus on a smaller number of projects.
"There became a point in time where, for me, [there were] too many time zones; let's come back and focus," he 
said. "So I stepped back in 2022 and focused on where there are opportunities for very, very large-scale 
decarbonisation."
Some of the green iron technologies being pursued by Fortescue were developed by Mr Kolodziejczyk during his 
time at the company, and his name is still on some Fortescue patents.Page 3 of 3
Ex-Fortescue duo's green-iron play
Asked why he did not pursue Element Zero's electro-reduction method while working at Fortescue, Mr 
Kolodziejczyk said the idea had not dawned on him until later. "You actually had to step out of Fortescue to 
brainstorm, ideate and develop a pathway," he said. "We tested it in our garage initially to make sure it works.
"We can move significantly faster being a small start-up company."
Mr Masterman said he hoped Element Zero could have a good working relationship with Fortescue in the future.
"We need a broad church to be successful here," he said.
"There are enormous incentives for the major iron ore companies to solve this problem and enormous incentives for 
the major steel companies to solve this problem.
"We want to be in a position, with the support of the full industry, to be able to deploy at scale quickly."
Element Zero was registered with ASIC in December 2022 and raised $9 million from US venture capital fund 
Playground Global in August.
The money was part of a $10 million raising that will help fund studies on a larger plant that would consume a tonne 
of iron ore per day.

Fortescue partner and supplier Plug Power is looking to raise $US1bn in the US capital markets to keep its 
hydrogen ambitions alive, underlining the risks facing the nascent green hydrogen sector.
Stock in the electrolyser and hydrogen company crashed on the US markets this week after the company said it 
planned to raise as much as $US1bn in a stock offering, despite the company downplaying its financial troubles in 
November.
Plug is a key partner for Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Energy. Last October Fortescue named Plug Power as the 
preferred supplier of 550MW in electrolysers for its Gibson Island green ammonia plant in Queensland.
Plug and Fortescue also have a deal for the Australian resources major to take up to a 40 per cent stake in Plug's 
Texas hydrogen plant and for Plug to take up to a 25 per cent stake in a plant Fortescue wants to build in -Arizona.
In November Plug attached a going concern warning to its quarterly accounts, warning the company was running 
out of cash after burning through more than $US860m in the first nine months of the year. Plug chief financial officer 
Paul Middleton told analysts the going concern warning was to comply with corporate accounting standards, and 
Plug was confident it could raise debt to cover its obligations. Instead the company filed a prospectus to raise up to 
$US1bn on the US market this week, in a move that could dilute existing shareholders substantially.

Fortescue partner and supplier Plug Power is looking to raise $US1bn ($1.52bn) in the US capital markets to keep 
its hydrogen ambitions alive, underlining the risks facing the nascent green energy sector.
Stock in the electrolyser and hydrogen company crashed on the US markets this week after the company said it 
planned to raise as much as $US1bn in a stock offering, despite downplaying its financial troubles in November.
Plug is a key partner for Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Energy, both as a potential supplier of electrolysers for the 
company's own projects, and as a joint venture partner with Fortescue in the US hydrogen market.
Last October, Fortescue named Plug Power as the preferred supplier of 550MW in electrolysers for its Gibson 
Island green ammonia plant in Queensland - although that plan may be stalled as Fortescue battles to find power 
cheap enough to realise its hydrogen ambitions.
Plug and Fortescue also have a deal for the Australian resources major to take up to a 40 per cent stake in Plug's 
Texas hydrogen plant and for Plug to take a stake of up to 25 per cent in a plant Fortescue wants to build in -
Arizona.
Those plans may also need rethinking, however, after the draft detail of hydrogen subsidies on offer from the Biden 
administration turned out tougher than expected, requiring new sources of clean energy powering the production of 
hydrogen to qualify for generous $US3 per kilogram -subsidies.
In November, Plug attached a going concern warning to its quarterly accounts, warning the company was running 
out of cash after burning through more than $US860m ($1307m) in the first nine months of the year.
At the time a spokesman for Fortescue said the company was not concerned about Plug's -financial position or 
ability to deliver on its agreements with -Fortescue.
Plug chief financial officer Paul Middleton told analysts the going concern warning was driven by the need to comply 
with corporate accounting standards, and Plug was confident it could raise debt to cover its obligations.

"I have a $US5bn ($9.43bn) balance sheet that's unlevered," he said. "I mean, I really don't have any debt.
"So we still are extremely confident about the range of parties and solutions that we're working with." But the 
company instead filed a prospectus to raise up to $US1bn on the US market this week, in a move that could dilute 
existing shareholders substantially.
The filing sent Plug stock down more than 40 per cent over the past few days, with the company now trading 
around $US2.40 a share - more than 85 per cent below its price a year ago, and a fraction of its all-time high of 
$US66.87 in January 2021. Plug is due to give a business update early next week.

Barely three years ago, hydrogen seemed to be the panacea for all the world's problems.
It was touted as the next clean fuel for passenger cars, the chemical catalyst that would decarbonise the steel and 
alumina industries, an ingredient for clean fertiliser and maybe even the replacement for methane gas in kitchen 
stoves.
"People thought it was a floor wax and a dessert topping, and it was good for everything," recalls Peter Barrett, the 
founder of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Playground Global.
"But it ain't."
Barrett isn't a hydrogen sceptic; as a director of Californian company Universal Hydrogen, he believes the 
"incredibly useful" molecule can cure the carbon footprint of the aviation and maritime industries plus work for 
fertiliser. But he doesn't hesitate to use the "b" word - bubble - when asked to explain the capitulation in most listed 
hydrogen stocks over the past three years.
"Some of the valuations were chasing applications that didn't necessarily make sense," he says. "We see bubbles 
like that, we are seeing one in AI today. People pile in, and they put money into silly shit."
The euphoria in hydrogen stocks peaked between Joe Biden winning the Democratic Party nomination in mid-2020 
and his inauguration as president in January 2021.
The prospect of a green political wave at a time of ultra-low interest rates led investors toward riskier investments, 
particularly those with a decarbonisation theme.
But three years on, the hydrogen tide has receded.
The 97-year-old Norwegian company Nel belongs to the "sensible" end of the hydrogen spectrum; it has 
manufactured the electrolysers that turn water into hydrogen for decades, and Australian companies like Woodside 
and Viva Energy have its order book bursting at the seams.
Page 2 of 3
Should Fortescue buy its way to supremacy in hydrogen? Due Diligence
But Nel shares are down 86 per cent over the past three years as it endures short-term pain (investment in extra 
manufacturing capacity) to underwrite a long-term strategy.
The silly end of the hydrogen spectrum was best represented by Nikola Motors, the hydrogen truck aspirant that, 
among other sins, was forced to admit to US regulators that it had rolled its prototype truck down a hill to make it 
appear functional for promotional videos.
The incident was one of several lies or exaggerations told to investors about Nikola's progress, and late last year its 
talismanic founder Trevor Milton was sentenced to jail for fraud.
Nikola shares peaked at $US65.90 in 2020 but were just US62¢ last week.
Another hydrogen truck aspirant, Hyzon, has lost 96.5 per cent of its value since February 2021 after it, too, fell foul 
of regulators for misleading investors over its sales performance.
The irregularities found by US regulators in the accounts of Plug Power - a manufacturer of hydrogen-powered 
forklifts, electrolysers and other components - were less serious than those at Nikola and Hyzon.
But they haven't helped investor confidence; Plug shares are down 96 per cent over the past three years, and the 
cash-strapped stock lost almost 12 per cent on Thursday when it revealed plans to issue $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) 
of new shares.
While each stock is affected by individual factors, David Tuckwell from GlobalX says the common thread has been 
higher interest rates making future cash flows seem less attractive; a painful blow for a sector where almost all cash 
flows are far from being realised.
Tuckwell manages a hydrogen exchange-traded fund.
Aside from interest rates, he says investors have been scared away from the hydrogen sector by frequent dilutive 
share issuances and the threat that Donald Trump could scrap President Joe Biden's hydrogen incentives if he 
regains power.
Amid this market carnage, the International Energy Agency still reckons global demand for hydrogen will more than 
triple by 2050 if nations keep to their "announced pledges". The IEA believes demand for "low-emissions" hydrogen 
will rise 25-fold by 2030 if those announced pledges are kept intact, and 246-fold by 2050.
The hard part is determining which of hydrogen's many uses will be adopted at scale, and then how to invest in 
those applications.
Asset manager Mirova's sustainability equity fund took its first cautious steps into hydrogen last year when it 
purchased shares in Euronext company Air Liquide.
Air Liquide makes a range of industrial gases, and its hydrogen is made from both fossil fuels and renewable 
power.
Mirova analyst Cindy Huang reckons investing in incumbents like Air Liquide is the best way to get insights into how 
the hydrogen sector will evolve, even if that means investing in a stock that currently has a big carbon footprint and 
does not offer pure exposure to hydrogen.
"We try to learn first from the individual company, and then through that company understand that part of the value 
chain," she says.
Air Liquide and the other industrial gas producers that dabble in hydrogen, like Linde and US company Air 
Products, have delivered much better returns for investors over the past three years than pure hydrogen stocks.
"Hopefully over time [we can] expand downwards through the value chain and hopefully identify more investment 
targets," says Huang, adding that electrolyser makers could offer exciting, medium term growth.Page 3 of 3
Should Fortescue buy its way to supremacy in hydrogen? Due Diligence
But Huang believes companies producing hydrogen fuel cells, or hydrogen for power generation, will require much 
more patience and risk tolerance from investors.
A separate Mirova fund has bypassed stocks to make direct investments in hydrogen businesses like Parisian taxi 
company Hype, which runs 400 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles refuelling at Hype's own stations.
No conversation about hydrogen is complete - in Australia at least - without mentioning Fortescue, the iron ore 
miner whose founder Andrew Forrest is the nation's biggest hydrogen bull.
Fortescue has built an electrolyser factory in Gladstone and has sanctioned its first green hydrogen project, a 
$US550 million hub in Arizona that will make low carbon hydrogen and offer refuelling services to hydrogen trucks.
Fortescue would need 1363 projects the size of that $US550 million hub to achieve its goal of producing 15 million 
tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030.
The hub was acquired from Nikola and the two companies are working on a long-term supply agreement. 
Fortescue's North America boss and former AGL chief executive Andy Vesey is now a director of Nikola.
Fortescue is also close to Hyzon, having acquired hydrogen-powered buses from the struggling company.
But Fortescue's most interesting relationship is with Plug; the iron ore miner has ordered electrolysers from Plug, 
and has floated the idea of giving Plug a stake in its Arizona hub under an equity swap that would give Fortescue a 
shareholding in one of Plug's projects in Texas.
When Plug boss Andy Marsh updates investors on Tuesday, it will be exactly one year since he bruised Fortescue 
by suggesting the economics of the Gladstone electrolyser factory were not attractive enough for him to invest.
Plug shares have since slumped 84 per cent for a market capitalisation of $US1.46 billion. Fortescue's shares 
have risen 22 per cent over the same period for an $85 billion valuation.
With a power imbalance like that, perhaps it is time for Fortescue to consider buying its way to hydrogen 
supremacy, rather than building.

At the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, only one Australian company had its own office in the 
jamboree's central hotel, sitting cheek-by-jowl with those of the big global banks and accounting firms.
Occupying a prime corner, with a big placard warning about lethal humidity at the door, is Fortescue Metals Group. 
Andrew Forrest has become a highly visible Davos regular, and for the past two years has been joined by 
Fortescue Future Industries chief Mark "Hutch" Hutchinson.
This year, though, they brought a third Fortescue exec with them: Robert Tichio, who has been part of Team 
Twiggy for all of eight weeks.
It wasn't the Wall Street financier's first time at Davos, but on this trip he had a new mission: to speed-date 
institutional investors, educating them about Forrest's latest initiative: Fortescue Capital, which Tichio has been 
recruited to run.
Taking a breather in the Fortescue office, he describes to The Australian Financial Review what the Fortescue 
master schedule might look like on a given day at Davos.
"Andrew Forrest is Andrew Forrest - his calendar is like nobody else's, and it involves extraordinary visits with 
people who are shaping the way that, frankly, the world will move over the next decade," he says.
"Hutch will spend an incredible amount of time working with project partners and large corporates - whose identities 
wouldn't surprise you - who may be partners, who may be suppliers, who may be governments, who are going to be 
instrumental in helping Fortescue projects achieve escape velocity. And then I've been spending my time entirely 
with allocators ... sovereigns, pensions, endowments, global investment banks."
A lot of northern hemisphere financial giants don't really know Fortescue well. And even if they do, they certainly 
need a steer on Fortescue Capital - because Forrest, Hutchinson and Tichio are trying to do something that 
nobody else has quite done before.

Essentially, not everything in Forrest's vastly ambitious slate of green energy projects can be funded from the iron 
ore miner's balance sheet. But rather than send Fortescue Metals Group to the private markets, Forrest has 
delegated the job of finding the funds to Tichio and his rapidly growing team.
Fortescue Capital has a foot in both camps: it works inside the company to get projects ready to pitch for external 
funding; and then it raises and manages those funds. It's like an in-house asset manager or investment bank.
But this puts Tichio in an interesting position. From the outside, it looks very much like Forrest exercises pretty 
unfettered authority inside Fortescue. Shareholders can either like that or lump it.
Those shareholders who have stuck with Forrest have been amply rewarded. But he can't take that attitude with the 
private markets. Institutional investors, running the risk-o-meter over specific Fortescue projects, will demand a 
tighter straitjacket.
And Fortescue Capital, as the middle man, serves two masters. It raises the capital for its parent company, but it 
has fiduciary duties to its investors. It looks as if Tichio is a man who might sometimes have to say "no" to Forrest. 
Or at least "yes, but".
It's a role he acknowledges is "delicate". "No one will unmoor the chairman, he's an extraordinary visionary. I 
wouldn't have come to do this if I didn't believe in the way that he sets out a vision, particularly in categories that are 
unmarked, that are uncharted," Tichio says.
"He has an extraordinary ability to see long-term vision and make decisions that oftentimes really require the 
education of the market versus the other way around. And we're not going to change that."
He rejects the idea that he will be some kind of Dr No. He describes Fortescue Capital as "a voice in the room 
about what third-party capital will want to see in a project", helping decide whether a project is best suited to 
external or internal funding.
"Those are conversations we're having now daily. And I think it has been a really remarkable early series of 
exchanges, robust exchanges, on this," he says.
Tichio has spent his early weeks visiting various parts of the Fortescue empire, learning about the projects that 
might ultimately come to his unit for funding. He was in Norway before Davos, and heads to the WAE operation in 
Britain afterwards.
"This has been a ramp period for us to work with the industrial teams, particularly on the energy side, to ensure that 
decisions that are getting made around how these projects are being framed, sized, de-risked ... [are made] with 
third-party equity investors in mind," he says.
Although, of course, not every project will end up going externally for funding - some "just may not be ready or 
appropriate".
Meanwhile, back at Fortescue Capital in New York, his colleagues are assembling "a Wall-Street-deep team" of 
people from the likes of JPMorgan, BlackRock and Goldman Sachs.
The plan is not to raise capital for a pooled fund, in the style of Brookfield or Macquarie Asset Management, where 
the money manager gets wide discretion about what to do with the cash.
Instead, Tichio and his team will hawk "diligenced, ringfenced assets or investment offerings" for investors to 
consider on an individual basis. Those offerings will come in the next three years, although probably not in 2024.
"If you were a fly on the wall of this room in Davos, there have been a lot of conversations with allocators to start to 
introduce to them what they might expect to see from us, because of what we know is coming in the pipeline."Page 3 of 3
Davos speed-dating for Forrest recruit Analysis
If Tichio can navigate his tricky job successfully, it sounds like he will be finding his way back to Davos again next 
year.

Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has severed ties with Andrew Forrest's Fortescue in the latest high-profile 
exit from the iron ore miner turned renewables hopeful.
Mr Turnbull ceased to be a director of Australian Fortescue Future Industries on January 11, ending a legal 
association with the company that had lasted almost three years.
AFFI is one of several wholly owned subsidiaries of Fortescue that collectively make up the iron ore miner's clean 
energy division.
Mr Turnbull declined to elaborate on the exit yesterday, but his departure adds to the long list of Fortescue people 
who have moved on from the company in the past three years.
Former Woodside chief executive Fiona Hick spent just six months as Fortescue's mining boss before leaving in 
August, while the chief financial officer appointed by Ms Hick, Christine Morris, lasted barely two months.
Former Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle was also a director of AFFI before severing ties last August.
AFFI never directly held any operational assets and Mr Turnbull's focus during the past three years was largely on 
the establishment of an international member association for hydrogen producers, the Geneva-registered Green 
Hydrogen Organisation. Mr Turnbull was still chairman of the Green Hydrogen Organisation yesterday. His 
retirement from AFFI comes six months after Fortescue announced plans to rebrand its "Future Industries" division 
as "Fortescue Energy", and it is understood there will be some rationalisation of the subsidiaries that make up the 
division.
Two of the original architects of Fortescue Future Industries - former chief financial officer Michael Masterman and 
former chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk - revealed last week they had launched their own green iron start-up.
Fortescue shares hit a record high this month on strong iron ore prices. The company will update investors 
tomorrow.

Highlight: Billionaire Andrew Forrest's troubled foray into producing high-grade ore has suffered another setback.
Body
Mining billionaire Andrew Forrest's troubled foray into producing high-grade ore - Fortescue's Iron Bridge project - 
has suffered another setback, with a leaking water pipeline that could more than halve magnetite production this 
financial year.
However, the lost production and $220 million cost to replace 65 kilometres of pipeline will hardly dent Fortescue's 
financial performance. The miner shipped 48.5 million tonnes of its main iron ore product haematite in the 
December quarter, a figure 6 per cent higher than the previous three months to achieve the company's second-
highest first-half production.

At Iron Bridge, Fortescue had planned to produce 5 million tonnes of magnetite this financial year as it ramped up 
the $5.9 billion project to its full capacity of 22 million tonnes a year. That forecast has now been cut to 2 to 4 million 
tonnes due to continual leaks in the higher pressure section of a 240-kilometre pipeline that supplies water to the 
processing plant.
Fortescue's first move into complex processing of the ore it mines has been dogged with problems since three 
senior executives exited three years ago when news of cost blowouts first surfaced.
Fortescue's guidance for total production of both types of iron ore for the 12 months to June remains unchanged at 
192 million to 197 million tonnes.
Fortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said it was a strong quarter from the iron ore operation that included 
the company's second shipment of magnetite and the initial export from its Belinga project in Gabon.
"We achieved this while continuing to grow our green technology, energy and metals businesses, keeping costs low 
and maintaining our safety performance," he said.
Fortescue aims for its mining operation to be emissions-free by 2030, a far more aggressive target than any other 
Australian miner. It is trialling the first of three electric excavators powered by a trailing cable more than two 
kilometres long.

Fortescue Metals ( OTCQX:FSUMF) reported higher Q4 iron ore shipments Thursday, bringing half-year shipments 
to the company's second highest ever, but cut estimates for annual exports from its new Iron Bridge operation.
The world's fourth largest iron ore miner shipped 48.7M metric tons in the December quarter, up from 45.9M tons 
the previous quarter but below 49.4M tons shipped during the same period a year ago; first-half shipments totaled 
94.6M tons, the second highest in the company's history.
Fortescue ( OTCQX:FSUMF) slashed its forecast for FY 2024 shipments from the Iron Bridge project to a range of 
2M-4M metric tons from 5M tons estimated previously after further leaks were detected in the Canning Basin Raw 
Water Pipeline.
But the company said the problems at Iron Bridge will not hurt its total production guidance, maintaining an outlook 
of 192M-197M tons for FY 2024.
"The Iron Bridge ramp-up issues are not ideal, but not surprising and relatively immaterial for now," Jefferies 
analysts said, adding it is "positive to see the first 11,000 [metric ton] shipment go from Belinga" in Gabon.

Fortescue Energy CEO Mark Hutchinson says the company is likely to make a decision next month on whether to 
push ahead with its biggest Australian green hydrogen project, as the company's mining division hits more troubles 
with its Iron Bridge magnetite project.
Fortescue delivered its December quarter production report on Thursday, blaming ongoing troubles with the water 
supply to Iron Bridge for a decision to again slash production guidance, and saying an additional $US140m ($213m) 
would need to be spent on work to get the plant running at full tilt.
It is the second time in six months that Fortescue has cut export guidance from the troubled operation, after initially 
flagging exports of 7 million tonnes for the full financial year.
In September, Fortescue said it expected to ship about 5 million tonnes of magnetite concentrate from Iron Bridge 
this financial year, but has so far managed only five cargoes.
The company, which is controlled by billionaire Andrew Forrest, said shipments from the facility could reach as little 
as 40 per cent of that 5 million tonne guidance, giving a new range of 2-4 million tonnes.
Fortescue said it was still having trouble with supply from its borefields for the water-hungry operation, where a 
high-pressure water line keeps springing leaks.
"Work is under way to evaluate options to derisk and improve the performance of the high-pressure section (65km) 
of the raw water pipeline, where the leaks have occurred," the company said. "It is anticipated that replacing this 
section of the pipeline would not materially impact Iron Bridge's ramp-up schedule and would require investment of 
-approximately $US100m (For-tescue's share)." Fortescue owns about 70 per cent of the operation, with the 
remainder controlled by Taiwan's Formosa.
The company increased the total cost of delivering the 22 -million-tonnes-a-year mine to $US4bn in its annual 
financial results last year, from a previous -estimate of $US3.9bn, and its initial guidance, when the project was 
approved in 2019, of $US2.6bn. Fortescue wrote $US1bn off its valuation of the project in its last annual report.

Fortescue nears green hydrogen call
Fortescue shipped 48.6 million tonnes of iron ore in the December quarter, slightly below the 49.4 million tonnes 
shipped in the same period in 2022.
The company said its C1 cash cost for the period averaged $US17.62 a wet metric tonne, and it received an 
average $US116.18 a dry metric tonne for its sales in the December period.
Fortescue closed December with net debt of $US600m, the company said. The company has said it still expects to 
ship 192-197 million tonnes for the full year, despite the impact of the troubles at Iron Bridge and a derailment on its 
iron ore line in the Pilbara that stopped trains for four days over the New Year weekend.
Fortescue said it was implementing an "operational recovery plan" to optimise rail loading and shipments for the 
second half of the year.
Fortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said he believed the company would still meet its full-year 
shipments guidance for the year, despite the setbacks at Iron Bridge and through the derailment.
"The rest of the supply chain is performing exceptionally well. The bottleneck for our operations is rail, so we expect 
any specific recovery plan just to be focused on that, but we're in a pretty good position," Mr Otranto said.
After falling short of its promise to reach a final investment decision on as many as five green energy projects in 
2024, the company was likely to make a call on its biggest planned hydrogen project in Australia, Mr Hutchinson 
said.
Fortescue announced the -approval of two projects from its energy division in November, ticking off plans for small 
hydrogen production plants in Phoenix in the US and at Gladstone in Queensland.
At the time, Fortescue said it would fast-track a decision on larger projects in Norway, Kenya and Brazil.
But the company put off any decision on its Gibson Island proposal in Brisbane, where For-tescue has been 
working with Incitec Pivot on a green hydrogen feed for Incitec's mothballed fertiliser plant. At the time, Fortescue 
cited high Australian energy costs for the deferral.
Late last month, Genex Power told the market it had extended a deadline for Fortescue to close a deal for power 
from its proposed Bulli Creek solar farm - first -announced in October - by two months until the end of February.
Mr Hutchinson told reporters and analysts that a final decision on the plant was likely at Fortescue's board 
meeting.
"We're working hard to get this project over the line," Mr Hutchinson said. "We have a board meeting coming up 
later in February and I would imagine there will be a 'go or no go' decision made at that board meeting." Fortescue 
shares rose 2 per cent to $28.97 in a higher market on Thursday.

In a groundbreaking development, Liebherr Mining and Fortescue Ltd have transformed a diesel-powered R 9400 
excavator into an electric configuration.
This innovative conversion, a first in Liebherr's more than 40-year history of working with electric excavators, was 
carried out at Fortescue's Christmas Creek mine in Western Australia.
The repowered R 9400 E excavator now operates with a hydrogen Offboard Power Unit (OPU), a Fortescue-
developed technology, currently undergoing tests within the zero-emission testing area at Christmas Creek.
The project, a significant step towards decarbonising mining fleets, was executed at Liebherr-Australia's Perth 
facility, involving experts from both companies. 
Fossil fuel-free mining future
Liebherr executive vice president of R&D, engineering and manufacturing Oliver Weiss said: "Liebherr is delighted 
that Fortescue has chosen to collaborate with Liebherr in our joint efforts to accelerate the pathway to a mining 
future without fossil fuels.
"This repower project demonstrates that decarbonisation is also possible with Liebherr machines previously 
supplied with diesel engines.
"The modular design of Liebherr equipment makes it possible to repower existing diesel excavators to new zero-
emission configurations, such as electric powertrains.
Page 2 of 2
Liebherr and Fortescue transform diesel excavator into electric
"This means that the diesel equipment customers buy today is also future-proofed for many years to come. The fact 
that we can ease the transition from traditional to decarbonised mining fleets for our customers is one of the key 
strategies of the Liebherr Zero Emission Mining Program."
"Exciting milestone"
Echoing this sentiment, Fortescue chief executive officer Dino Otranto said: "This is an exciting milestone for both 
Fortescue and Liebherr as we work together to develop the zero-emission solutions the world needs to step 
beyond fossil fuels.
"Our partnership with Liebherr is an example of true collaboration and how heavy industry can work together to 
decarbonise and eliminate fossil fuels."

The chief financial officer of Fortescue's energy division, Deborah Caudle, has exited the company after less than 
five months, adding to the roll call of names quitting the miner's executive ranks.
Ms Caudle was announced as the CFO of Fortescue's energy division on August 2, but did not join the miner until 
September. A Fortescue spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that Ms Caudle had departed after a corporate 
restructure.
"As part of our transition to a One Fortescue model, there has been consolidation of Fortescue's finance 
functions," the spokeswoman said.
"We thank Deborah Caudle for her fantastic contribution to Fortescue and wish her the very best. In the interim, 
Apple Paget, acting metals CFO, will take on additional responsibilities."
It is the third prominent departure from Fortescue in the past seven days; the exit of former prime minister Malcolm 
Turnbull was legally formalised last week, while external affairs boss Fiona Sugden has left to join Prime Minister 
Anthony Albanese's team.
While Fortescue has suffered high turnover across all sections of its executive ranks over the past four years, the 
churn among finance professionals in its clean energy division has been particularly high.
One of Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest's longest-serving lieutenants, Michael Masterman, ceased serving as 
CFO of the clean energy division in 2022 and is now pursuing a green iron start-up called Element Zero.
Mr Masterman was replaced by former Reserve Bank of Australia deputy governor Guy Debelle, who lasted just 
five months as CFO and severed his final links to Fortescue in September when he ceased to be a director of 
Fortescue subsidiaries.
Dr Debelle's replacement, Felicity Gooding, lasted just eight months in the role before quitting in July and being 
replaced by Ms Caudle.

Fortescue finance boss lasts five months
Long-serving chief financial officer Ian Wells - whose role straddled both Fortescue's mining and energy divisions - 
quit in January last year and left the company 22 days later.
His replacement as CFO of Fortescue's minerals division, Christine Morris, lasted barely two months before exiting 
in August. She was replaced by Ms Paget.
Ms Morris left just days after Fortescue's mining chief executive Fiona Hick exited the company after her six 
months in charge of its flagship iron ore riches.
Ratings agency Moody's said in September that Fortescue's high churn was "negative" for its credit rating.

  Former Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner is the latest big name to quit the Fortescue iron ore and 
green energy group chaired by Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest.
   Mr Gunner announced his decision on Thursday, citing personal reasons.
   "Some big personal news. I have made the decision to leave Fortescue," he said in a Facebook post.
   "Working for Andrew and Fortescue was an incredible opportunity - a dynamic company with a bold green 
energy vision."
   The retired Labor politician, who lives in Darwin, joined Fortescue Future Industries in October 2022 after 
stepping down as the territory's Labor leader several months earlier.
   He said the travel and time away from his wife and children had become too difficult to manage.
   "I will always be a friend of the Fortescue family and an advocate for Fortescue and the path they are forging," 
he said.
   "I?m taking a bit of time before deciding with the family what I do next and am now reporting for lunch box duty."
   A Fortescue group spokeswoman confirmed Mr Gunner's resignation and said it wished him well.
   Mr Gunner served as the NT chief minister from 2016 until he resigned from the post in May 2022, leaving politics 
soon after.
   His departure is the latest in a slew of recent leadership exits from the Fortescue group.
   These have included Fiona Hick, who left after six months as Fortescue Metal's group chief executive.
   Former Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle quit after 17 months with the group and chief financial officer 
Christine Morris departed just two months into that role.

Former chief minister Michael Gunner has left Australian billionaire Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest's renewable energy 
company less than six months after being promoted to head up the company's national operations.
Mr Gunner joined Fortescue Future Industries in November 2022 to lead a new Northern Australia team, before 
moving into an Australia West director role in April, overseeing work across Western Australia, South Australia and 
the NT.
In August last year he was promoted again to Australian director, but on Thursday he announced his resignation 
from the company, saying that it was "too difficult" to manage the travel demands of the job with his young family.
"Some big personal news. I have made the decision to leave Fortescue," Mr Gunner said on Facebook.
"Working for Andrew and Fortescue was an incredible opportunity - a dynamic company with a bold green energy 
vision.
"I will always be a friend of the Fortescue family and an advocate for Fortescue and the path they are forging.
"After taking on the Australian director role in August it meant more travel away from Darwin and the family, which I 
found too difficult.
"I'm taking a bit of time before deciding with the family what I do next and am now reporting for lunch box duty." A 
Fortescue spokesman said: "We respect Michael's decision, and his personal reasons for making it and wish him 
and his family well."

Former Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner has quit Andrew Forrest's Fortescue, the latest high-
profile departure from the billionaire's mining and energy empire.
Fortescue's green energy division hired Mr Gunner in -November 2022, three months after he resigned from 
parliament, one of several big name recruits at the time including Guy Debelle, the Reserve Bank's former deputy 
governor.
However, Mr Gunner has joined the procession of executives leaving Fortescue. A social media post blamed the 
amount of travel away from his base in Darwin following a promotion last year.
"After taking on the Australian director role in August it meant more travel away from Darwin and the family, which I 
found too difficult," Mr Gunner said in a LinkedIn post.
"I'm taking a bit of time before deciding with the family what I do next and am now reporting for lunchbox duty." Mr 
Gunner was initially hired to lead Fortescue Future Industries' northern Australian operations in November 2022. 
He was then promoted to a position as director of Australia and New Zealand in August last year.
"Working for Andrew and Fortescue was an incredible opportunity - a dynamic company with a bold green energy 
vision. I will always be a friend of the Fortescue family and an advocate for Fortescue and the path they are 
forging," Mr Gunner said.
A Fortescue spokesman said: "We respect Michael's decision and his personal reasons for making it, and wish him 
and his family well." Earlier this week the finance boss of Fortescue's energy division, Deborah Caudle, left the 
company after a consolidation of Fortescue's finance functions.
A revolving door of executives have jumped ship from the company in the last 12 months as pressure grows on 
Fortescue to execute a high-stakes pivot to green energy from its iron ore foundations which made its founder one 
of Australia's richest men.

Gunner quits Fortescue citing toll from travel
In August 2023, Fortescue's CEO Fiona Hick and chief financial officer Christine Morris both quit, while Dr -Debelle 
resigned as a director of Fortescue Future Industries. The company's general manager of operations planning, 
Andrew O'Dowd, also left the company in September.
The departures have added to the picture of turmoil at the company over the past few years, with the exit of at least 
a dozen members of Fortescue's executive leadership team - and substantially more senior operational managers.
Dr Forrest last year denied responsibility for the rapid turnover at the senior ranks of the company he founded, 
saying some new recruits had struggled in the "boiler room" environment at the company, but left with its best 
wishes if they were not a good fit. Fortescue received a first strike against its remuneration report at the company's 
annual shareholder meeting - with more than 52 per cent of shares voted against the motion - amid a backlash 
against the company's decision to give additional payouts to the company's former CEO and chief financial officer.

Former Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner has quit Fortescue less than 18 months after joining the 
Andrew Forrest-chaired energy and iron ore major.
His departure followed the exit of Deborah Caudle, the chief financial officer of Fortescue's energy division, this 
week and the resignation of former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull earlier in the month. All three were part of 
Fortescue's energy business, which is pursuing green hydrogen developments around the world.
Mr Gunner, who resigned as chief minister in May 2022 after leading Labor to government in 2016, said working 
with Dr Forrest "was an incredible opportunity" and he would remain "an advocate for Fortescue and the path they 
are forging".
But his departure, and those of Ms Caudle and Mr Turnbull, will bring greater investor scrutiny on Fortescue's 
energy business. There has been an extended executive exodus over the past five years, with former Reserve 
Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle lasting just five months as chief financial officer, while his successor, Felicity 
Goodman, remained in the job for eight months before being replaced by Ms Caudle.
Moody's, a major rating agency, in September said the departures represented a "credit negative, with the potential 
to impact strategy and operations, which may have implications on the group's balance sheet, financing and capital 
structure".
Fortescue's lucrative mining division has lost two chief financial officers - Ian Wells and Christine Morris - since 
August 2022. Its chief executive, Fiona Hick, was replaced by Dino Otranto in September after just six months in 
the position.
Investors have, so far, shrugged off the elevated executive turnover, with Fortescue shares more than 30 per cent 
higher over the past 12 months. Shares were down 1.3 per cent yesterday, falling 38¢ to $29.50.

A key player in Mike Cannon-Brookes' $40 billion Sun Cable venture says big renewables projects in Australia will 
struggle to overcome "nimbyism" and a lack of resolve from governments.
Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners managing director David Scaysbrook questioned the investment returns on the 
latest round of big wind and solar farm transactions struck at big prices.
He also raised doubts about the feasibility of Fortescue's stalled Gibson Island green hydrogen and ammonia 
project in Brisbane.
Quinbrook is charged with building the solar farms and transmission lines into Darwin associated with Sun Cable in 
the Northern Territory.
Mr Scaysbrook said location was everything in renewables, with the cost of delivery into constrained networks 
"astronomically higher".
Gibson Island simply couldn't access the cheapest renewable power because of its location, he argued.
"They're going to have to pay to transmit power all the way to Gibson Island through the high voltage system in 
Brisbane, and so paying full freight on all the transmission and distribution," he said.
Fortescue has said it is in talks with the Queensland and federal governments about the Gibson Island project's 
future and that Australia "suffers structurally high green electricity costs".
The other challenge for renewables providers is nimbyism, which will only get worse in more populated parts of 
Australia, Mr Scaysbrook said.
"Community acceptance is fundamental to getting your project going because governments don't have a lot of 
spine, and they actually don't have a lot of ability to do anything about resolving community opposition," he said. "It 
is becoming more acute now because the scale of the wind or solar farms that we are talking about now is greater 
Page 2 of 2
Sun Cable key player's doubts on Fortescue
than anything we have seen before. The scale of the projects we are doing now is 10-fold bigger than they were 
even five years ago."
Quinbrook remains agnostic about the cable side of Sun Cable - a 4200-kilometre undersea transmission cable that 
would connect Darwin and Singapore - and is focused on delivering its end of the bargain in the form of giant solar 
farms and onshore transmission infrastructure. It is working with potential customers within the NT government's 
Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct adjacent to the port, where Fortescue and French oil and gas major 
Total have been allocated land for green hydrogen projects. Mr Scaysbrook said if Mr Cannon-Brookes' Grok 
Ventures succeeded with the cable component to Sun Cable, Quinbrook would build more solar capacity to meet 
the extra demand.
"Our job is to lead the development, and then we have an option to invest equity in the onshore component.
"Once we can prove up the delivered cost of renewable power into the MASDP, and we're getting closer to being 
able to do that, then we can say to industry that wants to locate there, 'this is what your power cost is going to be', 
remembering that just one of these factories will consume two to three times more power than the NT currently 
produces."
Last year, the NT government set aside land at the Middle Arm precinct for Fortescue and Total as well as 
Beetaloo Basin gas field developer Tamboran Resources, vanadium play Tivan and phosphate-focused Avenira.
Mr Scaysbrook said Quinbrook was focused on the NT and north Queensland, where it's looking for backers for a 
$10 billion polysilicon plant at the Lansdown eco-industrial precinct in Townsville that would supply solar panel 
manufacturers.

If it wasn't enough that PwC's tax advice scandal trashed the firm's reputation and forced the outsourcing of its 
lucrative government services arm, it has also heaped a fresh humiliation on new PwC chief executive Kevin 
Burrowes, costing the PwC supremo his ranking on the professional services pay ladder.
As the Senate's Star Chamber again turned the screws on PwC's tax advice scandal on Friday, the hearings also 
revealed that Burrowes is enjoying a far smaller pay packet than his predecessor, Tom Seymour.
Burrowes attended Friday's Senate committee hearings complete with a platter of humble pie, or a reasonable 
facsimile of one, but still copped a scolding from Senators Deb O'Neill and Barbara Pocock.
But perhaps the greater mortification was the revelation that fronting the accounting and consulting behemoth as 
the PwC Australia chief executive is now worth a paltry $2.4m a year.
Readers may remember that former PwC boss Seymour, who jumped ship soon after the proverbial contacted the 
fan at PwC, was enjoying $4.6m a year as Grand Poobah (Australia) of the professional services giant.
But after amputating its government services arm, thought to be worth a cool $1bn, in a deal worth a whole dollar, 
Burrowes has far less of the big money to rely upon when benchmarking his pay.
Burrowes now ranks among the low to middling big dogs for his pay packet, with Deloitte boss Adam Powick pulling 
in a cool $3.5m, EY Oceania's David Larocca enjoying $2.8m a year, and KPMG's Andrew Yates basking in the 
glow of an annual $2.2m.
Worth noting also that Scyne Advisory boss Richard Gwilym is on about $922,000 a year to run PwC's former 
government consulting arm - meaning both men combined are getting paid less than Seymour was.
Departure lounge Andrew Forrest has lost yet more senior executives, with the president of Fortescue Energy's 
European arm set to depart the company after only 10 months.
Page 2 of 3
New chief executive pays price
The Australian understands Carlos Lange has quit the company. Mr Lange was appointed as the president of 
Fortescue Energy's European operations in March 2023, tasked with helping Fortescue make good on its big 
promises about the production of green energy and hydrogen across Europe.
At the same time long-term company secretary Cameron Wilson is set to take a step back from Fortescue, initially 
shifting to a part-time role as he hands over duties at the company. Mr Wilson's decision comes only a few months 
after the departure of co-company secretary and Fortescue general counsel Gemma Tually, who stepped down 
from the role in November 2023.
"We are delighted that (Cameron) has agreed to continue with the company on a part-time basis to ensure a 
smooth transition," a Fortescue spokesman said.
Both of those moves come amid a fresh wave of senior executive losses at Fortescue.
Former Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner quit the company earlier this month, after only 15 months 
with Fortescue's Energy arm. Initially appointed as Fortescue Energy's Head of Northern Australia in late 2022, Mr 
Gunner finished his period with Fortescue as the head of business development for Australia and New Zealand.
This year Fortescue Energy also lost the services of chief financial officer Deborah Caudle, less than five months 
after she was appointed to the role, with former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also formally severing ties with the 
company, and external affairs boss Fiona Sugden leaving to join the office of current Prime Minister Anthony 
Albanese.
The departure of Mr Lange - also once an executive director of Fortescue's WAE arm in Britain - extends the 
uncertainty around the company's progress in establishing a hydrogen and green energy production hub in Europe.
In 2022 Fortescue committed to delivering as much as five million tonnes of green hydrogen a year to German 
giant E. ON, one of Europe's largest power companies, with the start of deliveries around 2030.
The company also bought into a German import terminal in late 2022, and has said its first European green 
hydrogen plant is likely to be in Norway.
But the company also missed a self-imposed deadline to make a final investment decision on up to five green 
energy projects by the end of 2023, instead saying it had "fast-tracked" an investment decision on its Holmaset 
project in Norway.
Shipping news As blockbuster names go for decisions at next week's High Court sittings, you couldn't do much 
better than a showdown between Indian billionaire Gautam Adani and British metals magnate Sanjeev Gupta.
On a first glance, the prospect of a High Court call on a gloves-off stoush in the nation's top court between the 
Adani Group's Carmichael coal mine and Gupta's Whyalla steelworks should have security guards wedging them 
into the aisles with crowbars in Court No 1 in Canberra on Wednesday.
Sadly, the reality falls far short of Margin Call's hopes, expectations and sensationalist attempts to fool our loyal 
readers into reading the last third of this column.
While the case does indeed involve companies associated with both men - along with a shipping line - the actual 
dispute troubling the court appears to be the most pointless pile of guff to ever be billed in eight-minute increments 
by King's Counsel.
Essentially, the dispute is this: Carmichael commissioned Gupta's South Australian steelworks to manufacture 8669 
individual steel rails for its railway line.
Whyalla did so, and bunged them onto a ship in South Australia - owned by BBC Chartering Carriers GmbH - 
bound for Queensland's Galilee basin.Page 3 of 3
New chief executive pays price
As it turns out, somebody failed to tie them down properly in the ship's hold, so the rails apparently got bounced 
around a bit in transit, rendering them unfit for use as railway lines when they finally arrived in Mackay.
As a result Carmichael was forced to flog the lot off for scrap, fetching $656,998.51. The Adani group now, not 
unreasonably, wants someone to cough up for the difference in what it paid for the rails and what it received from 
the scrap merchants.
Although the court documents don't make it clear exactly how much is at stake, the total sum is likely to be a fair bit 
south of $10m, steel industry sources suggest.
On the face of it, a pretty simple commercial dispute, with only one likely outcome. But, no! As the matter 
approached hearings in the Federal Court over who should pay, shipping line BBC launched a bid to move the case 
to arbitration in London.
And, as is known by all close followers of admiralty and maritime law (may God protect their eternal souls), the 
Australian and British laws on the subject may read the same, but are interpreted very differently - with the British 
interpretation likely to reduce the liability of the shipping company.
The issue now facing the High Court is whether to allow this type of jurisdiction shopping, or not. Lawyers of our 
acquaintance insist it could be an immensely important point of law at some other point, or the High Court wouldn't 
bother hearing it. Irrespective, Margin Call is betting the legal teams will make more money than the cargo was 
worth by the time the case is done.

Highlight: The health of China's economy will be a key focus for investors when big miners BHP, Rio Tinto and 
Fortescue report their results this week.
Body
Investors will this week be seeking reassurance from Australia's largest miners that there are no shocks in store 
from China's economy as it kicks back into gear following a week-long holiday for the Lunar New Year.
These issues will come under intense scrutiny when BHP reports its half-year results on Tuesday, followed by Rio 
Tinto on Wednesday and then Fortescue.
The share prices of all three miners started 2024 at record highs, with iron ore prices soaring through the $US140-
mark on the promise of fresh stimulus measures in China. But these stocks retreated over the past month as 
worries returned about China's economic malaise and its impact on iron ore demand.
It is a significant issue for BHP and Rio, which both count on China for more than half of their revenue. For 
Fortescue, the figure is closer to 90 per cent.
And it will be of significance in Canberra as well, with iron ore accounting for around 60 per cent of the value of 
Australian exports to China in recent years.
"The first dark cloud is growing concerns about the Chinese property markets and Chinese economy," investment 
banking group Jefferies said in a recent report.
Jeffries also flagged concerns about non-residential construction outside China, including the US commercial real 
estate market, which is buckling under significant debt and low valuations.
"The problem, in each case, is that things are more likely to get worse before they get better," the banking group's 
analysts said.
One bright spot for China's economy is that travel and spending patterns during China's most important holiday 
break indicate that domestic consumption has rebounded, despite the economic struggle with deflation and a 
property crisis. It has primed China's sharemarkets for a strong opening this week.
ANZ senior commodity strategist Daniel Hynes doubted even a potential stimulus package from the Chinese 
government - something that investors have been discussing for months - would cure the country's economic woes.
Page 2 of 2

"I think the stimulus will help stem the fall that we've seen in property investment and construction activity, but that 
won't ignite another rally like we've seen in the past," he said.
This is crucial for Australian miners, as property and construction account for half of the 1 billion tonnes of steel 
China produces annually. But Hynes said iron ore miners were helping their own cause by recognising that growth 
in steel demand is reaching its limits.
"They're now talking about peak steel demand and that did instigate a bit of a review of their projects," he said.
Hynes said he expected this to pay off over the medium term as miners balance supply and demand.
"We actually have the iron ore market, remaining relatively tight over the next two to three years. On the back of 
that lower growth in supply."
According to Macquarie Equities, consensus estimates expected a $US6.5 billion ($10 billion) underlying profit from 
BHP for the half year, a full-year profit of $US11.6 billion from Rio for the year ending December 31, and $US3.3 
billion from Fortescue's half year.
While BHP is a diversified miner, iron ore dwarfs the contribution of the other businesses.
Macquarie forecasts that iron ore earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will reach $US9.8 
billion, followed by copper with $US3.1 billion and coal at $US1.1 billion.
BHP confirmed last week that its nickel business would make no contribution to earnings, after writing down the 
value of the loss-making business to zero.
The Albanese government subsequently added nickel to its critical minerals list, which opens access to potentially 
billions of dollars in government funding, and the West Australian government has also offered royalty relief for the 
nickel industry.
"The nickel industry supported almost 10,000 jobs, and generated sales of more than $5 billion last financial year," 
WA Premier Roger Cook said on Saturday while announcing the package.
"It is also an essential component of the state's vision of becoming a global hub for the downstream processing of 
battery metals."

production of iron ore from its key Pilbara operations falling.
Body
Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Metals Group has boosted earnings and profits despite shipments and production of 
iron ore from its key Pilbara operations falling marginally over the past half-year, due to increased maintenance at 
its sprawling network of mines.
Fortescue Metals' chief executive officer Dino Otranto labelled the first half performance "excellent", saying the 
miner's shipments, while slightly lower than a year ago, were still the company's second highest in history. Costs 
had been kept low, he said.

Fortescue reported underlying earnings of $US5.9 billion ($9 billion), 36 per cent above the previous half-year 
period, as it declared a fully franked interim dividend of $1.08 per share, 44 per cent higher, and a net profit of 
$US3.3 billion ($5.06 billion).
"Whether it's through our first green energy projects, our diversification into the high-grade segment of the iron ore 
market through Iron Bridge, or expansion of our global footprint with the Belinga iron ore project in Gabon, we 
remain committed to creating value for all our stakeholders," Otranto said.
Shipments of hematite ore fell to 95 million tonnes, about three million tonnes below the previous period, and the 
amount of ore mined decreased by 10 million tonnes to 105 million tonnes. The volume of ore processed also fell 
slightly. Fortescue attributed the drop to infrastructure maintenance activities and an increase in waste mining.
Fortescue's shares started the year at a record high as ore prices peaked above $US140 a tonne in anticipation 
China would unleash a fresh wave of stimulus to fix its ailing economy, but the miner's shares followed iron ore's 
downward trajectory in intervening weeks.
The metal, still at a 10-year-high, is now sitting around $US125. Fortescue's shares rose about 2 per cent to 
$27.79 in trade by midday.

Fortescue ups dividend, profits jump despite lower iron ore shipments
UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw said the result was "solid and clean," and off the back of elevated iron ore prices and 
tight discounting. Softer shipments or ore in January because of bad weather and a train derailment meant 
Fortescue will need a stronger second half to meet its shipping forecasts.
"This is not unusual seasonally, but we will need to monitor for disruptions over coming months," Shaw said.
At Iron Bridge, Fortescue had planned to produce five million tonnes of high-grade magnetite ore this financial year 
as it ramped up the $5.9 billion project to its full capacity of 22 million tonnes a year. The project hit a snag recently 
from continual leaks in the higher pressure section of a 240-kilometre pipeline that supplies water to the processing 
plant.
Nevertheless, the company said it reached six million tonnes of mined ore over the first half at Iron Bridge and 
shipped 84 thousand tonnes. It also shipped its first iron ore from its Belinga project in Gabon, the first time it has 
exported outside of Australia.

Fortescue Metals ( OTCQX:FSUMF) +1.5% in Thursday's trading after reporting a 41% rise in H1 net profit and 
raising its midyear payout to shareholders, beating estimates and bucking a trend of weaker earnings among the 
world's major iron ore miners.
The world's fourth-largest iron ore producer said its net profit in the six months through December 31 rose to 
US$3.34B from US$2.37B in the year-ago period, and underlying EBITDA jumped 36% Y/Y to US$5.91B; H1 
revenues from iron ore gained 24% to US$8.71B.
Fortescue ( OTCQX:FSUMF) said its average realized iron ore price rose to ~US$108/metric ton from ~US$87/ton 
a year earlier, more than offsetting a 2% drop in shipments and a 2% bump up in costs.
The miner's interim dividend equated to 65% of profits for the half, the same as the prior-year period and in line with 
its policy of paying out 50%-80% of full-year underlying profit to shareholders.
Fortescue's ( OTCQX:FSUMF) "performance in the first half of FY24 has been excellent, with the team achieving 
our second highest first half shipments," CEO Dino Otranto said.
There is "very little to see" in the H1 earnings report, Jefferies analysts say while seeing some cause for concern 
over iron ore prices, which could be at or near their peak in the current quarter, and that recent weakness after the 
Lunar New Year does not bode well for iron ore demand.
"We have been through an upgrade cycle in Fe as pricing outperformed broad-based weak expectations through 
the end of 2023," Jefferies said, as it now sees " risks more skewed to the downside."

  Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest's Fortescue Group has revealed stellar profits on near-record iron ore shipments and 
higher prices for his Pilbara ore.
   The iron ore giant reported on Thursday a net profit of $US3.3 billion for the six months to December 31, up 41 
per cent amid strong demand for the company's products in China.
   Shares in Fortescue rose 1.3 per cent or 35 cents to $27.60 by midday AEDT but investors remain wary about 
"elevated" green spending on hydrogen, shipping, trains and electric trucks.
   Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation, a key measure of profitability, rose 36 per cent to 
$US5.9 billion.
   The company is aiming for zero emissions across its iron ore operations by 2030 at a cost of more than US$6 
billion in capital.
   The energy division's chief executive Mark Hutchinson said the decarbonisation plan continues to gain 
momentum, including the testing of the first battery electric haul truck prototype in the Pilbara.
   He said important progress was made across green energy production, battery technology development, 
hydrogen systems and capital.
   "We have a strong pipeline of projects to come, and we will continue to show the same financial discipline that 
Fortescue has shown for 20 years," he said.
   Analyst Sean Williams at Moody?s Investors Service said earnings growth was supported by favourable iron ore 
prices, strong shipment levels and cost discipline.
   "Fortescue's solid financial profile sets the company in a good position given its investment spending will likely 
remain elevated in the coming years," he said.
   As well as decarbonising its mining operations, the group plans to advance its renewable energy and green 
hydrogen projects through the Fortescue Energy division.

   Plans include the deployment of an additional two to three gigawatts of renewable energy generation and battery 
storage, in addition to the deployment of a green mining fleet and locomotives.
   Total capital expenditure for the half-year period was $US1.5 billion, including $US104 million on decarbonisation 
and $US165 million by Fortescue Energy.
   Overall, the cash balance was $US4.7 billion at 31 December 2023 and gross debt was unchanged at $US5.3 
billion, resulting in net debt of $US0.6 billion.
   Guidance for full-year shipments, cost and capital expenditure was unchanged.
   "Fortescue?s performance in the first half of FY24 has been excellent, with the team achieving our second 
highest first-half shipments while maintaining our strong focus on safety and keeping our costs low," metals chief 
executive Dino Otranto said.
   Cost management will continue to be a focus, however inflationary pressures remain a risk, the company said.
   Iron Bridge went into operational production in August 2023 and completed Fortescue?s first shipment of higher 
grade magnetite product.
   The company said there was also progress on the Pilbara Energy Connect project with the completion of 320km 
of transmission lines to connect Solomon to Iron Bridge and through to Port Hedland.
   In the critical minerals portfolio, Fortescue said it was ramping up exploration activities in copper, rare earths and 
lithium.
   Fortescue Capital, launched last November, is seeking investors to support the pipeline of green hydrogen and 
green ammonia projects and emissions reduction at Pilbara operations.
   UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw said the result was "solid and clean" but maintained a "sell" rating on the stock.
   Maintaining full-year shipment guidance of 192-197 million tonnes despite weather and train derailment delays in 
January would require a strong second-half, he warned.
   "This is not unusual seasonally, but we will need to monitor for disruptions over coming months," he said.
   The group declared a fully franked interim dividend of $A1.08 per share, up from 75 cents a year earlier.

  Iron ore producer Fortescue Group is standing by plans to strip emissions from the key Australian export more 
quickly than rivals BHP and Rio Tinto.
   Fortescue has reiterated plans for $US6.2 billion in capital investment by 2030 to eliminate fossil fuel risk and 
reduce operating costs, backed by a cash windfall from high iron ore prices even as other commodities falter.
   "We're going to make sure we're 'real zero' by 2030 and we're on track to do that," the energy division's chief 
executive Mark Hutchinson told a results webcast while visiting a project in Gabon in central Africa.
   Fortescue reported a net profit of $US3.3 billion for the six months to December 31, up 41 per cent, on solid 
demand in China from the car industry and decarbonisation manufacturers as well as traditional steelmaking for the 
construction sector.
   The higher-grade Belinga project in Gabon, the company's first iron ore operations outside Australia, will prove to 
be important for green steel later this decade, according to Fortescue.
   Shares in Fortescue closed up 2.1 per cent or 58 cents at $27.83 as investors cheered the surge in profits and a 
higher dividend.
   Underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation, a key measure of profitability, rose 36 
per cent to $US5.9 billion.
   Mr Hutchinson said emissions reduction continues to gain momentum, including the testing of the first battery 
electric haul truck prototype in the Pilbara, with the decarbonisation spend to ramp up over "the next few quarters".
   Quizzed on a possible slowdown on green hydrogen, Mr Hutchinson said "we still have very ambitious plans over 
the next few years to develop this".
   "There is just no one else doing what we are doing," he said on Thursday.

   A final investment decision was taken last November on the first two hydrogen projects: a 50-megawatt 
electrolyser project in Gladstone, Queensland, and the Phoenix hydrogen hub in the United States where more 
generous subsidies are available for development.
   A green hydrogen project in Norway was likely to be "the next cab off the rank", Mr Hutchison said, as the country 
responds to climate change with plans to be a leader in renewable energy, green hydrogen and green ammonia in 
Europe.
   Analyst Sean Williams at Moody?s Investors Service said earnings growth was supported by favourable iron ore 
prices, strong shipment levels and cost discipline.
   "Fortescue's solid financial profile sets the company in a good position given its investment spending will likely 
remain elevated in the coming years," he said.
   Plans for decarbonising mining include the deployment of an additional two to three gigawatts of renewable 
energy generation and battery storage, as well as a green haulage fleet and locomotives.
   Total capital expenditure for the half-year period was $US1.5 billion, including $US104 million on decarbonisation 
and $US165 million by Fortescue Energy.
   Overall, the cash balance was $US4.7 billion at 31 December 2023 and gross debt was unchanged at $US5.3

second-half.

Fortescue has declared a $1.08 a share interim dividend on the back of last year's surge in the iron ore price, with 
the company declaring a $US3.3bn net profit for the half.
The dividend represents a payout of 65 per cent of the company's first-half profit, and comes after Fortescue 
booked EBITDA of $US5.9bn, up 36 per cent on the first half of the previous financial year.
The dividend will deliver a $1.2bn payout to the commercial and charitable interests of Andrew and Nicola Forrest, 
whose business and philanthropic affairs remain intertwined despite their separation last year.
Fortescue's Energy division booked a $US320m EBITDA loss for the half, up from $US302m in the first half of the 
previous financial year. The energy division now includes UK technology business WAE, which booked revenue of 
about $US26m for the year.
Fortescue's policy is to pay out 50 to 80 per cent of its net profit in dividends, and the mid-range payment - the 
same as its total payout ratio across last financial year - comes as the company looks to ramp up spending on its 
Pilbara iron ore mines and its green energy projects.
The iron ore giant spent $US1.52bn on capital projects in the first half of the financial year, with about $US1bn of 
that on sustaining capital for its existing Pilbara miners. Another $US165m was spent on Fortescue Energy 
projects across the globe, and another $US104m on decarbonising the company's iron ore operations.
Fortescue says it expects to spend $US3.3bn to $US3.7bn in capital for the full financial year, with about $US500m 
of that to go towards green energy projects and $US300m to $US500m on decarbonisation.
Fortescue's first half result comes after the company received an average $US108 a dry metric tonne for its iron 
ore shipments in the half, up from $US87 a tonne in the prior corresponding period, with the company booking 
$US9.5bn in revenue, up 21 per cent.
Cash production costs lifted 2 per cent to $US17.77 a wet metric tonne for the period, as Fortescue kept 
inflationary pressures in the Pilbara largely under control.

Citi analyst Paul McTaggart said the results had beaten analyst consensus estimates of a $US5.6bn EBITDA and a 
$1.04 dividend. Fortescue shares were up 2.9 per cent to $28.03 in a flat market late on Thursday morning.

Fortescue is holding on to hopes of shipping record iron ore volumes in 2023-24 after it reported a 41 per cent rise 
in first-half net profit to $US3.33 billion ($5.1 billion) on the back of stronger-than-expected iron ore prices.
But its goal of setting a fifth consecutive record looks to be challenged, with the miner shipping 2 per cent less ore 
in the six months to December 31 than in the same period last year.
A train derailment in December added to the challenge, and Fortescue mining boss Dino Otranto said the fallout 
from the accident had continued to affect productivity in January.
The result was slightly better than analysts expected and came with a fully franked $1.08 interim dividend to be paid 
on March 27.
The dividend was equivalent to 2022-23's payout ratio of 65 per cent, but 44 per cent higher than the 75¢ declared 
this time last year.
The dividend is worth $1.22 billion to the family interests of Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest and Nicola Forrest, 
who separated last year.
Barrenjoey analyst Glyn Lawcock had expected Fortescue to report a $US3.2 billion interim profit.
Speaking from Libreville in Gabon, Mr Otranto refused to give up on Fortescue's goal of shipping between 192 
million and 197 million tonnes in the year to June. Fortescue is developing an iron ore project in Belinga, Gabon, 
on the west coast of Africa.
"The remaining 4&#xBD; months are big months for us, we acknowledge that, but nothing we haven't achieved 
before," he said. Fortescue shipped 192 million tonnes last year.
Fortescue's nascent clean energy division reported $US26 million of revenue in the period and lost $US320 million 
at the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation level.

Fortescue's iron ore record hopes intact
Fortescue expects to spend $US500 million on clean energy projects in the year to June, while the clean energy 
division will also spend about $US800 million on operating expenditure.
The division had promised to put five projects before the Fortescue board for a final investment decision before 
Christmas.
That process saw the commissioning of a $US550 million green hydrogen refuelling station near Phoenix, Arizona, 
and a $US150 million plant that will make green hydrogen beside Fortescue's electrolyser factory near Gladstone.
A $US50 million "trial" plant to make green iron in the Pilbara was also commissioned by Fortescue last year.
Asked about the lack of approval for Fortescue clean energy projects in Kenya, Brazil and Europe, clean energy 
boss Mark Hutchinson said shareholders could take comfort from the fact that not all projects were getting the 
green light.
"We are going to maintain our financial discipline," he said. "We will come to market when we are ready.
"We have a great pipeline over the next two years. We are accelerating a couple of very important projects, one in 
Norway and one in Brazil. I think the next cab off the rank is going to be Norway."

Fortescue has held talks with the BP-led Asian Renewable Energy Hub over potential power deals for the mining 
giant's Pilbara iron ore operations, according to Fortescue Energy boss Mark Hutchinson, although no deal has 
been done.
Such an agreement would mark a departure from Fortescue's previous strategy of building its own wind and solar 
farms around its iron ore assets, with the company having already embarked on a major transmission line project to 
link its Pilbara operations. Fortescue has promised to end its use of fossil fuels by the end of the decade and 
become a "real zero" emitter of carbon. But to do that the company has said it needs 2 to 3 gigawatt of renewable 
energy generation, along with battery firming.
So far Fortescue has only committed to a 100 megawatt solar farm at its Iron Bridge magnetite operation and a 
60MW solar farm at its Chichester iron ore mine. But last year, as part of an investor tour of its operations, 
Fortescue flagged plans to build a gigawatt of both solar and wind generation around its mines, as well as up to 
4GWh of battery storage.
Speaking to analysts on Thursday, however, Mr Hutchinson said the company had held discussions with the 
proponents of AREH, as well as other potential renewable energy providers in the region.
AREH is 48 per cent owned by fossil fuel giant BP, and includes Macquarie, CWP Global and Intercontinental 
Energy as joint venture partners. The consortium plans to build a giant 26GW of combined solar and wind power on 
a 6500 sq km site north east of the Port Hedland iron ore export hub.
"We are talking to many parties including the BP and Intercontinental Energy team and will continue to do so," Mr 
Hutchinson said. "This is one ecosystem which we want to make sure gets developed in Australia. And we want to 
make sure we also have the most efficient energy for our own use. So we'll continue to have discussions with a 
number of different parties." Last year Rio Tinto also switched its Pilbara renewable energy strategy to include third 
party energy providers, partly citing tight supply chains and intense competition for solar and wind energy 
generation equipment.

Mr Hutchinson's comments came after Fortescue declared another bumper dividend on the back of last year's 
surge in the iron ore price, delivering holders a $1.08 a share interim dividend after declaring a $US3.3bn net profit 
for the half.
The dividend represents a payout of 65 per cent of the company's first-half profit, and comes after Fortescue 
booked earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $US5.9bn, up 36 per cent on the 
first half of the previous financial year. Fortescue's energy division booked a $US320m EBITDA loss for the half, 
up from a $US302m loss in the first half of the previous financial year.
The energy division now includes UK technology business WAE, which booked revenue of about $US26m for the 
year.
Fortescue's policy is to pay out 50 to 80 per cent of its net profit in dividends, and the mid-range payment - the 
same as its total payout ratio across last financial year - comes as the company looks to ramp up spending on its 
Pilbara iron ore mines and its green energy projects. The iron ore giant spent $US1.52bn on capital projects in the

Another $US165m was spent on Fortescue Energy projects across the globe, and another $US104m on

Fortescue says it expects to spend $US3.3bn to $US3.7bn in capital for the full financial year, with about $US500m 
of that to go towards green energy projects and $US300m to $US500m on decarbonisation.

shipments in the half, up from $US87 a tonne in the prior corresponding period, with the group booking $US9.5bn in 
revenue, up 21 per cent.
Cash production costs lifted 2 per cent to $US17.77 a wet tonne for the period as Fortescue kept inflationary 
pressures in the Pilbara largely under control.
Citi analyst Paul McTaggart said the results had beaten analyst consensus estimates of a $US5.6bn EBITDA and a 
$1.04 dividend. Fortescue shares closed up 58c to $27.83 on Thursday.

Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest has blamed an exodus of senior bosses on the transition from a 
"fossil fuel-burning company to a green energy company", but insists a -period of high turnover is starting to settle 
down.
Dr Forrest said former Northern Territory chief minister -Michael Gunner and ex-Reserve Bank deputy governor 
Guy Debelle - two recent high-profile departures - remained "great friends of ours", and pushed back against the 
idea that the company had suffered from higher than normal executive departures.
"I don't believe we have a conga line, as you dramatically point out," Dr Forrest told the National Press Club in 
Canberra on Monday in response to a -question.
"We employ 22,000 people. When you go from a fossil fuel-burning company to a green energy company, you're 
going to lose people who say, 'what are you doing? You've got this fantastic economic model. You have the most 
successful company shareholder returns in decades in our company. Why are you fiddling around with it?' " Mr 
Gunner quit the company earlier this month, after only 15 months with Fortescue's Energy arm. On social media, 
he blamed the amount of travel away from his base in Darwin following a promotion last year.
A revolving door of executives have jumped ship from the company in the past 12 months as pressure grows on 
Fortescue to execute a high-stakes pivot to green energy from its iron ore foundations that made its founder one of 
Australia's richest men.
In August last year, Fortescue's chief executive, Fiona Hick, and chief financial officer Christine Morris both quit, 
while Dr Debelle resigned as a director of Fortescue Future Industries.
Dr Forrest last year said executives who had left the iron ore major had struggled to cope with the -"boiler room" 
conditions of the company and were not following his green vision.
However, Dr Forrest said on Monday that a degree of turnover was expected as the company transitioned from a 
pure iron ore producer to a green energy company with lofty global renewable hydrogen ambitions.

Forrest blames green move for executive exodus
"The reason is we want to continue that track record. We're not happy just sitting on our laurels with what we've 
achieved already. Lots of people think that's not for them, and I think that's completely fine," Dr Forrest said.
"But when you look at, say, Fortescue to, say, the mining industry per se, we're running at about half the turnover 
of the mining industry at Fortescue." Dr Forrest said Fortescue's board of directors were long term, but senior 
management was "changing â€¦ all the time". He said: "Change is necessary if you're going to improve. You cannot 
improve without change.
"I think we're settling it down now. I think that Dino (Otranto), Shelley (Robertson) and (Mark) Hutch (Hutchinson) 
are a really great team. They're working super well together.
"They're driving our green energy transformation as well as keeping up record production and profits. I'm really 
comfortable with them." The president of Fortescue Energy's European arm, Carlos Lange, quit the company this 
month after only 10 months.
Its long-term company secretary, Cameron Wilson, is also set to take a step back from Fortescue, initially shifting 
to a part-time role as he hands over duties at the company. Mr Wilson's decision comes only a few months after the 
departure of co-company secretary and Fortescue general counsel Gemma Tually, who stepped down from the 
role in November last year.
This year Fortescue Energy also lost the services of chief -financial officer Deborah Caudle, less than five months 
after she was appointed to the role, with former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also formally severing ties with the 
company, and external affairs boss Fiona Sugden leaving to join the office of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. 
Fortescue has promised to end its use of fossil fuels by the end of the decade and become a "real zero" emitter of 
carbon.

Magmatic Resources Ltd (ASX:MAG) has garnered strong support from one of the biggest names in Australian 
mining, executing a farm-in and joint venture agreement with FMG Resources Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Fortescue 
Ltd (ASX:FMG).
Under the agreement, Fortescue will commit $14 million over a six-year period to earn up to a 75% interest in the 
Myall Project.
At Myall, MAG is exploring for copper and gold, having already generated a resource estimate containing 293,000 
tonnes of copper, 237,000 ounces of gold and 2.8 million ounces of silver for the Corvette and Kingswood 
Prospects.
Magmatic subsidiary Modeling Resources Pty Ltd will remain the operator of the project during the initial period of 
the farm-in for up to four years.
Fortescue has also opted to become a cornerstone investor in Magmatic, buying almost 76 million shares for $3.17 
million (a 10% premium) to hold a 19.9% stake in the company.
Signatures of a Tier-1 deposit
"We are excited to joint venture and partner with Fortescue to advance our exploration efforts across the Myall 
Project area," Magmatic Resources executive chair David Richardson said.

"Myall has many of the signatures of a Tier 1 copper-gold deposit and Magmatic has recognised the need to partner 
with a major to further advance the project following the maiden resource.
"Fortescue's cornerstone investment in MAG will allow the Company to simultaneously advance our other two 
projects at Wellington North and Parkes which are strategically located near Alkane Resources Boda-Kaiser 
deposits and Tomingley Gold Operations respectively."
The proceeds from Fortescue's stock purchase will go to exploration at the Wellington North and Parkes Projects, 
which surround Alkane Resources' Boda-Kaiser deposits with a mineral resource of 15.7 million ounces gold 
equivalent.

Fortescue has pumped more money into its decade-long search for copper and gold in NSW by taking a 19.9 per 
cent stake in ASX-listed minnow Magmatic Resources.
Pre-revenue Magmatic has been drilling for copper, gold and silver near Narromine, a geological district made 
famous by big copper and gold mines such as Newmont's Cadia and Evolution Mining's Northparkes operation.
Fortescue has been trying to find the extension of Cadia's rich gold and copper geology for the best part of a 
decade, after previously helping to fund exploration in the district through a privately held explorer called Gold and 
Copper Resources.
The iron ore miner will pay $3.7 million for a 19.9 per cent stake in Magmatic, which also has exploration projects 
near Parkes and Wellington.
Fortescue will spend at least a further $3 million on drilling at Magmatic's Myall prospect near Narromine.
"Myall has many of the signatures of a tier 1 copper-gold deposit and Magmatic has recognised the need to partner 
with a major to further advance the project following the maiden resource," Magmatic executive chairman David 
Richardson said.
The iron ore miner could spend a total of $17.7 million over six years on drilling Magmatic's targets and buying 
shares. Under that scenario, Fortescue would emerge with 19.9 per cent of Magmatic and 75 per cent ownership 
of the Myall project. The partnership illustrates the effort Fortescue is making to diversify into other minerals, as 
well as its highly publicised pivot into clean energy products.
Fortescue has explored extensively across Western Australia and South America for minerals such as lithium and 
copper and has also stated an interest in rare earth elements.
Magmatic shares rose by more than 37 per cent after Fortescue's interest was revealed on Friday, earning it a 
market capitalisation of $19 million. Fortescue will pay 4.884¢ for each of the shares it subscribes for.

As long as its shareholding remains below the 20 per cent threshold, Fortescue will have the right to one Magmatic 
board seat. If its ownership increases, Fortescue gets the right to another seat provided its grip on the register is 
sustained at 20 per cent or higher.
Magmatic shares raced ahead of Fortescue's subscription price, fetching the highest level since December.
Magmatic shares rose 38 per cent.

An exodus of senior staff from Fortescue was due to a cultural misalignment and not an indication of underlying 
woes, two of the company's most senior executives say, insisting that the upheaval has now settled.
Fortescue has in recent years significantly stepped up its investment in renewable projects to cash in on the global 
transition to green energy.
However, this has led to an exodus of high-level management and raised investor concerns about the capacity of 
the company to execute its high-stakes pivot to green energy from its iron ore foundations, which made its founder 
one of Australia's richest men.
Notable hires such as former NT chief minister Michael Gunner and deputy RBA governor Guy Debelle have left 
Andrew Forrest's company in recent months.
However Fortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson and Fortescue Metals head Dino Otranto said the 
exodus was indicative of the company's unique culture and a desire of some to change an organisation that did not 
need changing.
"Fortescue is unique and some people come in and think they can fix it, that it needs to be run differently, but we 
don't need to be fixed," said Mr Hutchinson.
"We've got to change and evolve. I think things will settle down." The comments came just weeks after Dr Forrest 
rejected suggestions the company has faced upheaval and the green agenda has been a catalyst for the exits.
"We employ 22,000 people. When you go from a fossil fuel-burning company to a green energy company, you're 
going to lose people who say, 'what are you doing? You've got this fantastic economic model. You have the most 
successful company shareholder returns in decades in our company. Why are you fiddling around with it?' " said Dr 
Forrest.
Mr Otranto acknowledged the commitment to renewable energy had been a concern to many within the 
organisation.

Fortescue exodus blamed on culture
"Eighteen months ago when we announced the pivot into green energy, we were a bit anxious, to be honest," said 
Mr Otranto.
Fortescue is aiming to capitalise on demand for zero-emission energy sources, but there is broad concern about 
the capacity of many countries to meet emissions targets as new renewable energy generation projects take longer 
than expected to materialise. The sluggish transition has fuelled fierce debate about the possibility of nuclear 
energy.
It is currently banned in Australia, but the Coalition has proposed using small modular nuclear reactors to replace 
coal-fired power.
The Coalition insists nuclear power is the only viable means to achieve Australia's 2050 net zero emission targets, 
but federal Energy Minister Chris Bowen insists independent evidence shows the fuel source remains prohibitively 
expensive.
Dr Forrest has rejected the nuclear plan, insisting it amounts to "dividing us with the false hope that we can cling to 
fossil fuels forever". Echoing his boss, Mr Hutchinson said nuclear power was "not the answer", and Australia 
should instead focus on plentiful opportunities in renewable energy.

Fortescue Energy boss Mark Hutchinson says Australia must get power prices down to about $US30 ($45.36) a 
megawatt hour if it wants to be a hydrogen superpower, under a goal that would effectively require a halving of 
power prices across much of the eastern states.
Mr Hutchinson's power price challenge came as he warned that Fortescue and Incitec Pivot would find it "tough" to 
proceed with a plan to retrofit Queensland's Gibson Island fertiliser plant towards a future in hydrogen and ammonia 
unless governments helped mitigate the high cost of clean energy.
Gibson Island had traditionally consumed large volumes of methane gas - a compound of carbon and hydrogen - to 
make ammonia, which is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen.
But Fortescue, Incitec and taxpayer agencies such as the Australian Renewable Energy Agency have funded 
studies into a retrofit of Gibson Island, where an electrolyser would make green hydrogen at the site for synthesis 
with nitrogen to make "green ammonia".
Green ammonia can be combusted as a source of energy but is also considered the easiest way to transport 
hydrogen long distances.
Fortescue was expected to take a final investment decision on Gibson Island in late 2023, but the project has not 
yet been approved and the company contracted to supply solar power to the project, Genex, has given Fortescue 
until March 31 to decide.
Mr Hutchinson told The Australian Financial Review Business Summit that high power prices were the main 
impediment at Gibson Island.
"We've been working very, very hard on it," he said. "But it's tough based on the current power prices when we're 
looking at competing globally. It's a tough decision.
"So we're working very closely with the Queensland government and federal government to figure out a way to 
make it happen because it's a bit of a litmus test for the rest of the hydrogen industry in Australia, to be honest.
Page 2 of 2
Hydrogen's half price challenge Clean energy
"We're very keen to get it up."
"Green" hydrogen can be made with zero or low carbon emissions if renewable electricity is passed through water 
to separate the fluid into its constituent parts, oxygen and hydrogen.
Fortescue has travelled the world over the past five years searching for the cheapest sources of clean power to 
generate affordable green hydrogen.
The company expects to approve a green hydrogen project in Norway this year which would be powered by carbon-
free hydroelectricity.
"If you look around the world where you can get cheap renewable power, competitive renewable power is below 
$US30 a megawatt hour," he said.
"That should really be the target and particularly when you're looking at really what will be a global market to supply 
green ammonia, green hydrogen. So that's kind of the goal."
Average annual power prices were above $100 per megawatt hour in NSW, Queensland and South Australia in 
2023, according to data published by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER).
The same AER data found average annual power prices in Tasmania were $56 per megawatt hour while Victorian 
prices averaged slightly higher than Tasmania.
Asked about the large number of departures from Fortescue's executive ranks over the past four years, Mr 
Hutchinson said new recruits needed to fit into the company's unique culture, not vice versa.
"Some people come in and think they [have to] fix it," he said. "That's just not Fortescue. We don't need to be 
fixed."

Billionaire Andrew Forrest says Jim Chalmers is "completely correct" in urging Australia to have more ambition 
about its long-term growth targets, with the Fortescue founder saying "if China can do 5 per cent, there's no reason 
why we can't too".
The Treasurer laid down a challenge to the country's top corporate leaders at a Business Council of Australia 
dinner last week, urging them to invest in "new foundations for growth" as the "global economic deck gets 
reshuffled".
Australia's richest man endorsed Dr Chalmers' analysis that the global energy transition created huge economic 
opportunities that could help lift Australia's long-term growth targets.
"Jim is completely correct," the Fortescue executive chairman told The Australian in an interview on Tuesday.
Dr Forrest said the Treasurer had "the levers of power" to make Australia's actual long-term growth rate a multiple 
of Canberra's current projections of 2.2 per cent a year.
"If China can do 5 per cent, there's no reason why we can't too. Our population is hard- working. Our population is 
smart. Our population is determined. We just happen to have all the resources which China doesn't," he said.
The iron ore and clean energy entrepreneur was speaking from Beijing, where he has been meeting with China's 
leaders. Over the weekend, along with BHP CEO Mike Henry and Rio Tinto's Jakob Stausholm, he was at the 
China Development Forum, an event held in Beijing as many international businesses have been debating their 
future in the world's second-biggest economy.
Dr Forrest said Beijing was being "very welcoming" of international businesses, but the tense geopolitical 
environment posed challenges. "It's becoming more difficult because of bellicose North American attitudes. And 
China kicks an own goal through these cyber activities into democratic institutions. That is just intolerable," he told 
The Australian.
Page 2 of 3
Chalmers right on economy: Forrest
On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Penny Wong joined her counterparts from Britain, the US and New Zealand in calling 
out "China state-backed actors" that had targeted democratic institutions and parliamentarians in Britain.
Dr Forrest said that China's cyber interference "might not be an act of war, but it's hostile".
"I feel that China is such a huge and vast organisation that, generally, it's attitude is to be very friendly with the rest 
of the world. But it does trip up," he said.
Beijing never interfered with supplies of iron ore during its economic coercion campaign on Australia, but the tense 
relationship raised anxiety among all China-exposed businesses. Later this week, Beijing is expected to remove the 
punitive tariffs it imposed on the Australian wine industry in November 2020.
Dr Forrest welcomed the improvement in the relationship, which he said had gone from "childish and politically 
motivated" to "maturity".
"I see a real consolidation of the relationship and trust building back into the Australia-China bilateral relationship. 
And that is necessary to continue the growth of the economies of both countries," he said.
China-reliant miners BHP, Rio Tinto and Fortescue are -Australia's three biggest taxpayers. A fall in iron ore prices 
by almost 25 per cent this year to just over $US105 a tonne ($160 a tonne) is being closely watched by the 
Treasury in Canberra.
The founder of Fortescue, the "third force" of Australia's iron ore export trade, said he remained confident about 
the "constant demand" from China's steelmaking industry.
"Ebbs and flows, for sure, you see that. But the big mega trends are unchanged," he said.
He said a private dinner on Sunday night with Yi Gang, the former governor of the People's Bank of China, had 
reaffirmed that confidence.
The country's former central bank chief, who stood down last July, detailed various fiscal stimulus measures Beijing 
was using to support housing, car ownership and the purchase of other big consumer items.
Dr Forrest said China's latest growth target of "about 5 per cent" announced by Premier Li Qiang earlier this month 
would have been "a bit of a yawn" a decade ago. But he said growth at that rate for an economy as "massive" as 
China's now would lead to "a serious increase in goods and services â€¦ from around the world".
On Thursday, the Fortescue founder will speak at the Boao Forum, another business forum held on China's 
Hainan island.
Dr Forrest's address will focus on the clean energy transition and China's role in it.
Since last year's Boao Forum, Beijing has built and installed 260 to 300 gigawatts of renewable energy generation, 
according to analysts at Bloomberg.
That "huge uptick" has supported Fortescue's iron ore business, which is being used in "all the infrastructure it 
takes to create green energy and connect it to the grid," Dr Forrest said.
Last week, industry leaders at an oil and gas conference in Houston said the huge infrastructure rollout to support 
energy grids, along with power-hungry artificial intelligence data centres and world population increases, were 
extending the commercial viability of fossil fuels.
Dr Forrest said those comments had been useful for exposing the "lip service" of the fossil fuel industry only months 
after climate scientists declared 2023 the hottest year on record.Page 3 of 3
Chalmers right on economy: Forrest
"The climate is going to hell in a handbag unless we turn it around," he told The Australian. "The fossil fuel 
industry's lip service to the energy transition is no more than that. It's like carbon sequestration. It's literally the 
same old lie but waiting for the next new idiot to come along and believe it," he said.

Fortescue has allowed a key deadline to buy green energy for its stalled Gibson Island hydrogen plant to lapse, as 
renewable energy company Genex says it is talking to other potential buyers for energy from its proposed Bulli 
Creek solar farm.
The lapse throws fresh doubt over the viability of the Gibson Island project, once the flagship of Fortescue's 
proposed hydrogen production centres in Australia, but which the company has seemingly set aside as it struggles 
to find returns at Australian power prices.
The failure of Fortescue to meet a twice-extended March 31 deadline to make a final investment decision on 
building a hydrogen production plant at Incitec Pivot's former Queensland fertiliser plant also has Genex scrambling 
to find a replacement to anchor the generation hub's construction.
The Andrew Forrest-led company signed a deal with Genex for up to 337.5 megawatts of annual capacity from the 
proposed 2GW solar farm in October 2023. The deal was to underpin the first 450MW stage of the solar farm's 
construction, allowing Genex to look for additional contracts to upsize its construction to 775MW and target an 
eventual 2GW of solar and battery capacity.
But, despite long having flagged plans to make a final investment decision by the end of 2023 - along with partner 
Incitec Pivot - Fortescue dropped Gibson Island from its top priority list only six weeks after signing on with Genex, 
saying it was still working on front-end engineering and design studies "as Australia struggles to shed its petrostate 
status and still suffers structurally high green electricity costs".
In December, Genex extended Fortescue's deadline to make a final investment decision until the end of February, 
then tacked on an additional month.
That deadline has also lapsed and, while Genex said on Tuesday a path was still open for Fortescue to buy power 
from the proposed 5000ha solar farm, the company also flagged talks with alternative buyers for the energy.

Genex seeks new solar buyers
Genex said Fortescue had -neither satisfied or waived the construction by the new March 31 deadline, leaving the 
door ajar for the iron ore and would-be renewable energy major to make good on the October power purchase 
agreement.
Incitec declined to comment on Tuesday, but a Fortescue spokeswoman said the company was still "progressing" 
the Gibson Island project, but "we have more work to do". She said: "We are approaching this project with the same 
financial discipline Fortescue has shown for 20 years." But Genex said it was also involved in ongoing talks over 
additional power contracts, and Fortescue's failure to meet the latest deadline "has no material impact on the 
project timeline or such discussions" - despite confirming that it believed the agreement was on foot, and must be 
confirmed or terminated before the company could close financing for Bulli Creek.
"Genex is continuing discussions with external parties for further solar offtake which would allow the initial capacity 
of the project to be increased to up to 775MW to become the largest grid-connected solar farm in Australia," the 
company said.
"Genex continues to expect that such discussions will conclude and the size of Bulli Creek confirmed by mid-2024, 
which will support the target of a final investment decision for the first-stage project in the second half of the year." 
Hydrogen produced at Gibson Island was to have been used to produce ammonia at Incitec's mothballed fertiliser 
plant nearby.
The Australian understands a key factor in the decision to put the project on the backburner last year was 
Fortescue's failure to find an external buyer for ammonia from the plant, with Incitec rival Orica believed to have 
turned down an offtake agreement unless Fortescue guaranteed it would then buy explosives produced using the 
plant's ammonia for use at its own mines.
Analysts have long doubted the viability of Gibson Island, with Goldman analysts last year tipping construction costs 
of $US1.5bn ($2.3bn) and production costs of about $US5.50-$US6 a kilogram of hydrogen.
Genex shares closed up 1c at $25.5c on Tuesday, with Fortescue down 28c at $25.42.
A month ago Genex received a $381m takeover bid from Japan's Electric Power Development, known as J-Power, 
one of Japan's largest electricity companies, sending shares in the pure-play renewable energy developer up more 
30 per cent. Genex said on Tuesday the exclusivity period had been extended to April 8 with a view to reaching a 
deal.
J-Power has also offered a back-up offer to secure Genex in the event that not enough of Genex's shareholders 
vote in favour of the bid. J-Power is offering a slightly lower amount of 27c in cash that is conditional on support 
from Genex shareholders owning at least 50.1 per cent of the Australian renewable energy company. The 
alternative structure comes amid concerns that a one-time suitor for Genex, Skip Capital, could block the deal.

  For almost 20 years, Yindjibarndi people of the Pilbara have been battling iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group, 
the company founded by billionaire Andrew Forrest.
   Some traditional owners say the rifts between family and community members caused by the dispute may never 
heal.
   The long-running native title fight is back in the Federal Court on Monday after years of legal action.
   The case will finally determine whether Yindjibarndi native title holders should be compensated for Fortescue 
mining on their land for years without agreement.
   A Fortescue spokesperson said in a statement the company was committed to seeing the matter settled and was 
prepared to pay compensation.
   But in court documents the company contends the amount should "not entitle a claim for royalties calculated by 
reference to the value of iron ore at the FMG tenements or any rent or royalties paid by FMG to the State".
   "The question that must be answered is: what is the value of the native title rights and interests held by the YP 
(Yindjibarndi people) that have been lost, diminished, impaired or affected?"
   In 2017, the Federal Court recognised the Yindjibarndi had exclusive possession over the area of land where 
most of FMG's Solomon mine is located.
   FMG's Solomon hub, made up of the Firetail, Kings Valley and Queens Valley iron ore mines, together have an 
annual production range of 65 to 70 million tonnes.
   When Fortescue began planning the Solomon hub it started negotiating with the Yindjibarndi Aboriginal 
Corporation (YAC), whose members including Stanley Warrie conducted heritage surveys for the project, thinking 
that would mean protection of important sites.
   The relationship began to sour in 2007 when Yindjibarndi people realised FMG could legally destroy their sacred 
sites and was doing so in construction of the mine.

WA:Yindjibarndi compensation case returns to court
   When YAC refused to accept FMG's royalty offer, the miner gave financial backing to a break-away group, Wirlu-
Murra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation, which paid people $500 each to attend a meeting that voted in favour of 
the deal in 2010.
   "The split between YAC and WYAC has changed everything ... some of the young people go against each other 
from each side, fighting in the streets," Mr Warrie told the court in an on-country hearing in April 2023.
   "We try to tell them 'No, we don't go about it this way' and we try to do the right thing but I don't think we will ever 
be able to bring peace back to the community.
   "FMG has caused this split."
   FMG says social disharmony isn't compensable and the company did not cause it.
   Since mining began at Solomon in 2013, FMG has shipped iron ore reportedly worth about $50 billion, legally 
destroying dozens of significant Yindjibarndi sites.
   FMG has not paid the recognised native title holders a cent.
   In the upcoming hearings expert witnesses will give evidence on the economic, environmental and social damage 
resulting from the mine.
   Their exclusive native title rights over this land were affirmed by the High Court in 2020, which refused FMG 
special leave to appeal.

Fortescue will open Australia's largest electrolyser manufacturing facility in Gladstone on Monday as part of plans 
by the Andrew Forrest-backed mining giant to become a major force in hydrogen and renewable energy.
The 15,000sq m advanced manufacturing facility in Queensland, constructed and fully commissioned in two years, 
will have capacity to produce over 2GW of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolyser stacks annually.
The launch has paved the way for the Queensland government to sign off on the next phase of the facility - a 50MW 
green hydrogen production facility called PEM50.
Fortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson said the facility had positioned Fortescue as a large-scale 
producer of what would be an increasingly sought-after commodity in the global shift to green energy.
"We're strategically focused on building out our energy business," he said. "Not only are we developing a pipeline of 
green energy projects, we're also now designing and manufacturing the specialised equipment and technology that 
will underpin our green hydrogen projects and that of others." Mr Hutchinson said the facilitywould produce 
electrolysers designed in-house by Fortescue, establishing the company as an original equipment manufacturer.
"The process of splitting hydrogen and oxygen isn't new, but the innovative ways the world is looking to use green 
hydrogen to decarbonise are, and that means demand for green hydrogen and for the electrolysers to produce it is 
growing rapidly," Mr Hutchinson said.
The Queensland government supported the site's development, providing an electrical substation, road network, 
communications and a local scheme water connection, as well as the allocation of land.
The federal government tipped $44m in under the collaboration stream of the Modern Manufacturing Initiative.
Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest will be in Gladstone to launch the site with representatives from 
Queensland government including Premier Steven Miles, and federal Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic.

Forrest pursues green dream
"Together we have laid the cornerstone for what will be a massive new manufacturing industry in Australia creating 
the potential for thousands of new green energy jobs," Dr Forrest said.
More than 100 jobs were created during the construction process. The facility on the outskirts of Gladstone will 
ultimately underpin more than 300 direct and indirect jobs.
Electrolysers pass an electrical current through water, splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen.
The electrolyser facility is the first stage of a wider Green Energy Manufacturing Centre being developed by 
Fortescue on the 100ha Gladstone site. The next phases will include a hydrogen system testing facility and 
Fortescue's PEM50 green hydrogen project.
PEM50 will receive development approval from Queensland's Coordinator-General on Monday, paving the way for 
construction to begin.
It will use the locally made Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysers with approval to produce green 
hydrogen for local and export markets. Once operational it will be Fortescue's first commercial-scale green 
hydrogen facility.
"Queensland is now leading the nation on investment in renewable energy, and we are now seeing that translate 
into good manufacturing jobs in our regions," Mr Miles said.
"This is why one of my first announcements as Premier was to commit to 75 per cent emissions reduction by 2035 
on the path to net zero because it means accelerating investment in good clean economy jobs in our industrial 
heartlands." Mr Husic said: "This hydrogen gigafactory shows what can be achieved when government and industry 
work together."

  An Australian first manufacturing facility that will develop hydrogen electrolysers has opened in central 
Queensland.
   Fortescue Future Industries on Monday officially opened its electrolyser plant on a 100-hectare site in Gladstone.
   It is the first stage of a wider green energy manufacturing centre that will export green hydrogen electrolysers to 
domestic and international markets, with approvals for stage two signed off by the Queensland government on 
Monday.
   Electrolysers produce hydrogen by using electricity to split water molecules into their component elements, 
hydrogen and oxygen.
   Initial production capacity for Fortescue's facility is forecast at more than two gigawatts per annum.
   Altogether the facility at full capacity over a 10-year period could sell electrolysers that produce about 11 million 
tonnes of green hydrogen, the equivalent of converting 40 per cent of the cars in Australia to hydrogen, FFI Energy 
CEO Mark Hutchinson said.
   Stage two of the project is a 50-megawatt green hydrogen facility known as PEM50 that will use locally made 
Proton Exchange Membrane electrolysers, with approval to produce green hydrogen for domestic and international 
exports.
   Once operational, it will be Fortescue's first commercial-scale green hydrogen facility.
   The electrolyser factory was previously a 50-50 joint venture between Fortescue Future Industries and US 
partner Plug Power, before the latter exited in January 2023.
   It is expected the facility will turn Gladstone into a leading manufacturer of green energy technology, Mr 
Hutchinson said.
   "The machines that are produced here are miracle machines," he told reporters on Monday.

   "It's really the ability to take renewable energy from somewhere in the world to somewhere else in a molecule 
form.
   "This is really the first time that we can see we have a real tangible alternative to fossil fuels."
   Queensland Premier Steven Miles said the facility will be Australia?s largest manufacturer of hydrogen 
electrolysers and one of the largest in the world.
   ?Queensland is now leading the nation on investment in renewable energy, and we are now seeing that translate 
into good manufacturing jobs in our regions," he said.

Highlight: As hearings in a $500-plus million compensation case against Fortescue Metals Group resume, a 
clinical psychologist says traditional owners report significant trauma associated with mining in their community.
Body
A clinical psychologist has compared the impact of alcohol abuse in a West Australian remote community with the 
effects of mining on culture and heritage.
The landmark legal battle between the Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation (YAC) and Andrew Forrest's mining giant 
Fortescue Metals Group (FMG) resumed in the Federal Court this week.
Traditional owners are seeking more than $500 million in unpaid royalties and interest as well as damages for 
cultural and spiritual losses allegedly caused by mining.
The Fortescue operation at the centre of the issue is the highly profitable Solomon hub, which is in the state's north 
and has reportedly produced about $50 billion in iron ore since 2013.
But the miner has never had an Indigenous land use agreement with Yindjibarndi people, who have held native title 
over much of the area since 2017, meaning the miner was essentially digging without permission.
YAC has claimed some of these cultural losses were caused by FMG's decision to back a splinter group known as 
the Wirlu-murra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation to help progress its mining ambitions.
Miner's impact comparable to alcohol: psychologist
During a hearing on Tuesday, clinical psychologist Jeff Nelson, an Aboriginal man from Cairns, told the court the 
impact of mining on Yindjibarndi people could be compared to the social impacts of heavy drinking.
Page 2 of 2
Fortescue Metals Group's Pilbara mining activity compared to alcohol abuse in court testimony
Many Yindjibarndi people live in the small town of Roebourne, which had a long history of social issues and alcohol 
abuse connected to the local Victoria Hotel, now closed.
The building has since been reclaimed by the Yindjibarndi community and used as a cultural centre.
"The Yindjibarndi closed down the Vic Hotel … which definitely slowed down the intake of alcohol, [but] they can't 
just say no to the ongoing mining that's happening at Solomon Hub," Dr Nelson said.
"They undertook the step, even if the outcome wasn't as successful as they would have liked, they were proactive."
Dr Nelson's full evidence was tendered as a written document and only elements of his evidence were talked about 
in open court, with his full evidence to be made public at a later date.
As part of his written evidence, Dr Nelson interviewed Yindjibarndi people, and he said in court they all described 
significant individual trauma, which many connected to "the FMG experience".
Lawyers representing the WA government, which is also a respondent, questioned whether Dr Nelson could 
realistically gauge community views based on a relatively small number of interviews.
In response, Dr Nelson said many of the interviewees were community leaders and Yindjibarndi elders who could 
speak on behalf of the broader group.
Last year the Federal Court heard evidence on-country in the remote Pilbara from traditional owners about the toll 
the saga had taken on the community.
The trial is expected to hear more evidence in the coming weeks from a range of anthropological, environmental 
and economic experts.

Andrew Forrest-backed mining giant Fortescue plans to ramp up its green ambitions and roll out hydrogen 
electrolyser manufacturing facilities into more locations after launching its first in Queensland.
The 15,000sq m advanced manufacturing facility in Gladstone, which was officially opened on Monday, has the 
capacity to produce more than 2GW of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser stacks annually.
The company, which counts billionaire Mr Forrest as its largest shareholder, expects the first electrolyser stacks to 
be rolled out commercially from 2025 and is in talks with interested parties globally as it looks to build its order 
books.
Fortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson told The Australian that the company would look to roll out 
more electrolyser manufacturing facilities but not in Australia, adding that the US was at the top of its wish list.
"We'll definitely do one in the US because the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) incentives to do this in America are 
enormous. And then other countries that also have the ambition to do exactly the same," he said.
Mr Hutchinson said the technology behind the manufacturing process for electrolysers made it easy to roll out in 
any country that wanted to work with Fortescue.
"The beautiful thing about (this facility) is it's fully automated. We can do it anywhere," he said.
"You don't have to think about labour or train people, so you just build a fully automated facility and off we go." 
Fortescue will now test the technology as it looks to slowly ramp up the facility to reach its peak capacity of more 
than 2GW and did not expect customers to receive orders until 2025.
"We're building a test facility which will hopefully be in production, which will make hydrogen from about September, 
October this year.
And then we've actually got to do it at an industrial scale," Mr Hutchinson said.

Fortescue to roll out more electrolyser plants after Gladstone
"Realistically, it's going to be 2025 (until the product is rolled out commercially) by the time we get the testing done 
and the sales and we make them," he said.
The Queensland government, which held its cabinet meeting on the factory floor on Monday, signed off on the next 
stage, PEM50.
It will use the locally made PEM electrolysers to produce green hydrogen for local and export markets.
Once operational it will be the first commercial-scale green hydrogen facility for Fortescue.
Federal Industry and Science Minister Ed Husic told The Australian that the Fortescue site would play a pivotal role 
in Australia's transition to net zero and opened the door for more businesses locally and internationally to invest in 
the space.
"It shows regional Australia has a role to play in the transition to net zero in manufacturing. And that's the big thing 
for me, is to see that opportunity spread out. We want everyone to pitch in from all corners of the country," he said.
"The (Fortescue sites) are important examples that businesses and other sections of industry can see what can be 
done. It is a signal to send about the capacity for regional Australia and to get the job done." Mr Hutchinson said all 
options were on the table as Fortescue looked for further opportunities in the energy transition space.
"Fundamentally, our view is that with the green molecule coming, everything gets disrupted. So theoretically, you 
look at any industry, and it's going to be disruptive," he said.
"We're going to be the shift business and we're going to be in the cable business, and we're going to be in maybe a 
lot of other business.
"We are looking at everything." It's a busy time for Fortescue as it continues to pivot away from its reliance on iron 
ore.
Green hydrogen hopeful Sparc Technologies and its joint venture partners, including Fortescue Future Industries, 
are also progressing plans to begin construction of a multimillion-dollar pilot plant in the coming months. FFI paid an 
initial $1.8m for a 20 per cent stake in 2022.
ASX-listed Sparc's hydrogen subsidiary aims to commercialise its photocatalytic water splitting technology which 
can convert water into hydrogen and oxygen using the sun and a photocatalyst.
The plant is expected to take six months to build.
Shares in Fortescue rose 0.3 per cent, or 8c, to close at $24.86 on Monday. The reporter travelled to Gladstone as 
a guest of Fortescue.

A key independent witness in a lengthly native title legal battle against Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has batted 
away accusations of bias in favour of the traditional owners, the Federal Court heard yesterday.
The silk representing Fortescue urged the court to view as unreliable clinical psychologist Jeff Nelson's key report 
on the psychological harm to traditional owners caused by the miner's giant iron ore project on their land in the 
Pilbara.
The Yindjibarndi people are suing Fortescue for about $1 billion in lost economic benefits, and cultural and spiritual 
damage from Fortescue's Solomon hub, three-quarters of which sits in Yindjibarndi land that also takes in the 
gorges and rock pools of Millstream Chichester National Park.
The case will decide if Fortescue, which has mined iron ore there without permission or agreement with the 
Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation for 10 years, will get compensation. The Yindjibarndi were found to be native 
titleholders of the land in 2017.
One of the traditional owners' claims for compensation, previously untested, is around social disharmony based on 
Fortescue opting to throw its support behind a breakaway group, Wirlu-murra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation, 
which has separately struck deals with the miner.
Griff Ranson SC, the silk for the state of Western Australia, played the court a recording of a conversation between 
Dr Nelson with the leader of YAC, Michael Woodley, to suggest he was biased towards the YAC's interests.
"A fair-minded listener could reasonably conclude from listening to this audio recording that your evidence is not 
impartial, but that you've become an advocate for the cause of the party that's retained you," he said.
Dr Nelson refuted the suggestions that he was biased and that his report was one-sided.
"The excerpts of the tape may have presented me in a particular way and I make no apology for interacting with him 
on level that they are comfortable with," he told the court when re-examined by YAC's counsel Tina Jowett. "I am 
not an advocate for one person ... I really went to great lengths to get information from both sides of this divide."
Page 2 of 2

Fortescue's silk Brahmananda Dharmananda SC sought to cast doubt on the report's finding that Fortescue 
caused social division, and argued Dr Nelson didn't make an effort to interview the breakaway group.
"The sample group of 21 people cannot statistically reflect ... the whole of the people - given there around 1200 of 
them?" he asked.
Dr Nelson agreed the maths was correct, but explained this criticism didn't stand in a professional setting. "When 
you're talking in the clinical space, it's a different argument. You will find many good single case study reports from 
which generalisations are made."
Dr Nelson dismissed suggestions he did not make efforts to interview Wirlu-murra Yindjibarndi people. He said he 
visited their office on five occasions, and had arranged to interview a group of people, but they didn't turn up.
Fortescue's silk further put to the court that the social dislocation and trauma faced by the group couldn't be 
pegged on Fortescue, and instead the social dislocation stretched back to the 1960s and 1970s.
Dr Nelson agreed that it was not possible to pin the group's trauma and dislocation exclusively on Fortescue.
But on re-examination by Ms Jowett,he said Fortescue mining the land without permission compounded the 
foundational trauma of the group's relocation.

Highlight: Two former Fortescue executives want to reduce the enormous carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's 
most lucrative export industry. It'll cost at least $3 billion.
Body
The lofty ambitions of two former Fortescue executives, who want to build a $US2.1 billion ($3.2 billion) green iron 
ore processing plant in the Pilbara within five years, will require a gigantic infusion of money.
Michael Masterman and Bart Kolodziejczyk formed Element Zero at the end of 2022, which aims to reduce the 
carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry. It's a big step up from the $US10 million the 
group raised at the start of this year in seed funding, and there are plans to undertake another capital raising later in 
the year, targeting $US50 million to $US100 million.
Iron is the key ingredient in steel production, which the world depends on for construction and manufacturing. 
However, production of iron and steel emits a combined 3.4 billion tonnes of carbon annually, or 7 per cent of global 
emissions, according to energy analysts Wood Mackenzie.
If the international agreement to limit global warming is to be achieved, emissions must reach net-zero by 2050. To 
decarbonise the iron ore and steel industries, Wood Mackenzie has estimated it would require a mind-bending 
$US1.4 trillion in global investment - almost equivalent to Australia's total annual gross domestic product.
This makes the capital needs of Element Zero seem less of a tall order.
"There is so much interest in what we do both in Australia and globally, in particular in the US, that we believe that 
we can make it," said Kolodziejczyk, Element Zero's co-founder and chief technology officer.
Element Zero, which employs about two dozen staff, has developed and patented a technology to reduce iron ore 
to pure iron through an electrochemical process.
An alkaline solution and electric current are used to separate pure iron from silica, alumina and oxygen. Iron ore is 
dissolved into the solution and when electricity - from a renewable source - passes through it, the pure iron collects 
on a cathode.
The group said it had also made progress on decarbonising silicon.
Element Zero has pitched itself to investors as a platform company, its technology aimed at converting metal ores 
to metals, not only iron ore, with zero carbon emissions.

Element Zero is seeking West Australian government approval for its green iron processing plant on 25 hectares in 
the Boodarie strategic industrial estate near Port Hedland. Kolodziejczyk said the group was also seeking a 
separate site to build a wind and solar farm to power the plant.
He said the plant would be capable of processing 5 million tonnes of iron ore feed into 2.7 million tonnes of green 
iron per year within five years, with plans to scale up to processing 50 million tonnes.
Element Zero's pilot plant in Perth is still a long way from industrial scale. It is processing 100 kg of iron ore daily, 
bought from major iron ore producers.
A process known as direct reduction uses natural gas, or methane, in a furnace to extract pure iron from iron ore. 
Some companies such as Fortescue have explored replacing methane with green hydrogen.
Kolodziejczyk, once Fortescue's chief scientist, led a push to develop green hydrogen to decarbonise the 
company's mining operations and shipping fleet.
Masterman, Element Zero's chief executive, has had a long career in the energy industry, including in Europe and 
also worked as Fortescue Future Industries' chief financial officer. He was chairman of renewable energy group 
Squadron Energy, part of the Tattarang group of companies, which are linked to Fortescue founder Andrew 
Forrest.
"The entire industry has enormous commercial pressures, shareholder pressures and goodwill to find technology 
solutions that can reduce the carbon emissions from converting iron ore into iron," said Masterman. "We can 
significantly move the dial."
About 560 million tonnes of iron ore are shipped through Port Hedland annually.
"If we can move to converting the vast, exceptional natural resources we have in Australia to metals, rather than 
just exporting the raw ore, that's going to have two impacts. It's going to help significantly reduce carbon emissions 
and ... substantially strengthen Australia."
Element Zero faces strong competition from other companies that have or are developing technology to make 
green iron and steel, among them Fortescue Future Industries, which last year claimed it had built a pilot plant that 
could turn iron ore into green iron using a membrane.
Element Zero is exploring converting other metal ores to metals with zero carbon emissions, including lithium, nickel 
and silicon.
Kolodziejczyk acknowledges the challenges but remains confident, predicting that eventually some of the major iron 
ore producers, among them BHP, Rio Tinto, Fortescue, Vale, and Roy Hill, could become investors in Element 
Zero. "We believe that some of those majors will come and invest in us."
Companies such as BHP and Vale have invested in clean tech groups such as Boston Metal, which is working on 
decarbonising steelmaking. BHP also has a stake in Electra, a start-up focused on decarbonising iron making.
In January, H2 Green Steel, which has technology that it says will help to decarbonise European steel, raised 
(EURO)4.2 billion ($6.9 billion) in debt financing. The start-up was founded in 2020.
Kolodziejczyk said Element Zero was also holding discussions with potential customers in Japan and South Korea 
for its green iron.
"Given how quickly we are moving with the technology scale-up, and also with the project in the Pilbara, we believe 
it's a good time to secure those initial agreements," he said. "That's what we're going to do in the next couple of 
months. We believe the first offtake will come from Japan. Obviously having those agreements in place will help us 
with the next fund raise."Page 3 of 3
The iron men with a $3 billion plan to save the planet
Masterman said Element Zero was providing potential customers with samples of its green iron so they "can test it 
to understand any adjustments they might need to make in their systems to be able to utilise it in their processing 
plants".
Kolodziejczyk said Element Zero's next fundraising could be as much as $US100 million. Masterman declined to 
provide a figure, saying instead the group was focused on proving its technology in stages to secure funding.
Element Zero is also exploring potential grants from the United States through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). 
The IRA has directed hundreds of billions of dollars to clean energy projects, including electric vehicles, to 
accelerate the country's transition to net-zero.
The IRA has fuelled a manufacturing boom in the US but that rapid growth in cleantech manufacturing has come at 
a cost. It has driven a huge increase in electricity demand, as has the development of artificial intelligence and 
digital currencies, which threaten to slow the path to net-zero, as renewable energy companies struggle to keep 
pace.
Last week, the Australian government announced a new industrial policy - the Future Made in Australia Act - that 
was immediately dubbed a mini-version of the IRA, although details of the policy are yet to be released. It will target 
advanced manufacturing and clean energy projects with government-funded incentives.
The push to decarbonise the iron ore sector comes amid pressure on exports. Vivek Dhar, director of the 
Commonwealth Bank's mining and energy commodities research team, has forecast that iron ore prices will 
average between $US100-$110 a tonne for the remainder of the year, after hitting $US140 in January.
He said there were risks the price could fall below those forecasts if growth slowed in China, as a result of a slump 
in its property sector. China imports almost 75 per cent of the world's iron ore.
Element Zero is exploring converting other metal ores to metals with zero carbon emissions, including lithium, nickel 
and silicon.
Kolodziejczyk said the group had made good progress with silicon. "We are trying to refine the process. The team is 
working towards that, and we believe that could be our second offering."
Silicon is used in the manufacturing of solar cells and microchips. The US has also introduced the CHIPS and 
Science Act that aims to boost investment, manufacturing and research and development in semiconductors.
"If we're able to take literally sand and convert it into silicon metal, with very little carbon emissions, that makes a 
major difference to the supply source of silicon metal and the carbon emissions that come from producing it," said 
Masterman.
"Silicon is a very exciting one for us and one in which we might be able to move more quickly. We could accelerate 
parts of the silicon plant in parallel with the work we're doing in iron ore. There are some significant opportunities in 
the United States we're considering."

  Should Fortescue Metals Group - the mining company founded by billionaire Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest - pay 
Yindjibarndi people millions of dollars or very little for digging up iron ore worth billions from their land?
   That's the question being considered in the long-running native title battle in the Federal Court, which on Monday 
and Tuesday heard testimony from valuers on both sides.
   Since Fortescue began mining at the Solomon hub in the Pilbara in 2013, the company has shipped off iron ore 
reportedly valued at roughly $50 billion, legally destroying dozens of significant Yindjibarndi sites in the process.
   FMG has not paid the Yindjibarndi people a cent and they are seeking compensation for destruction of country 
and of community.
   Yindjibarndi are arguing compensation should take into account other mining agreements, where native title 
holders negotiate an arrangement based on a percentage of royalties, considered standard practice in the industry.
   But FMG is saying compensation should be calculated without reference to the value of any minerals on or in the 
ground.
   Economics Consulting Services director Murray Meaton, an independent expert who has worked in native title 
negotiations, told the court that standard royalty rates ranged from 0.05 to 1 per cent of the free on board sale 
revenue with an average of 0.55 per cent.
   He said the most common rate by far in the Pilbara is 0.5 per cent and Rio Tinto, for example, uses that 
percentage.
   Fortescue barrister Brahma Dharmananda said the focus of compensation should be the impact on native title 
rights and interests - and cannot be treated as equivalent to the amount mining companies have been prepared to 
pay to native title holders under negotiated agreement.
   But Mr Meaton said native title rights negotiations recognise the value of the benefits to the other party as well as 
the impact on the situation.
   "What if you owned a residential lot that was suitable for a single house?" he said.
   "You would expect one price but if it was suitable for three houses, you would adjust your price to reflect 
increased benefit to the other party."

WA:Value of minerals irrelevant to compensation, says FMG
   When Fortescue began planning the Solomon hub in the mid-2000s it started negotiating with the Yindjibarndi 
Aboriginal Corporation, which wanted a 0.5 per cent royalty, the standard rate paid by major iron ore miners in the 
Pilbara.
   Fortescue offered $4 million a year and $6 million in housing, training and employment programs.
   When YAC refused Fortescue?s offer, the mining company gave financial backing to a breakaway group, Wirlu-
Murra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation, which paid people $500 each to attend a meeting that voted in favour of 
a deal with FMG.
   Fortescue began mining with no agreement with YAC, which had been named as the appropriate native title 
body by the Federal Court.
   The split between the two groups caused massive rifts between Yindjibarndi people, including families.
   Mr Meaton's report, prepared for the Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation, which is bringing the case, 
estimates that lost royalties compensation for the impact of mining activities on Yindjibarndi land is valued at $339 
million for iron ore produced to December 2022, plus interest of $56 million.
   He has also estimated compensation for the loss of royalties on future production at $107 million.
   Independent actuaries, employed by FMG, have said in their report that the Yindjibarndi people should be 
compensated for their actual economic loss, which does not include any rights in relation to minerals and should 
only take into account the loss of use of the land and not by reference to other agreements.

Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest arranged private talks with Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation boss 
Michael Woodley in a Perth park as part of attempts to settle a billion-dollar case unfolding in the Federal Court.
Two of three meetings between the billionaire iron ore miner and the Indigenous leader occurred at Kings Park at 
Dr Forrest's request, despite the pair falling out in a fiery clash in 2011.
A third meeting was held in Karratha, about 35 kilometres from the town of Roebourne where Fortescue is accused 
of dividing the Yindjibarndi community.
The talks failed as the warring parties remain hundreds of millions of dollars apart on what represents an 
appropriate financial compromise.
Fortescue said yesterday that it was ready to settle and make an offer of compensation to the Yindjibarndi 
Aboriginal Corporation.
"We would like this matter with the Yindjibarndi people resolved. We are committed to seeing this matter settled so 
the Yindjibarndi people can receive the benefits they deserve," a Fortescue spokeswoman said.
"Fortescue has offered compensation to the Yindjibarndi people in the past, and we continue to be ready to settle 
this by paying compensation."
The company refused to answer questions about why Dr Forrest opted to meet Mr Woodley in a public park, and 
would not discuss whether it had put forward a settlement offer that varied from its standard compensation 
agreements with other traditional owner groups in the Pilbara.
Fortescue, valued at $79 billion, also declined to comment on whether its settlement offer diverged from its legal 
arguments made in the Federal Court.
Page 2 of 2
Forrest's meetings in park with YAC over $1b claim
Fortescue has argued any compensation should be funded by the State of Western Australia because it granted 
the mining tenements covering the traditional lands of the Yindjibarndi. The WA government maintains Fortescue 
should pay.
The Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation is arguing it is entitled to compensation for economic losses estimated by 
one expert witness at more than $500 million, and more because it alleges Fortescue destroyed more than 240 
culturally significant sites - including rock shelters - for which it is also seeking around $500 million.
It is also arguing Fortescue divided the community by backing a breakaway group known as the Wirlu-Murra 
Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation in a novel third element to its legal fight.
The scope of potential damages is $1 billion.
Fortescue was left exposed to the compensation claim in 2020 after the High Court denied the company special 
leave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings that in effect meant a large part of its Solomon iron ore mining hub was 
built without permission of traditional owners.
The Federal Court had granted exclusive native title over 2700 square kilometres in the iron ore-rich Pilbara. This in 
effect recognises the Yindjibarndi as private owners of the highest legal standing with a spiritual connection that 
allows them to decide who mines the land.
Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation previously rejected Fortescue's offer of a $4 million annual payment over the 
anticipated life of the Solomon project, worth around $120 million.
Fortescue pays capped compensation as part of seven native title agreements with other traditional owner groups.
In court yesterday, lawyers for WA questioned mining economist Murray Meaton about his assertion that exclusive 
possession under native title entitled the claimant to a 1 per cent annual royalty on iron ore mined at Solomon, 
which would be double the royalty paid to some traditional owners with non-exclusive possession.
Mr Meaton estimated last year that the economic loss suffered by YAC from not having an agreement with 
Fortescue was $502 million. The court has asked him to update his figures based on the latest Fortescue 
production forecasts. A ruling in the case is expected next year, with the parties not due to deliver closing 
arguments until around October.

Institutional investors are increasingly steering clear of Fortescue, but their scepticism of the iron ore giant's 
prospects has meant they have missed out on a record rally in the company's share price as overseas funds and 
retail shareholders pile in.
Analysis of more than 30 top actively managed Australian equity funds found just one portfolio manager had 
disclosed a substantial position in the company this year.
That makes the West Australian miner - founded in 2003 by Andrew Forrest, now executive chairman - the least-
held stock among the 10 largest companies on the ASX.
The Australian Financial Review's analysis is in line with a survey of 50 fund managers from JPMorgan, which 
ranked Fortescue as the "least-loved" stock relative to its size - a position it has held for much of the poll's eight-
year history.
Several portfolio managers and analysts cited the miner's lower iron ore grades as one reason to forgo the stock in 
favour of larger rivals BHP, Rio Tinto and Brazil's Vale.
They said they were also concerned about the high turnover among senior management and increased spending 
on the as-yet unprofitable green hydrogen projects.
"For some investors over the last couple of years, it's just gone into the too-hard basket," said Jason Kururangi, 
portfolio manager with Milford Asset Management.
He also cited concerns about its green investments.
"Most people tend to be more comfortable in BHP. You have a similar cost structure and a higher-grade product, 
which generally fares through the cycle - even if you sometimes get supercharged earnings from Fortescue, like 
we've seen in the last 12 months."

Even so, many fund managers missed out on an almost 50 per cent surge in the share price between September 
and February, after earnings were boosted by higher iron ore prices and lower than expected discounts on its 
exports. That compares to a mere 5 per cent rise for BHP and 16 per cent for Rio Tinto over the same period.
Brokers have also been bearish for some time. Most analysts have slapped a sell or equivalent rating on the stock 
since November 2022. In contrast, BHP and Rio Tinto have never held a majority sell rating from brokers since at 
least 2009.
Morningstar mining equity analyst Jon Mills said the stock had become too expensive compared to its peers.
"Fortescue has been really benefiting recently from a higher iron ore price and lower discounts on it products," he 
said. "If you go back a few years, it was the exact opposite. It's in a great situation now, but is iron ore going to stay 
where it is? We don't think so.
"It's not generally liked by the wider market, but retail investors love it because it's made them a fortune over the 
years."
The company lost its final buy rating in January after JPMorgan's head of Australian resources, Lyndon Fagan, told 
investors to take profits. The call proved well-timed: shares in the company fell more than 10 per cent since peaking 
in early February.
Australian Eagle Asset Management chief investment officer Sean Sequeira said investors had remained sceptical 
of Fortescue's prospects since its earliest days.
"When Andrew first put Fortescue together, it all seemed quite haphazard," Mr Sequeira said. "It was the 
entrepreneurial spirit that drove the company, not standard management."
Mr Sequeira's fund was among the few to back the stock in 2016, when looming debt repayments and a poor iron 
ore market raised fears that Fortescue was close to broke.
"It was an extremely contrarian investment at the time. Everyone said it was going under," he said, adding that the 
fund had wound down its interest in Fortescue since that time in favour of gaining exposure to copper through BHP 
and Rio.
Shares in the miner have recovered strongly since its nadir in 2016, rising 1500 per cent. BHP and Rio have risen 
150 per cent and 200 per cent respectively since then.
Mr Sequeira said Dr Forrest's unconventional approach to management had often left the investment community 
baffled.
"Andrew is the type of person who goes into areas and tries to execute new methods of doing things," he said.
"That does result in the market finding it very difficult to see how these things will be pulled off because they haven't 
seen them done before."

  Traditional owners seeking compensation from iron ore miners have rejected a proposition that the land value 
should be calculated without considering the minerals.
   An expert witness for Fortescue Metals Group has argued that the Federal Court should only consider what the 
land is worth when calculating compensation - and not the tonnes of iron ore being dug up at its Solomon mine hub.
   The long-running dispute will decide how much compensation the native title holders, the Yindjibarndi people, will 
receive from Fortescue and is hearing from valuers about possible methods of calculation.
   Campbell Jaski, a valuer at PWC Australia who has previously worked at mining giant Rio Tinto, said his 
understanding of the Native Title Act was that compensation should be calculated based on what the land would be 
worth after separating the minerals it contained.
   But Economics Consulting Services director Murray Meaton, an independent expert who has worked in native title 
negotiations and is appearing on behalf of the Yindjibarndi, said that approach was "nonsensical".
   "Anyone valuing this land will take into account the fact that it contains an estimated 2800 million tonnes of iron 
ore," he said.
   "I can't imagine anyone would look at this land and ignore the potential to which this land could have, which is the 
mining of that iron ore."
   Fortescue began mining at the Solomon hub in the Pilbara in 2013 and has since shipped iron ore valued at an 
estimated $50 billion, but has not paid any money to native title holders.
   Fortescue has also legally destroyed dozens of significant Yindjibarndi sites in the process.
   The Yindjibarndi people are seeking compensation for the destruction of country and community.
   In court on Wednesday, the parties disagreed about implications for the case from the Timber Creek High Court 
decision, in which traditional owners were awarded compensation for the extinguishment of native title rights and 
interests.

   Mr Jaski said his interpretation was that the economic component of the compensation was equivalent to freehold 
land value - and varying impairments depending on how the land had been used.
   He described as misguided the royalty approach to compensation being suggested by Mr Meaton, who has 
compared what other mining companies in the Pilbara have negotiated with native title holders, which would mean 
millions of dollars for Yindjibarndi.
   "They're (royalty agreements) a bargain between mining companies and native title holders, which combine a 
whole myriad of rights and obligations and assets and liabilities, some of which have nothing to do with the title 
holders' rights or interests," he said.
   "For example, the cost of project delays to a mining company."
   But Yindjibarndi barrister Vance Hughston said compensation should take into account the amount the native title 
holders would have been able to negotiate with Fortescue.
   "What the claim group could fairly and justly have demanded for their assent to the infringement (mining), that's 
the economic component," he said.
   Fortescue began mining without agreement from the Yindjibarndi's registered native title body and instead dealt 
with a breakaway group.

Fortescue says the proposed design of the Biden administration's green incentives scheme could triple the cost of 
low-carbon hydrogen projects and stifle growth in the sector.
The iron ore group has an ambitious strategy to become a major force in hydrogen and renewable energy, and has 
previously outlined plans to build a $US550 million ($857 million) green hydrogen project in Arizona.
Its criticisms of the draft eligibility rules come ahead of Fortescue's quarterly update on Wednesday, when it is 
expected to outline whether they will force changes to the Arizona plant.
Hydrogen can be made with zero carbon emissions if renewable electricity is passed through water by a machine 
called an electrolyser.
Fortescue was hoping to use tax credits delivered as part of the $US369 billion Inflation Reduction Act, which is 
expected would almost halve the cost of some projects in the United States.
But Fortescue's enthusiasm has waned since the US Treasury issued draft regulations known as "45V" which 
provide the detail on eligibility for the tax credits. Fortescue's biggest problem is the requirement that companies 
match each hour of production to an hour of renewable power generation and consumption to be eligible.
The rule is designed to ensure that subsidies are not given to hydrogen made from fossil fuels when solar and wind 
power are not available.
The "hourly matching" rule will force hydrogen producers to either cease production when renewables are not 
available - undermining productivity and viability - or sign up for excess renewable power from diverse sources to 
improve the chances of having clean energy available at all times.
Fortescue has urged the government to instead consider "annual matching" - a system that would allow a producer 
to rely on non-renewable power at times, so long as it sourced extra renewable power at other times and ultimately 
consumed as much power as it generated over the course of a year.
Page 2 of 2
Fortescue slams Biden hydrogen incentive rules
In submissions to Treasury, Fortescue has warned that "hourly matching" would increase the cost of an 80-
megawatt green hydrogen facility by "between 140 and 200 per cent". The comment appears to be a reference to 
Fortescue's Arizona project, which will be an 80-megawatt plant that makes green hydrogen for refuelling trucks.
Asked by The Australian Financial Review whether the unfavourable draft rules would force Fortescue to alter the 
scope of the approved Arizona project, a spokesman signalled there were unlikely to be changes until the eligibility 
rules were finalised.
"When 45V guidelines are finalised, we will assess how they impact our US operations and make the decisions 
necessary to ensure our green energy projects are economic and profitable," he said. "Fortescue believes with or 
without government incentives there will be a place for green hydrogen and green ammonia projects in the US."
The questions about eligibility are an example of how the details of the IRA are still being thrashed out, almost two 
years after legislation passed Congress.

Magmatic Resources Ltd (ASX:MAG) made significant progress in activities during the quarter ending March 31, 
with a notable advancement in the Myall Project alongside gold-copper exploration at the Wellington North Project.
Fortescue partnership
A key achievement during the quarter was the execution of a farm-in and joint venture agreement with FMG 
Resources Pty Ltd (Fortescue), focusing on the Myall Project.
The Myall Project, covering 244 square kilometres, is strategically located along the northern extension of the 
Junee-Narromine Volcanic Belt, some 50 kilometres north of the world-renowned Northparkes Mine.
This area is historically significant, featuring extensive copper anomalism akin to those found at Northparkes, 
positioning the Myall Project as a prospective venture for further exploration and development.
Under the agreement, Fortescue has committed to investing up to A$14 million over six years, potentially acquiring 
a 75% joint venture interest.
The terms stipulate a minimum spend of A$3 million and at least 3,000 metres of drilling within the first two years.
Magmatic, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Modeling Resources Pty Ltd, will act as the operator throughout the 
initial farm-in period, which could extend up to four years.

Additionally, the establishment of an Exploration Committee between Magmatic and Fortescue is set to finalise the 
forward exploration work program for the project.
Wellington North work
Concurrently, exploration activities have recommenced at Magmatic's wholly-owned Wellington North project near 
Alkane Resources' 15.7 million ounces gold-equivalent Boda-Kaiser discovery.
This phase of exploration includes targeted follow-ups at three key areas - Boda Southwest, Lady Ilse North and 
Rose Hill - all of which are known for nearby porphyry gold-copper mineralisation.
The exploration strategy encompasses a variety of techniques including soil geochemistry, aircore drilling and 
reverse circulation percussion drilling.
A detailed soil sampling program at the Boda Southwest Prospect is already underway, with further approvals for 
other target areas anticipated soon.
Finances buoyant
In addition to these operational achievements, Fortescue has invested in Magmatic Resources by subscribing for 
75,946,151 shares, which helped raise A$3.71 million during the quarter.
As of the end of March 2024, Magmatic Resources was in a robust financial position, with A$4.027 million in cash 
reserves.

The financial endowment behind Andrew and Nicola Forrest's philanthropic Minderoo Foundation is expected to 
grow towards $40 billion by the end of the decade as the separated couple continue to hand over shares in iron ore 
miner Fortescue Limited.
It is understood the Forrests remain in lockstep when it comes to a commitment made in 2013 to give away the 
majority of their wealth, with more large Fortescue share donations to Minderoo anticipated in the next five years.
Minderoo Foundation has placed at No.1 on this year's Financial Review Philanthropy 50 list, spending $225 
million. It marks the first time Minderoo has been Australia's biggest-spending foundation since the Philanthropy 50, 
compiled by JB Were's John McLeod, was first published in 2017.
Minderoo chief executive John Hartman said yesterday that it was humbling to reflect on how far the foundation had 
come since it was founded by the Forrests as the Australian Children's Trust in 2001.
The Forrests signed up to Bill Gates' and Warren Buffett's The Giving Pledge in 2013, making a commitment to give 
away most of their wealth in their lifetimes. The first big step came in June when they handed over 220 million 
shares in Fortescue to the not-for-profit charity they founded and control. The shares represented about a fifth of 
their total shareholding in the Andrew Forrest-led Fortescue and were worth about $5 billion at the time, making 
Minderoo one of the world's largest philanthropic organisations.
Minderoo shed about 100 jobs last week - roughly a third of its workforce - in a major reset that Mr Hartman said 
was aimed at ensuring more of the money provided by the Forrests reached intended beneficiaries.
He has signalled Minderoo's annual expenditure could more than double in the next few years, with more money 
directed into collaborations and partnerships as part of a focus on environmental protection and inequality.
"Minderoo's capacity to affect meaningful change dramatically increased when the Forrests became the first 
Australians to sign The Giving Pledge, and generously donated an historic $5 billion to the foundation (last June)," 
Mr Hartman said. "Such a generous flow of philanthropic capital alone does not guarantee results nor impact. We 
Page 2 of 2
Minderoo charity heads for $40b as Forrests stump up Fortescue shares
have made a tangible difference in the lives of countless Australians and people around the world in the past 23 
years (and) we must continue to rigorously hold ourselves to account."
In making the giving pledge, the Forrests said: "As a family we agreed many years ago to give away the majority of 
our wealth. We felt that if our children (Grace, Sophia and Sydney) were to inherit considerable wealth, it would only 
get in the way of them striving for and achieving their best, and truly making a positive difference in other people's 
lives."
Last year's share donation took Minderoo's endowment to about $7.6 billion. The total endowment now stands at 
about $10 billion based on increases in the Fortescue share price, dividends and other investments.
Minderoo has in recent times focused its efforts on helping vulnerable communities, gender and equality, and 
protecting oceans. Last year, the biggest-ever grant - $US100 million over nine years - went to a gender fund run by 
US-registered public charity, Co-Impact, for work aimed at achieving a fairer world for women and girls.
Mr Hartman said Minderoo was going through a transformation as it tried to expose problems to the world and 
provide solutions. "It is part of our DNA to hold those responsible to account and use our platform to enable agency 
for disempowered voices."
The Financial Review Philanthropy 50 appears in the May issue of AFR Magazine, inside Friday's newspaper.

Highlight: Iron ore shipments of 43.3 million tonnes were six per cent lower than previous corresponding quarter 
because of the ore derailment in late December and weather disruptions.
Body
Green energy pioneer Andrew Forrest's Fortescue says it is on track to produce its target of 50 million tons of 
hydrogen by 2030 after converting and gaining world-first certification for a ship running on a mix of green ammonia 
and diesel.
The company successfully converted a Singapore-flagged vessel, Fortescue Green Pioneer, to run on dual-fuel 
green ammonia, gaining world-first certification for the technology, said Mark Hutchinson, who heads up the 
Fortescue Energy division.
"This is a huge milestone and brings us one step closer to green shipping," he said.
The iron ore miner and green energy producer reiterated it is expected to meet its key 2030 decarbonisation 
targets. "We totally believe we're going to get there," Hutchison said, and the company's large green hydrogen 
projects in Norway and Brazil will "prime the pump" for production.
"They're progressing well," he said. "Into the 2030s, we believe there's going to be a massive demand for the 
product."
Green hydrogen, made by using a renewable energy-powered electrolyser to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, 
is seen as a viable alternative to carbon-emitting fossil fuels in heavy transport, heating, and power generation. 
However, it is still prohibitively expensive to produce.
Fortescue is also pushing ahead with decarbonising its fleet of diesel-guzzling iron ore mining vehicles in the 
Pilbara. It now has three electric excavators operating and says converting its entire excavator fleet to electric will 
cut diesel use by 95 million litres every year.
The miner's iron ore shipments slowed over three months to March, down six per cent to 43.3 million tonnes due to 
a derailment late in December and weather disruptions in January and February, Fortescue Metals chief Dino 
Otranto said in a quarterly update on Wednesday.
However, he said shipments hit a record level in March as the company focused on recovering its output. Guidance 
for total financial-year shipments remains unchanged, but will be at the lower end of the expected 192 to 197 million 
tonne range.

Fortescue takes 'milestone step towards green shipping' amid iron ore hit
The company's crucial high-quality Iron Bridge project is facing significant problems with a faulty water pipeline and 
plant teething issues slowing its output. Work is under way to replace a high-pressure section of the pipeline and 
improve its performance. The mine's process plan was reconfigured to deal with the water supply issues. "We've 
got a process under way, I won't get into too many details of it," Otranto said.
He said China's steel demand was becoming increasingly diversified, with strong growth across infrastructure, 
manufacturing and renewable energy sectors. "China's rollout of wind and solar capacity blew my mind," Otranto 
said after a recent visit to the Asian powerhouse. "Renewable energy infrastructure needs a lot of steel."

Iron ore futures rose Wednesday to their highest level in seven weeks as Fortescue ( OTCQX:FSUMF) forecast its 
full-year shipments likely will come in at the lower end of guidance.
Singapore futures ( SCO:COM) jumped more than 5% to as high as $118.70/metric ton, while Dalian prices ended 
up 4.6%, according to Bloomberg.
In its latest quarterly production report, Fortescue ( OTCQX:FSUMF) said it sees annual iron ore shipments at the 
lower end of its previous guidance range after an ore car derailment and bad weather slowed operations in the 
March quarter.
The world's fourth biggest iron ore producer had guided for total full-year iron ore shipments of 192M-197M metric 
tons in the 12 months through June.
Fortescue ( OTCQX:FSUMF) said it shipped 43.3M tons of iron ore in its latest quarter, down 6% Y/Y, but that 
volumes had recovered near the end of the period.
Even after Wednesday's rise, iron ore prices are down 15% so far this year as inventories at China's ports continue 
near the highest level in about two years, with the country's real estate sector still mired in crisis.
The real estate slump has yet to bottom, according to Goldman Sachs, with home prices continuing to decline in 
March, even as policymakers ramp up measures to revive demand.

Fortescue will need to maintain close to record export rates to hit its full-year shipment guidance, with its troubled 
Iron Bridge magnetite project registering another production downgrade.
Fortescue has revealed the extent of the impact of a derailment at its Pilbara iron ore operations, saying iron ore 
exports had slipped 6 per cent as a result of the significant outage at its rail line.
The company exported 43.3 million tonnes for the March quarter, down from 46.3 million tonnes for the same period 
last year, and down 11 per cent from the three months to the end of December. The slip in exports also pushed up 
average C1 cash costs by 7 per cent, to $US18.93 a tonne.
And, while Fortescue said it still expected to meet its annual export guidance, the company said it would probably 
come in -towards the bottom of its 192-197 million-tonne range.
But the company will need a heroic performance to meet even that expectation, needing to export 53.5 million 
tonnes in the June quarter, given it has only shipped 138.5 million tonnes in the first half of the financial year.
Fortescue Metals CEO Dino Otranto said Fortescue was confident it could hit that rate, despite needing to ship at 
near record rates of about 18 million tonnes a month for the June quarter, after shipping 18.7 million tonnes in 
March.
"You can hold a lot of confidence in the performance that we've had over the last six weeks - March was an all-time 
record. So we're looking pretty good for the remainder of this quarter," Mr Otranto said.
Fortescue again downgraded expectations from its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project, saying it now only 
expected to ship 2 million tonnes of high-grade concentrate from the massive mine and processing operations, 
down from previous - and already substantially revised - guidance of 2-4 million tonnes.
The company shipped only 500,000 tonnes of concentrate from Iron Bridge in the March quarter as it struggles with 
water supply to the operation. Fortescue is spending about $US100m ($140m) to fix flaws in the water pipeline, 
which is leaking in high-pressure sections.
Page 2 of 2
Fortescue confident on export guidance
The Iron Bridge processing plant is water-hungry as it grinds hard magnetite ore into a fine paste, before separating 
iron from waste rock using revolving magnetic drums. When running at its full rate, Iron Bridge will need 20 
gigalitres of water a year to support its full production rate of 22 million tonnes of concentrate.
Mr Otranto blamed the pipeline issue on quality control issues with a 65km section of the pipeline that now leaks 
under pressure.
He said Fortescue had elected to replace the pipeline section, but declined to comment on whether Fortescue 
would be able to make an insurance claim for the replacement work or business interruption, or the status of any 
legal claims against the manufacturer.
Mr Otranto said Fortescue expected to be able to replace the pipeline this year, and said he was confident the 
company would still be able to ramp Iron Bridge up to its nameplate capacity by September next year, as previously 
forecast.
"All our focus is on getting the water supply back. And our September quarter 2025 guidance that we gave before is 
still unchanged," he said.
"However, it does depend on getting that water solution in play. "The good news is that we've been able to identify 
some other source of water - we're using our tailings facility to store some of the downpour that we have seen." 
Fortescue also cut its capital spending guidance by $US300m-$US500m for the current financial year for its metals 
group, to $US2.5bn-$US2.7bn, and cut capital spending forecasts for its energy division by $US100m to $US700m. 
Fortescue shares closed up 16c at $24.76 on Wednesday.

In his first speech to the National Press Club after the 2022 election, Anthony Albanese boasted that his reforming 
Labor government would transform Australia into a clean-energy superpower.
How so? asked a sceptical journalist from Bloomberg News. How would Australia compete against the US, Canada, 
China and other countries that are aspiring to be global leaders in green manufacturing? "By getting on with it," 
replied the Prime Minister. Some 20 months later, the question remains unanswered: Getting on with what?
The two examples of promising green businesses the PM cited on that day have hardly stood the test of time. Sun 
Cable, Mike Cannon-Brookes's proposal to build the world's largest solar farm and link it by an undersea cable to 
Singapore, seems less likely to come to fruition than Clive Palmer's plan to rebuild the Titanic. As for Tritium, the 
Australian company that promised to build the world's fastest electric vehicle chargers in southeast Queensland, the 
less said the better. Tritium's future won't be built in Australia. It will be built in Tennessee, where the company has 
received generous assistance from President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, securing a sweetheart deal to 
build a giant manufacturing plant.
The $15bn National Reconstruction Fund Albanese promised would kickstart the industries of the future has been in 
place for well over a year but has yet to issue a single grant.
The PM plans to break the impasse with the National Reconstruction Fund 2.0, optimistically named the Future 
Made in Australia Act. Underpinning the government's green superpower ambition is a breathtaking complacency 
that assumes Australia's natural advantages in the fossil fuel-based economy can be seamlessly swapped out for 
ascendancy in the brave new carbon-free world. They cannot be. Our primacy in resources was based on merely 
having stuff. Green manufacturing is about making stuff, which is a different game altogether.
The Albanese government has placed a speculative bet on green hydrogen as the key to our export success. It 
makes the fatuous claim that Australia has an abundance of sunshine that can be turned into cheap renewable 
energy.

PM's subsidy crusade stirs ghosts of Labor's past
In October 2022, Energy Minister Chris Bowen announced a $13.7m grant to Andrew Forrest's company, 
Fortescue Future Industries, to scope the construction of a 500MW electrolyser at Gibson Island near Brisbane. 
Bowen described the project's success as "critical" to Australia'a ambition to be a green energy superpower.
Last month, Fortescue boss Mark Hutchinson reinforced the project's importance, describing it as "a litmus test for 
the rest of the hydrogen industry in Australia". Yet when Fortescue announced financial approval for a string of 
green hydrogen projects at the end of last year, Gibson Island was not one of them. "We've been working very, very 
hard on it," Hutchinson told The Australian Financial Review Business Summit last month. "But it's tough based on 
the current power prices when we're looking at competing globally." To judge from Fortescue's investment portfolio 
right now, the future may be built in Norway, northern Patagonia, Brazil and British Columbia before it is built in 
Australia. It may even be built in Kenya and Congo. The future is already being built in Buckeye, Arizona, where 
Fortescue is investing $US500m ($765m) in a green hydrogen plant it says will be up and running by 2026.
It turns out abundant sun was not such a competitive advantage in the manufacture of green hydrogen. Low taxes, 
fiscally responsible government and cheap and reliable carbon-free energy are far more appealing drawcards for 
investors.
In 2023, manufacturing in Arizona grew faster than in any other state. It includes energy and water-intensive 
industries such as silicon chip manufacturing, with Arizona coming from nowhere to fourth place among US states. 
Apologists for the Albanese government might look for excuses in the global subsidy arms race unleashed by the 
Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. They might claim Arizona has easy access to a much bigger market.
Yet Arizona's hi-tech manufacturing boom started before Biden came to power and came at the expense of 
neighbouring California, where manufacturing is declining.
It isn't hard to work out why. Arizona's top state income tax rate is 2.98 per cent. California's is 13.3 per cent. 
Corporate tax in Arizona is 6.96 per cent compared to 8.84 per cent in California. For energy-hungry industries such 
as hydrogen and the IT sector, however, the biggest attraction is the industrial electricity price: 7.47 cents a kWh in 
Arizona compared to 18 cents in California.
Albanese continues to talk a big game, promising jobs, industry and prosperity will flourish under the Future Made 
in Australia Act. Details are scarce, but the PM told ABC's 7.30 this month there would be new government 
programs attached to the Act, as well as a recalibration of old ones.
Yet the long history of manufacturing decline in the past 50 years is a story of broken promises and failed industry 
welfare programs. The Hawke government's generosity in granting $36m to the Kodak film factory in Victoria in 
1988 (roughly $100m in today's money) failed to stop the introduction of digital cameras or development of the 
smartphone. Hundreds of millions of dollars thrown at the car industry failed to save the Holden Commodore. 
Indeed, evidence that industry assistance programs work as intended is difficult to find.
It's more than three decades since Bob Hawke's Labor government eschewed industry protectionism as a means to 
make Australia globally competitive. Yet governments, state and federal, of both political persuasions, have found it 
difficult to go cold turkey. The federal government's guide to grants lists 330 different types of industry assistance. 
In 2019, the last year before Covid-19, the Productivity Commission calculated total government assistance to 
businesses at $13.9bn in tariff assistance, tax concessions and direct grants.
That is why we can say with some certainty that more government grants are no substitute for the economic 
discipline practised by the Republican administrations of governors Jan Brewer and Doug Ducey or the far-sighted 
decision of the Arizona government in the 1980s in overseeing the construction of the second-largest nuclear 
reactor in the US. The 3.9GW Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station remains the backbone of the Arizona 
electricity grid, producing some of the cheapest power in the country.
Albanese is hardly the first prime minister to enter office who has failed to learn from King Canute, instead suffering 
from the delusion that getting your hand on the levers of state gives you the power to alter the tides. The outgoing 
tide of deindustrialisation shows no sign of abating. Nick Cater is senior fellow at the Menzies Research Centre.Page 3 of 3

Fortescue says it has begun -negotiations with Chinese authorities for the supply of 100 million tonnes of green 
iron from its Pilbara operations, but has flagged the need for a huge amount of hydrogen to make the plan a reality.
Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest flagged the plan in a presentation on Thursday to the Scottsdale Action Forum 
in Arizona that is hosted by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.
Dr Forrest's presentation to the forum, hosted on the Fortescue website, did not give details of whether the 
negotiations were with China Mineral Resources Group, established in 2022 as the country's central iron ore buyer, 
or with another Chinese government agency.
In June last year, Fortescue also announced an agreement with China's Baowu steel group over the development 
of green iron technology.
The presentation did not put a timeframe on the discussions, other than to say that they had begun this year.
Fortescue only ticked off on a $50m pilot plant for its green iron production plant at its Christmas Creek mine late 
last year, saying the plant would be producing 1500 tonnes of iron ore a year by 2025.
The company did not give an update on its progress in building the plant in its March quarter production report, 
delivered last week.
But Thursday's presentation suggests Fortescue will need to produce enormous quantities of green hydrogen to 
make its -vision come true, reiterating Dr Forrest's previous ambition of producing 200 million tonnes a year of 
carbon-free iron ore for export to its customers.
Fortescue has said its pilot plant will use renewable energy and green hydrogen reduction technology, together 
with an electric smelting furnace, to produce high-grade iron for use in the steel industry.

Fortescue in China talks on green iron
Dr Forrest's presentation suggests Fortescue will need about 8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year to reach its goal 
of producing 200 million tonnes a year of green iron, potentially eliminating 220 million tonnes a year of carbon 
emissions compared with current iron ore production.
Fortescue Energy CEO Mark Hutchinson confirmed in February that the company had held discussions with the 
BP-led Australian Renewable Energy Hub over potential power deals for the mining giant's Pilbara iron ore 
operations, which could also have the capacity to supply energy for hydrogen production.
The AREH consortium - 48 per cent-owned by fossil fuel giant BP, and with Macquarie, CWP Global and 
Intercontinental Energy as joint venture partners - plans to build 26GW combined solar and wind power plant on a 
6500sq km site northeast of the Port Hedland iron ore export hub.
But Fortescue has otherwise outlined few options to build hydrogen production hubs close to its Pilbara iron ore 
operations.
The Scottsdale Action Forum is in its second year. It hosted more than 130 industry chief executives, directors, 
bankers and government officials, according to Fortescue. Dr Forrest was the keynote "how to" speaker at the 
forum, Fortescue said. Fortescue shares rose 1 per cent to $25.57.

Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest has slammed the Biden administration's proposed hydro-gen subsidy regime 
as the company begins work on a production plant in the US, saying rules that may limit Fortescue's access to 
government cash have been made at the behest of the fossil fuel industry.
Earlier this year the US Treasury Department released draft details of its proposed rules for production credits 
supporting the development of the nascent green hydrogen industry in the country, including a requirement that 
companies must match each hour of production to an hour of renewable power generation and consumption to be 
eligible.
Designed to ensure that energy derived from fossil fuel sources powering local grids can't be used to claim green 
hydrogen subsidies, the draft ruling would mean that producers switch off hydrogen production when wind, solar 
power or hydro power are unavailable.
Fortescue argued for power matching over a longer period, to avoid production interruptions, saying the proposed 
rules - known as 45V - would push up costs at the 80-megawatt green hydrogen facility the company is building in 
Arizona by between 140 and 200 per cent.
Fortescue had originally expected to qualify for a $US3 a kilogram subsidy offered by the IRA for all of its 
production.
Speaking at a sod-turning event at the site of the plant on Friday, Dr Forrest said the proposed rules would be a 
"straitjacket" on the emerging industry.
"I support the Biden Administration's goal to produce hydrogen in a way that prioritises sustainability. However, 
45V, in its current form, is a straitjacket on the industry and works against the Biden administration's own climate 
goals," he said. Dr Forrest said the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act was helping the US make serious 
strides towards decarbonising its economy, but said the proposed rules were "fine print shoved into the IRA 
legislation to do everything it can to kill off what is the saviour in energy for humanity and every organic life on 
Earth".

Forrest slams US hydrogen regime
"You deserve much better than faceless people wandering around with chequebooks full of lobbying money, putting 
in a landmine into the law which is getting green hydrogen off the ground," he said.
"That landmine is put in by fossil fuel lobbyists - they masquerade as environmentalists and I can tell you they're 
not, I can tell you that they're paid for by the fossil fuel sector." Fortescue ticked off on the development of the 
Arizona hydrogen project late last year. The company plans to spend $US550m ($837m) building a plant capable of 
producing 11,000 tonnes of liquid hydrogen a year for sale to the heavy transport -industry.
Scheduled to begin production in 2026, Fortescue has said the plant will be supplied by utility Arizona Public 
Service with "new sources of wind and solar generation under its regulated extra high load factor tariff, together with 
green attributes under its Green Power Partners program".
The Arizona grid was still dominated by fossil fuel generation in 2022, however, according to the US Energy 
Information Administration.
About 42 per cent of the state's net energy generation came from natural gas plants, with 12 per cent from coal-
fired power stations. Another 29 per cent came from nuclear generation, and 16 per cent coming from solar, wind 
and hydro-electric sources. Fortescue shares closed up 9c to $25.66 on Friday.

Fortescue boss Andrew Forrest says he feels betrayed by the United States over legislative changes threatening to 
"kill off" a $US550 million ($836 million) hydrogen project in Arizona.
An emotional Dr Forrest said he was duped into thinking that the US would become the world leader in green 
energy. The billionaire lashed out in front of politicians and traditional owners during a soil turning ceremony in 
Buckeye, Arizona, where he claimed global warming had already pushed temperatures in Western Australia's 
Pilbara, where Fortescue made its iron ore fortune, to 60 degrees.
Fortescue has counted on tax credit eligibility to underpin its US hydrogen investment and is furious over revisions 
attached to the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act.
Dr Forrest said lobbyists for big oil and gas were behind US Treasury draft regulations known as 45V, which detail 
eligibility for the tax credits.
"Fortescue are here when we have projects all over the world because we believed the IRA meant that the 
leadership of China [in decarbonisation] was going to be taken by North America, and North America would become 
the green energy nation of the world," he said. "But the fine print, which is known as 45V ... that's a really stupid 
name ... has been shoved into the IRA legislation to do everything it can to kill off what is the saviour in energy for 
humanity and every organic life on Earth, and that is green electrons and green hydrogen.
"You deserve much better than faceless people wandering around with chequebooks full of lobbying money putting 
a landmine into the law," he told the audience.
"They masquerade as environmentalists, and they're not. I can tell you that it is paid for by the fossil fuel sector."
Fortescue is upset by a requirement that companies must match each hour of production to an hour of renewable 
power consumption to qualify. The rule is designed to ensure subsidies are not given to hydrogen made from fossil 
fuel power during times when solar and wind power are unavailable.

Fortescue renamed what was known as the Phoenix Hydrogen Hub. The project, about 50 kilometres from 
Phoenix, is now called Arizona Hydrogen.

Australia's Fortescue Metals ( OTCQX:FSUMF) said it broke ground Friday at its $550M green hydrogen project in 
Arizona, which it expects will produce as much as 11K metric tons/year of liquid renewable hydrogen to help 
decarbonize heavy-duty transport in the southwest U.S.
The Arizona Hydrogen project is the first of Fortescue's ( OTCQX:FSUMF) planned green energy investments in 
North America; the company is working on other U.S. projects, including a manufacturing plant in Michigan for 
electrolyzers, batteries and electric vehicle chargers, and with the U.S. Department of Energy to build a Pacific 
Northwest Hydrogen Hub that would include a green hydrogen production plant in Washington state.
Fortescue ( OTCQX:FSUMF) Executive Chair Andrew Forrest, speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony, praised 
the U.S. for supporting decarbonization projects but also noted some proposed policies that he said could stall 
investment.
"Fortescue is unashamedly a first-mover in this space, [but] we need to be encouraged to that, not punished," 
Forrest said. "There are rules right now under consideration with the Biden Administration that would make already 
announced projects like this one dramatically more expensive and smaller."
Forrest was referring to the proposed Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, or section 45V of the Inflation 
Reduction Act, which outlines how hydrogen producers qualify for the credit; draft rules propose to limit hydrogen 
producers' ability to provide project-specific information, such as upstream emissions data, when calculating the 
carbon intensity of their hydrogen.
Critics say eligibility for the 45V tax credit based on national average carbon intensity, rather than the real 
emissions associated with each producer's operations, wound cause the U.S. government to essentially reward 
dirtier natural gas production while discouraging other producers from cleaning up their processes.

In February 2023, businessman Andrew Forrest decided to shame his home state newspaper, The West Australian, 
for engaging in what he said was commercial retaliation over a missed contract.
The move didn't work.
Since Dr Forrest recorded a video that criticised reporting in The West, the Kerry Stokes-controlled paper has 
published 78 articles about him or his company, Fortescue Metals Group, according to the paper's website. Sixty-
five had a negative slant.
They included coverage of job cuts and executive departures ("The list of those walking away from Forrest keeps 
growing"), business problems ("Andrew Forrest the new victim of nickel price agony"), and Dr Forrest's separation 
from his wife, Nicola Forrest ("Shock twist in Andrew Forrest's marriage breakdown").
One of the few articles about Dr Forrest available free on the paper's website reports a denial, which Dr Forrest 
made to another paper, that he fathered three illegitimate children. Another wrote that Dr Forrest had described 
himself as his staff's "humble servant" - and was published with a photo of him wearing a cravat.
The latest, two weeks ago, suggested Fortescue's dividends might be cut. Fortescue shares have risen 80 per 
cent since October 2022, when the paper's reporting seemed to turn negative.
The coverage raises a question: is Mr Stokes' power in Western Australia so great that it cannot be challenged, 
even by a billionaire five times as rich?
Mr Stokes, who denies giving his newspaper instructions, was Australia's 12th-richest person last year, according to 
the Financial Review Rich List. Dr Forrest was second.
"Editorial decisions have nothing to do with Kerry Stokes," a spokesman for the billionaire said. "To put that 
proposition to him would be totally misguided."
A spokeswoman for Dr Forrest, who was in Washington yesterday, said he would not comment.
Page 2 of 2
After losing a deal, Stokes' newspaper pursued Forrest Business dispute
Dr Forrest has asserted that the coverage was triggered by Fortescue's decision to buy a hydrogen-powered fleet 
of trucks from a Swiss-German manufacturer instead of WesTrac, a construction equipment business owned by 
Seven Group Holdings, which is controlled by Mr Stokes. Dr Forrest had received mostly positive coverage in the 
paper, which lasted until a few months after Fortescue struck the truck deal in June 2022, after negotiations with 
WesTrac stalled over the vehicles' fuel systems.
"I made it really clear if they don't change that stance, I don't bluff," he said in February last year when asked about 
the contract.
Some of the critical stories appeared on the front page, hurting Dr Forrest's reputation and likely damaging morale 
at Fortescue.
The West Australian does not have a state-based competitor, and Mr Stokes controls the Seven television network, 
which broadcasts the most popular news bulletin in Perth. Facing off against a local media monopolist, Dr Forrest 
decided to record the video for his staff to present his side of the story.
"Everyone loves positive disruption and improvement in technology and in society, except perhaps when it happens 
to them," he said. "This, I believe, is the case and what has inspired the biased, inaccurate reporting of The West."
Mr Stokes, 83, comes from an era when media proprietors freely used their outlets to help their business interests. 
He feels that he is unfairly criticised by bigger media companies based on the east coast, according to a person 
who knows him.
Seven West Media, which owns The West Australian, is worth $310 million. Nine Entertainment Co, which owns 
The Australian Financial Review, is worth $2.5 billion.
Last month, Seven West Media said it had decided to terminate a contract to print the Financial Review in Perth. 
The print edition of the paper won't be available in the city from May 22, further strengthening the power of Mr 
Stokes' paper.

Highlight: The former Victorian premier still has an eye for a big project: joining a billionaire to sell "green" iron to 
China.
Body
We all knew the cat would soon be out of the bag on the next chapter for former premier Daniel Andrews. After all, 
the bloke couldn't spend the rest of his life playing golf, partying with Lindsay Fox and triggering Steve Price.
So we can now reveal that Andrews has teamed up with West Australian mining billionaire Andrew "Twiggy" 
Forrest and his iron ore giant Fortescue to help fulfil Twiggy's dream of selling 100 million tonnes of "green" iron to 
China.
It's not clear exactly how this thing came to pass, but sources close to the action tell us that Andrews, who is taking 
on the Fortescue work through his consultancy, Forty Eight and Partners, gave a presentation at the Boao Forum 
for Asia in China's Hainan Province in March.
Forrest, a major sponsor of the event, was also present, and the two men appear to have clicked.
The green iron plan aims to deliver vast quantities of the metal to market after stripping carbon emissions from the 
extraction, processing and supply chain operations by using - and this could be the tricky bit - 8 million tonnes of 
renewable hydrogen each year.
So, Forrest is thinking big. But then Andrews never saw a large project he didn't like, if we overlook the East West 
Link and the Commonwealth Games. So this thing makes sense on that level.
It's also been a winning approach for Forrest in the past. The Fortescue chairman - who, like Whitney Houston, 
believes that children are our future - hired another former long-serving Labor premier, South Australia's Jay 
Weatherill, in 2019 to lead the Thrive by Five early childhood education campaign that the miner established with 
his then-wife, Nicola Forrest.
Neither Forrest nor Andrews were available on Sunday to chat, leaving CBD to ponder alone the many questions 
raised by this news. The first would be, who gets to call himself chairman?
Andrews was never quite able to shake that "chairman Dan" moniker used by unkind souls over both his hard line 
on public health during the pandemic and enthusiasm for closer trade links with China.

'Iron Dan': Andrews' next career move aligns with Forrest's green dream
There's this too: with the former premier and the mining boss both well-known for having a certain, well, let's call it a 
single-minded management style, what happens if differences emerge on strategy or tactics?
Oh, and you'd think that Andrews' new gig would mean spending a lot of time away from his beloved Mulgrave, in 
China and, of course, at Fortescue's HQ way out west.
It'd be a shame if someone closed the borders.
TAYLOR MADE
Looks like Taylor Auerbach, the former producer from Seven's Spotlight program who stole the show at Bruce 
Lehrmann's recent high-profile defamation case, is not yet ready to move on from the matter of Lehrmann and 
Brittany Higgins.
Twitter link
Auerbach announced on the weekend that he's been "writing a book!"
Well, "just having a crack, to see if I can do it. It might never be read by anybody but me. And I'm only an each-way 
bet."
Now, Tay-Tay II reckons it'd be "crass", at this stage, to reveal if the tome will be fiction or non-fiction, and we'll 
defer in matters of crassness to the expertise of anybody who's worked a few shifts at Spotlight.
You're not going to believe this, but Auerbach's post on X says the book is about a group of people working in 
media and politics and features an accusation of rape against a controversial figure. So maybe don't hold your 
breath for a powerful work of the imagination.
The initial signs are promising though, with Auerbach running his first chapter past an artificial intelligence program 
- you can do that these days - which gave the former print journalist's literary efforts as warm a review as you could 
hope for. From a machine.
But litigation-obsessed CBD worries that Auerbach might be entering legally fraught territory, what with all the 
defamation cases launched after Higgins first made her allegation that Lehrmann raped her in Parliament House in 
2019. The Federal Court last month sustained that allegation on the balance of probabilities.
Maybe Auerbach enjoyed his days in court so much that he fancies another go.

GAS FRIGHT
Since we've come over all empathetic, we'll spare a thought now for Victorian Energy Minister Lily D'Ambrosio, 
who had to watch last week as her so-called Labor comrades in Anthony Albanese's federal government put a 
match to her efforts to take gas out of Victoria's energy supply mix.
As if that wasn't bad enough, D'Ambrosio then had to listen to frontbench colleague Ben Carroll tell the airwaves 
that he was an enthusiastic gas user at home and had no plans to switch.
"I have gas at home," Carroll, the deputy premier no less, told ABC Melbourne Drive presenter Ali Moore.
"We're keeping it [for] a range of reasons, and I think that's symbolic of a lot of Victorians, a lot of Victorians like 
cooking with gas."Page 3 of 3

Moore observed that D'Ambrosio might have something to say about all that.
We wondered too, but the minister's office wasn't keen to comment when we called.

education campaign Forrest established with his then-wife Nicola Forrest.
Neither Forrest nor Andrews were available on Sunday to chat, leaving CBD to ponder alone all the quotations 
raised by the news of the team up.
Who gets to call themselves chairman would be the first one, with Andrews never quite able to shake that 
"Chairman Dan" moniker used by unkind souls over his hard line on public health during the COVID pandemic and 
the Labor man's enthusiasm for closer trade links with China.

There's this too; with both the former premier and the mining boss well-known for having a certain, well, let's call it a 
single-minded management style, what happens if differences emerge on strategy or tactics?
Oh, and you'd think that Andrews' new gig would mean spending a lot of time away from his beloved Mulgrave, in 
China and of course at Fortescue's HQ way out west.
It'd be a shame if someone closed the borders.
TAYLOR MADE
Looks like Taylor Auerbach, the former producer with Seven's Spotlight program, whose jaw-dropping star turn in 
the witness box at Bruce Lehrmann's recent high-profile case matter took some processing, is not yet ready to put 
the matter of Lehrmann and Brittany Higgins behind him.
Auerbach announced on the weekend that he's been "writing a book!"
Well, "just having a crack, to see if I can do it. It might never be read by anybody but me. And I'm only an each-way 
bet."
Twitter link
Now, Tay-Tay the second reckons it'd be "crass", at this stage, to reveal if the tome will be fiction or non-fiction - 
and we'll defer in matters of crassness to the expertise of anybody who's worked a few shifts at Spotlight.
But what of the book's subject matter? Well, it says here that the plot revolves around a group of people working in 
media and politics and features an accusation of rape against a controversial figure, so maybe we shouldn't be 
holding our breath for a powerful work of the imagination.
The initial signs are promising, with Auerbach running his first chapter past an artificial intelligence program - you 
can do that these days - which gave the former print journalist's literary efforts as warm a review as you could 
expect from a machine.
But litigation-obsessed CBD worries that Taylor might be entering legally fraught territory, what with all the defo 
cases launched in the wake of Higgins' allegation - sustained on the balance of probabilities by the Federal Court 
last month - that Lehrmann raped her in Parliament House in 2019.
Maybe Taylor enjoyed his days in court so much that he fancies another go.
WORLD SECORD
Former state Labor MP Walt Secord, who quit politics in 2022 after bullying allegations were made against him, 
seems to be living his best life in comfortable semi-retirement.
CBD reported last year that Secord, who converted to Judaism in 2020, took on a new gig as director of public 
affairs for the Australia-Israel & Jewish Affairs Council. Secord left that job last December, and is now doing the 
more relaxing work of a full-time book promoter for his wife Julia Levitina, who released her debut novel, The Girl 
From Moscow earlier this year.
Moscow-born Levitina's novel, which is partially set in the Soviet Union of the 1980s, has garnered some positive 
reviews locally, and the manuscript for her next book, Beyond The Pale was recently shortlisted for the UK 
Historical Novel Society's First Chapters Competition.
Still, Walt hasn't completely left the world of Macquarie Street behind, and his old party connections have come in 
handy on the promotional front. NSW Premier Chris Minns even stepped in to launch Levitina's first novel at a 
Bondi Beach bookshop in March.Page 3 of 3

Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest and oil and gas producer Woodside Energy have emerged as 
unlikely allies in the fight over legislative changes they say are threatening hydrogen projects in the United States.
The two biggest Perth-based companies on the ASX have found common ground in lobbying against plans by US 
Treasury officials to restrict the availability of tax credits for hydrogen developments through the Biden 
administration's Inflation Reduction Act. Both companies had counted on access to those incentives to underpin 
their US hydrogen ventures.
Dr Forrest has warned the provisions, known as 45V, threaten to "kill off" Fortescue's $US550 million ($836 million) 
hydrogen project in Arizona. Woodside has similar concerns about its H2OK project in Oklahoma, a key plank in the 
company's decarbonisation strategy.
In a submission to officials in the US, Woodside has warned that instead of incentivising hydrogen production, 45V 
would add costly requirements that are "virtually impossible to meet". Woodside has committed more than $100 
million in procuring equipment for H2OK.
Of particular concern for Woodside and Fortescue is a requirement that requires companies accessing tax credits 
to match each hour of production to an hour of renewable power consumption. The rule is designed to ensure 
subsidies are not given to hydrogen made from fossil fuel power during times when solar and wind power are 
unavailable.
Woodside's H2OK plan involves using electricity from Oklahoma's power grid to run electrolysers to produce liquid 
hydrogen. It would source renewable energy certificates to offset the emissions from the non-renewable power 
included in that supply.
Fortescue also plans to use renewable energy certificates in Arizona.
Woodside wants the US to instead offer annual - rather than hourly - matching. Hourly matching raises the spectre 
of having to shut down plants when wind and solar power is unavailable to maintain tax credit status.

Fortescue, Woodside allies on green hydrogen
In a submission to the government, Woodside said: "Switching to hourly matching would require the procurement of 
the type of electrolyser that can ramp up and down in response to intermittent renewable electricity. These issues 
will increase costs, resulting in an increased levelised cost hydrogen in an already challenging macroeconomic 
environment."
Woodside is pushing for annual matching to apply to hydrogen projects that start construction before the end of 
2027 and 10-year grandfathering of annual matching for first-movers.
In a similar submission, Fortescue is pushing for annual matching to apply for projects that start production before 
the end of 2028 and 10-year grandfathering. Fortescue says it is "difficult to have confidence" in the feasibility of its 
project without changes to the 45V proposal.
Speaking this month in Buckeye, Arizona, where Fortescue plans to build its hydrogen project, Dr Forrest claimed 
that lobbyists for big oil and gas producers were behind the draft provisions in 45V.
He has previously criticised Woodside, Australia's biggest oil and gas producer, and its chief executive Meg O'Neill, 
describing her as "hard-edge trained by the biggest liar we've ever seen around climate change over the last 40 
years, and that's ExxonMobil".
"Can we please look at the fact that Meg is driving an agenda to get carbon bombs going as quickly as possible," 
he said in an incendiary interview last year. He separately told the ABC that fossil fuel executives should have their 
heads "put on spikes", and said Ms O'Neill was "peddling poison".
Woodside accused Dr Forrest of using "violent imagery" and resorting to "personal vitriol". "Such language sets a 
terrible example for public debate and should be condemned," it said.

Hydrogen projects backed by large companies like Fortescue and Woodside are set to be early beneficiaries of the 
federal budget's $6.7 billion production tax credit, but one developer says the measure will attract a lot of 
international investment and could blow past its allocation.
Michael Myer, a member of Melbourne's wealthy Myer family and chairman of Sunshine Hydro, said two projects 
the developer is pursuing in Gladstone and northern NSW could yield enough hydrogen to earn $730 million in 
production tax credits at the $2 per kilogram rate.
"I think they've been conservative on what [it] will cost them, but I think the benefit to the national economy will far 
outweigh what might be a cost in the forward estimates ... in terms of jobs, export earnings, bringing down the 
wholesale price of energy and green fuels," Mr Myer said. "It'll pay for itself many times over."
The budget also topped up the Hydrogen Headstart scheme - which targets hydrogen projects of more than 50 
megawatts - with $1.3 billion, making $8 billion in new funding overall.
Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest celebrated the production credit as a force multiplier that could help Australia to 
become "the Saudi Arabia of energy production" in a zero-carbon world. But he warned to beware of white-anting of 
the production credit rules by fossil fuel companies.
"It will also lower the cost of energy for every single Australian by making green hydrogen competitive with fossil 
fuels, spurring massive renewable energy projects in sparsely populated regions where employment is needed 
most," Mr Forrest said.
The iron ore billionaire, whose company has taken investment decisions on $1.15 billion of green hydrogen and 
ammonia projects in Queensland, Western Australia and Arizona, said fossil fuel companies were preparing to 
undermine the production credits program to foil the development of a low-cost competitor.
"The government has sent a clear message - business-as-usual for the fossil fuel monopoly driving up the cost of 
living and trashing our environment is over.
Page 2 of 2
Hydrogen credit could blow its $6.7b allocation Development
"Of course, the fossil fuel sector which, relative to the rest of us in heavy industry, is not a big employer, yet are 
expert at shifting income around so they don't pay fair taxes in Australia, will use profits to try to complicate this 
legislation to make it unworkable.
"The government should be fully prepared for this lobbying effort, one which will attempt to stop a cheaper 
competitor for fossil fuels being made right here in Australia, taxed right here in Australia, and enjoyed by Australian 
mums and dads and jobseekers."
Fortescue's projects include a $US550 million ($828 million) Phoenix Hydrogen Hub where it plans to build an 80 
megawatt electrolyser and liquefaction plant producing up to 11,000 tonnes a year of liquid green hydrogen, a 
$US150 million ($226 million), 50 MW green hydrogen project at Gladstone in Queensland, and a $US50 million 
($75 million) green iron trial plant at Christmas Creek iron ore mine in WA.
Woodside and Fortescue are among multinationals chasing green hydrogen projects in Australia.
Global oil and gas giant BP is the operator of the proposed 26 gigawatt Asian Renewable Energy Hub in the Pilbara 
region of WA, and Queensland's Stanwell Corp is backing a large hydrogen project.

Andrew Forrest's Fortescue will be "doing the numbers" on its stalled Gibson Island hydrogen plant in Queensland 
with a major federal government subsidy scheme bolstering the case for proceeding, according to project partner 
Incitec Pivot.
The Gibson Island project has been the flagship of Fortescue's proposed hydrogen production centres in Australia 
but the company has delayed several investment decisions for moving forward with the development at Incitec's 
former Queensland fertiliser plant.
"It's early days (but) I'm sure they have been doing the numbers," Incitec managing director Mauro Neves said. "We 
are hopeful that with the incentives that were put in place to make those projects economic ... (it) will be more likely 
to happen." The Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive will provide a $2 incentive per kilogram of renewable hydrogen 
produced for up to 10 years per project between 2027-28, and 2039-40 for projects that reach final investment 
decisions by 2030.
"We have been talking about our work with Fortescue on the Gibson Island ammonia plant," Mr Neves said.
"We have advanced that to engineering studies to the point where now we depend on the principal partner FFI 
(Fortescue Future Industries) to make a decision of initial financial closure on their side, and it is very much reliant 
on the cost of energy." Fortescue said in February it was still working on front-end engineering and design studies 
for the project "as Australia struggles to shed its petrostate status and still suffers structurally high green electricity 
costs".
To prepare projects to become eligible for the tax credits, Labor has extended its so-called hydrogen headstart 
program.
Consultancy WoodMackenzie said Australian projects - particularly midstream processors - faced enormous cost 
competition from a sector dominated by China.
Page 2 of 2
Incitec hopeful on stalled Gibson plant
"Australian producers in the critical mineral space are likely to continue to need help from taxpayers to combat 
cheap credit, low energy costs, (and) supportive policies in other jurisdictions," WoodMac's metals and mining 
research head Robin Griffin said.
"Government support can help projects to derisk by providing support at critical moments where the market is too 
reticent to invest." WoodMac added that could be delivered in the form of equity or by filling a project debt stack by 
either filling shortfalls or providing lower cost capital that attracts other investors.
Still, the $2 incentive per kilogram would only cover part of the costs. The "green hydrogen production credit will be 
beneficial for project economics no doubt, but our current cost estimates are $US8.30 per kilogram for green 
hydrogen in Australia, and falling comparatively slowly to 2030," Mr Griffin said. "So $2/kg won't immediately move 
the needle when we expect prices of maximum $3 to allow green hydrogen to compete into steel for example."

Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest landed his private jet in the Moroccan capital of Rabat overnight, hoping to 
advance one of his ongoing investments in the country - and no, we don't mean the bilateral relations forming with 
Energy Minister Leila Benali.
It's all part of what Team Fortescue told us was a "long-planned trip" to help Morocco become a "major player in 
the global energy transition", a deal Benali helped broker during a visit by Forrest and Fortescue to Rabat in 
February - and sealed with a kiss in Paris, evidently, thanks to some extravagant PDA caught by a wily snapper 
nearby. As a Forrest spox told us, the Rabat visit involves meetings with Fortescue's joint-venture partner OCP 
(Benali being one of its directors along with half the Moroccan cabinet, although Chairman Twiggy only deals with 
Chairman Mostafa Terrab, we're informed), plus an event at the Australian embassy, a -speaking gig at the Africa -
Business School and meetings with "key ministers and local ambassadors".
Local media was reporting on Tuesday that Forrest - "surnomme par la presse australienne 'Twiggy' " - had been 
due to meet Moroccan Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch (apparently false, not happening, never was) and Industry 
Minister (and OCP director) Ryad Mezzour.
No pre-arranged business commitments with Benali either - who was doorstopped by a press pack and didn't want 
to comment on all the fuss - but nothing to stop the Twig from finding a corner table at Rick's Cafe in Casablanca. 
It's only an hour's drive from the capital. Bah, even if she doesn't turn up - they'll always have Paris.
Israeli interlude Meanwhile, we note Twiggy's Bombardier Global Express 7500 had been in Tel Aviv just prior to 
departing for Morocco. We asked what Forrest was doing in Israel but his people would only say it was personal, 
rather than Fortescue-related. No doubt he met with a few Knesset members. The visit didn't sound so much like a 
solidarity visit post-October 7 and more like an opportunity to cut a few deals. On what? TBC, we hear. Stay tuned.
King's share play A panicked Phil King appears to have tried to play the market over his holding in luxury goods 
merchant Cettire, led by reclusive rich-lister Dean Mintz. Cettire has been the subject of ongoing prodding by this 
masthead and we hear King was on the phone to News Corp journalists last Monday sniffing about for details of an 
impending scoop - one that he knew would be hardly flattering to the business. On that basis, King's Regal Funds 
Page 2 of 2
Busy Forrest on the job in Morocco
Management tried to beat the news (and the serious risk of a price drop, which ended up happening), selling 25,300 
shares in Cettire for about $635,000 the very next day, well before any article had been printed.
We can't explain why he then bought back roughly one-third of those shares hours later. Did he suddenly think 
better of acting on the whiff of a rumour? In any case, once Joyce Moullakis and John Stensholt's yarn was 
published exactly one week later King immediately scrambled to buy more Cettire, purchasing nearly $1.1m worth 
of stock - and not all of it at a discount. We put questions to King about this mischief but didn't receive a reply.
Cars in reverse Wretched news for investors in Peter Warren Automotive on Tuesday, the company announcing a 
20 per cent profit downgrade, with projections coming in somewhere between $52m and $57m.
That set off a share price crash to a low of $1.84, a cliff drop from the $2.21 and $2.40 that directors Niran Peiris 
and Paul Warren have been paying, respectively, to buy up shares in recent months. Peiris acquired 90,000 shares 
from March to mid-April; Warren, eldest son of company founder Peter Warren, bought 122,000-odd shares at the 
end of February.
The timing of these purchases could reflect some crappy judgment. Peiris and Warren would be well across the 
declining customer demand for vehicles, the higher costs of holding them, the discounting, the thin margin on sales. 
There's also the big, billowing red flag of CEO Mark Weaver announcing his exit from the company in March, a 
signal of doom and decay for any company right before the release of their results. Peiris didn't care, it seems, and 
bought more than $100,000 a week later, followed by another tranche a fortnight afterwards for a total of $200,000.
Not that either of them are alone in making oddly miscalculated stock purchases in this sector. Two years ago the 
Sutton family paid a premium for Quadrant Capital's remaining post-IPO stake in Peter Warren, a $50m deal that 
priced the shares at roughly $3.18, well above the market price of $2.99 at the time, and far higher than the $1.87 at 
which the shares closed on Tuesday.
We asked Peiris and Warren for some reasoning behind their purchases, to which CFO Victor Cuthell replied, 
telling us both directors are "strong supporters of the Peter Warren strategy, its long-term outlook and its prospects 
in general," and adding that they still hold those views post-trading update and even consider the investments "well-
made". Surely all said through gritted teeth. An alternative take is they've been sleep-walking through board 
meetings - or maybe auto execs are generally in denial about the turmoil of their industry?

Andrew Forrest's big plans in -Morocco could be complicated by his romantic connection with the country's Energy 
Minister, who also sits on the board of Fortescue's joint -venture company in the North African country.
In her first comment on the matter since The Australian -revealed her identity, Moroccan Energy Minister Leila 
Benali -refused to shed any light on a photograph of her allegedly sharing an intimate moment with the Fortescue 
chairman in France last week.
In footage posted to a local news site, Ms Benali was asked by a Moroccan journalist whether she had a personal 
or business -relationship with Mr Forrest.
The minister did not confirm the authenticity of the photograph, but did not deny it. "No, no I will not speak," she 
said.
The romantic connection threatens to complicate matters for Fortescue as it draws up plans for a multi-billion-dollar 
renewable energy and green ammonia investment in Morocco with joint venture partners OCP Group.
In addition to being Energy Minister, Ms Benali sits on the board of state-owned OCP, along with other Moroccan 
government ministers.
OCP is one of the biggest phosphate miners in the world, controlling Morocco's vast deposits of the fertiliser - 
estimated to make up more than 70 per cent of the world's known reserves.
Together the two companies plan to build a green ammonia hub in the country, adding to OCP's fertiliser exports.
The joint venture was announced in April, and includes -renewable energy generation and "large-scale integrated 
green -ammonia and green fertiliser production capacity".
The two companies also plan a research, development and education facility near Marrakesh.
Page 2 of 2
Risks in Twiggy's tryst with minister
OCP's plans are controversial in Morocco. It says it has already invested about Ã¢â€šÂ¬2.5bn ($4bn) as part of a 
Ã¢â€šÂ¬12bn green program aimed at increasing the group's fertiliser production to 20 million tonnes a year - up 
from 12 million tonnes in 2022. Its initial plans for a green ammonia production centre were centred around the 
small fishing town of Tarfaya in southwest Morocco - once best known for the treacherous waters off its coast, a 
19th-century British fortress now crumbling into the sea, and for being the closest mainland town to the surfing 
resorts of the Canary Islands, about 80km to the west.
OCP planned to build a -3.8 gigawatt wind and solar farm in the region, with an eventual production capacity of one 
million tonnes of green ammonia a year from 2027 and three million tonnes from 2032.
But, in addition to its isolation, Tarfaya is also disputed territory. It is only 35km north of the disputed regional border 
of the Western Sahara - a Spanish colony until 1975, but since occupied by Morocco.
Moroccan control of the -region is disputed by the traditional Sahrawi people. Their separatist movement has this 
year launched attacks on Moroccan troops in the region - which already hosts large wind farms built by companies 
owned by the country's royal family.
It is unclear whether Fortescue's joint venture with OCP will focus on the Moroccan company's original plans, and 
the Australian mining and energy giant has not elaborated further on their work in the region.
"The Fortescue team is working with key stakeholders as we continue to develop our ambitious strategy with OCP, 
developed over more than two years, to develop green energy, hydrogen and ammonia in Morocco," a spokesman 
said on Tuesday.
Fortescue's African plans have already suffered one major setback this month, after it was - replaced as the 
preferred developer of the giant Grand Inga hydro-electric project in the Democratic Republic of Congo by Nigerian 
oil company Natural Oilfield Services.
The Grand Inga, estimated to come with a total cost of more than $US80bn ($120bn), was a favoured project of Dr 
Forrest, and Fortescue's involvement was announced with fanfare in mid-2021, during the first flush of 
announcements around the company's plans to become a green energy giant by the end of the decade.

Staff inside billionaire Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest's mining empire have confirmed he has been romantically involved 
with a Moroccan politician.
Mr Forrest, 62, was photographed passionately kissing a woman in the Place de Vosges in Paris at the weekend.
The woman who had enjoyed the romantic walk with the Australian green energy champion along the Rue des 
Francs-Bourgeois on the banks of the River Seine was later identified as Morocco's energy minister Leila Benali.
Confronted by Moroccan media, Ms Benali at first declined to comment. "No, no I will not speak," she said before 
being escorted away.
A statement later released to Morocco World News claimed she was preparing to start defamation proceedings 
over the "offensive publication" of the picture in The Daily Mail and her name in The Australian.
It said Ms Benali "denies any connection to either picture as a minister responsible in the government as well as a 
Moroccan woman and mother".
Instead it said the publication was an "attempt to defame" her by "interest groups" seeking revenge for failing to 
achieve their goals.
A spokesman for Mr Forrest's Fortescue mining company refused to comment on who his billionaire boss was 
pashing in Paris.
But a staff insider told The Daily Telegraph the pair have been romantically linked for some months.
It is understood Ms Benali was in Paris on ministerial business at the weekend which coincided with the arrival of a 
Fortescue delegation. Mr Forrest flew on to the Moroccan capital Rabat on Tuesday night.
Ms Benali was part of the official reception committee who welcomed Mr Forrest to Rabat in February after they had 
both been in the Swiss town of Davos a month earlier.

Twiggy's Moroccan energiser
Mr Forrest split from his wife Nicola after 31 years of marriage last year and announced they had agreed to "live 
apart" with no mention of a divorce. This is the first time he has been romantically linked publicly with anyone else.
Ms Benali is an energy expert who was appointed Morocco's Minister of Energy Transition and Sustainable 
Development in 2021 and in that role sits on the board of the state-owned OCP group that Fortescue is partnering 
with. A Fortescue spokesman said yesterday: "The Fortescue team is working with key stakeholders as we 
continue to develop our ambitious strategy with OCP, developed over more than two years, to develop green 
energy, hydrogen and ammonia in Morocco.

7 | NICOLA FORREST | $16.92 BILLION | DEBUTANT | AGE: 63, PERTH
The announcement last July that Andrew Forrest would separate from Nicola, his wife of 31 years, has reshaped 
the top of the Rich List. In fact, the terms of the separation make Nicola wealthier than her husband, given she now 
owns 50 million more shares than Andrew does in Fortescue, the iron ore miner he founded in 2003. But such 
intricacies are a moot point - the pair remain in furious agreement on their commitment to the Giving Pledge, set up 
by American billionaires Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, under which they have agreed to give away the "vast 
majority" of their wealth.
It was to this end that last June the couple transferred one-fi fth of their Fortescue holding worth $5b to their 
charitable Minderoo Foundation, knocking their combined wealth at the time down to $28b. Their fortune has since 
rebounded on a climbing share price for Fortescue, which ships about 180 million tonnes of hematite iron ore per 
year from its Chichester, Solomon and Western mines in the Pilbara. Fortescue's fi rst mine for higher-grade 
magnetite iron ore, the Iron Bridge operation 145km south of Port Hedland, had a slower-than-expected start but 
the company remains confi dent it will eventually ship 22 million tonnes a year.
Fortescue also shipped its fi rst iron ore mined outside Australia, from the Belinga mine in Gabon, which Andrew 
hopes will eventually become globally signifi cant. However, Andrew is more likely to be heard discussing green 
energy than iron ore these days. His dreams of making Fortescue a clean energy superpower are starting to take 
material shape - this year Fortescue conducted the world's fi rst use of ammonia as a marine fuel onboard the 
Singapore-fl agged ammoniapowered vessel Fortescue Green Pioneer. Nicola is driving investment in Australian 
fashion with her half of the Forrest family's Tattarang investment vehicle. In April, she unveiled an $8m women's-
boot-only production line at the Adelaide factory of R.M. Williams, the iconic footwear brand Tattarang bought in 
2020. Last year, it acquired the Akubra hats business and also bought a 25pc stake in the Camilla fashion brand, 
famous for its kaftans .

Fortescue has accused the two architects of its clean energy pivot of copying and taking the company's intellectual 
property when they departed to start a rival green iron project.
Fortescue has asked the Federal Court for permission to search three premises in Western Australia and one in 
Victoria in pursuit of evidence that supports its claim that the founders of Element Zero engaged in "industrial-scale 
misuse" of work on green iron.
Element Zero was founded by Fortescue's former chief scientist, Bart Kolodziejczyk, and Michael Masterman in 
December 2022, soon after they left Fortescue. The iron ore miner, led by executive chairman Andrew Forrest, has 
alleged they copied and took information when they left Fortescue that helped them build Element Zero's own 
green iron project.
"It is alleged that this has been utilised in the designing, engineering and construction and operation by the first 
respondent of an industrial pilot plant for an electrochemical reduction process," said Federal Court judge John 
Logan in a summary of the claim.
Element Zero has asked the court to set aside the search request, which Justice Logan said could become an 
"industrial-scale forensic debacle".
During their time in Fortescue's clean energy division, Mr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk were among the small 
group that spent most of 2020 travelling on Dr Forrest's private jet to more than 30 nations on the hunt for clean 
energy projects.
Mr Masterman had worked closely with Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest for close to a quarter of a century, both 
at Fortescue and at Dr Forrest's private companies.
Fortescue's claim has been lodged against Element Zero, Mr Masterman, Dr Kolodziejczyk and a third man, Bjorn 
Winther-Jensen. Justice Logan's summary is the only document from the case that is publicly available, and a 
spokesman for Element Zero said it would contest the search request.

Fortescue takes former execs to court over IP
"Element Zero believes this legal action is entirely without merit and welcomes the opportunity to respond to 
Fortescue's spurious claims.
Our response will include an application to vary or set aside the original search orders," he said.
"As Element Zero will demonstrate, its green metals technology was developed independently of and is very 
different from anything that Fortescue is doing or has done in this space.
We continue to rapidly advance our technology.
"As the matter is now before the court, we will not be making further comment at this time."
A spokesman for Fortescue said yesterday that it was developing cutting-edge solutions to help the world fight 
climate change and protecting intellectual property was crucial.
"As a first mover, our intellectual property is critical to our ongoing success in this pursuit and must be protected at 
all times," he said.
"Protecting our IP helps to protect the substantial investment of time and effort made by our innovative employees 
and stakeholders every day.
"We invest significant resources in creating IP and are committed to vigorously managing and enforcing its 
protection. As the matter is the subject of legal proceedings, we do not intend to comment further at this stage."
Hearings into the case are scheduled to resume later this month.
The stoush comes as all the major Australian iron ore miners are ramping up efforts to reduce the carbon emissions 
footprint of the nation's most lucrative commodity export.
Earlier this week, Rio Tinto announced plans to spend $215 million building a giant microwave heating system 
south of Perth for its BioIron method of making metallic iron, with up to 95 per cent lower emissions.
Hancock Prospecting and Fortescue are also pushing more into a form of iron ore known as magnetite 
concentrate, which can lower the carbon footprint of the entire steel value chain compared to traditional iron ores.

Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has launched secret raids on the homes and offices of directors of a green steel 
competitor in a move described by Federal Court judge John Logan as a potential "industrial-scale forensic 
debacle" amid claims of intellectual property theft.
Fortescue won court orders authorising the searches in May, targeting the offices of would-be green steel 
competitor Element Zero and the homes and computers of company directors - including former Fortescue chief 
scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk, long-term Andrew Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman and former Fortescue staff 
member Bjorn Winther-Jensen.
Fortescue sought the co-called Anton Pillar orders after accusing all three men of taking Fortescue's intellectual 
property with them when they quit the iron ore and would-be green energy giant, in what the mining giant describes 
as "industrial scale misuse" of their positions in the company.
A spokesman for Element Zero said on Thursday the claims were "spurious" and "entirely without merit".
Element Zero won the first round in the battle to prevent Fortescue from accessing the devices and documents on 
Wednesday, ahead of a further hearing into arguments to set aside the orders.
"Other affidavits â€¦ give pause for thought about whether, as the Fortescue parties have alleged, there was 
'industrial scale misuse', or rather whether what occurred in the obtaining of the search orders, and the obtaining of 
material upon their execution, was what one might describe as an 'industrial-scale forensic debacle'," Justice Logan 
said in his decision. Suppression orders covering the case were only partially lifted by Justice Logan on Tuesday, 
but the case centres around allegations made by Fortescue that Element Zero directors used confidential 
Fortescue intellectual property about Fortescue's green iron - carbon-dioxide free - technology to found their own 
company.

"That is said to have occurred â€¦ whilst undertaking and leading research and development work, which included 
work on what is said to be a confidential process of electrochemical reduction of iron oxide in iron ore using ionic 
liquid electrolytes, to create metallic iron," Justice Logan said.
"It is alleged that, without the knowledge of the Fortescue parties, upon resignation of the second (Dr 
Kolodziejczyk) and third respondents (Dr Winther-Jensen) from the employment of the Fortescue parties in late 
2021, information concerning such a process was copied and taken." In his decision Justice Logan stressed there 
was no finding or decision about the veracity of Fortescue's claims against Element Zero, and a spokesman for the 
company denied the allegations on Thursday.
"Element Zero believes this legal action is entirely without merit and welcomes the opportunity to respond to 
Fortescue's spurious claims. Our response will include an application to vary or set aside the original search

and stakeholders every day," he said.
"We invest significant resources in creating IP and are committed to vigorously managing and enforcing its 
protection. As the matter is the subject of legal proceedings, we do not intend to comment further at this stage." The 
documents and devices were made under Anton Pillar orders, which are made without alerting respondents, Justice 
Logan said.
"The purpose of such search orders is invariably to preserve evidence, so as to assist in the proof of an applicant's 
claim, which may be in jeopardy of destruction, concealment or perhaps removal from the jurisdiction," he said.
"They usually provide, and in this case, did, for a search by representatives of the applicants, here the Fortescue 
parties, of nominated places associated with the respondents, under the supervision of an independent lawyer." 
The court action comes as Fortescue kicked off negotiations with Chinese authorities for the supply of 100 million 
tonnes of green iron from its Pilbara operations in May.
The company ticked off a $50m pilot plant for its green iron production plant in late 2023, estimating it could 
produce 1500 tonnes of iron ore a year from 2025.
Dr Forrest has spruiked his ambitious goal of producing 200 million tonnes a year of carbon-free iron ore for export 
to the company's customers.
Fortescue plans to produce high-grade iron ore for use in the steel industry by using renewable energy and green 
hydrogen reduction technology, together with an electric smelting furnace at its pilot plant. Fortescue will need 
about eight million tonnes of hydrogen a year to reach its goal of producing 200 million tonnes a year of green iron, 
potentially eliminating 220 million tonnes of carbon emissions annually.

Highlight: Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Group has asked the court for search order in a stoush with former 
executives who left to start a rival green iron technology firm.
Body
Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Group has accused two former executives of "industrial-scale misuse" of its intellectual 
property when they left to start a rival green iron technology firm.
The miner has asked the Federal Court for permission to trawl through computers at three properties linked to 
former employees Michael Masterman and Bart Kolodziejczyk to find evidence to support its claims.
Two of the properties are located in Perth, another is in Melbourne.
Fortescue alleges that confidential information was copied and taken when Masterman and Kolodziejczyk left the 
company in late 2021.
Soon after leaving the miner, Kolodziejczyk, Fortescue's former chief scientist, and Masterman, a senior executive 
close to Forrest, founded Element Zero with the aim of reducing the carbon footprint of Australia's most lucrative 
export industry, iron ore.
Fortescue has positioned itself as a green energy convert, promising to spend $9.2 billion to eliminate emissions 
from its mining operations and become a global producer of green hydrogen and iron.
"The allegation at the heart of the proceedings is an alleged 'industrial-scale misuse' of what is said to be, by the 
Fortescue parties, confidential information concerning its 'green [carbon dioxide free] iron' technology," Federal 
Court judge John Logan said in a summary of the claim.
"It is alleged that this has been utilised in the designing, engineering and construction and operation by the first 
respondent [Element Zero] of an industrial pilot plant for an electrochemical reduction process."
The court summary also names a third person connected with Element Zero, Bjorn Winther-Jensen.
Element Zero has foreshadowed an application to set aside the search orders. Justice Logan said the application 
for and execution of the search orders could turn into an "industrial-scale forensic debacle".

"Element Zero believes this legal action is entirely without merit and welcomes the opportunity to respond to 
Fortescue's spurious claims. Our response will include an application to vary or set aside the original search 
orders," the company said.
"As Element Zero will demonstrate, its green metals technology was developed independently of and is very 
different from anything that Fortescue is doing or has done in this space. We continue to rapidly advance our 
technology. As the matter is now before the court, we will not be making further comment at this time," it added.
Masterman and Kolodziejczyk want to build a $US2.1 billion ($3.2 billion) green iron ore processing plant in the 
Pilbara within five years. They raised $US10 million from investors at the start of the year and have plans for 
another capital raising later in the year, targeting $US50 million to $US100 million.
Fortescue said it was leading the world in developing the cutting-edge solutions to decarbonise its Australian iron 
ore operations by the end of the decade, and helping the world avert the worst impacts of climate change.
"As a first mover, our intellectual property is critical to our ongoing success in this pursuit and must be protected at 
all times," a spokesperson said.
"We invest significant resources in creating IP and are committed to vigorously managing and enforcing its 
protection. As the matter is the subject of legal proceedings, we do not intend to comment further at this stage," 
they said.
Justice Logan's summary is the only court document available in the case. Hearings are set to resume later this 
month.
"What needs to be made pellucid is that there is no determination whatsoever of the merits of the claims made by 
the Fortescue parties, or, for that matter, the riposte which has thus far been made on behalf of the respondents," 
Justice Logan said.

A newly formed exploration committee for the Myall Project farm-in and joint venture between Magmatic Resources 
Ltd (ASX:MAG) and Fortescue's FMG Resources Pty Ltd has approved the JV's initial work program.
This committee has agreed to a two-phase work program for Myall in the Lachlan Fold Belt of central New South 
Wales for the 2024/2025 Financial Year.
The farm-in and JV agreement that Magmatic executed in March with FMG Resources will see the Fortescue 
subsidiary spend up to $14 million over six years to earn up to a 75% interest in the Myall Project.
An initial 51% interest can be earned by incurring $6 million in exploration expenditure over the first four-year 
period, with a minimum obligation of $3 million expenditure and 3,000 metres of drilling within the first two years. 
As a part of the farm-in and JV, Magmatic and Fortescue recently formed an exploration committee comprising 
representatives of both companies to direct exploration efforts. 
After a review of past exploration activity and available datasets, the exploration committee has agreed to an 
exploration work program and budget for the coming financial year. 
A two-phase work program at Myall
The exploration committee has agreed to a two-phase work program.
Phase 1: 
Page 2 of 2
Magmatic Resources new JV with Fortescue for Myall Project approves initial work program
  
• Historic core and drill chips re-assay program to provide expanded coverage of multi-element geochemical 
and hyperspectral data not previously collected.   
• Resampling to include up to 75 holes focused on Corvette/Kingswood in the west and at Monaro Prospect 
in the east.   
• Existing geophysical datasets will be reprocessed and integrated with the updated geochemical datasets.   
• A detailed study of the immediate Corvette/Kingswood area will also be undertaken to identify potential 
vectors towards higher-grade copper-gold mineralisation. 
Phase 2:
  
• Six diamond holes, each 400-500 metres in depth, in the greater Corvette/Kingswood region in the western 
portion of the project area.  
• Diamond holes are expected to test multiple prospect areas, with final targets and drill hole designs to be 
agreed following the integration of results from the Phase 1 work.
Next chapter commences
The company advises that work on Phase 1 has commenced, with most on-ground exploration activities expected 
to be completed by the end of this year subject to access and weather conditions.
Magmatic Resources managing director Dr Adam McKinnon said: "With a work program now in place for the 
project, I am excited to see the next chapter for Myall commence in partnership with Fortescue. 
"Our technical team has done an excellent job over the last two years in unravelling some of the key geological 
complexities of the region and in defining a major copper-gold system at Corvette and Kingswood. 
"We very much look forward to building on this work with Fortescue's technical input and unlocking the enormous 
copper-gold discovery potential the Myall Project holds." 
The company notes that the program at Myall will occur in parallel with exploration at Magmatic's other projects. 
This includes planned aircore drilling that commenced last week at the Lady Ilse Prospect on the Wellington North 
Project.

The executive in charge of Fortescue's fledgling iron ore operations in Gabon is leaving the Andrew Forrest-
chaired mining and energy giant, the latest in a long line of senior executives to depart the company over the last 
year.
Julie Shuttleworth has been one of Dr Forrest's most trusted lieutenants for more than a decade, having served as 
the chief executive of the company's energy division when it was first established as Fortescue Future Industries.
More recently, she has been Fortescue's deputy chief executive - a role created when Elizabeth Gaines became 
chief executive to ensure there was sufficient mining expertise at the top levels of the company - and run mining 
operations in Africa.
Fortescue staff held a farewell party for Ms Shuttleworth, one of the miner's most respected and popular leaders, 
on Wednesday. She joined Fortescue as general manager at its Cloudbreak mine in Western Australia in 2013. 
She also ran the Solomon mine before being appointed as deputy chief executive in February 2018.
Ms Shuttleworth said she was grateful for her time at Fortescue and leaving to spend more time with her family.
"It's time to spend more quality time with my family and that will include some great adventures while travelling 
together," Ms Shuttleworth said yesterday.
"I have really loved my 11 years with Fortescue and the experiences that I've had during this time - from sitting with 
the excavator and dump truck operators at Cloudbreak, to travelling the globe with the chairman [Dr Forrest] 
meeting presidents and prime ministers, to working in the jungle in Gabon and everything in between.
"I have had amazing career growth and worked with thousands of incredible people."
Ms Shuttleworth said she had no immediate plans to work elsewhere.
Fortescue confirmed Ms Shuttleworth had opted to end her time at the company to spend some time travelling 
overseas with her family.

"Julie has been an integral part of Fortescue's success. We thank Julie for all she has contributed over 11 years 
and wish her the best as she enjoys some travel and time with her family," a company spokesman said.
Ms Shuttleworth's departure adds to the growing list of senior executives who have left Fortescue recently.
Green energy division chief financial officer Deborah Caudle exited the company in January after less than five 
months as part of what Fortescue described as a restructure.
Her departure came days after the resignation of former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull was formalised and the 
exit of external affairs boss Fiona Sugden to join Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's team.
Last year's departures included former Reserve Bank of Australia deputy governor Guy Debelle, who lasted just five 
months as chief financial officer of the green energy division and severed his links to Fortescue last September.
Dr Debelle's departure from the green energy division's board came in the same week that Fortescue chief 
financial officer Christine Morris resigned - after just two months in the role - and the resignation of Fiona Hick, who 
spent just six months as chief executive of the company's iron ore division.

Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has lost another senior member of its management team, with former green energy 
boss Julie Shuttleworth leaving the company this week.
A Fortescue spokesman confirmed Ms Shuttleworth's amicable departure on Thursday, saying the former senior 
executive had called time on her 11 years with the iron ore giant and planned to spend time travelling abroad with 
her family.
"Julie has been an integral part of Fortescue's success. We thank Julie for all she has contributed over 11 years 
and wish her the best as she enjoys some travel and time with her family," he said.
Ms Shuttleworth had most recently been in charge of developing Fortescue's Belinga iron ore project in Gabon.
She was previously a key member of the team seeking to deliver on Dr Forrest's plans to reshape Fortescue as a 
global green energy and hydrogen giant, as the first boss of Fortescue Future Energy.
She is the latest in a long line of senior executives to leave Fortescue over the last two years.
Former Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner also left the company this year, along with Deborah 
Caudle, the chief financial officer of Fortescue's energy division for only four months.
A tumultuous 2023 saw the departure of chief executive Fiona Hick in August after only six months in the role, with 
newly appointed chief financial officer Christina Morris departing within a few days.
Dr Forrest in February blamed an exodus of senior bosses on the transition from a "fossil fuel-burning company to a 
green energy company", but insists a -period of high turnover is starting to settle down.
A revolving door of executives have jumped ship from the company in the past 12 months as pressure grows on 
Fortescue to execute a high-stakes pivot to green energy from its iron ore foundations that made its founder one of 
Australia's richest men.
Page 2 of 2
Fortescue loses another exec
Dr Forrest last year said executives who left the iron ore major had struggled to cope with the -"boiler room" 
conditions of the company and were not following his green vision.
However, Dr Forrest said in February that a degree of turnover was expected as the company transitioned from a 
pure iron ore producer to a green energy company with lofty global renewable hydrogen ambitions.
Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull also formally severed ties with the company, and external affairs boss 
Fiona Sugden left to join the office of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
Fortescue has promised to end its use of fossil fuels by the end of the decade and become a "real zero" emitter of 
carbon.
Dr Forrest said last year that former CEO Fiona Hick chose to step aside after just six months in the role following 
differences of opinion over the company's green transition.
Dr Forrest said Ms Hick's swift departure - confirmed just hours after Fortescue wrapped up a lavish 20-year 
anniversary party at the company's Solomon iron ore hub in the Pilbara - was an example of Fortescue's "fail fast" -
approach. He said the company had chosen to lose Ms Hick, knowing that it would be criticised in the media, rather 
than delay the decision out of fear of negative headlines.
Fortescue this month launched secret raids on the homes and offices of directors of a green steel competitor in a 
move described by Federal Court judge John Logan as a potential "industrial-scale forensic debacle" amid claims of 
intellectual property theft. Fortescue won court orders authorising the searches in May, targeting the offices of 
would-be green steel competitor Element Zero and the homes and computers of directors, including former 
Fortescue chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk, long term Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman and former 
Fortescue staffer Bjorn Winther-Jensen.

Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has embarked on a major management restructure of its energy -division amid a wave 
of new executive departures, with Argentinian rugby star Gus Pichot looming as the major winner in the shake-up.
The reset has been triggered by the departure of the recently appointed boss of the company's UK technology arm 
and the resignation of Fortescue's president of European operations - the second to resign from the post this year.
Fortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson has been handed -direct responsibility for running UK-based 
Williams Advanced Engineering, renamed Fortescue Zero this month.
Former Argentina rugby international Pichot, a close confidant of Dr Forrest, will take charge of running the rest of 
Fortescue's global energy projects in addition to its Latin American operations.
Mr Pichot has been appointed Fortescue's "regional director - energy", meaning the other regional directors will 
report -directly to him, rather than to Mr Hutchinson.
A spokesman for Fortescue said there had been no change to his position, adding the former GE executive 
remained the chief executive of Fortescue Energy and that Mr Pichot remained his subordinate.
"Fortescue Energy CEO Mark Hutchinson recently took on the additional role of leading Fortescue Zero, the green 
technology arm of Fortescue. Fortescue Zero brings together all the green technologies to accelerate commercial 
decarbonisation rapidly, profitably and globally. This includes haul trucks, batteries, electrolysers, power 
conversion, intelligence software, trains, green shipping and green iron," he said.
"While Western Australia remains Fortescue's home, Perth is not the centre of gravity for our energy business. 
Fortescue Energy's executive team reflects the global nature of the company." In addition to the fresh upheaval 
within Fortescue's energy division, the company is still to announce the appointment of a permanent chief financial 
officer, 10 months after the sudden departure of Christine Morris from the role. Ms Morris quit after only two months 
in the job, following the exit of metals boss Fiona Hick, who herself lasted only a few months at the company.

Fortescue in reshuffle of green team
The latest restructure within Fortescue's energy division was partly triggered by the recent departure from 
Fortescue Zero of Judith Judson, appointed only 10 months ago. Ms Judson remains a Fortescue employee but is 
understood to have elected to return to live and work in the US for family reasons.
Fortescue Europe president Bruh Terfie has also just handed in his notice. Mr Terfie previously ran the company's 
African section and was made the acting president for Europe in February, when Carlos Lange quit the job after 
only 10 months.
Mr Hutchinson will now replace Ms Judson as the interim CEO of Fortescue Zero, the former technology company 
founded to back the Williams Formula One racing car team.
Mr Hutchinson joined Fortescue only two years ago, tasked with turning the results of Dr Forrest's grand green 
energy ambitions into reality.
But from the hundreds of billions of dollars in green energy projects earmarked by the iron ore billionaire's whirlwind 
global tour in 2020 and 2021, Fortescue's energy division has only managed to advance three relatively minor 
projects to the point of a final investment decision.
The restructure positions Mr Pichot as the clear heir to the top job within Fortescue's Energy division should Mr 
Hutchinson, who has just turned 64, part ways with the iron ore and energy giant.
The executive reshuffle may only be the tip of more sweeping changes at Fortescue Energy, sources say, with 
staff on edge over talk the company is drafting plans to "reset" its ambitions as major planned projects fall by the 
wayside and Fortescue factors in a lower iron ore price outlook.
Fortescue recently lost out to a Nigerian company in the race to be nominated to lead the development of the giant 
Grand Inga hydro power project in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
And sources say the company is also cooling on other planned African projects, including a geothermal and green 
hydrogen play in Kenya once slated as a key project for the company that failed to make the cut in the round of final 
investment decisions in late 2023.
The shift comes amid a wave of other senior executive departures. Long-serving executive Julie Shuttleworth, Mr 
Hutchinson's predecessor as Fortescue Energy CEO, called time on her 11 years with Fortescue this week.
Ms Shuttleworth's most recent role was leading the development of the company's Belinga iron ore project in 
Gabon. Fortescue's president of African operations, Ed Kalajzic, will now take charge in Gabon.
The past year has also seen the loss of Fortescue's global director of people, Matt Brady, along with Allard Nooy, 
president of Asian operations, global government relations boss Todd Clewett, and Michael Gunner, the ex-
Northern Territory chief minister.
Dr Forrest last year said executives who had left the iron ore major had struggled to cope with the -"boiler room" 
conditions of the company and were not following his green vision.
However, Dr Forrest said in February that a degree of turnover was expected as the company transitioned from a 
pure iron ore producer to a green energy company with lofty global renewable hydrogen ambitions.
Hopes for both hydrogen and critical minerals in particular remain high given recent stimulus from the Albanese 
government.
Major miners and investors, including Dr Forrest, in May toasted a $15bn cash splash for hydrogen production and 
critical minerals processing, a major push the Albanese government hopes will unlock $50bn in private spending to 
further turbocharge the sector.Page 3 of 3

Dr Forrest personally welcomed the federal government's commitment to green hydrogen in the budget, predicting 
it could drive a "massive employment boom" in the sector.
He said in May the $2 per kilo tax credit for green hydrogen would help drive a green hydrogen, green ammonia 
and green iron industry which would "create economic opportunities of historical scale". Mr Forrest has long been a 
supporter of encouraging the development of a green hydrogen sector in Australia, urging the federal government 
to take action to follow the green energy incentives in the Biden Administration's Inflation Reduction Act.

The chief executive of Fortescue-owned Williams Advanced Engineering has left after less than a year amid the 
latest upheaval in the company's fledgling green energy division.
Judith Judson was appointed chief executive of WAE, recently re-branded Fortescue Zero, in 2023. She was 
tasked by Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest with leading the business as it opened two new facilities 
in Britain and talked up increasing headcount by at least fourfold.
It is understood Ms Judson remains on the Fortescue Zero payroll and has returned to the United States, where 
she has family and a long track record of renewable energy leadership.
Mark Hutchinson, the boss of Fortescue's green energy division, has stepped in as CEO of the business, which 
started as an offshoot of the Williams F1 racing team and was acquired for $US222 million ($334.8 million) in 2022.
Mr Hutchinson is thought to be running Fortescue Zero on top of his responsibilities as head of the green energy 
division.
Meanwhile, former Argentina rugby union captain Agustin Pichot's star continues to rise at Fortescue. He has been 
appointed to the newly created position of regional director for energy. The global role takes in all of Fortescue's 
green energy projects.
Mr Pichot is already Fortescue Latin America president and recently filled in for head of corporate communications 
Fiona Sugden after she departed to join Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's media team.
Bruh Terfie, who was Fortescue energy president for Africa and then acting president for Europe when Carlos 
Lange exited, has also resigned.
The most recent accounts for Fortescue Zero were filed last August and show the business lost £16 million ($31 
million) in the 18 months to June 30, 2022. Fortescue did not respond to a request for comment.

The business is integral to Fortescue plans to decarbonise its iron ore operations by 2030 without relying on 
offsets.
Part of the Fortescue Zero brief is to adapt the technology applied in racing electric cars in Formula E to moving 
large tonnages of iron ore using haul trucks. It is also working on green iron technology.
Dr Forrest and other business leaders are due to meet Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Perth on Tuesday. The mining 
billionaire will also host Mr Li and Mr Albanese on a visit to a Fortescue hydrogen research and development 
centre, where the company is working on electric haul trucks.
Ms Judson is the latest in a long line of Fortescue executives to leave or step back from senior roles at the 
company in recent times.
Julie Shuttleworth, who was in charge of Fortescue's iron ore operations in Gabon, and the inaugural leader of the 
green energy division, departed this week. In the green energy division, chief financial officer Deborah Caudle 
exited in January after less than five months as part of what Fortescue described as a restructure.
Former Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle lasted just five months as CFO of the division before quitting.
Fortescue said in November that it would proceed with its first three projects under ambitious plans to become a 
major force in hydrogen and renewable energy, committing to investments worth $US750 million in Australia and 
the US.
The company said at the time that it was allocating $US550 million to a hydrogen project in Arizona, but Dr Forrest 
subsequently hit out at revisions attached to the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act that threatened 
Fortescue's tax credit eligibility.

This week's visit from Chinese Premier Li Qiang should mark an end of a "puerile" era in Australian political 
attitudes towards China, billionaire Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest has declared.
Speaking to The Australian ahead of Mr Li's visit to Fortescue's research and development facility in Perth on 
Tuesday, Dr Forrest said the deterioration in the relationship between Australia and China in the early years of the 
pandemic - which resulted in China introducing trade barriers on a host of Australian exports - had risked our 
economic prosperity.
"Australia's attitude to China during that period was puerile and was matched only by China's response. To get out 
of that awkward era as soon as possible is the responsibility for any good government," Dr Forrest said.
"Any government of Australia which goes out of its way to annoy its biggest customer is probably going to stop 
being that customer's favourite supplier.
"You can't run around kicking your customers and still expect to sell a lot of boots." Dr Forrest's stake in his iron ore 
miner Fortescue Metals, whose main customer is China, has made him one of the richest men in Australia. He is 
now driving the company to push into hydrogen and the production of "green steel".
He was also critical of Peter Dutton's recent decision to flag that he would abandon Australia's 2030 carbon-
reduction targets if he came to power.
He said maintaining the goal was critical for business planning, and warned that scrapping the target could lead to 
Australia missing out on the enormous economic opportunity around the global -energy transition.
"Barnaby Joyce and others know I am likely to call out behaviour which is going to be directly against the standard 
of living, the national interest, the economic growth of Australia," he said.
"Causing fear and division or claiming you can run a business, let alone a country, without targets just says to me 
you've obviously never employed anyone, you've never created value from scratch." Slowing down the energy 
Page 2 of 2
'Awkward': Forrest hails an end to 'puerile' politics
transition by scrapping the target, he said, would mean slowing down the economic growth opportunities associated 
with the transition.
"The reason why we can drive potentially the next big economic wave, the biggest economic growth, the highest 
employment multiplier and economic multiplier in Australia's recent history is thanks to the necessity to address 
climate change," he said.
"There is a serious economic opportunity here for every single Australian. You wouldn't want to stand in the road of 
that." The Chinese Premier's visit to Fortescue's Perth facility will centre on the efforts the company is putting into 
developing hydrogen-fuelled trucks and a battery-powered locomotive it has named "the infinity train".
Dr Forrest will also detail Fortescue's plans to develop an Australia-China green iron supply chain. "We have the 
leading tech in the world now," he said. "I see this as a really key historical step to creating the next wave of major 
economic growth and employment for Australia." Dr Forrest said this week's visit showed China too had shifted its 
diplomatic approach. "You can see wolf diplomacy failed, and the dip-lomacy of Premier Li is absolutely the right 
step," he said. "We've always been able to export and drive the standard of living we have in Australia. Now the last 
thing we want to do is start hurting that standard of living, hurting that economic growth, and a strong relationship 
between China and Australia is absolutely necessary to continue the growth of the economies of both countries."

Fortescue shares slumped more than 5 per cent yesterday after The Australian Financial Review's Street Talk 
column reported that JPMorgan was marketing a $1.1 billion block of shares in the company on behalf of an 
unknown institutional investor. Fund managers were being offered the shares at $21.60 apiece, representing a 6 
per cent discount to Fortescue's share price on Monday before the sale. Shares fell $1.19 in trade yesterday to 
close at $21.78. It is their lowest point since October. Fortescue shares have fallen more than a quarter since the 
start of the year. It has been a tumultuous period for the Andrew Forrest-chaired iron ore and energy group, with a 
string of executive departures over the last year. Last week, Julie Shuttleworth, one of Dr Forrest's most trusted 
lieutenants and the executive in charge of Fortescue's fledgling iron ore operations in Gabon, announced her 
departure. She had previously been the company's deputy chief executive and run Fortescue Future Industries, as 
the energy division was then known.

Natural gas explorer Tamboran Resources has detailed plans for a $US175.5 million ($265.3 million) initial public 
offering on the New York Stock Exchange. The company is offering 6.5 million shares at a price range of $US24 to 
$US27 apiece. Taboran told investors that it was seeking to raise capital to fund the drilling, completion and 
infrastructure requirements to reach plateau rates for its proposed Shenandoah South Pilot Project. The joint book-
running managers on the IPO are Bank of America, Citi and RBC Capital Markets. "We are excited to be launching 
our IPO in the US to support funding of our proposed Shenandoah South Pilot Project in the Beetaloo Basin," 
Tamboran Resources chief executive Joel Riddle said. "The US market has deep knowledge of the development of 
shale gas resources and a long history of supporting gas companies to fund their developments." Mr Riddle added: 
"Our board of directors believe the US listing will deliver Tamboran shareholders a greater reflection of the value of 
Tamboran's assets." The company last raised money 12 months ago, taking a $70 million capital raise to Australian 
investors following offtake agreements with Shell and BP. But the junior explorer faces an uphill task to secure the 
environmental approvals it needs and proceed into development amid staunch opposition from green groups and 
others due to the impact on emissions and worries about damage to land and water. Shares last traded at 19¢, 
down 10 per cent this year.

The former Fortescue executive now being sued by the Andrew Forrest-led company amid allegations of 
intellectual property theft has taken aim at the hydrogen technology at the centre of his former employer's "green 
steel" strategy.
Speaking publicly for the first time since Fortescue launched a Federal Court action against his company Element 
Zero, long-time Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman revealed that key customers in Asia had directly questioned 
the merits of using -hydrogen to make steel.
Appearing at an Australian British Chamber of Commerce conference in Perth on Monday, Mr Masterman said 
Element Zero's technology would be far more energy-efficient than rival green steel techniques that involved the 
use of hydrogen.
He described a meeting he had with the chairman and chief executive of a major Japanese steel producer when he 
was still involved in promoting For-tescue's hydrogen ambitions.
"Halfway through the presentation, the chairman said 'Masterman San, this hydrogen is fantastic, but it's not going 
to help us one iota in terms of being able to reduce carbon emissions. What we need you to do is go back to 
Australia and work out how to combine the vast renewable energy resources you have up there in the Pilbara, with 
your supply chain for iron ore. Bring those -together in Port Hedland or at the Rio Tinto ports, and convert that iron 
ore into green iron and be able to ship it to us'," Mr Masterman said.
"The best place in the world to take the carbon emissions out of iron steel making is in northwestern Australia. So 
the industrial logic is there, the cost structures are there, and we believe in rapidly advancing technology to be able 
to scale up and really take emissions in this space â€¦ to zero in a way that just cannot be done with the other 
technologies." Element Zero's technology, developed by Mr Masterman and former Fortescue chief scientist Bart 
Kolodziejczyk, involves removing many of the impurities in iron ore by running renewable electricity through a 
chemical -solution.
Page 2 of 2
Ex-Fortescue exec blasts hydrogen claims
Mr Masterman said such an approach would require less renewable energy than rival plans involving hydrogen DRI 
(direct reduced ironmaking), which require using renewable energy to produce hydrogen that is then used to 
process the iron ore.
"The reason why this technology is superior to, say, hydrogen DRI is that we don't have a loss associated with 
making hydrogen in the first place," he said.
"At the moment, hydrogen DRI takes green electrons, which as everybody has said is scarce, and loses 25 per cent 
when -converting to hydrogen â€¦ Our technology uses the green electrons directly and it can use them on an 
intermittent basis." Mr Masterman had a long -association with Fortescue and Dr Forrest, having previously worked 
as the chief financial officer of the company's green energy arm Fortescue Future Industries and chairing Dr 
Forrest's privately owned renewable energy group Squadron Energy.
Fortescue earlier this year won court orders authorising searches of Element Zero's offices after accusing the 
former Fortescue employees at the company of taking its intellectual property with them when they quit. Element 
Zero has described the claims as "spurious" and "entirely without merit".
Element Zero has been testing its technologies on iron ores from across Australia, and the company is now 
planning to build a plant in Port Hedland that will process five million tonnes a year of iron ore into 2.6 million tonnes 
of green iron. Mr Masterman says the technology is scalable so can be easily expanded over time.
The output, he said, would be "vastly superior" to that currently produced in blast furnaces around the world. "The 
key to actually making this business chain or supply chain work is being able to harness the great amounts of iron 
ore produced out of Port Hedland with the vast renewable -assets that are available and -deployable in the Pilbara 
of Western Australia, through our manufacturing plants to produce high-quality green iron that can go to all the 
major steel mills of the world, and they can then save 70 per cent of their carbon emissions by taking our green 
iron," he said.

Native titleholders over the lands that host Fortescue's Solomon iron ore hub want government regulators to 
investigate the site's environmental and heritage compliance, in the latest iteration of a long-running stoush 
between the miner and the Yindjibarndi people.
The Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation has written to West Australian Environment Minister Reece Whitby 
asking him to audit the Solomon hub's compliance with the approval conditions granted for the project in April 2011.
Those approvals were granted by WA's Environment Protection Authority before the Yindjibarndi were awarded 
"exclusive" native title rights over the Solomon region in 2017. Those exclusive rights were further cemented in May 
2020, when the High Court refused to hear Fortescue's appeal.
Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation chief executive Michael Woodley said the conditions applied to the 2011 
approvals were "much weaker" than modern approvals, including for nearby mines such as Fortescue's Eliwana.
"We want the EPA to report on the adequacy of the implementation conditions of the Solomon iron ore project and 
their capacity to avoid, minimise, rehabilitate and offset its impacts to our land, water and cultural heritage," said Mr 
Woodley.
The call for a review comes as the Yindjibarndi continue their pursuit of Fortescue for compensation over the 
mining of iron ore on ancestral lands. The Yindjibarndi are believed to be seeking between $500 million and $1 
billion as part of their claim.
A Fortescue spokesperson said the company was compliant with legislation and took its cultural heritage 
responsibilities seriously. "Fortescue will continue to work closely with our First Nations partners."

Highlight: The Yindjibarndi people chasing Fortescue for $500 million compensation now want the independent 
environment regulator to consider tightening the regulation of the high-grade Solomon mine.
Body
The Yindjibarndi people of WA's Pilbara have opened another front in their war with Andrew Forrest's Fortescue, 
calling for the WA government to impose tougher conditions on the miner to protect their cultural heritage and the 
environment.
Michael Woodley, chief executive of the Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation said Fortescue's 400 square 
kilometres Solomon iron ore mine had destroyed or damaged 249 indigenous heritage sites and operated under 
more lenient conditions than more recently approved similar mines.
"Our community not only endures poor environmental and cultural management, which is a source of ongoing hurt 
and distress, but out native title rights and interests have also been disrespected," he said.

Fortescue received environmental approval from the WA government to develop the Solomon mine in 2011.
Woodley said Fortescue's own Eliwana mine, approved in 2019 and Sanjiv Ridge operated by Gina Rinehart's 
Atlas Iron both had stricter requirements than Solomon.
In December 2023 YNAC made a detailed submission to environment minster Reece Whitby, calling on him to 
request the independent Environmental Protection Authority to investigate if the regulation of Solomon was 
adequate.
YNAC wants Fortescue to be required to protect cultural heritage at Solomon and adequately consult the 
Yindjibarndi.
It is also concerned about reduced flows into nearby creeks caused by water use at Solomon and a Fortescue 
application to increase its use of groundwater and whether there has been any use of toxic forever chemical PFAS 
that may have contaminated the water supply.

Forrest's Indigenous foes call for inquiry into Fortescue mining
Woodley said the only way to resolve the concerns was for Whitby to approve an EPA review. Whitby's office 
declined to comment.
Fortescue was asked if it would support changes to the conditions governing its mining at Solomon to match those 
imposed on other Pilbara iron ore mines more recently.
A Fortescue spokeswoman said the miner takes its responsibilities to protect cultural heritage seriously and is at all 
times compliant with WA legislation.
"We have strong relationships with the First Nations people of the Pilbara ... built on open and transparent 
engagement," she said.
YNAC fought Fortescue in the courts for years to establish its people had the native title right of exclusive 
possession over the area of the Solomon iron ore Fortescue has worked since 2013.
The battle ended in 2020 when the High Court dismissed Fortescue's application to appeal to Australia's highest 
court, exposing the $77 billion company to compensation claims from the Yindjibarndi for mining their land without 
their agreement.
Hearings for the Federal Court case on the Yindjibarndi $500 million compensation case started in August 2023 
with at Roebourne's Fifty Cent Hall where 15 years before negotiations between Forrest and Woodley about the 
development of Solomon failed to reach agreement.
The case is continuing, with further expert evidence expected later this year, followed by closing arguments in early 
2025 and a decision, perhaps, later that year.

  Traditional owners are calling on the West Australian government to impose stronger environmental protections at 
Fortescue?s Solomon mine in the Pilbara region.
   Since Fortescue Mining Group began operations just over a decade ago, Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal 
Corporation chief executive Michael Woodley said the 400 square kilometre iron ore mine had destroyed or 
damaged 249 cultural heritage sites.
   In addition, the traditional owners said they were concerned about the mine's ground water use, contamination of 
the Millstream Water Reserve, and the use of polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in operations and at a nearby 
airfield.
   However, previous environmental reviews in 2010 and 2016 did not find or mention the use of the highly toxic 
substance.
   Mr Woodley said he had made a detailed submission to WA's Environment Minister Reece Whitby, calling on him 
to authorise an Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) inquiry.
    ?We want the EPA to report on the adequacy of the implementation conditions of the Solomon Iron Ore Project 
and their capacity to avoid, minimise, rehabilitate and offset its impacts to our land, water, and cultural heritage.?
   Mr Woodley said the impacts had occurred without the consent of traditional owners, who hold exclusive native 
title over the land where Solomon operates.
   ?The current conditions are much weaker than those in recent ministerial approvals for similar projects, including 
Fortescue?s own Eliwana mine and the Sanjiv Ridge project on Nyamal Country,? he added.
   The calls for an inquiry are the latest in a long-running legal battle between traditional owners and billionaire 
Andrew Forrest?s Fortescue Mining Group.
   The Yinjibarndi people are seeking upwards of $500 million in compensation from the mining company over its 
lucrative iron ore operations due to the "economic and cultural loss".
   While mining operations began in 2013, the Yindjibarndi people won a native title case four years later.

   Since then Fortescue has neglected to enter into an Indigenous land use agreement.
   Mr Woodley said the mine?s lack of environmental and cultural management has been causing his community 
ongoing ?hurt and distress?.
   In a statement to AAP Fortescue Mining Group said it took its responsibilities to protect and manage cultural 
heritage seriously and at all times it was compliant with relevant state and territory legislation.
   "We have strong relationships with the First Nations people of the Pilbara region of Western Australia, which are 
built on open and transparent engagement, mutual respect and the development of comprehensive native title 
agreements."
   Fortescue said it would continue to work closely with its First Nations partners to ensure heritage was managed 
sustainably and responsibly.

Former Fortescue executives will try to have a lawsuit alleging they stole the mining giant's intellectual property 
thrown out for "egregious material nondisclosures" when Fortescue won legal permission to launch raids on their 
homes and offices.
Fortescue won court orders authorising the searches in May, targeting the offices of would-be green steel 
competitor Element Zero and the homes and computers of company directors - including former Fortescue chief 
scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk and former Fortescue staff member Bjorn Winther-Jensen.
Long-term Andrew Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman, now an Element Zero director, is also a party to the case.
Fortescue sought orders allowing the secret raids after accusing all three men of taking Fortescue's intellectual 
property with them when they quit the iron ore and would-be green energy giant. Lawyers for Element Zero and its 
executives on Wednesday flagged a move to have Fortescue's suit struck out, saying the accusations had caused 
"ongoing reputational damage" to all three men, and the orders were improperly obtained by Fortescue.
Appearing for Element Zero, John Hennessy SC told the court the original orders were won on the basis of "the 
weakest of weak prima facie cases".
"We say the order was improperly obtained, off on the back of what was egregious material non disclosure, and so 
we don't want it to continue any longer than it must out there in the marketplace," he said.
Mr Hennessy flagged plans to introduce evidence showing Fortescue employees had previously met with Element 
Zero to discuss the company's technology, which it says is not based on any work conducted by the men at 
Fortescue.
The court was told Mr Kolodziejczyk also planned to introduce evidence he was allowed by Fortescue to take some 
documents with him when he resigned.
Fortescue's lawyer told the court the company would "refute" the allegations it won the orders improperly.
Page 2 of 2
Fortescue's secret search 'improper'
"There was no material nondisclosure," he said.
The computers and electronic devices seized in the raids are currently held at the offices of an independent lawyer, 
and Element Zero and its directors will also seek to have the original search orders overturned and their property 
returned.
Details of Fortescue's case, and of the new allegations by Element Zero, remain subject to suppression orders.
The case centres around allegations made by Fortescue that Element Zero directors used confidential Fortescue 
intellectual property about Fortescue's carbon-dioxide free green iron technology to found their own company.
The matter will return to court in August.
Mr Masterman this month took aim at the hydrogen technology at the centre of his former employer's "green steel" 
strategy.
He revealed that key customers in Asia had directly questioned the merits of using -hydrogen to make steel, 
arguing that Element Zero's technology would be far more energy efficient than rival green steel techniques that 
involved the use of hydrogen.
Element Zero's technology involves removing many of the impurities in iron ore by running renewable electricity 
through a chemical -solution. Mr Masterman previously said such an approach would require less renewable energy 
than rival plans involving hydrogen DRI (direct reduced ironmaking), which require using renewable energy to 
produce hydrogen then used to process the iron ore.

Former Fortescue chief executive Fiona Hick, who quit the Andrew Forrest camp last year after less than six 
months in the top job over "differences of opinion", has joined Evolution Mining's board.
Ms Hick, an executive with nearly three decades of experience, including roles at Woodside Energy and Rio Tinto, 
said she was thrilled to be joining Evolution, where she will also join its risk and sustainability committee.
"Having recently accompanied the Evolution board on a visit to the Cowal and Northparkes operations, it has 
reinforced my view of the quality of the people and assets within the company," Ms Hick said. "I'm thrilled to be 
joining the board and supporting Evolution's exciting future." Ms Hick quit Fortescue in August 2023 after less than 
six months in the job. Fortescue said on the day that Ms Hick had "made a joint decision with the Fortescue 
board" to depart and that her resignation had been both "friendly and -mutual".
Days later Andrew Forrest said she chose to step aside following differences of opinion over the company's green 
transition.
"What we have now is a literally galloping herd of people who want to see this company go green. So if you want to 
step outside that, you're given a choice. You're not fired, there's no disagreement, you're just given choice: step 
back in, or you call it," Dr Forrest said in August 2023.
"All I'm saying is that Fiona was given the choice and she made her own decision â€¦ We're not going to let a single 
person's disagreement with the direction of this company affect it.
"You either get on the bus or get off the bus, but you make the choice. No one was pushed." The Fortescue 
founder then told The Australian that an extraordinary wave of management departures had been sparked after he 
returned from an overseas trip to find the -company's strategy had been -hijacked by several of its -executive team.
The billionaire chairman of the $67bn mining giant said executives who had left the iron ore major had struggled to 
cope with the -"boiler room" conditions of the company and were not following his green vision.
He said he was not to blame for the rapid hiring and firing of staff at the company.

Ms Hick last worked in iron ore with Rio Tinto, as a rail superintendent in 2001. She was appointed Woodside's 
operations vice president in 2019, and also served as its strategy and planning boss, and before that as its crisis 
management leader.
Her role at Fortescue included keeping costs down at the iron ore operations in an increasingly inflationary 
environment and, overseeing the commissioning of the company's troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project, as well 
as the company's ambitious $US6.2bn ($9.2bn) plan to decarbonise its iron ore operations by the end of the 
decade.
Ms Hick was part of the executive leadership team at Woodside since 2019, with her most recent role overseeing 
the operational performance of the company's Australian assets - including both Woodside's original North West 
Shelf operations and the Bass Strait production hubs inherited from its merger with BHP's oil and gas division.
Her career at the oil and gas producer included a stint overseeing its health, safety, environment and quality 
performance. Dr Forrest said at the time the recruitment of the long-term Woodside executive would help 
Fortescue "step beyond fossil fuels".

Fiona Hick has joined the board of gold and copper producer Evolution Mining in her first major career move since 
leaving Fortescue after just six months as chief executive of its iron ore division.
Ms Hick is considering at least one other non-executive director role as her career enters a new chapter after a 
bruising experience at Fortescue.
As a board member she will become a member of Evolution's risk and sustainability committee, and is expected to 
become a non-executive director at a second ASX-listed company within the next few weeks.
Ms Hicks has not spoken publicly since her abrupt departure from Fortescue in August, announced on the same 
day as the company's full-year results.
Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest said at the time that her departure - announced shortly after a major 
celebration in the Pilbara to celebrate the company's 20th anniversary - was "friendly and mutual".
Days later Dr Forrest claimed Ms Hick had not fully supported his reinvention of the iron ore miner as a green 
energy producer and had faced a choice to "get on the bus, or get off the bus".
"What we have now is literally a galloping herd of people who want to see this company go green. So if you want to 
step outside that, you're given a choice," the billionaire businessman said.
Evolution executive chairman Jake Klein said Ms Hicks was "a highly regarded executive and her depth of 
experience, and skills will complement those of our existing directors and further enhance the board".
Perth-based Ms Hick has held senior roles with Rio Tinto and Woodside Energy over a 29-year career in the 
resources industry. She was also president of the West Australian Chamber of Minerals and Energy between 2021 
and 23 and in that job pushed the industry to tackle sexual assault and harassment problems.

At Woodside, she held leadership positions in the areas of health, safety and environment, strategy and planning, 
and engineering, and was executive vice president of the oil and gas giant's Australian operations when she left to 
take on the top job at Fortescue.
Ms Hick recently joined the Evolution board on visits to the company's Cowal and Northparkes mines. She said the 
visits "reinforced my view of the quality of the people and assets within the company".
Evolution acquired a majority stake in the Northparkes copper and gold mine in Central Western NSW from China 
Molybdenum Company for $720 million last year. Metals Acquisition Corp had also bid on the mine, while ASX-
listed Sandfire Resources had considered an offer.
CMOC has owned Northparkes for almost a decade, paying Rio Tinto $US820 million for its 80 per cent stake in 
December 2013. It started to test the market for the 29-year-old asset earlier this year as BHP closed in on its $9.6 
billion acquisition of OZ Minerals.
Evolution shares fell 6.5¢ yesterday to close at $3.42.
Ms Hick joined Fortescue in February 2023 and was tasked with keeping the iron ore operations firing, sorting out 
the problematic Iron Bridge magnetite project, decarbonising mining, starting iron ore production in Gabon, and 
developing a critical minerals division.
Her departure last August made her the 10th senior executive to leave Fortescue in three years; others have exited 
over the past 11 months.

Highlight: The billionaire mining magnate's company hired private investigators amid allegations of stolen 
intellectual property.
Body
Billionaire Andrew Forrest's company Fortescue hired private investigators to spy on former staff and their family 
members, including children, for weeks before raids took place on their homes and offices, amid allegations of 
stolen intellectual property.
Fortescue has taken legal action in the Federal Court against three former employees: Michael Masterman, Bart 
Kolodziejczyk and also Bjorn Winther-Jensen. It has accused the men of copying and taking the company's 
intellectual property when they left to start a rival green iron project, called Element Zero.

The men have denied the allegations. Masterman, who is Element Zero's chief executive, has called Fortescue's 
claims "spurious" and said that their "green metals technology was developed independently of and is very different 
from anything that Fortescue is doing or has done in this space".
Fortescue secured court orders to raid the offices and homes of the men from mid-May. An independent lawyer 
was present, and a computer expert was allowed to search and copy any electronic devices, including family 
members' computers, while also being required to hand over all passwords and passcodes.
Documents released by the Federal Court late on Wednesday, which were previously suppressed, revealed that a 
psychologist was required to attend if a child was present during the raids.
In the weeks before those raids, which stretched from Victoria to Western Australia, private investigators were hired 
to spy on and trail Kolodziejczyk and also Winther-Jensen, and provide a report to independent lawyers. The 
lawyers required that report before a search warrant from the Federal Court could be obtained.
The extent of that spying in the investigator's report included photographs and Google Maps images of both men's 
private residences, floor plans, and also photographs of their wives and children.
Kolodziejczyk, a former hydrogen specialist at Fortescue Future Industries, who lives in Melbourne with his wife 
and five-year-old child, travels frequently to Perth, where Element Zero is headquartered.

Andrew Forrest's Fortescue spied on former staff and their families
Private investigators reported observing him at home with his family, noting where his home office was, and 
followed him on one occasion to Melbourne airport when he departed on a business trip.
The investigators, unable to ascertain Kolodziejczyk's destination, deployed a team to pick up the trail at Perth 
airport, expecting that was where Kolodziejczyk was headed. They were wrong.
While Kolodziejczyk was away on that trip the investigators continued to spy on his family. "In the meantime, 
surveillance continues at the Hadfield, Victoria residence, where Dr Kolodziejczyk's wife and child are permanently 
residing," investigators noted.
Kolodziejczyk is a co-founder and chief technology officer of Element Zero.
Winther-Jensen, who ceased being a director at Element Zero in January, was observed by investigators going to 
the gym, shopping and watering plants. There were also photographs of his wife and 16-year-old daughter in the 
investigator's reports, as well as records of when his daughter left and arrived home from school.
Winther-Jensen continues to work with Kolodziejczyk and Masterman at another company.
Element Zero was formed by Kolodziejczyk and Masterman at the end of 2022. Masterman has had a long career 
in the energy industry, including as Fortescue Future Industries' chief financial officer.
Element Zero said it wants to reduce the carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry. It 
has patented a technology that aims to convert metal ores to metals, not only iron ore, with zero carbon emissions.
Fortescue said it would "vigorously" defend its intellectual property in the development of cutting-edge solutions to 
decarbonise its Australian iron ore operations by the end of the decade.
"As a first mover, our intellectual property is critical to our ongoing success in this pursuit and must be protected at 
all times," a Fortescue spokesperson said.

Andrew Forrest's Fortescue paid private investigators to spy on former executives and their families for weeks 
ahead of launching raids on private homes and -offices amid allegations of intellectual property thefts.
The Federal Court on Wednesday released previously suppressed documents in a court case, in which Fortescue 
alleges three of its former executives - Bart Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn Winther-Jensen, and long-term Forrest lieutenant 
Michael Master-man - took its green iron technology with them when they left and used it to form their own 
company, Element Zero. The three deny the allegations and say Element Zero's technology was developed 
independently of the work they under-took at Fortescue, and "is very different from anything Fortescue is doing or 
has done in this space".
The documents released on Wednesday show private detectives hired by Fortescue followed Dr Kolodziejczyk and 
Dr Winther-Jensen for weeks before the Federal Court issued orders authorising raids on their properties, including 
watching Dr Kolod-ziejczyk's family when the former Fortescue chief scientist was away on a business trip.
A report provided to independent lawyers that carried out the raids - as is required under Federal Court rules that 
authorise privately obtained search warrants - said Fortescue's investigators lost track of Dr Kolod-ziejczyk when 
he flew out of Melbourne in early May.
"Dr Kolodziejczyk's whereabouts have been unknown since Saturday, 4 May, 2024," the report said. "In the 
meantime, surveillance continues at the Victoria residence, where Dr Kolodziejczyk's wife and child are 
permanently residing." There are also Google Maps images of Dr Kolodziejczyk's property in Victoria and floor 
plans contained in the report.
"The private investigator noted that there appeared to be a home office set up within the ... Victoria residence in the 
room to the right-hand side of the front entry door," the report said.
The dossier includes photographs of Dr Kolodziejczyk's wife and five-year old daughter and surveillance shots of Dr 
Winther-Jensen's wife and 16-year-old daughter who, the report noted, had been watched as she left for school and 
returned home on one day. "The private investigator has observed Dr Winther-Jensen at and around his residence

(in Scarborough, just north of Perth). (He) does not appear to be working and has been observed conducting 
everyday activities such as watering plants, attending the gym, and going shopping," it said.
Further pictures included in the report were taken on April 22, showing the interior of Element Zero's "principal place 
of business" in Malaga, WA.
The former Fortescue executives are trying to have the iron ore giant's case thrown out of court for "egregious 
material non-disclosures" when Fortescue won legal permission to launch raids on their homes and offices.
Appearing for Element Zero, John Hennessy SC told the court the original orders were won on the basis of "the 
weakest of weak prima facie cases" and the case was causing ongoing reputation damage to all three men and 
their business. "We say the order was improperly obtained, off on the back of what was egregious mat-erial non-
disclosure, and so we don't want it to continue any longer than it must out there in the marketplace," he said.
Further documents show specialist forensic cyber business Cyter was engaged to assist in carrying out the raids. 
Mr Kolodziejczyk, Mr Winther-Jensen and Fortescue have been contacted for comment.

A Fortescue-backed hydrogen-powered plane start-up has collapsed, burning through almost $150 million in 
investor capital but unable to secure additional funding amid the global challenging venture capital environment.
The closure of Universal Hydrogen comes despite the California-based start-up successfully completing a test flight 
last year, which made it the largest hydrogen fuel cell-powered plane to take to the skies.
The company, founded in 2020 by former Airbus chief technology officer Paul Eremenko, raised $US62 million in a 
Series B round at the height of the venture capital boom in 2021.
Its previous $US20.5 million Series A raise was led by Silicon Valley-based Australian Peter Barrett's early-stage 
deep tech fund Playground Global, while Rich Lister Andrew Forrest's Fortescue was also an early-stage minority 
investor. Other investors include American Airlines, Toyota, Airbus and General Electric.
Speaking to The Australian Financial Review, Mr Barrett said the start-up, led by former chief technology officer 
Mark Collins - who stepped into the CEO role after Mr Eremenko left earlier this year - had been trying to raise 
funds since last year.
"Last year wasn't a good time to raise money, we had a lead for a very significant round, but that lead [investor] was 
unable to fund it," said Mr Barrett, who was also Universal Hydrogen director.
"There were dynamics that had nothing to do with the market or technology. There were a number of unfortunate 
timing coincidences ... It's a really underappreciated determinant of success for these companies.
"We were very close to getting through this crisis. We were less than six months of runway from being in a very 
strong position."
Mr Barrett, who co-founded video game developer Rocket Science Games in the 1990s and gave Elon Musk his 
first job, said the US government had approached Universal Hydrogen since the news of the collapse with offers to 
inject capital into the start-up to keep it afloat, but he believed it was too late to save it. However, he backed the 
team and the technology, saying he hoped the company would "find another home" for its hydrogen fuel cell tech.

"We have test aircraft flying, certification basis, we know the economics of the hydrogen plane are favourable, but 
there is still a two-year path for certification ... That means you have to keep the development program fed and 
there's a very small quorum of money that's in the middle," Mr Barrett said.
"It's not the $5 million cheque, or the $500 million cheque, it's the $50 million cheque that's really hard."
Playground Global, which Street Talk reports is raising a new fund, is also an investor in federal government-
backed PsiQuantum, Agility Robotics, Atomic AI and Ultima Genomics. More than 20 per cent of its portfolio 
companies have already hit $US1 billion valuations.
A statement from Fortescue on yesterday on the collapse of Universal Hydrogen suggested the company was 
undeterred by the the venture's demise.
"There remains significant interest in our green energy projects and the prospect of green hydrogen and its 
derivatives," the spokesperson said.
"We are proud to have some of the first green energy projects in the world at final investment decision including our 
Arizona Hydrogen project in the United States and our Gladstone PEM50 project in Queensland."
The Seattle Times reported Universal Hydrogen's funding negotiations had been with a Saudi investment fund, and 
the business had then tried to merge with Florida-based regional airline Silver Airways to stay afloat.
While companies such as Universal Hydrogen have made leaps forward in developing hydrogen fuel cells to power 
planes, there are still limitations being worked through, including storing sufficient hydrogen for long flights, given 
even in liquid form it contains about a quarter of the energy of a similar volume of jet fuel. On its test flight last year, 
only one engine of the retrofitted aircraft was powered by a hydrogen fuel cell, the other by regular jet fuel.
As well as developing the propulsion system, Universal Hydrogen faced other challenges, including developing the 
infrastructure at airports to support hydrogen-powered planes, and securing sufficient green hydrogen.
Hydrogen-powered long-haul flights are still some way off, but Mr Barrett said it was time for regional airlines to 
convert to the fuel, with the technology already there to support short flights.
As well as being an early investor in Universal Hydrogen, Fortescue Future Industries had signed a memorandum 
of understanding with the US start-up in 2021 to negotiate a global offtake arrangement.

Dispute A bitter falling out reveals pressure behind the transition.
Billionaire Andrew Forrest has the Chinese Communist Party to thank for holding up the iron ore price.
In the 12 months since The Australian Financial Review lifted the lid on his separation from wife Nicola and the 
divvying up of their Fortescue wealth, it appears the life of Australia's eighth-richest person has become more 
complicated.
Through all this, the iron ore price has defied forecasts: trading above $US110 ($163) a tonne in a low-growth 
world. Iron ore's outlier status hinges on optimism about what China's leadership might do in response to its growth 
dilemma.
The Fortescue executive chairman's judgment is in question over revelations that private investigators hired by the 
company watched and photographed the families of former employees. The spying reveals a dark side to the noble 
quest to produce so-called green iron by Fortescue, which makes nearly all its money from selling iron ore to 
Chinese steel mills.
Fortescue has accused key figures behind its leap into clean energy of copying and taking the company's 
intellectual property when they left to start a rival green iron business, Element Zero.
Fortescue hired private investigators to trail Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen in 
the lead-up to raids on homes and Element Zero premises.
The actions, which included photographing Winther-Jensen, his wife and teenage daughter at their home in the 
Perth suburb of Scarborough, and Kolodzijczyk's wife at their Melbourne home, were revealed in an affidavit 
released by the Federal Court this week.
Cameras are everywhere these days but even WA premier Roger Cook has questioned if Fortescue went too far.

Benali, who is on the board of one of Fortescue's joint venture partners in a green ammonia project, later denied 
that she was the woman in the picture.
Under Federal Court rules, an independent lawyer must carry out raids under privately obtained search warrants of 
the kind granted to Fortescue.
Lawyers acting for Element Zero will seek to have the Fortescue claim they stole intellectual property thrown out. 
They have also pointed to reputational damage suffered by the three men and say the search and seizure orders 
were improperly obtained.
Fortescue is making no apologies and is standing by its allegations of "industrial-scale misuse" of its work on green 
iron. Element Zero says its technology was developed independently and is very different from anything Fortescue 
has done.
One-time trusted Forrest lieutenant Masterman and former Fortescue chief scientist Kolodziejczyk founded 
Element Zero in December 2022; they were part of the Fortescue team that travelled the world with Forrest in 2020 
in the hunt for clean energy projects.
The green hydrogen dream remains elusive. Throughout most of last year, Fortescue maintained it would make 
final investment decisions on five green energy projects by December 31.
Three were announced at the company's annual general meeting in November, and Fortescue said at the time that 
it still hoped to hit the target by the year-end. Seven months later, Fortescue remains stuck at three.
It was due to host Cook, other officials and the media on a site tour of its clean energy hub at Christmas Creek on 
June 21 but cancelled the event because of heavy rain.
The heavens opened up days earlier when Forrest hosted Chinese premier Li Qiang at a Fortescue research hub 
on the outskirts of Perth, where it is trialling hydrogen, ammonia and battery power for use in its mining machinery.
Speaking in May at a JP Morgan forum, Forrest talked up the prospect of a fully integrated Australia-China green 
iron supply chain. He said Fortescue would produce 200 million tonnes of green iron ore annually through its 
efforts to achieve zero emissions, and Chinese manufacturers would supply the equipment and electrolysers. In the 
same presentation, Forrest predicted Morocco would become the "leading green molecule and green electron 
provider" in a transformation of the global fertiliser industry.
Meanwhile, his US interests are getting expensive. Forrest has warned that plans by US Treasury officials to restrict 
the availability of tax credits for hydrogen developments through the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act 
threaten the viability of the $US550 million Arizona project, one of the three big bets. Fortescue has counted on 
access to those incentives to underpin the US hydrogen venture.
In WA, where Fortescue still makes all its money, the $US3.9 billion Iron Bridge magnetite operations remain in 
need of fixing. It was slated to produce just 2 million tonnes in 2023-24, and it remains unclear if it will ever hit a 
nameplate capacity of 22 million tonnes a year.
Among its issues, Iron Bridge has been plagued with high turnover. This week, Fiona Hick joined the board of gold 
and copper producer Evolution Mining in her first major move since leaving Fortescue after just six months as chief 
executive of its iron ore division.

The number of proponents trying to shore up projects at the Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct has 
been reduced from five to four.
Fortescue Future Industries, one of five companies last year granted 12-month "Not To Deal" assurances from the 
Territory government to develop projects at Middle Arm, has quietly withdrawn its bid to develop a green hydrogen 
hub.
Fortescue was one of five proponents selected by the Territory government to develop projects at Middle Arm 
along with TEH2, Tivan, Tamboran Resources and Avenira.
But Fortescue's interest in Northern Territory projects has been waning since the group unsuccessfully bid for 
control of SunCable's Australia-Asia Powerlink, which was eventually acquired by Mike Cannon-Brookes' Grok 
Ventures last November.
In February former chief minister Michael Gunner stepped aside from the Andrew Forrest owned FFI after holding 
roles as Australia West Director and Australian director.
His resignation was one of a number of high profile departures from Fortescue, including former chief financial 
officer and Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle, who last year moved to Territory company Tivan as a 
director.
In a statement, the NT government said it hoped to retain Fortescue at Middle Arm.
"Following recent discussions with Fortescue on its project outlook and planning activities, the Not to Deal 
arrangement has concluded," a spokesman said.
"Fortescue continues to consider Middle Arm Sustainable Development Precinct an attractive long-term location for 
green product projects, and the Northern Territory government would welcome a future project by Fortescue in the 
Territory.
Page 2 of 2
Fortescue now at Arm's length
"The Northern Territory government is continually engaging with a number of potential proponents around 
opportunities at Middle Arm. More specifically, discussions are well advanced with two green energy projects about 
land in the precinct which combined are expected to require slightly more land than what was previously proposed 
by Fortescue." The government said Not to Deal commitments for initial proponents TEH2, Tivan, Tamboran and 
Avenira remain in place.
Middle Arm is the Territory government's most consequential major project which, if successfully developed, could 
deliver 20,000 direct and indirect jobs to the economy and millions in revenue and royalties. A visionary plan, 
Middle Arm defies the historic challenge of securing major projects by offering developers the land, infrastructure 
and regulatory environment of a joint user facility to get hundred-million-dollar-plus developments off the ground.
Canberra-focused anti-development activists including senators David Pocock and Lidia Thorpe have opposed the 
development, implying the Territory, unlike anywhere else in Australia, should be excluded from job-creating, 
wealth-generating projects.
While the agreements are intended to provide proponents with confidence and certainty to continue developing their 
proposals, the government said, final land allocation within Middle Arm is subject to key project milestones and 
approvals, specific to each proponent project.
The Middle Arm peninsula is already home to the Santos Darwin LNG and the INPEX Ichthys LNG processing 
facilities. Both companies are committed to net zero emissions. While the government attempts to secure 
development at Middle Arm, it's also wrestling with seemingly constant delays on its $500m ship lift project while 
work continues on two other Top End major projects - the Tiger Brennan Drive overpass and the State Square art 
gallery.
After almost a decade, the government said it was preparing to start work at the Alice Springs Indigenous art 
gallery. In the private sector Tamboran Resources and Empire Energy are continuing work in the Beetaloo Basin, 
hoping for first production next year, Grok is developing Sun Cable and in Central Australian Arafura Rare Earths 
continues to progress the Nolans project, underpinned with an $840m Commonwealth loan.

Billionaire mining magnate Andrew Forrest has described former Labor prime minister and treasurer Paul Keating 
as the Australian who he believes has had the biggest impact on the country in his lifetime.
"His floating the Australian dollar and making a number of other economic and social moves which were deeply 
unpopular at the time but he went ahead and did that," Dr Forrest says, describing Mr Keating's work on 
deregulation in the 1980s as being immensely influential.
Dr Forrest is the founder of the hugely successful Fortescue Metals Group and the Minderoo foundation, the 
biggest charitable foundation overseen, with wife Nicola Forrest, by a living Australian billionaire.
But in talking to The Australian after being named by the masthead as one of the most influential Australians of the 
past six decades - in a list to be published on Saturday - Dr Forrest said he remembers the first time he was 
prominently featured in the newspaper was in less auspicious times.
It was an icy day in mid-1999 when Dr Forrest, now 62, stood next to the then PM John Howard and West 
Australian premier Richard Court to open his $1bn dream in the desert: Anaconda Nickel's Murrin Murrin laterite 
nickel project.
Dr Forrest promised the massive plant would be in full production within 18 months and revolutionise the global 
nickel industry, but a series of technical disasters crushed the dream and he was eventually forced out of 
Anaconda.
"Back then, there were very few supporters," Dr Forrest tells The Australian. Today though, Dr Forrest notes, Murrin 
Murrin has become an eventual success for its now owner Glencore, and he personally has since gone on to build 
Fortescue Metals into an iron ore powerhouse.
He is now onto his next revolution, turning Fortescue into what he hopes will eventually be the world's biggest 
energy company via his huge green hydrogen production ambitions.

Keating our most influential Australian: Forrest
"I think, if I look back on anything with a semblance of pride, it will be switching off all fossil fuels of this huge 
industrial hyper-successful company," Dr Forrest says of Fortescue, every move of which continues to be covered 
in detail by The Australian.
Dr Forrest is a notable member of this newspaper's annual The List - Australia's Richest 250 edition, and his trials 
and tribulations as Fortescue boss have been written about extensively.
That has included tracking Fortescue's incredible share price rise over the last decade, the huge amounts of 
dividends it has paid and that has also caused billions of dollars to flow to the Forrest family's Minderoo foundation, 
extensive executive and boardroom changes and much more.
Dr Forrest's personal battle against Meta, which he has claimed did nothing to stop thousands of scams being 
published on its platforms such as Facebook that fleeced scores of Australians of their life savings, has also been 
written about in detail.
The mining billionaire has also attracted plenty of publicity for his backing of various causes, ranging from vowing to 
help rebuild Ukraine to saving the Western Force rugby union team, and more recently his separation from wife 
Nicola. But it is Fortescue's push into green energy, firstly via its Fortescue Future Industries subsidiary and which 
has more recently seen Dr Forrest return to the company as executive chairman, that has attracted the most -
attention.
It is one that from a corporate point of view fills him with the most pride. "This company which has proved to its 
investors all over the world that it's high performing yet it was the one, even being a heavy industry mining 
company, that switched off fossil fuels," Dr Forrest says.
"And it further cemented its position as the leading industry player by doing so, setting the example for the rest of 
the industrial world that they can and must as well." See full video interview online at

Highlight: Billionaire Andrew Forrest's Fortescue spied on three former employees and their families over 
allegations of stolen intellectual property, a court has heard.
Body
Billionaire Andrew Forrest's company Fortescue is fighting to suppress a 600-page private investigator report, 
which details its extensive spying on ex-staff and their extended family members, in a court case that alleges stolen 
intellectual property.
The court heard that Fortescue conducted 19 days of surveillance on three former employees, their wives, children 
and other family members. The spying included sifting through their personal mail, following some family members 
and partners to Kmart, trailing a former employee to the airport and also spying on his wife and child at their family 
home.

Justice Brigitte Markovic is presiding over the case before the Federal Court in which Fortescue has taken legal 
action against three former employees: Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen.
It has accused the men of copying and taking the company's intellectual property when they left to start a rival 
green iron project, called Element Zero.
A hearing on Wednesday was called to discuss the reasons for the suppression of the report. Markovic told 
Fortescue's legal team that its suppression request in relation to some material was an "ambit claim", while the 
request from Element Zero to release the report with redactions of selective information, such as residential 
address and photographs of minors, was "more nuanced".
"There's a real issue about how much of this material is confidential." Markovic said.
She noted that she had been "littered with applications for confidentiality and suppression orders" regarding the 
case, where there has been a large amount of interest from third parties requesting documents.
In a statement after the court proceedings, Andrew Forrest, Fortescue's executive chairman, said protecting the 
company's intellectual property was critical to its success.

"I was surprised to learn of the investigations and have been advised by Fortescue's legal team that they were 
necessary in order to be granted search orders from the Federal Court," Forrest said.
"Fortescue's external legal team have been reminded that they also have an obligation to comply with the 
company's values and their engagement is now under review."
The ex-staff members accused of intellectual property theft have denied the allegations.
Masterman, who is Element Zero's chief executive, has called Fortescue's claims "spurious" and said that their 
"green metals technology was developed independently of, and is very different from, anything that Fortescue is 
doing or has done in this space".
Fortescue secured court orders to raid the offices and homes of two of the men from mid-May. An independent 
lawyer was present, and a computer expert was allowed to search and copy any electronic devices, including family 
members' computers, while also being required to hand over all passwords and passcodes.
A summary of the private investigator's report, already released by the court, included photographs and Google 
Maps images of Kolodziejczyk and Winther-Jensen's private residences, floor plans, and also photographs of their 
wives and family members, including children.
Kolodziejczyk is a co-founder and chief technology officer of Element Zero. Winther-Jensen departed Element Zero 
in January.
Element Zero was formed by Kolodziejczyk and Masterman at the end of 2022. Masterman has had a long career 
in the energy industry, including as Fortescue Future Industries' chief financial officer.
Element Zero said it wanted to reduce the carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry. It 
has patented a technology that aims to convert metal ores to metals, not only iron ore, with zero carbon emissions.
Fortescue has said it would "vigorously" defend its intellectual property in the development of cutting-edge 
solutions to decarbonise its Australian iron ore operations by the end of the decade.

Byline: NICK EVANS, ANALYSIS
Body
The fact that Andrew Forrest threw his own lawyers under a bus on Wednesday suggests that even the Fortescue 
founder has worked out that setting detectives to follow around the wives and kids of business rivals is a bad look.
Forrest denied knowledge of the actions of the law firm his company hired to prosecute its argument that its former 
executives - former chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn Winther-Jensen, and long-term lieutenant Michael 
Masterman - took proprietary work with them when they left the company and eventually set up a rival green iron 
business.
"I was surprised to learn of the investigations and have been advised by Fortescue's legal team that they were 
necessary in order to be granted search orders from the Federal Court," he said.
"Fortescue's external legal team have been reminded that they also have an obligation to comply with the 
company's values and their engagement is now under review." That may well be the case. But here's the problem: 
law firms act under instruction.
Somebody at Fortescue instructed Davies Collison Cave Law to pursue the three men in the way that happened - 
or, at the very least, authorised the steps taken.
Those, as a quick reminder, include: pictures of a teenager leaving school, following a family on a shopping trip to 
Kmart, grubbing through their mail - and, given Fortescue is still trying to keep the actions of its spies secret, 
probably a fair bit worse that is not yet in the public domain.
If Fortescue employees weren't overseeing the behaviour of their contractors, they should have been. Forrest's 
disavowal of knowledge of their actions will only have meaning if there are internal consequences for those that 
authorised them.
Or, at the very least, a public apology to the families whose privacy has been violated. Until the court case is done, 
we will not know whether Fortescue's underlying complaint is a reasonable one, and it would be foolish to prejudge 
the outcome of the court case.

Forrest 'surprised to learn of the investigations'
But the fact remains that the damage has been done. Start-up tech companies rely on investors to get them through 
early stages of their commercialisation process. Any sniff that the intellectual property they are developing could be 
challenged in court would scare off investors - a potentially fatal problem for a nascent business. Even if dropped 
tomorrow, Fortescue's legal action has already irreparably damaged the reputation of its former employees and 
their business. Justice should be done in public. The fact that Fortescue is still trying to keep its actions secret - so 
far helped by the court - makes it difficult to see how that pillar of the Western judicial process can be upheld in the 
face of this case.

Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest is considering sacking the company's external lawyers who 
presided over the surveillance of former employees - behaviour that has come to light amid a legal dispute over 
green iron technology.
Dr Forrest said yesterday he was unaware that private investigators had spied on three former employees and 
photographed their families, including children, at their homes, until it was revealed in the Federal Court 
proceedings between Fortescue and the start-up Element Zero.
Fortescue has accused key figures once involved in its work on green energy of copying and stealing the 
company's intellectual property when they left to start their rival green iron business.
Fortescue's outside counsel - Davies Collison Cave - hired private investigators to trail Michael Masterman, Bart 
Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen before the raids on their homes and Element Zero premises.
Dr Forrest said the firm was on notice.
"I was surprised to learn of the investigations and have been advised by Fortescue's legal team that they were 
necessary in order to be granted search orders from the Federal Court," he said yesterday.
"Fortescue's external legal team have been reminded that they also have an obligation to comply with the 
company's values and their engagement is now under review."
The statement from Dr Forrest came after a hearing in the Federal Court, which focused on Fortescue's attempts 
to suppress most of a 600-page document that details surveillance of Mr Masterman, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr 
Winther-Jensen.
As for the case brought against Element Zero, Dr Forrest said: "Fortescue is a first mover which invests significant 
time and resources into its intellectual property. Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our ongoing 
success."
Page 2 of 2
Forrest 'kept in the dark' about spying
It is the first time the Fortescue founder and major shareholder (alongside Nicola Forrest) has responded to the 
spying revelation.
Element Zero and the three men reject the allegations of intellectual property theft and counter that the Element 
Zero technology was developed independently and is very different from anything Fortescue has done.
Mr Masterman worked for Fortescue in senior roles for many years and, along with Dr Kolodziejczyk, was part of a 
group that travelled the world with Dr Forrest in 2020 on a hunt for green energy projects.
The surveillance was carried out as Fortescue mounted its case for search and seizure orders covering family 
homes and Element Zero business premises. Vulnerable people, including partners and children, must be identified 
before any raids.
Justice Brigitte Markovic described Fortescue's request for comprehensive suppression orders as an "ambit claim" 
and a suppression application from Element Zero as more nuanced.
"Ultimately, I'll have to resolve how much of the material truly is confidential. There's real issue about how much of 
this material is confidential," she said. Justice Markovic said that, for instance, she could not understand a 
Fortescue application to suppress signatures.
"Thousands of affidavits are filed in this court every day signed by individuals," she said. "Hundreds of judgments 
are released every week signed by our associates. People's signatures are publicly available, so I do not 
understand that application."
Chris McMeniman, acting for Element Zero and founders Mr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk, said his clients were 
seeking the redaction of residential addresses and pictures of children in the private investigator reports, but were 
not opposed to the release of other details.
Mr McMeniman said the Fortescue side wanted to redact "the entirety of the investigation reports that run to some 
600 pages concerning 19 days of surveillance that was undertaken of all the respondents and their employees and 
some family members and wives, following people to Kmart, sifting through mail and the like".
The legal teams were instructed to see if they could find common ground on the suppression order and redactions 
and report back to Justice Markovic.
Davies Collison Cave was contacted for comment.

Fortescue detectives spied on family shopping trips to Kmart, rummaged through mail and watched the wives and 
children of former executives for 19 days, the Federal Court has heard.
Further details about the iron ore giant's efforts to monitor its green steel rivals, Element Zero, and their executives 
Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen before launching raids on their homes and offices over allegations 
they stole intellectual property were revealed on Wednesday.
Federal Court Judge Brigitte Markovic also told Fortescue's lawyers they should revise the "ambit" of their broad 
suppression order requests, which included a bid to keep the entire 600 pages of a report produced by private 
investigators secret.
In a statement on Wednesday, Fortescue's executive chairman Andrew Forrest effectively conceded that the 
company's lawyers had overstepped the mark in their pursuit of the three men saying the engagement of Davies 
Collison Cave Law was under review.
"I was surprised to learn of the investigations and have been advised by Fortescue's legal team that they were

"Fortescue's external legal team have been reminded that they also have an obligation to comply with the

"Fortescue is a first mover which invests significant time and resources into its intellectual property." A report was 
provided to independent lawyers who carried out the raids - which is required under Federal Court rules authorising 
privately obtained search warrants - and showed pictures had been taken Dr Winther-Jensen's wife and 16-year-old 
daughter who, the report noted, had been watched as she left for school and returned home on one day. The matter 
will return to court in August.

"Fortescue's external legal team have been reminded that they also have an obligation to comply with the 
company's values and their engagement is now under review.
"Fortescue is a first mover which invests significant time and resources into its intellectual -property." A report was 
provided to independent lawyers who carried out the raids - which is required under Federal Court rules authorising 
privately obtained search warrants - and showed pictures had been taken of Dr Winther-Jensen's wife and 16-year-
old daughter, who, the report noted, had been watched as she left for school and returned home on one day.
As well, there were photographs of Dr Kolodziejczyk's wife and five-year-old son in the report. Private investigators 
identified -Element Zero's principal and likely secondary place of businesses at two locations close by in Malaga, in 
Perth's northern suburbs.

Fortescue 'spied on' wives, kids
Former Fortescue executives Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen and their company Element Zero along with 
long-term Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman are parties to the court fight. All three quit the would-be green 
energy giant to start their own green metal firm in 2022.
After Fortescue accused them of stealing intellectual property relating to its carbon dioxide-free iron technology, it 
successfully obtained orders from the Federal Court in May to search the offices and homes of Element Zero and 
its staff. Computers and electronic devices were seized in those raids.
Element Zero denies the allegations and says its technology was developed independently to that of Fortescue's.
Such has been the veil of secrecy cast over the case that its existence was not revealed until two weeks after the 
search orders were granted (on May 14), and elements of the matter are still suppressed.
During a brief case management hearing on Wednesday, Chris McMeniman, the barrister appearing for Element 
Zero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman, told the court that for 19 days Fortescue's private investigators pursued 
his clients, their families and Element Zero staff.
He said Fortescue claimed it was "too difficult" to redact residential addresses and photos of minors included in a 
600-page report completed for them, and therefore wanted the whole thing kept secret.
That report contains details about the extraordinary surveillance conducted by Fortescue, including that private 
investigators followed "wives to Kmart", sifted through mail "and the like" and that Element Zero staff beyond those 
listed in the court filings were followed.
"They want the entirety of that redacted," he said.
Fortescue barrister Wen Wu told the court that since an interim suppression order was granted on May 9, the 
company had since lodged a further two applications.
"The reason â€¦ why a further suppression application was brought is because the initial suppression was to 
suppress -material that was confidential to Fortescue and not known to the individual respondents," Mr Wu said.
"The second suppression -application made â€¦ covers confidential information which is known to individual 
persons but not to the world at large." Mr Wu agreed that Fortescue's bid for a suppression order covering the 600 
pages of private investigator reports was "broader" than Element Zero's.
Justice Markovic described Element Zero's application as "more nuanced or selective".
She said she would need to "sift through" the vast amounts of material filed and examine what was sought to be 
redacted.
In relation to one of Mr Wu's suppression applications, Justice Markovic said: "I would like your side to consider â€¦ 
narrow applications".
Hall and Wilcox were hired by Fortescue's external lawyers Davies Collison Cave Law to act as independent 
solicitors and carry out the raids in May.
According to a letter sent from Davies Collison Cave Law to Hall and Wilcox that summarised Fortescue's 
allegations against Element Zero, Dr Winther-Jensen sent emails to his personal email address attaching 
confidential Fortescue technical documents.
As well, Fortescue claimed Dr Kolodziejczyk accessed confidential technical documents on his work-issued laptop 
using a USB and deleted a file shortly -before he left.
"Fortescue are unable to locate a substantial number of documents recording the research and development of the 
ER (electrochemical reduction) process in the green iron project on its internal file systems," the letter read.Page 3 of 3
Fortescue 'spied on' wives, kids
Lawyers for Element Zero have previously flagged they would move to have Fortescue's case struck out, saying 
the accusations had caused "ongoing reputational damage" to all three men, and the orders were improperly 
obtained by Fortescue.
At a hearing late last month, Dr Kolodziejczyk suggested he planned to introduce evidence he was allowed by 
Fortescue to take some documents with him when he resigned. The matter will return to court next month.

Billionaire Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has been accused of failing to disclose "material" information when it 
secured a warrant to raid the homes and offices of ex-Fortescue staff, who have been accused of stealing the iron 
ore group's intellectual property, according to court documents.
Fortescue has taken legal action in the Federal Court against three former employees: Michael Masterman, Bart 
Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen. It has accused the men of copying and taking the company's intellectual 
property when they left to start a rival green iron project, called Element Zero.
Element Zero has rejected the allegations, and its chief executive, Masterman, has described the claims as 
"spurious". Fortescue's executive chairman, Forrest, has argued that protecting the company's intellectual property 
remains "critical to its success".
A warrant was secured to conduct raids on Element Zero's offices and the homes of Kolodziejczyk and Winther-
Jensen. It is estimated that three terabits of data was gathered from personal computers, mobile phones and cloud 
storage accounts.
Included in the trove of data were the entire business records of Element Zero, including payroll data, budgets and 
forecasts, and all the personal emails sent and received by Kolodziejczyk since 2008. However, Kolodziejczyk only 
started at Fortescue Future Industries on July 1, 2020, and ceased working there on November 5, 2021, in his 
roles as chief scientist (energy) and later chief scientist.
Kolodziejczyk is now chief technology officer of Element Zero, a company he and Masterman founded at the end of 
2022.
In affidavits filed to the court, Gilbert + Tobin partner Michael Williams, who is representing Element Zero, said he 
had "serious concerns" about the material that was relied on by Fortescue to secure the warrant from the Federal 
Court.
He said the material "omitted key information" about the relationship between Fortescue and Element Zero, 
particularly in the six months before the orders were executed.

Williams said the material relied on for the orders, which included affidavits, did not disclose a meeting that 
occurred on December 19 between Masterman, Fortescue's chief legal counsel, Phil McKeiver, and Paul Dewar of 
law firm Davies Collison Cave. Dewar is representing Fortescue in its case against Element Zero.
Williams said that in that meeting Masterman advised the men that Element Zero's technology was very different 
from Fortescue's green iron technology. He said this was because the technology did not use a membrane, 
operated at a different temperature range and used a non-aqueous alkaline solution.

Masterman told the men that Element Zero had completed freedom-to-operate searches, which cleared its 
technology and found no overlap with Fortescue.
A freedom-to-operate search is undertaken when trying to establish that a new product or service offering will not 
infringe on a third party's patents.
In January, there was a meeting as well as emails exchanged between the two companies that discussed the 
testing of Fortescue's iron ore, sharing of information, and future commercial opportunities, Williams said. A non-
disclosure agreement between the companies was also signed.
In 2023, Element Zero received iron ore samples from Fortescue, which allowed it to test its technology. It had 
provided Fortescue with information about the results. Element Zero was also testing iron ore samples from other 
companies such as BHP and Rio Tinto.
Many companies are researching and developing ways to produce green iron ore. Green iron technology is a 
technology for processing iron ore into metallic iron without burning fossil fuels that produce carbon dioxide.
This court case focuses on the technology that uses electrochemical reduction of the iron oxides found in iron ore to 
produce metallic iron.
In his affidavits, Williams also argued that the warrant secured by Fortescue allowed for the collection of "highly 
confidential and privileged material" and "the indiscriminate capture of material entirely unrelated to Fortescue's 
pleaded claim".
He said the volume of material taken was an "extraordinary invasion of the privacy", which exceeded what is 
"usually contemplated" in civil proceedings. He said the invasion of privacy also extended to spying on Element 
Zero staff that had occurred before the warrant was issued.
The Federal Court has heard how Fortescue hired a private investigation firm to trail the three men, their family 
members and other Element Zero staff, for 19 days.
A 600-page report was compiled. Fortescue lawyers said the investigation and report was required so that it could 
secure the warrant.
Forrest has since said he was "surprised" to learn of the spying.
Fortescue is seeking loss and damages in the case. In its submission to the court, it claims that green iron could 
sell for as much as $900 a tonne, "which means hundreds of millions in revenue per year for Fortescue". Last 
financial year, Fortescue said it produced 190 million tonnes of iron ore.
Fortescue alleges that through forensic searching of its computer systems that the men took with them information 
that was developed for Fortescue, which they used to create their own green iron technology. A claim that Element 
Zero founders have denied.Page 3 of 3

Body
An investigation by Fortescue into former employees - which has left the iron ore miner embroiled in a row over 
private investigators photographing children and tailing family members to Kmart - was sparked by a report in The 
Australian Financial Review.
Documents released by the Federal Court, filed by Fortescue as part of its dispute with Element Zero, show the 
company did not start investigating workers who left to start the green metals group until publication of an interview 
in the Financial Review in January.
Those investigations eventually led to 19 days of surveillance by private investigators of the homes and families of 
former Fortescue employees Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen.
Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest earlier this week distanced himself from the spying, saying legal 
teams had kept him in the dark.
Separate documents filed by lawyers acting for Element Zero and released by the court on Friday accuse 
Fortescue of omitting key information in submissions that resulted in it gaining search and seizure orders covering 
family homes and business premises.
The Fortescue document released by the court says Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman participated in an 
interview which "launched the public profile of Element Zero".
Fortescue referred to a quote from Dr Kolodziejczyk that read: "Everything we do was developed after Fortescue 
and doesn't bring anything from Fortescue."
"Dr Kolodziejczyk also told The AFR that the idea to pursue Element Zero's electroreduction method had not 
previously occurred to him: 'You actually had to step out of Fortescue to brainstorm, ideate and develop a 
pathway'," the filings read.
Page 2 of 2
Fortescue says report led to spying Green metals
"With these statements, The AFR article set in train a line of inquiry at Fortescue, which involved reviewing the 
projects that Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen had been working on, and investigating their Fortescue 
email inboxes, group SharePoint folder, and two laptops, on suspicion of IP leakage."
Mr Masterman worked for Fortescue and Dr Forrest for about 25 years and, along with former Fortescue chief 
scientist Dr Kolodziejczyk, was part of a group that travelled the world with the billionaire businessman in 2020 on a 
hunt for green energy projects.
Dr Winther-Jensen also worked for Fortescue. Element Zero and the former Fortescue employees reject the 
allegations of intellectual property theft and counter that the Element Zero technology was developed independently 
and is very different from anything Fortescue has done.
Material seized from raids on the homes of Mr Masterman, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen is being held 
by independent lawyers.

Body
Fortescue seized personal banking details of former employees that were the subject of raids conducted by the 
mining giant - as well as the entire business records of rival green iron start-up -Element Zero - claims in the 
Federal Court show.
The "extraordinary" orders won by Fortescue's lawyers include details of private negotiations between Element 
Zero and other Fortescue rivals, as well as deeply personal information of its staff, potentially including personal 
banking passwords and private communications between the former Fortescue staff and their families.
Documents released by the Federal Court on Friday also show that, despite Fortescue's claims its former staff 
stole its intellectual property, the iron ore giant was last year selling its would-be rival iron ore to help them test their 
own technology, and had agreed to protocols for the exchange of information about how well it worked using 
Fortescue ore.
The new revelations come after Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest claimed he did not know his 
company paid private investigators to follow the wives of his ex-staff Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen 
into Kmart, take pictures of their children and rummage through mail before court-sanctioned raids were launched 
on their homes and offices. Fortescue won court orders to carry out raids in May after it was alleged Element 
Zero's Dr Kolodziejczyk, Dr Winther-Jensen and Michael Masterman stole Fortescue's carbon-dioxide-free green 
iron tech-nology secrets when they all quit several years ago.
Despite elements of the court case remaining suppressed, fresh documents released on Friday revealed Element 
Zero's concern that an "extraordinarily large volume" of electronic material - more than three terabytes - belonging 
to its young business was captured during the searches.
Element Zero's Gilbert & Tobin lawyer Michael Williams said virtually the entirety of Ele-ment Zero's documents and 
emails were seized, "together with highly confidential and privileged material" that was "entirely unrelated to 
Fortescue's pleaded claim". The entire contents of Dr Kolodziejczyk's mobile was downloaded, including photos 
and videos, and about 3TB of data was captured, which Mr Williams said was "an extremely large volume" to be 
caught under Anton Piller search orders in his experience.
Page 2 of 2
Fortescue 'seized personal details'
Further, he said there were grounds for the search orders to be scrapped based on "the apparent extraordinary 
invasion of the privacy of the respondents".
"I am informed by Mr Masterman and believe that, as a result of how the search orders are drafted and executed 
they will have captured a very large amount of information that is confidential, privileged, and not likely to be 
relevant to these proceedings," Mr Williams said.
"The search orders will have captured material that is ... highly confidential to third parties including competitors of 
Fortescue." As well, Mr William said he believed images taken of Dr Kolodziejczyk's phone would have captured 
data including passwords for online banking and superannuation.
According to a summary of Fortescue's arguments, staff became suspicious about the activities of the three men 
after they realised Mr Masterman was working with Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen in September, that 
they incorporated Element Zero, which was "potentially developing technology that is similar to technology â€¦ 
developed for Fortescue", and that Element Zero was "seeking the supply of iron ore samples from Fortescue to 
help test (Element Zero's) technology".
A story published in the Australian Financial Review on January 17 kicked off their concerns.
"The AFR article set in train a line of inquiry at Fortescue, which involved reviewing the projects that Dr 
Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen had been working on, and investigating their Fortescue email inboxes, group 
SharePoint folder and two laptops on suspicion of IP leakage," the summary read.
After Dr Kolodziejczyk resigned in October 2021, he attended a meeting at which he was told he could not work at 
Fortescue's office to finish his notice period. Dr Kolodziejczyk was told he could "make copies and use documents 
he needed" to wrap up and that he should delete "everything" saved locally on his Fortescue laptop before he 
returned it because the company had copies on SharePoint. He continued to work on patent applications for 
Fortescue up until he left the company, court documents said.

Highlight: Tristan did not just get his own desk at Fortescue when he shared his diagnosis. He got a ticket to be 
himself.
Body
When his son was being assessed for autism, Tristan Calder argued about various aspects of his son's behaviour: 
"That's normal, I did that as a child".
Then the penny dropped.

Colin Murty
So he got tested, too. And so in his early 40s, Calder discovered not only his son, but also himself to be autistic, as 
are one in 150 Australians.
"It's possibly the best thing I've ever done," the Fortescue worker says, of seeking the diagnosis. "It helped me fully 
understand myself."
Calder is clear, however, that his experiences are his alone. "If you meet one person with autism, you've met 
exactly one person with autism," he says.
"For me, I have challenges around social interaction, communication [and] repetitive behaviours that I can't get out 
of."
He likes a plan - and is good at making them - but deals poorly with surprises.
He must park in the same spot every day, take the same path from the car to the same lift, and then walk to the 
same desk - only possible because Fortescue exempted him from its hot-desking policy.
"I can't use these toilets," he says while being interviewed at the miner's Perth headquarters, "this is how stupid it is 
- I use the toilets out there."
Without his own desk, Calder says he would be overwhelmed by dealing with different screens, different lights and 
glare, the mouse and charger in different spots, and an unfamiliar coworker beside him.

'Best thing I've ever done': How a chance diagnosis transformed this WA mining worker's life
"These little triggers build up slowly," he says.

Colin Murty
"Your body doesn't filter any of this out, so it's taking all this sensory input and ... it's all rattling around in here."
Calder got his own desk because he was willing to share his diagnosis with his supervisor and say what he needed. 
To him, having a corporate culture where workers feel comfortable sharing their concerns is key.
"I don't want people to start to pigeonhole people and think 'he might be autistic,'" he says.
"The only way you can help an autistic person is for them to approach you."
Calder says he got more than his own desk when he shared his diagnosis: he got a ticket to be himself.
Because of the stigma attached to neurodiversity - a non-medical term for those who experience the world 
differently, including ADHD, dyslexia and various other conditions as well as autism - Calder would previously 
"mask".
"Masking, in layman's terms, is cosplaying as a normal person," he says.
"You're suppressing your diagnosis ... and that comes with a massive emotional, physical and mental drain."
Stimming - repetitive behaviours used by people with autism to reduce stress - can look unprofessional to 
neurotypical co-workers.
Fortescue head of healthy safety and risk Zara Fisher says she has seen workers get incredibly poor performance 
feedback for actions such as fiddling at meetings, which can be interpreted as a sign of not concentrating.
"Things like that have nothing to do with the person's productivity or capacity, but more about how they present 
themselves," she said.
The fortnightly 2½-hour team meeting was a particular ordeal for Calder. Now he can rock back and forth in his 
chair without explaining himself.
"They know that if I interject, or I talk loud, or I say something that might be perceived to be abrupt, I'm not just 
being an arsehole," he said.
"Weekends for me four or five years ago would be on the couch, zoned out, trying to recover from the week of work 
I've had because I've been masking."
The diagnosis has also led Calder to seek assistance from speech and occupational therapists and understand 
himself better, causing life to improve at home as well as work.
Now he understands his own triggers, and works around them with the help of his wife.
"That helps our relationship massively," he says.
Calder is part of a network of neurodiverse employees at Fortescue who support each other. They also provide 
"reverse mentoring" for supervisors by letting them chat with a network member with a similar diagnosis to 
someone on their team who they are unsure how to support.
For Fisher, the key for supervisors is realising that everyone - both neurodiverse and neurotypical - is different.
"Every one of us functions best under certain circumstances, or we might just have other things going on in our 
lives," she says.Page 3 of 3
'Best thing I've ever done': How a chance diagnosis transformed this WA mining worker's life
The trick is creating a "safe space" where workers will tell the boss they are struggling and what they need.
And the prize for employers? Fisher says freeing workers from exhausting themselves pretending to be someone 
else leaves them with more energy. Not just for themselves - but also for work.

"What it comes down to, from a neurological standpoint, is our brains are wired differently, and that comes with 
complexities but also comes with strengths and benefits."
Calder occasionally works in a pod in Fortescue's open-plan office when he really needs to focus.

Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has lost yet another senior executive, with Asia Pacific energy boss Eva Hanly 
understood to have parted ways with the company.
Ms Hanly's departure comes amid ongoing upheaval in Fortescue's energy division, after a restructure of 
responsibilities in June in which former Argentinian rugby star Gus Pichot was promoted to the newly created 
position of regional director for energy - a role which effectively oversees all of Fortescue's green energy projects - 
reporting to Fortescue Energy boss Mark Hutchinson.
Ms Hanly joined Fortescue's energy division 18 months ago, after a six-month stint as chief executive of Dr 
Forrest's private energy business Squadron Energy. She had previously worked for Transgrid, Transurban and 
Origin Energy.
Her exit comes after Fortescue has retreated from many of its planned green hydrogen and ammonia projects in 
the region.
A plan to develop an ammonia production facility at Incitec Pivot's mothballed Gibson Island - once at the top of 
Fortescue's Australian development list - has been stalled since 2023 over high energy costs.
Plans to build an ammonia facility at Bell Bay in Tasmania have similarly been put on ice over power costs, and the 
company's grand plans to build huge hydro-electric power facilities in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia have also 
seemingly fallen by the wayside.
Fortescue has made only three final investment decisions on green hydrogen projects over the past year - a small 
hydrogen plant in Gladstone in Queensland, a facility in Arizona, and a green iron trial commercial plant in the 
Pilbara. Fortescue last year also "fast-tracked" work on hydrogen production projects in Brazil, Kenya and Norway, 
but is still to make a formal investment decision on any of those.
Ms Hanly is the latest of a long line of Fortescue executives to part ways with the company.

Upheaval continues as Fortescue loses another energy exec
Last month Judith Judson, chief executive of UK technology company Fortescue Zero - formerly known as Williams 
Advanced Engineering - stepped down from the role after only 10 months, although she is still believed to be 
working for the company after returning to the US.
Mr Hutchinson took on the role of running Fortescue Zero in addition to his other responsibilities at the company. 
His predecessor in Fortescue's top energy job, Julie Shuttleworth, parted ways with the company in recent months, 
and Fortescue Europe president Bruh Terfie also handed in his notice after replacing Carlos Lange in the role in 
February.
Fortescue's energy division is also involved in a damaging dispute with another group of former key executives, 
including former chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk and long-term Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman, over 
allegations of intellectual property theft.
Fortescue has accused the pair - along with another former employee, Bjorn Winther-Jensen - of using proprietary 
Fortescue information to form their own green iron technology company.
All three have denied the accusations and have, in turn, accused Fortescue of wildly inappropriate behaviour in its 
efforts to win court orders allowing a search of their homes and offices - including spying on family members, 
reading their mail, and omitting key information in submissions to the court ahead of those orders being granted. 
Fortescue shares closed up 38c to $22.48 per share on Monday.

Fortescue has announced it will slash 700 jobs from its global operations as part of a major restructure, as the 
company promises to deliver on green technology and diversity goals.
The company, helmed by multi-billionaire Andrew Forrest, announced to the Australian Stock Exchange on 
Wednesday afternoon that hundreds of jobs would be lost as part of a company restructure.
“Fortescue remains resolute in its commitment to be the world’s leading green technology, energy and metals 
company with a laser focus on achieving Real Zero by 2030,” the statement said.
“The company has undergone a period of rapid growth and transition, and as part of bringing together Metals and 
Energy into One Fortescue, initiatives are being implemented to simplify its structure, remove duplication and 
deliver cost efficiencies.”
As part of this, 700 jobs will be slashed across the global sites, with the process to be finalised by the end of this 
month, the statement said.

“The company must continually evolve to ensure it remains lean, is best positioned to deliver on its strategy and 
generate the maximum value for shareholders.
“Fortescue is grateful for the contribution of all those impacted by these changes.”
The statement also said the new One Fortescue team will be reflective of the aim for the board to be 50% women.

“Diversity will continue to be a key measure of our performance, with new targets implemented to drive diversity 
across the business.”
Forrest issued a separate statement in which he did not mention the job cuts – instead he focused on the 
company’s green future, saying it was “absolutely resolute” in its commitment to decarbonisation goals.
“Being a first mover isn’t easy, but as we learnt 21 years ago, risk is always worth the reward,” he said.
“Part of the reason Fortescue is the highest performing company on Australia’s Stock Exchange is that we do 
things differently.
“We do not apologise for requesting people leave their corporate culture behind when they join us … nor will we 
apologise when we don’t look like everyone else.”

streamline business.
Body
Andrew Forrest's Fortescue mining company has announced it is slashing 700 jobs while affirming its "resolute" 
commitment to its green technology vision.
In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange, Fortescue (FMG) said the restructure would ensure the Perth-
based mining company remains "lean, impactful and agile."
"As part of this, approximately 700 people from across Fortescue's global operations will be offered redundancies, 
with that process to be finalised by the end of July 2024," the statement read.
The company said it remained committed to its green technology developments, and must evolve to deliver on its 
strategy, and generate maximum value for shareholders.
However, it said the company was "grateful for the contribution of all those impacted by these changes."
Forrest makes no mention of cuts
Executive chairman Andrew Forrest issued a separate statement shortly after, but did not mention the job cuts.
He said the company was "absolutely resolute" in its commitment to achieving its decarbonisation goals by 2030 
and that "without change, improvement is impossible".
"Being a first mover isn't easy, but as we learnt 21 years ago, risk is always worth the reward," he said.
"Part of the reason Fortescue is the highest performing company on Australia's Stock Exchange is that we do 
things differently.

"We do not apologise for requesting people leave their corporate culture behind when they join us … nor will we 
apologise when we don't look like everyone else."
Fortescue has extensive iron ore operations in WA's Pilbara, and in 2022-23 exported 192 million tonnes of ore.
However, in recent years it has been focusing on the development of green hydrogen and the decarbonisation of its 
operations.
'Not seeing the full picture'
Some analysts have said the job losses showed the mining giant was slowing its push into green hydrogen or 
abandoning its ambitions altogether.
But resources analyst Tim Treadgold wasn't so sure.
"We're not seeing the full picture outside," he said.
"Whether it's related to iron ore and a troubling outlook with China construction slowing, or whether it's related to 
hydrogen, which is not developing or being developed as quickly as we had been promised, we don't know.
"It could just be a nice round 700 figure to lower the overall cost base. There's a lot more yet to be revealed.
"You've got Macquarie Bank out there at the moment with a great big 'sell' recommendation on Fortescue and a 
share price tip, which is close to half what the company is at the moment.
"That's a big call by a big bank."
Mr Treadgold said iron ore remained the "engine room" for Fortescue.
"China is a big problem for Fortescue, it's a big problem for Australia and hydrogen is a peculiar problem for 
Fortescue because the world is just not ready for it yet," he said.
"To make a move like this and then wrap it all up in two weeks, either something serious has happened or the 
company is looking at the future and saying we need to pull our head in."

Fortescue ( OTCQX:FSUMF) said Wednesday said it will cut ~700 employees as part of a restructuring aiming to 
"simplify its structure, remove duplication and deliver cost efficiencies" in its metals and energy businesses.
Founder and executive chairman Andrew Forrest has been attempting to pivot from iron ore, which still generates 
the vast majority of revenue, by investing heavily in green technologies, but a Fortescue ( OTCQX:FSUMF) 
spokesperson told Bloomberg that the goal of producing 15M tons/year of green hydrogen will be held back until 
electricity prices fall, and that activity on the technology will be slowed down across the board.
Green hydrogen has not yet been commercially produced anywhere; Fortescue ( OTCQX:FSUMF) currently makes 
a relatively small amount at a plant in Western Australia and last year made a final investment decision on three 
other projects at a cost of ~$750M.
Forrest reportedly told the Australian Financial Review that wars in Ukraine and the Middle East had raised global 
energy prices, making green hydrogen production at scale unviable.
Fortescue ( OTCQX:FSUMF) also appointed Apple Paget as group CFO after serving 11 months in the role on an 
interim basis.

Body
Mining billionaire Andrew Forrest has seen the light on his overblown green hydrogen ambitions and in the process 
pulled the plug on a centrepiece of Labor's renewables-only energy transition plan.
Forrest has admitted what should have been obvious from the start. Energy users want cheap energy and hydrogen 
is not cheap. Having scoured the world for subsidies and customers, Forrest has learnt that any technological 
advance to lower costs will be hard won.
He has instead launched a sweeping restructure of Fortescue with as many as 700 jobs going and the company's 
goal of producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030 has been shelved. This leaves Fortescue, a 
company with one of the nation's largest carbon emissions footprints, looking for other ways to salve its eco-
conscience. But it leaves the federal government with a much bigger hole to fill.
Billions of public subsidy dollars are being directed towards getting hydrogen production down to a reasonable 
price. In the Albanese government's mind, it is the nation's route to being a renewable energy superpower.
In the latest sign of what hydrogen means for the federal government, it has put forward draft plans that, unlike Joe 
Biden's hydrogen subsidy scheme, will allow green hydrogen producers to claim a credit for hydrogen that is 
actually made with fossil fuels.
The US refusal to count gas-fired hydrogen might explain why among the projects shelved as part of Fortescue's 
restructure is a hydrogen play in the US state of Washington.
Fortescue has spent hundreds of millions of dollars examining potential green hydrogen and ammonia sites across 
the world, but has so far delivered just three investment decisions across the would-be green energy portfolio. One 
of these is a small-scale pilot plant in Gladstone, Queensland.
Without hydrogen, Labor's renewables-only transition is left looking for a reliable long-term fuel that can firm the grid 
when wind and solar fail to produce. Grid-scale batteries will get you only so far.
Page 2 of 2
Minister left high and dry by sudden change of direction
Hydro is the obvious answer, but look at Snowy 2.0. On Wednesday, Energy Minister Chris Bowen remained full 
bore on a renewables-only plan. Without hydrogen, Labor has little choice but to go back to gas, something he 
ironically described as a life insurance policy, and something he and those inside the energy industry know to be 
true.
The federal government has a lot of work to do persuading states to lift their bans on gas exploration and 
development.
Gas is also the clash of ideology that the Greens have been most anxious to have with Labor. The big picture is a 
re-elected Donald Trump as US president will reinvigorate the global energy picture as he strives to restore US 
energy independence. Forrest has shown that private capital can quickly change course. Government must show it 
can do so as well.

Body
Mining billionaire Andrew Forrest's Fortescue will slash 700 jobs and merge its mining and energy divisions, as the 
company tempers its ambition to be a major producer of the clean fuel hydrogen.
The $70 billion miner announced late on Wednesday - shortly after Forrest addressed its almost 16,000 staff - that 
the cuts would mainly hit white-collar roles.

Since 2020, Forrest has toured the world promoting the virtues of green hydrogen as an emissions-free fuel and 
seeking to partner with governments that have areas suitable for producing the vast amounts of wind, solar or 
hydropower required.
Forrest defended the high-profile quest, which involved Fortescue assessing 150 projects across the world at one 
stage in the search for cheap electricity, as a targeted effort to ensure value for shareholders.
"The 'scattergun' critics obviously haven't gotten a lot of new industries off the ground," he said.
However, Fortescue's reassessment on Wednesday highlights a realisation that producing the huge amount of 
energy required to separate hydrogen from water is extraordinarily costly.
It now plans to switch its focus to reducing that cost. Forrest said it would enable the company to compete "blow 
for-blow" with "fossil fuel peddlers".
In recent years, Forrest has set increasingly ambitious climate goals for the iron ore miner that made him Australia's 
richest man.
He first charged the mine operations with the goal of emitting net zero carbon emissions by 2030, two decades 
ahead of the two bigger Pilbara miners, Rio Tinto and BHP.
Page 2 of 2

Later, Forrest demanded zero actual emissions, removing the option to buy carbon offsets for any emissions that 
were technically difficult or prohibitively expensive to eliminate.
"We've got this unfolding miracle of Fortescue going fully green this decade," he said.
Initially, Fortescue touted green hydrogen as vital to decarbonise its own operations but more recently its efforts 
have almost exclusively focused on electrifying its operations, which are heavily dependent on diesel, and ensuring 
that the electricity used is renewable.
Forrest's goals covered both Fortescue's own emissions - termed Scopes 1 and 2 - and the far greater carbon 
pollution from the steel mills buying Fortescue iron ore, known as Scope 3 emissions.
In late 2021, Fortescue targeted zero Scope 3 emissions by 2040 and the production of 15 million tonnes a year of 
green hydrogen by 2030.
"That is what the world needed, and that's where we always start," he said, adding that the targets were set before 
the "massive spikes" in energy prices in part caused by the market upheaval after Russia invaded Ukraine.
In early 2023, Fortescue committed to making final investment decisions on at least five green hydrogen projects 
by December 2023. It achieved two: a plant to make 30 tonnes of liquid hydrogen a day in Arizona and a $US150 
million ($223 million) investment in a facility in Gladstone, Queensland.
There are no more commitments to investments, but Fortescue will keep investigating the feasibility of a project in 
Norway that is three times bigger than the Gladstone plant, and may also launch a study into an opportunity in 
Brazil.
As part of the restructure accompanying the job cuts, Fortescue will retain dual chief executives - Dino Otranto for 
mining and Mark Hutchinson in energy - but will merge other senior corporate roles.
Two executives who have been with Fortescue for 18 months or less have emerged as major winners. Chief 
financial officer for mining Apple Paget will take on that role for the entire company, and Shelley Robertson will 
move from chief corporate officer to chief operating officer.

Fortescue will cut 700 jobs and slow its push into green hydrogen in a blow to the Albanese government's plan to 
make Australia a hydrogen superpower, supported by more than $8 billion of taxpayer-funded incentives.
Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest said low carbon "green" hydrogen still had a bright future, but his immediate 
focus would shift to renewable electricity as he jettisoned a target for Fortescue to produce 15 million tonnes of 
green hydrogen by 2030.
The concession comes after a six-year period in which Dr Forrest was one of the world's leading advocates for 
hydrogen and as Fortescue works to break down a corporate structure that had previously treated its energy and 
iron ore mining divisions as separate companies.
The decision out of Perth stokes speculation that the Albanese government's flagship Hydrogen Headstart program, 
which proposes a $2 per kilogram subsidy to hydrogen producers, could be insufficient to spur the industry into 
commercial reality. Woodside Energy has struggled to get a US hydrogen project signed off without enough 
customers willing to pay a premium for low-carbon fuels.
Dr Forrest said lower energy prices were the priority for world leaders at a time when war in Ukraine and the Middle 
East had roiled commodity markets, driven up the cost of energy and challenged the economics of hydrogen, which 
is more expensive than natural gas. "In that environment, you're not going to bring in major sources of green 
hydrogen, which relies on cheap energy prices," he said. "We are not going to swim against the tide."
The Albanese government promise of $6.7 billion of production tax credits for hydrogen arrived barely a year after 
pumping $2 billion of taxpayers' funds into the Hydrogen Headstart policy.
And energy sources say Japanese importers are increasingly looking at hydrogen only as a long-term alternative, 
preferring in the nearer term substitutes that are compatible with existing transport and utility infrastructure.
Grattan Institute energy policy director Tony Wood said: "The reality is that the queue of people being prepared to 
pay Twiggy Forrest a lot of money for green hydrogen is not very long."
Page 2 of 3
Labor's hydrogen goal stalls as Fortescue trims ambitions
Green hydrogen is made by using renewable energy to split water into its constituent parts, and Fortescue had 
shaped as a likely beneficiary of those federal schemes.
But Dr Forrest said Fortescue would focus in the immediate future on generating and distributing clean power, 
rather than using that clean power to make hydrogen. "We're going to stay where we know we can win, and that's 
green electricity. Nothing beats green electricity," he said.
Dr Forrest is already a big producer of renewable power in his private capacity through Squadron Energy, which 
owns many Australian wind farms.
The job cuts announced by Fortescue yesterday will continue efforts under way for close to 18 months to reduce 
duplication between the energy and mining divisions.
One layer of duplication will remain: energy boss Mark Hutchinson and mining boss Dino Otranto will continue to be 
dual chief executives of Fortescue and report to Dr Forrest as executive chairman.
While the top three at Fortescue will remain in place, the rapid turnover of senior executives has continued, with 
energy executive Eva Hanly and marketing director Vivienne Tieu leaving the company.
Dual company secretary-general counsel Phil McKeiver has lost the company secretary role, in a move that 
appears to be driven by his handling of a bitter legal dispute with green iron rival Element Zero.
Fortescue hired private investigators to follow and monitor the former executives behind the Element Zero start-up 
and their families as part of a lawsuit over an alleged intellectual property breach.
Yesterday, Dr Forrest said no member of the Fortescue board had been aware of the strategy and the board 
"struggled" to align the actions with Fortescue's values.
Mr McKeiver had offered his resignation, but it had been rejected, the iron ore billionaire said.
"I'm proud of the guy for taking full responsibility."
Fortescue appointed Mona Gill as company secretary; Mr McKeiver will continue as general counsel.
Iron ore prices are predicted to slide over the next five years as new supply from Africa and Western Australia 
enters the market, but Dr Forrest said the job cuts were not driven by this.
"We're going to sadly lose around 4.5 per cent of our direct workforce, 3 per cent of our indirect workforce," he said 
of the proposed cuts.
"It's not a big number in percentage terms, but we still don't like doing it. But it's not to jam operating costs down, it 
is to streamline this organisation and keep the genius of simplicity."
The job cuts will affect Fortescue staff around the world and also add to the thousands of job losses in the 
Australian resources sector this year at loss-making nickel mines, lithium mines and Alcoa's Kwinana alumina 
refinery.
Yesterday, Fortescue appointed Apple Paget as chief financial officer of the combined group, ending the previous 
structure where the mining and energy divisions had their own CFOs, such as former Reserve Bank deputy Guy 
Debelle, who lasted just 143 days.
Former Mineral Resources executive Shelley Robertson was named as Fortescue's chief operating officer.
Fortescue will continue to push ahead with three green hydrogen projects that were the subject of final investment 
decisions last year; one in Arizona, one in the Pilbara, and a $US150 million venture near Gladstone, which will 
start construction this year.Page 3 of 3
Labor's hydrogen goal stalls as Fortescue trims ambitions
Fortescue said two more hydrogen projects in Norway and Brazil remained under consideration, and the 
Norwegian project was close to a final investment decision.
Despite abandoning the 2030 hydrogen goal, Dr Forrest said Fortescue would eventually get to 15 million tonnes 
of hydrogen production and would retain its promise to have zero greenhouse gas emissions globally by 2030 
without relying on carbon offsets. It bills its hydrogen as zero carbon.
Dr Hutchinson said Fortescue would continue to make hydrogen electrolysers at its Gladstone factory at a time 
when many customers were enduring long waits for electrolysers to be delivered.
But Fortescue's plan to retrofit Incitec Pivot's Gibson Island fertiliser plant near Brisbane into a low-carbon version 
of itself is on the backburner because of high electricity costs in Australia.

Body
However Fortescue may try to spin it, the announcement it will slash 700 roles from its global headcount is more 
than just an attempt to remain "lean, impactful and agile".
The last time Fortescue made cuts this deep into its workforce was when it sacked 1000 people in a single day in 
2012, when the tumbling iron ore price combined with Fortescue's massive debts to create an existential crisis for 
the iron ore producer.
For Fortescue to abandon its ambitions to produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030, and make 
similarly deep cuts to its workforce, represents a humiliating backdown.
Not because the company has abandoned the goal in the face of reality. But because Andrew Forrest and his 
leadership team spent the past three years waving away genuine concerns about the plans that were being 
expressed by investors, market analysts, hydrogen and energy experts, and even the company's own staff - many 
of whom left in frustration well ahead of Wednesday's announcement.
In that time Fortescue has become increasingly erratic in its strategy and less tolerant of criticism - both internally 
and from the media and the investment community, as the company embraced the new vision of its founder and the 
"creative chaos" that came with it.
You cannot fault Forrest for his ambition, his commitment to innovation, and his attempt to try to drive a shift to 
green energy by bringing the scale of Fortescue's resources to bear on a problem others have found too difficult to 
grapple with.
Hopefully some good will eventually come of all that frenzied work. But belief alone cannot defy reality, and it has 
been clear for some time that Fortescue took on more than it could ever handle - perhaps to the detriment of 
projects that could have been achieved.
Plenty of voices inside Fortescue have been saying that along the journey, but have been told to get with the 
program or leave.
Page 2 of 2
Humiliating move raises serious fears for our reputation
The reputational damage brought about by the retreat from this green foray is enormous, both to Fortescue and to 
other Australian companies operating overseas.
Forrest has spent the past four years touring developing nations making big promises about the jobs that green 
hydrogen will bring, and the economic transformation his company could help deliver to some of the poorest 
countries in the world, if they give Fortescue access to their resources.
Few, if any, of those promises will now be delivered - and that will not be easily forgotten the next time an Australian 
company rolls into town looking for support for a mining or energy project.
Many investors will welcome Wednesday's backdown as offering hope the company will return its focus to the 
mining arm where it makes its money. But real questions still need to be asked about how the rest of the Fortescue 
board did not reign in Forrest's green ambitions well before now.

Andrew Forrest says a move to slash 700 jobs from Fortescue is not a sign he is pulling away from his green 
hydrogen ambitions.
The company – which made its start mining iron ore but working to push into clean energy – announced the 
redundancies late yesterday, saying they would be finalised by the end of the month.
Speaking on morning radio, the mining magnate and self-described "hardcore bloke from the bush" declared: 
"Twiggy is not walking back from hydrogen."
He told Nine Radio in Perth the job losses, which are expected to be finalised by the end of the month, were about 
streamlining the company.
"It's in community, it's in government relations, it's in HR, Fortescue people," Mr Forrest said.
"It's in all the, if you like, white-collar jobs where there's duplication between mining and energy. It's common sense 
that we bring them together.
"Any nut can complicate something. It takes a genius to simplify it.
"I'm no genius but I do my best."
Scrapped target sparks questions

Andrew Forrest downplays hit from Fortescue job cuts, saying 'Twiggy is not walking back from hydrogen'
The cuts had raised questions about whether Fortescue was slowing its push into green hydrogen, which is 
produced from clean energy sources, after the company also flagged it was abandoning its target to produce 15 
million tonnes of green hydrogen a year.
Mr Forrest has spent the last few years selling the idea to governments around the world as a future fuel source for 
industry as it decarbonises.
"We're not pulling back. This is something which I genuinely believe in," he said today.
"It's a bit like, I don't know … antibiotics or penicillin. The world has to have it.
"We just have to work out now how to produce it cheaply enough."
Bringing down energy prices was a key challenge to achieving that, Mr Forrest said, adding he was still committed 
to eliminating all fossil fuels from Fortescue's operations by the end of the decade, which would help lower costs.
"So what we're doing is investing upstream, investing now into the generation of green electricity, pushing down the 
price of power for the benefit of every punter in Australia," he clarified later in the day.
"And of course at the end of it when power prices really do come off then we'll have a very commercial form of 
green hydrogen which is absolutely essential to get into the world."
Roy Green from the University of Technology Sydney said he was not surprised by Fortescue's decision to scrap 
the target.
"While hydrogen as a technology … ultimately will have commercial application, it will certainly be part of our 
energy mix, it may have been hyped up too much in the beginning in the sense that its costs were underestimated," 
he said.
Renewable energy expert and founder of clean technology news website Renew Economy, Giles Parkinson, said 
those factors could lead to shareholder pressure.
"This is one of the problems about the whole sort of green energy transition is that [shareholders] say, 'OK great, 
you're a leader but don't go so far out in front that we can't see you anymore, because then we kind of get worried 
about returns,'" he said.
"Investors and institutional shareholders unfortunately are so obsessed with returns and profits over the short 
timeframe."
Renewables crucial
Sunshine Hydro executive chairman Michael Myer says producing green hydrogen can be viable when it's done 
with low-cost renewable energy.
He's told The Business his company is producing green hydrogen from wind, solar and pumped hydro, which is 
viable without the need for tax credits the government has on offer.
"I noted the commentary from the chairman of Fortescue saying that they're focusing now on the production of 
renewable and clean energy, and that's the right place to start," Mr Myer said.
"But what you need to do is you need to be able to produce 24/7 carbon free energy.
"If you do that first and then you use that energy to produce hydrogen you can produce it very competitively."
Labor's energy plan attackedPage 3 of 3
Andrew Forrest downplays hit from Fortescue job cuts, saying 'Twiggy is not walking back from hydrogen'
Liberal MPs have used Fortescue's decision to attack the federal government's support for green hydrogen, with 
the opposition's spokesperson for climate change and energy, Ted O'Brien, declaring it blew "a massive hole in 
Labor's energy plan".
"Labor isn't interested in hydrogen. They want only green hydrogen … which basically means all eggs in one 
basket," he said.
"We cannot as a nation put all our eggs in one basket. We need to have a balanced energy mix.
"Today's decision also points to the need for more gas. Labor says 'green hydrogen it will do everything'. Well, we 
now know today that the biggest investor in it is saying it's not going to do everything, and in fact he's pulling back.
"Labor has to stop its anti-gas crusade. We need more gas. We need it immediately."
Mr O'Brien said the government had been "picking winners", and that "some of those winners are turning out to be 
losers".
Mr Forrest disagreed.
"He got it completely wrong," was his response.
"We streamlined our company so we can start investing billions into green electricity, into green iron."
But the government was not backing down from its support of the technology.
"The fact is that green hydrogen does have an important role to play in our future," Prime Minister Anthony 
Albanese said.
"We have seen investment and we're seeing that occurring right around the world, and Australia is in a position to 
take advantage of that."
Mr Albanese said much of what Mr Forrest had said about his decision related to factors overseas.
In a statement, Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said Australia had more than 50 companies 
pursuing renewable hydrogen.
"Green hydrogen will be one of the best ways Australia can decarbonise domestic heavy emitters and help develop 
robust low carbon manufacturing and energy," he said in a statement.
"The government is committed to working alongside commercial interests to deliver on this potential."
Western Australia's Deputy Premier, Rita Saffioti, was similarly optimistic.
"There has been a lot of demand for hydrogen. In relation to the future, I think the work will continue on providing 
the technology and making sure it is viable in the future," Ms Saffioti said.

Andrew Forrest has launched a sweeping restructure at -Fortescue in the face of the company's failure to deliver 
on its green energy promises, with as many as 700 jobs going.
The massive cutbacks come as Dr Forrest abandons the company's goal of producing 15 million tonnes of green -
hydrogen a year by 2030.
Dr Forrest is understood to have addressed Fortescue staff on Wednesday afternoon, -flagging a major round of -
redundancies - including the departure of more of the company's senior management. The concession that For-
tescue cannot meet its green -hydrogen targets represents a major backdown by Dr Forrest, who only a few years 
ago was boasting that the company's green energy ambitions would one day make it bigger than Saudi Energy 
giant Aramco.
It comes after a swag of executive departures.
The sweeping changes include the departure of senior operational staff in Fortescue's iron ore division, including 
senior mine managers, amid a widespread expectation that the company has failed to meet its annual production 
targets.
Sources say the changes -affect far more than just the company's energy division, which has burned hundreds of 
millions of dollars in examining potential green hydrogen and ammonia sites across the world, but has so far only 
delivered three final investment decisions across the would-be green energy portfolio.
Those three projects include a small hydrogen plant in Gladstone in Queensland, a second hydrogen project in 
Arizona in the US, and a green iron commercial pilot plant in the Pilbara.
All three remain in For-tescue's development portfolio, along with a green ammonia -project in Norway and one in 
Brazil. The company is also still working on some earlier stage projects, such as a joint venture in Morocco.

But a swag of others have been "deprioritised". Fortescue is effectively abandoning its green ammonia and energy 
projects in Kenya, Argentina, Canada and the US state of Washington - where Dr Forrest had promised to replace 
former coal-fired power plants with clean energy production.
Fortescue's failure to maintain the pace or exports at its flagship iron ore division is also understood to be at the 
heart of the sweeping changes, which will only add to the chaos that has engulfed the company over the past 18 
months.
A derailment on its main -Pilbara line over Christmas hit its export rates, as did heavy weather there in February. 
The company is also still struggling to get its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project operating to anywhere close to 
full capacity, and has -issued multiple downgrades to its expected output over the past year. Market analysts expect 
Fortescue to miss its 192 million tonne export forecast when the company releases its June quarter production 
report next week, with consensus expectations tipping the company to only barely break the 190 million tonne mark. 
Fortescue shares closed down 1 per cent at $22.36 on Wednesday.

Billionaire Andrew Forrest has abandoned ambitious green -hydrogen targets in a major -business backdown that 
threatens the Albanese government's pledge for the energy source to help drive the nation's transition to net-zero 
emissions by 2050.
Dr Forrest launched a sweeping restructure at For-tescue in the face of the company's failure to deliver on its 
green-energy -promises. Up to 700 jobs will go in the massive cutbacks after the iron ore mogul pulled back from 
the company's goal of producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030.
Dr Forrest is understood to have addressed Fortescue staff on Wednesday afternoon, flagging a major round of 
redundancies - -including the departure of more of the company's senior -management.
The concession that For-tescue cannot meet its green--hydrogen targets represents a major retreat by Dr Forrest, 
who only a few years ago was boasting that the company's green-energy ambitions would one day make it -bigger 
than Saudi energy giant Aramco.
The move also punches a hole in Labor's emissions transition plan, with the government providing $8bn in 
investment and support for hydrogen production as part of a push for Australia to become a key player in global -
efforts to achieve net zero.
Anthony Albanese has pinned the government's hopes on green hydrogen, solar and wind as key supply sources 
that can hand the nation "energy sovereignty".
The changes at Fortescue include the departure of senior operational staff in the company's iron ore division, -
including senior mine managers, amid widespread expectations that the company has failed to meet its annual 
production -targets.
Sources say the changes affect far more than the company's energy division, which has burned hundreds of 
millions of dollars in examining potential green--hydrogen and ammonia sites across the world, but has so far only 
delivered three final investment decisions in the would-be green-energy portfolio. Those three projects include a

small hydrogen plant in Gladstone in Queensland, a second -hydrogen project in Arizona in the US, and a green-
iron commercial pilot plant in Western Australia's Pilbara.
All three remain in For-tescue's development portfolio, along with a green-ammonia -project in -Norway and one in 
Brazil. The company is also still -working on some earlier-stage projects, such as a joint venture in Morocco.
But a swag of others have been "deprioritised". Fortescue is effectively abandoning its green--ammonia and 
energy projects in Canada and the US state of Washington - where Dr Forrest had promised to -replace former 
coal-fired power plants with clean-energy production. And projects in Kenya, which were previously on the "fast 
track" list, and Argentina have been pushed back down the priority order.
Fortescue's failure to maintain the pace or exports at its flagship iron-ore division is also understood to be at the 
heart of the sweeping changes, which will only add to the chaos that has -engulfed the company over the past 18 
months. A derailment on its main Pilbara line over Christmas hit export rates, as did heavy weather in February.
The company is still struggling to get its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project operating to anywhere close to full -
capacity, and has -issued multiple downgrades to its expected output over the past year.
Market analysts expect Fortescue to miss its 192 million tonne export guidance when the company releases its 
June quarter production report next week, with consensus expectations -tipping the company to barely break 190 
million tonnes.
Dr Forrest issued a statement on Wednesday night saying the company backed the federal government's green-
energy -ambitions and was investing in green electricity to support green-hydrogen supply, "setting Fortescue for 
its role as a world supplier of harmless, environmentally friendly energy -alternatives".
"We fully support the federal government's green energy ambitions for Australia," he said.
Dr Forrest said the government's $2 a kilogram subsidy for green hydrogen was "absolutely imperative to get our 
country into a leading position to produce a replacement for oil and gas".
"At the very least Fortescue's green iron plans will rely on green hydrogen," he said.
Dr Forrest added that "only delinquent irresponsible leaders will advocate for the continued use of extremely 
damaging -energy sources" as climate change set in.
"Green electricity is the only source of rapid to develop, -inexpensive new sources of energy," he said.
He claimed Fortescue's green energy expansion would be done in years. In a late market announcement on 
Wednesday, Fortescue said it had appointed acting chief financial officer Apple Paget to the role on a permanent 
basis, and moved chief corporate officer Shelley Robertson to the position of chief operating officer. Fortescue 
shares closed down 23c at $22.36 on Wednesday.

Andrew Forrest insists his green hydrogen dream is not over. Far from it.
But in the biggest shake-up of Fortescue's structure and strategy in several years, Forrest has put Fortescue's 
long-held target of 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 on the backburner, and "de-prioritised" several 
green hydrogen projects in the $70 billion giant's pipeline.
In a series of moves that will be welcomed by investors, but provide more evidence of how the global energy 
transition is spluttering, Fortescue will also slash 700 jobs by bringing its mining and energy divisions under one 
roof, eliminating duplication of corporate functions, and some layers of management.
Forrest will not countenance the idea that this is some sort of retreat or even a pivot; his determination to turn 
Fortescue into what he calls the world's go-to company for green solutions - green metals, green energy and green 
technology - remains as strong as ever.
But the changes announced yesterday speak to both the reality of an energy transition that has been stalled by 
cost-of-living worries and rising energy prices caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle 
East, and caution among some Fortescue investors about the prospective returns from the company's green 
energy strategy.
In June, US fund manager Capital Group sold more than $1.4 billion of Fortescue shares, ceasing to be a 
substantial shareholder in a move some read as a reaction to Fortescue's strategic shift.
Forrest insists that the 15 million-tonne green hydrogen target remains a big part of Fortescue's ultimate plan, and 
he's personally disappointed that the rest of the world - particularly the "weenies" in the traditional energy sector - 
are "not seeing as clearly what I am seeing, which is that the world must turn away from fossil fuels".
But in what will be music to the ears of the market, Forrest says the company is determined to maintain financial 
discipline.
Page 2 of 3
Reality bites for Forrest's dream
"We are not going to swim against the tide," he says. "The tide is the Australian government, every government, 
every leader, every president, every energy minister I've met around the world in the last three years saying 'we've 
got to get energy prices down'.
"Now, in that environment, you're not going to bring on major sources of green hydrogen, which relies on cheap 
energy prices.
"We're going to stay where we know we can win, and that's green electricity. We'll be producing 15 million tonnes 
[of green hydrogen] and more. But to get there, we're going to make sure that the supply chain's right."
The pressure on the global green hydrogen sector is building. On Tuesday night, the European Court of Auditors 
released a report that found despite the European Union pumping (EURO)18.8 billion ($30.45 billion) into the 
sector, its target of importing 10 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 was unrealistic and "not really founded 
upon the capacity at hand".
Forrest remains a believer in the ability of green hydrogen to replace fossil fuel, but says Fortescue will not "put the 
horse behind the cart" by pushing ahead with green hydrogen projects where the economics don't stack up due to 
persistently high electricity prices.
Green hydrogen projects on Fortescue's books, including in the US, Canada, the Democratic Republic of Congo 
and South Australia, will now be put on hold while the company pushes ahead with five key projects. Three of these 
- a $US550 million ($817 billion) liquefied green hydrogen facility in Arizona; its $US150 million Queensland plant at 
Gladstone, which is aiming to produce green hydrogen next year; and its $US50 million green iron project at 
Christmas Creek in the Pilbara, which seeks to produce 1500 tonnes of green iron from green hydrogen - have 
already been approved by the board and are under way.
Two more - a green hydrogen project in Norway and another in Brazil - are in the feasibility phase, but have now 
been prioritised because both countries have access to abundant, cheap, renewable energy.
No changes to Fortescue's capital expenditure forecasts were announced yesterday.
The announcement of 700 jobs cuts will not make for a very happy birthday for some at the company, which 
celebrates the 21st anniversary of its founding today.
But Forrest, who says no management team ever likes announcing job losses, is adamant the redundancies do not 
reflect pressure on iron ore prices or the spluttering energy transition, but are instead part of an evolution of the 
group.
It was necessary, he says, to originally set Fortescue Energy up as a sort of internal start-up, with its own 
infrastructure and teams. This was, in part, because the miner was "fat and happy" and some inside the company 
could not see the need to shake up its highly successful mining business.
But with the two sides of the business now working closely together - particularly on the push to decarbonise 
Fortescue's existing iron ore operations by 2030, a target Forrest clearly hopes to beat - he says the need for two 
silos is gone.
"This is not to jam operating costs down, it's to streamline this organisation and keep the genius of simplicity," he 
says.
Despite the embrace of a "one Fortescue" model, Forrest will continue with two chief executives: metals boss Dino 
Otranto, and energy boss Mark Hutchinson.
Forrest says the leaders will be able to access resources as needed from a reshuffled corporate team led by chief 
financial officer Apple Paget (who moves into the role permanently after acting in the position since last August); 
chief operating officer Shelley Robertson (who has been promoted from chief corporate officer); and Mona Gill, who 
assumes the role of company secretary from Phil McKeiver.Page 3 of 3
Reality bites for Forrest's dream
McKeiver will retain the role of general counsel, but only after offering to resign following revelations that a law firm 
employed by Fortescue had hired private investigators to follow former Fortescue executives and their families as 
part of an ugly legal spat with a rival start-up called Element Zero.
Forrest says the Fortescue board was not aware of the tactic and had struggled to see how it aligned with the 
company's values, but he is proud of McKeiver for taking responsibility. Forrest says Fortescue will continue to 
pursue the legal action.
The Fortescue restructure takes place against the backdrop of pressure on iron ore prices, which have fallen more 
than 30 per cent since the start of the year as China's economy continues to struggle.
But Forrest says Fortescue is struggling to keep up with what he says are full order books. And while the industry 
frets about the arrival of new iron ore production from the Simandou mine in the African nation of Guinea, Forrest 
remains sanguine, arguing that Fortescue's prospective project in Gabon gives it the ability to tap a deposit of 
better quality and scale.
But the company's ultimate trump card could be green iron; this is where low-carbon solutions such as green 
hydrogen and solar energy are used to remove waste elements from iron ore, leaving behind a product that is 
almost pure iron.
Indeed, Forrest is so bullish on the plan that he declares he's getting out of iron ore and into green iron.

Andrew Forrest has launched a sweeping restructure at For-tescue in the face of the company's failure to deliver on 
its green energy promises, with as many as 700 jobs going in the massive cutbacks after Dr Forrest abandoned the

The concession that For-tescue cannot meet its green -hydrogen targets represents a major backdown by Dr 
Forrest, who only a few years ago was boasting that the company's green energy ambitions would one day make it

The move also punches a hole in the Albanese government's $8bn cash splash for hydrogen production with Labor 
offering lucrative production tax credits in a bid to turbocharge the fledgling sector.
The sweeping changes include the departure of senior operational staff in Fortescue's iron ore division, including

Market analysts expect Fortescue to miss its 192 million tonne export guidance when the company releases its 
June quarter production report next week, with consensus expectations tipping the company to only barely break

The move comes amid signs of a further slowing in Chinese steel demand, which is expected to drive down iron ore 
prices, with lower-grade ores - such as those exported by Fortescue - seen as likely to suffer the biggest falls in the 
medium term.
Rio Tinto noted in its June quarter production report on Tuesday that the price differential between ore grades had 
widened in the June period.
In a late market announcement on Wednesday, Fortescue said it had appointed acting chief financial officer Apple 
Paget to the role on a permanent basis, and moved chief corporate officer Shelley Robertson to the position of chief 
operating officer.
Fortescue said it remained "resolute in its commitment to be the world's leading green technology, energy and 
metals company with a laser focus on achieving Real Zero by 2030". The company said it had "undergone a period 
of rapid growth and transition, and as part of bringing together Metals and Energy into One For-tescue, initiatives 
are being imple-mented to simplify its structure, remove duplication and deliver cost efficiencies.
"The company must continually evolve to ensure it remains lean, is best positioned to deliver on its strategy and 
generate the maximum value for shareholders," it said.

However Fortescue may try to spin it, the announcement it will slash 700 roles from its global headcount is more 
than just an attempt to remain "lean, impactful and agile".
The last time Fortescue made cuts this deep into its workforce was when it sacked 1000 people in a single day in 
2012, when the tumbling iron ore price combined with Fortescue's massive debts to create an existential crisis for 
the iron ore producer.
For Fortescue to abandon its ambitions to produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030, and make 
similarly deep cuts to its workforce, represents a humiliating backdown.
Not because the company has abandoned the goal in the face of reality. But because Andrew Forrest and his 
leadership team spent the past three years waving away genuine concerns about the plans that were being 
expressed by investors, market analysts, hydrogen and energy experts, and even the company's own staff - many 
of whom left in frustration well ahead of Wednesday's announcement.
In that time Fortescue has become increasingly erratic in its strategy and less tolerant of criticism - both internally 
and from the media and the investment community, as the company embraced the new vision of its founder and the 
"creative chaos" that came with it.
You cannot fault Forrest for his ambition, his commitment to innovation, and his attempt to try to drive a shift to 
green energy by bringing the scale of Fortescue's resources to bear on a problem others have found too difficult to 
grapple with.
Hopefully some good will eventually come of all that frenzied work. But belief alone cannot defy reality, and it has 
been clear for some time that Fortescue took on more than it could ever handle - perhaps to the detriment of 
projects that could have been achieved.
Plenty of voices inside Fortescue have been saying that along the journey, but have been told to get with the 
program or leave the company.

Forrest backdown raises fears for reputation
The reputational damage brought about by the retreat from this green foray is enormous, both to Fortescue and to 
other Australian companies operating overseas.
Forrest has spent the past four years touring developing nations making big promises about the jobs that green 
hydrogen will bring, and the economic transformation his company could help deliver to some of the poorest 
countries in the world, if they give Fortescue access to their resources.
Few, if any, of those promises will now be delivered - and that will not be easily forgotten the next time an Australian 
company rolls into town looking for support for a mining or energy project.
Many investors will welcome Wednesday's backdown as offering hope the company will return its focus to the 
mining arm where it makes its money.
But real questions still need to be asked about how the rest of the Fortescue board did not reign in Forrest's green 
ambitions well before now.

Andrew Forrest made his vast fortune by snubbing the doubters. The approach worked on his iron ore bet two 
decades ago. This time with green hydrogen, the story couldn't be more different.
After refusing to acknowledge any internal warning signs and critics from the energy industry, Forrest was 
determined to keep crashing through. Now reality has hit and his green energy ambitions have crashed 
spectacularly. There is more than a financial cost - much of which is yet to be quantified.
Firstly, there's the emotional toll on the 700 employees from across Fortescue - including those that bought into the 
green energy dream - who are now set to be sacked.
The second is Andrew Forrest's credibility has taken a major hit. For more than two years, Fortescue has been full 
throttle trying to turn Forrest's promise of green hydrogen into a commercial reality within years.
He talked a big game and travelled the world meeting governments, while handing out green MoUs like calling 
cards.
Instead, as the economics sank in, with electricity costs surging, deadlines were pushed back and back The 
mission changed. Then there was a revolving door of executives.
With all the optics of a rare defeat, Forrest has finally moved away from his centrepiece promise of developing a 
commercial green hydrogen export business by the end of the decade.
Instead, Fortescue is again looking more like its bigger rivals BHP and Rio Tinto, with plans to switch to 
conventional renewables like wind, solar and storage and in-house development to help it meet its net zero targets 
by 2030, while building up business lines.
Running two Fortescues in parallel - one for mining and another for energy - will end, saving hundreds of millions in 
costs.
Page 2 of 3
Forrest's credibility hit by green hydrogen collapse
Even with the much-welcomed streamlining, investors are still in the dark about financials and whether key 
executives in the energy adventure are staying.
Forrest on Tuesday was firmly standing by green hydrogen as a technology and promised that Fortescue would 
bring it to market as the economics became more favourable. So too with his commitment to decarbonisation, 
where he has already spent more than $1bn. "I am not giving up on hydrogen at all," Forrest tells The Australian. 
"The green electricity price just keeps heading north, and it's been dragged up by the fossil fuel price. We're not 
pivoting away. We're going upstream to get the green electrons at the right price." He says the benefits of the spend 
are spread through Fortescue, which now has a product division for battery-powered trucks, with trains and ships 
powered with green energy in development. He is developing inputs for green fertilizer as well as trialling a green 
iron plant in the Pilbara to make purer ore.
"These are each multipliers of market cap. They're not adders to market cap. They're big movers, and that's all 
come about because the company's pushing to hydrogen, and all of those are ripe." Still, the sheer chaos of the 
adventure was like watching a start-up burn bright and then implode, and Fortescue's board needs to remind itself 
it is a top 10 company with thousands of workers. Whether it likes it or not it has an army of stakeholders - 
governments, investors and customers.
Out of corporate failure there usually come some valuable -lessons. But the Forrest show has likely put the global 
quest for green hydrogen back years. If Forrest, with all his substantial resources and connections, couldn't pull it 
off, others will think twice about investing in the technology.
No customers For Forrest, the problems were multi-faceted.
He was trying to develop an over-the-horizon technology for product that didn't have any customers ready to go.
And as he discovered, it didn't have the green energy sources at the scale needed to make the raw material.
The rule of thumb is that more energy goes into producing hydrogen than what hydrogen offers. That's why Forrest 
needed to pin down an energy source, and lots of it. Surging power prices made that even harder.
Even if Forrest had a breakthrough on the technology of producing hydrogen from water, it simply wouldn't be 
economical at today's prices.
Essentially Forrest was solving the answer to a riddle that belonged to a different question.
At the peak of Forrest's hydrogen push, energy players were casting doubts, while Australia's biggest steelmaker, 
BlueScope, loudly warned that the technology was a long way from reality.
BlueScope boss Mark Vassella had sweated the numbers as he was embarking on his own green steel road map 
ahead of his $1.1bn upgrade of its Port Kembla blast furnace.
BlueScope was a potential customer and here Vassella couldn't find a commercial case for hydrogen to be used in 
the blast furnace.
Vassella's No.1 problem was the extremely high energy intensity needed to run the furnace, which he 
conservatively estimated to be 15 times BlueScope's existing energy needs.
BlueScope is now joining with BHP and Rio Tinto to develop an electric smelting furnace - a process that also relies 
on vast amounts of electricity but doesn't need hydrogen.
Big promise Hydrogen is classic Forrest play - big ambition, and promising something that changes the world.
But we should ask whether the business of hydrogen fits the business of Forrest. It is methodical manufacturing and 
requires buckets of patience. The Japanese government and electricity conglomerates have been working quietly 
but seriously for decades at solving the hydrogen puzzle.Page 3 of 3
Forrest's credibility hit by green hydrogen collapse
All without fanfare.
Forrest promised he could do it and be a global exporter by the end of decade. A surprising number even believed 
him.
No one knows the true financial cost of the green adventure, given transparency was sorely lacking, although next 
month's accounts release should shed some light.
Forrest still has dozens of green plans in train, with pilot plants under way and a push to build a green energy 
expressway from Morocco into Europe.
He is also ready to hit "real net zero" emissions (without the buy in of carbon credits) for the end of the decade.
The promises are still big, but who is going to buy in?
AI hype?
Influential stock picker David Paradice might have some leftover change - some $500,000 - aboard the runaway 
Nvidia train, but his own team are going to need more convincing about the benefits of artificial intelligence.
While AI has been the power story on Wall Street, driving names like Microsoft, Amazon and even Nvidia to fresh 
record highs, Paradice's own managers have called out the hype behind the tech.
"It is not clear to us that at this juncture the monetisation or productivity improvements from AI justifies the hype and 
very extensive rerating of AI-exposed stocks," Paradice's large cap manager Troy Angus has told the $14.5bn fund 
manager's clients.
Angus also remains cautious on Australian stocks, tipping a possible interest rate hike here next month, based on 
strong data around consumption and inflation.
He believes the Reserve Bank could be underestimating the impact of strong migration, fiscal stimulus and, 
importantly, the "lagged effect" of EBA agreements which is likely to sustain higher wage inflation and therefore 
spending for some time.
Paradice's Australian Equity Fund posted returns of 12.77 per cent for the year, coming in just below the 
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 (total return). The fund continues to outperform on three and five-year horizons.
In recent weeks Paradice has sold off BHP on a weaker China outlook. But Paradice was not a supporter of the 
mining giant's $65bn bid for Anglo American, which it ultimately abandoned in May after its advances were rejected.
The fund also kept the pressure on Qantas, recently meeting new director Nora Scheinkestel who is also in charge 
of the airline's board remuneration committee. Here the issue of nearly $15m in long-term bonus payments to 
former Qantas boss Alan Joyce was raised - and the prospect of recovery. johnstone@theaustralian.com.au

Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest says he would not change the way the company approached its energy 
strategy, despite Fortescue's green energy arm racking up more than $US1.44bn ($2.1bn) in losses over the last 
four years with little in the way of commercial returns.
The figure, drawn from Fortescue's annual accounts from 2021 onwards, does not reflect all of the mining giant's 
spending on its now-abandoned vision of producing 15 million tonnes a year.
Its last quarterly production report noted that Fortescue expected $US700m in net operating expenditure for its 
energy division for the year ending June 30, plus another $US500m in capital spending and investments.
The company on Wednesday announced it will cut 700 jobs and pull back from the hydrogen production target.
Fortescue has delivered on three final investment decisions as a result of the spending. But Dr Forrest said on 
Thursday he was confident its efforts in winning access to global energy projects, and technology investments such 
as its acquisition of Williams Advanced Engineering (now Fortescue Zero) would still deliver returns to Fortescue 
shareholders.
"If I could spend the amount of capital you're speculating about, to create a future for this company that will multiply 
its share price, I would do it every day of the week. There's no way we could have got that out of just doing more of 
the same," he said.
Fortescue Zero delivers a small revenue stream to the ASX-listed company, but none of its other energy 
investments have yet delivered a commercial return. But Dr Forrest said Fortescue's forays into designing 
ammonia-power ships, battery-operated trains and future green hydrogen and ammonia production would 
eventually deliver returns to shareholders.
"You can see the business we're now starting in shipping, in trucking, in rail, in green iron, in shipping green 
electrons into western Europe. These businesses are all available to us because of that investment," he said.

TWIGGY'S GREENING LIVES ON
Fortescue's green dream foundered on energy costs, with the global surge in pricing after Russia's invasion of 
Ukraine - and the massive post-pandemic cost inflation for major projects - effectively killing off the cheap electricity 
needed to make hydrogen a viable energy source.
Dr Forrest rejected suggestions that Fortescue had abandoned its ambition of turning hydrogen into a global 
seaborne commodity equivalent to LNG, but said in the short term Fortescue would instead look to build solar and 
wind projects that will help drive down energy costs to eventually make hydrogen and green ammonia viable.
That will start with powering Fortescue's Pilbara iron ore operations, he said, but will eventually extend to grid-
scale renewable energy projects. Fortescue shares closed down 32c to $22.04 on Thursday.

This year's The Australian Financial Review Rich Bosses list is dominated by tech and mining executives and also 
welcomes a new face.
Richard White
Rank: 1
Company: WiseTech Global
Shareholding: $12.95 billion
WiseTech Global co-founder and chief executive Richard White has retained the top spot on the Rich Bosses list 
after increasing the value of his shareholding by more than $2 billion last financial year.
The annual Rich Bosses list ranks the ASX 300's wealthiest executives based on the value of their shareholdings in 
the company where they work as of June 30.
WiseTech's shares returned to all-time highs in February after the software company's first-half earnings beat 
analysts' expectations. Months later, they temporarily edged above $100 per share for the first time since White had 
co-founded the company with Maree Isaacs in 1994.
WiseTech has never made a loss - and 85 per cent of its 3500 employees globally own shares in it thanks to an 
employee share scheme.
Alan Wilson & Peter Wilson
Rank: 2 & 6
Company: Reece
Shareholding: $9.03 billion & $3.02 billion
Page 2 of 4
" THE 10 WEALTHIEST EXECUTIVES IN THE ASX 300 REVEALED
Plumbing parts maker Reece Group boosted net profit after tax by 20 per cent in the first half of last financial year.
The solid result shocked analysts as it came after the company warned shareholders last August that it expected to 
sell fewer products and experience margin pressure in the months ahead.
Senior reporter Jonathan Shapiro said the result raised questions about Reece's adherence to the continuous 
disclosure rules, as the company provided no trading updates before reporting profits that far exceeded market 
expectations.
Nevertheless, executive director Alan Wilson climbed one spot on this year's list after the value of his company 
shareholding increased by 36 per cent to $9.03 billion.
His son, Peter, who has been chief executive of the family business since 2008, also made the top 10 for the first 
time after it was announced in May that he would also replace Alan as executive chair from November.
Peter's shareholding was worth $3.02 billion on June 30.
Andrew Forrest
Rank: 3
Company: Fortescue Metals Group
Shareholding: $8.95 billion
Andrew Forrest, executive chairman of Fortescue Metals Group and the eighth-richest person in Australia, dropped 
to third place on this year's Rich Bosses list after the value of his Fortescue shareholding fell by roughly $300 
million.
Forrest had already conceded first place to White last year after the terms of his divorce left him with fewer 
Fortescue shares than his ex-wife Nicola. The couple also transferred $5 billion of Fortescue shares to their 
Mindaroo Foundation last June. The company's share price dropped 6.2 per cent last financial year as lower iron 
ore prices offset an earlier rally that had taken the stock to record highs. But it still ended the financial year 137 per 
cent higher than it did in 2019.
More recently, Forrest made headlines when he was photographed kissing a woman on the streets of Paris in May. 
Moroccan Energy Minister Leila Benali, who sits on the board of one of Fortescue's joint ventures in the North 
African country, later denied she was the woman in the picture.
The iron ore miner also became embroiled in a spying scandal that involved 19 days of surveillance by private 
investigators of the homes and families of three former Fortescue employees.
Fortescue had accused them of copying and stealing its intellectual property when they left to start rival green iron 
business Element Zero.
Sam Hupert and
Anthony Hall
Rank: 4 & 5
Company: Pro Medicus
Shareholding: $3.74 billion each
Healthcare software developer Pro Medicus was the best-performing stock on the ASX 200 last financial year, 
delivering shareholders a return of 118.7 per cent after a record year of new contract wins.Page 3 of 4
" THE 10 WEALTHIEST EXECUTIVES IN THE ASX 300 REVEALED
That meant the value of co-founders Sam Hupert and Anthony Hall's respective shareholdings more than doubled 
to $3.74 billion each.
The company's flagship Visage software enables radiologists to view reports and image files generated by X-rays 
and other medical scans on their mobile devices.
Hall and Hupert set up the company in 1983 and floated its stock in 2000 at $1.15 a piece. Last month, the share 
price temporarily surpassed $140.
Michael and Matt Heine
Rank: Joint 7th
Company: Netwealth Group
Shareholding: $2.67 billion
Netwealth, the wealth company that Michael Heine registered in 1999, reported record inflows of $22 billion last 
financial year as it took its total funds under management to $88 billion.
Michael's son, Matt, became sole managing director when Michael moved from joint managing director to executive 
director in 2022. The value of their combined shareholdings increased by almost $900 million last financial year to 
$2.67 billion.
Gerry Harvey
Rank: 9
Company: Harvey Norman
Shareholding: $1.73 billion
Retailer Harvey Norman reported a 45.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profit in the first half of last financial year, as gloomy 
consumers weighed down by interest rate hikes and stubbornly high inflation pulled back on spending.
Yet, the company's share price still rose by about 20 per cent, boosting the value of executive chairman Gerry 
Harvey's shareholding by more than $300 million.
In an interview after the company's first-half results in February, Harvey said he was feeling more optimistic about 
the outlook than he was last year despite the large profit drop.
"So many more people are in the country, and they have all got to have a bed and a fridge," he said. "If interest 
rates drop a bit, inflation drops, consumer confidence picks up and big tax cuts are coming."
Greg Goodman
Rank: 10
Company: Goodman Group
Shareholding: $1.51 billion
Greg Goodman has had a good year. The property giant he co-founded and continues to lead as chief executive 
upgraded its earnings guidance twice last financial year as its shift into data centres offset weakening demand for 
warehouse space in China.
The company still makes most of its money from building warehouses, but Goodman told Chanticleer in March that 
the company's data-centre play had a 10-year tailwind behind it.Page 4 of 4
" THE 10 WEALTHIEST EXECUTIVES IN THE ASX 300 REVEALED
Over the 12 months to June 30, the value of his shareholding increased by 70 per cent to $1.51 billion.
Last week, Goodman was also revealed to be the highest-paid locally based ASX 200 CEO in the 2023 financial 
year.AFR EUAN BLACK

Fortescue founder Andrew -Forrest says Labor should push ahead with billions of dollars in tax -incentives for 
green--hydrogen producers despite scaling down his own ambitions, arguing that high energy costs must be 
lowered to secure the fuel source as a commercially viable export -industry.
Dr Forrest told The Australian the feasibility of the industry came down to the cost of electricity - a position backed 
by former chief scientist Alan Finkel - and Fortescue's decision to pull back from its target of producing 15 million 
tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 should not force a government rethink on its current strategy.
"The time to invest is through the cycle. If you wait for a boom to invest, you're going to be bringing your product on 
in a bust," Dr Forrest said. "No, I would not recalibrate (government policy)." Ahead of an election where the major 
parties will present radically different pathways to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, Anthony Albanese 
provided an assurance on Thursday that "our energy plan is on track" and Labor was "getting on with the job".
Dr Forrest said he would not change the way the company -approached its energy strategy, despite Fortescue's 
green-energy arm racking up more than $US1.44bn ($2.1bn) in losses over the past four years with little in the way 
of commercial returns.
The Fortescue restructure - under which 700 jobs will be cut - was seized on by the Coalition as evidence that 
Labor was "picking losers" by allocating billions of dollars in production tax credits for green-hydrogen producers.
Opposition climate and -energy spokesman Ted O'Brien said the announcement had "blown a gaping hole in the -
Albanese Labor government's energy plans" and elevated the importance of gas. But he stopped short of 
renouncing the viability of the emerging industry.
"We remain optimistic about the success of hydrogen in the long term playing a role in our -future energy mix but 
we will not follow Labor's mistake of putting all its eggs in one basket," Mr O'Brien said.
Page 2 of 2
Pullback Twiggy pushes tax credits
As part of its flagship Future Made in Australia plan, the -government provided a budget allocation of $6.7bn to 
provide a $2 incentive for every kilogram of green hydrogen produced from 2027-28. It also committed $1.3bn for 
new projects under the Hydrogen Headstart program.
The Prime Minister said Labor was encouraging investment. He said its policies would "reward success" because 
the tax credits would only kick in once projects were realised. "I tell you what's not real: -nuclear reactors," Mr 
Albanese said on Thursday. "There is no plan for how they (the Coalition) get around the (nuclear) bans which are 
there." Australian Hydrogen Council chief executive Fiona Simon estimated that governments - state and federal - 
had earmarked at least $12bn for hydrogen over the next 13 years. But she noted the US was offering a more 
appealing production tax credit than Australia: $US3 for every kilogram of green hydrogen.
Responding to the Fortescue decision, Dr Simon acknowledged that an announcement involving staff cuts was 
"going to be a blow" but argued that confidence in the sector had not been shaken. "(It) confirms what we've all 
been talking about for a while, which is that it's really hard to get hydrogen projects up. But ... it doesn't mean that 
all projects don't work," she said.
Dr Forrest said Fortescue planned to invest in renewable energy to bring energy costs down and make -hydrogen 
exports commercially feasible "I wouldn't change anything about the government's commitment," he said. 
"Companies like Fortescue will start deploying very low-cost, very low-risk capital into increasing electricity 
generation, because there's a very strong opportunity there." Dr Finkel, said green hydrogen could replace coal as 
a chemical--reducing agent in the production of iron, but acknowledged its viability was "highly dependent" on the 
costs of renewable electricity.
He said the goal should be to start producing green hydrogen at about $2 a kilogram, "which would require the 
electricity that is used to make the hydrogen to be less than about $30 per megawatt hour - which is very cheap." 
"Worldwide, customers using iron or steel for railroad lines or building construction - they are not prepared to pay a 
large premium for green iron," he said. "We need to get the costs down eventually towards the costs of existing iron 
and steel making." Dr Finkel and Superpower -Institute chair Rod Sims said green hydrogen - produced by cracking 
water into hydrogen and oxygen through zero-emissions technologies - offered a fresh -opportunity for Australia to 
combine its comparative advantages in iron ore and renewable energy.
Professor Sims said exporting hydrogen was "incredibly" expensive. "You make the green hydrogen in Australia 
and you double the cost to send it overseas," he said. "We've got the renewable energy sources to make green 
hydrogen. That's why Australia is the best place in the world to make green iron." Dr Finkel said that, in addition to 
lowering electricity prices, the government should make -legislative reforms to fast-track -approvals for renewable 
projects key to producing green hydrogen.

Fortescue's dream alive despite losses
Fortescue's green dream foundered on energy costs, with the global surge in pricing after Russia's invasion of 
Ukraine - and the massive post-pandemic cost inflation for major projects - effectively ending the cheap electricity 
needed to make hydrogen a viable energy source.
Dr Forrest rejects suggestions that Fortescue has forever abandoned its ambition of turning hydrogen into a global 
seaborne commodity equivalent to LNG, but says in the short term Fortescue will instead look to build solar and 
wind projects that will help drive down energy costs to eventually make hydrogen and green ammonia viable.
That would start with powering Fortescue's Pilbara iron ore operations, he said, but would eventually extend to 
grid-scale renewable energy projects - potentially putting Fortescue in competition with Dr Forrest's private 
renewables company, Squadron Energy.
"First of all you've got to look at the home base. We need gigawatts of our own (renewable -energy) first, and 
Fortescue will be now looking at opportunities across Western Australia, across the eastern states, to generate 
electricity," he said.
"Our purpose is always to value-add. So if we can go to carbon-free iron ore, and carbon-free metals, we will make 
much, much better returns on this sunk capital we already have than just selling into the National Electricity Market 
on the east coast - but if those opportunities arise, we're going to take them." Building solar and wind to power the 
company's Pilbara iron ore operations is a key part of Fortescue's goal of achieving "real zero" emissions by 2030 - 
a goal Dr Forrest says the company is "absolutely" committed to.
But even that will require substantial capital spending and, while Fortescue's retreat from its hydrogen ambitions 
was welcomed by market analysts on Thursday, MST Marquee analyst Saul Kavonic said the company might also 
be forced to accept its 2030 zero-emissions target is unrealistic.
"This signals Fortescue Future Industries has failed. Despite the overwhelming evidence it would be unviable from 
the get-go, Fortescue persisted with its green hydrogen ambitions, spending hundreds of millions and lambasting 
critics, until only now finally admitting defeat," Mr Kavonic said.
"Fortescue's 2030 zero-emissions target should prove to be the next stubborn ambition they wind back, as it also 
appears im-possible." Fortescue executives who raised concerns about the mogul's green hydrogen ambitions 
deserved an apology, Mr Kavonic added.
"Fortescue Future Industries has become the Fortescue Future Failure. Its failure was seen as inevitable by most 
folks in the energy industry from the start, given how uncompetitive green hydrogen economics are. It's remarkable 
that Fortescue took so long to figure it out themselves," Mr -Kavonic said. "All the Fortescue leaders and staff who 
were pushed out for telling the truth about Fortescue's green hydrogen ambitions deserve an apology." UBS 
analyst Lachlan Shaw said in a client note that Fortescue's hydrogen retreat was welcome, given expectations the 
hydrogen strategy would suck up cash as the iron ore price retreated later this decade.
"We had long been cautious about green hydrogen on better alternatives," he said. "â€¦ The capital discipline 
implied in the narrowing and slowing of Fortescue's push into green hydrogen is welcome." Fortescue shares 
closed down 32c to $22.04 on Thursday.

The Albanese government is sticking with its plan to dole out billions in taxpayer-funded handouts for green 
hydrogen despite Fortescue scaling back ambitious production goals and axing 700 jobs.
Billionaire Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest's abandonment of plans to produce 15 million tonnes of green 
hydrogen by 2030 has sparked questions over the government's subsidies and tax credits to get the industry off the 
ground as part of its Future Made in Australia agenda.
Opposition energy spokesman Ted O'Brien said Fortescue's decision had "blown a gaping hole" in the 
government's energy plans and, coupled with gas shortages, put energy security at risk. "The collapse of this 
project is symptomatic of Labor's failing all-eggs-in-one-basket 'renewables only' plan which is eating away at 
Australia's energy future," Mr O'Brien said.
"Despite offering billions in taxpayer funds these projects are still failing to get off the ground. If increasing gas 
supply was critical yesterday, it is absolutely essential today as the hopes that green hydrogen can play a role in 
supporting supply fades. We remain optimistic about the success of hydrogen in the long-term playing a role in our 
future energy mix, but we will not follow Labor's mistake."
While Dr Forrest is the highest-profile advocate for green hydrogen, the government points out he was not the only 
player, with more than 100 clean hydrogen projects in Australia, including 13 already operating and 17 under 
construction.
"Australia has more than 50 companies actively progressing renewable hydrogen project investment, making our 
current clean hydrogen pipeline amongst the largest globally, valued at more than $225 billion," Climate Change 
Minister Chris Bowen said.
"This underpins strong collaborative relationships with export partners who are keen to receive Australia's green 
hydrogen in coming years.
Page 2 of 2
PM stays with hydrogen despite Fortescue retreat
"Green hydrogen will be one of the best ways Australia can decarbonise domestic heavy emitters and help develop 
robust low carbon manufacturing, and industry.
'The government is committed to working alongside commercial interests to deliver on this potential."
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese insisted his government's energy plan remained on track.
"We want to make sure that we deliver the clean energy that Australia needs and that when coal-fired power 
stations close, as they've announced their closure, there isn't a gap in the energy security that Australia needs," he 
said. "That's why we need a real plan that's fully costed, and that's being rolled out with the certainty being provided 
for investment."
Climate Energy Finance director Tim Buckley said Dr Forrest was not alone in betting big on green hydrogen as 
part of the energy transition but costs had, in fact, gone up instead of following the usual pattern of better 
affordability for clean technology such as batteries, solar panels and electric vehicles.
"Twiggy went way too hard, way too fast and way too hyped about hydrogen," Mr Buckley said.
"Australia put out like 50 per cent of the world's press releases of hydrogen in the last five years but none of them 
have come to fruition."
With Australian coal and gas exports to decline as the world decarbonises, Mr Buckley expressed doubt green 
hydrogen would be able to fill the void, pointing out the first ship capable of transporting chilled hydrogen at scale 
was at least 10 years away.
He said green hydrogen's value was helping Australian resources companies to pivot to value-adding, such as 
processing critical minerals and producing strategic metals such as green steel.
The Superpower Institute, led by Rod Sims and Ross Garnaut, has warned it will be difficult for Australia to become 
a major player in green iron production without a green hydrogen industry.
The institute estimates the annual export value of green iron to be $295 billion, or three times the current value of 
iron ore exports.
"Green aluminium exports could be worth an additional $60 billion, compared with the current value of bauxite and 
alumina exports of $10 billion," it said in a report now sitting with the Department of Industry.
Mr Sims argues the government should double down on the hydrogen production tax incentive by introducing 
capital grants of 50 per cent or equivalent tax credits for the first movers who build green iron plants.
The former ACCC boss had no issue if that meant Fortescue qualified for green iron support on top green 
hydrogen handouts.
"He could be helping Australia to start a $300 billion industry," Mr Sims said. "And yet, if we don't help him, he won't 
do it. So this isn't just money for someone who's going to do something anyway."

Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest has defended the company's legal pursuit of three former executives over an 
alleged intellectual property breach, saying anyone attempting to snatch the company's technology will face the full 
weight of the law.
Fortescue launched Federal Court action in June against Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn 
Winther-Jensen after alleging they had taken intellectual property from Fortescue's work into "green iron" and 
attempted to commercialise it through their start-up Element Zero.
The Element Zero team has vigorously denied the claims. The lawsuit made headlines when it was revealed 
Fortescue had hired private investigators to follow and photograph the Element Zero executives and their families.
The stakes are high for Fortescue, which even after this week's austerity drive and 700 job cuts, has a bevy of 
trials and projects under way into various embryonic clean energy technologies.
Dr Forrest has denied prior knowledge of the plan to use private investigators, and said Fortescue directors had 
struggled to align the surveillance tactics with the company's values.
General counsel Phil McKeiver offered his resignation over the incident, but has been retained by Fortescue, albeit 
without his previous responsibility as company secretary.
But despite distancing himself from the private investigation tactics, Dr Forrest endorsed the decision to pursue 
Element Zero through the courts.
"There is an overarching message here: you're not going to be paid to develop technology with a whole heap of 
other people, at really serious risk and cost to the entire company and your workmates ... and then send that 
technology to another email address and think that's OK," he said.
"That's not OK."

Dr Forrest appeared to reference evidence tendered to the Federal Court in Fortescue's June 17 claim, where it 
accused Dr Winther-Jensen of sending technical documents about green iron research from his Fortescue email to 
a personal email account.
Dr Forrest said the Element Zero team had burned the bridges behind them "like the Nazis pulling out of Poland".
"You want to send emails full of our data over there then eliminate it, you'll be held to the full responsibility of the 
law," he said.
Dr Kolodziejczyk was born in the Polish city of Rzeszow, according to Australian Securities and Investments 
Commission filings.
A spokesman for Element Zero declined to comment on Dr Forrest's warning.
"We are not going to be drawn into responding to these comments. We look forward to these matters being 
determined through the court process," he said.
Mr Masterman has been one of Dr Forrest's closest allies over the past quarter of a century, working for both 
Fortescue and some private entities linked to the Forrest family.
Mr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk were among the inner circle of trusted executives who travelled around the 
world with Dr Forrest in 2020 collecting rights to clean energy projects.
The fight with Element Zero over "green iron" technology is timely, given Dr Forrest's latest long-term vision for 
Fortescue is to eventually cease selling hematite iron ore, and instead use green hydrogen and other techniques to 
strip out impurities and sell only the pure "green iron" left behind.
"We're getting out of iron ore, which is very interesting because we're going, as soon as we can ... to green metal," 
Dr Forrest said on Wednesday, when Fortescue conceded it would not achieve his previous goal of producing 15 
million tonnes of hydrogen a year by 2030.
Fortescue will start construction this year on a $US50 million ($74.2 million) green iron facility at its Christmas 
Creek iron ore hub in the Pilbara.
Dr Forrest said such projects would consume green hydrogen in the future, even if demand for the commodity as a 
fuel source from other companies was not as strong as Fortescue had hoped.

The Prime Minister says his government's clean energy plan is "on track" despite mining magnate Andrew Forrest 
suffering a major setback in his green energy ambitions.
But the opposition used the announcement that Mr Forrest's company, Fortescue Mining, was restructuring its 
mining and energy divisions, with a direct impact on its green hydrogen ambitions to say it showed the 
Government's renewables plan was a "super-flop".
Fortescue had sets its sights on producing cheap renewable energy at scale, but some believe Wednesday's 
announcement means its goal of producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030 is unlikely to be 
achieved.
Anthony Albanese, who was in northern Queensland on Thursday, said the Fortescue announcement did not worry 
him.
"Our energy plan is on track," he said in Winton.
"We want to make sure that we deliver the clean energy that Australia needs and that when coal-fired power 
stations close, as they've announced their closure, there isn't a gap in the energy security that Australia needs.
"That's why we need a real plan that's fully costed, and that's being rolled out with the certainty being provided for 
investment." Fortescue said it remained "resolute in its commitment to be the world's leading green technology, 
energy and metals company with a laser focus on achieving Real Zero by 2030".
But opposition energy spokesman Ted O'Brien said the Fortescue move showed "Labor's 'green hydrogen 
superpower' vision is quickly turning into a 'super-flop'." "Twiggy's abandonment of green hydrogen has blown a 
gaping hole in the Albanese Labor Government's energy plans," Mr O'Brien said.
"The collapse of this project is symptomatic of Labor's failing all-eggs-in-one-basket 'renewables only' plan which is 
eating away at Australia's energy future. Despite offering billions in taxpayer funds these projects are still failing to 
get off the ground." Mr O'Brien said the Coalition was taking a "sensible technology agnostic approach" to energy -

including hydrogen and its controversial nuclear reactor policy. Mr Forrest launched a sweeping restructure at For-
tescue in the face of the company's failure to deliver on its green-energy -promises. Up to 700 jobs will go in the 
massive cutbacks after the iron ore mogul pulled back from the company's green hydrogen goal.

Three things scare Australian fund managers and sell-side analysts off Fortescue. Andrew Forrest removed one of 
them, yet no one's paying attention.
The most surprising thing on the ASX yesterday was the way investors overlooked Fortescue's big news. Its 
promise to get back to its leaner and meaner roots and ease off its green energy expansion had the stock down 1.2 
per cent in afternoon trade, while brokers barely mentioned it in their morning notes.
Having heard sell-side analysts consistently poke holes in the hydrogen story - the technology, the rollout, the cost - 
and listened to fund managers talk about Fortescue spending iron ore cash flows on an unproven business and 
watching its cost base grow, we thought the wind-back would be welcome.
In theory, it's a reset that could return Fortescue to its glory days in 2018 and 2019, when just about every extra $1 
million in revenue fell through to the earnings before interest and tax line and its dividend machine started.
The job cuts and statement could also dispel fears about Fortescue's energy unit spending $1 billion or so a year in 
the near term with no clear path to revenue or earnings.
Instead, it was met with crickets and yesterday's share price drop. There were nervy buyers in early trade, and no 
instant gratification for what we thought was a pretty significant announcement.
Perhaps the most telling thing was the way sell-side analysts largely ignored the news. Macquarie's team had a 
close look, and upped its near-term earnings per share forecasts by 20 er cent, but none of the other 15 analysts in 
Bloomberg's survey had re-cut the numbers by lunchtime. UBS, not in Bloomberg's survey for the past few years 
and which called the hydrogen news "unsurprising", published a brief 1-pager.
So what's going on? It's either something simple or much more serious, depending on who you ask.
The simple theory is that the school holidays have sucked plenty of money managers and analysts away from their 
desks, significantly cutting active fund domestic institution trading volumes and quant money that factors in things 
such as broker earnings upgrades/downgrades.
Page 2 of 2
No sugar hit from Fortescue backflip Closing Bell
That is true, but we still see share prices go up and down on small volumes, so while it may explain the lack of 
analyst interest, we're not sure if it explains the muted share price response.
Worse for Fortescue would be if it shows institutional investors and all those analysts with hold/sell 
recommendations (all 16 of them in Bloomberg's survey) are materially more concerned by the company's other big 
issues. Time will tell. One day's trade does not make or break Fortescue's strategy, but the muted response can 
still be interesting.
The two other issues are the iron ore price - a perennial question that has flared up given what's going on in China 
and the arrival of Rio Tinto-backed Simandou into the market from 2026 - and Fortescue's leadership team which, 
while under executive chairman Forrest and his co-CEOs Dino Otranto and Mark Hutchinson, has experienced a lot 
of turnover.
Both come up in our talks with Australian fund managers, including the big industry funds and the domestic long-
only crowd, and are long-term issues that cannot be addressed or overcome with one announcement.
The price of iron ore is Fortescue's core earnings driver, while its leadership team and governance framework is 
important to its long-term value creation for shareholders. Wednesday afternoon's announcement had three more 
executive team appointments: Apple Paget to chief financial officer (from acting CFO), chief corporate officer 
Shelley Robertson to chief operating officer and Navdeep (Mona) Gill to company secretary (from assistant 
company secretary).
In the short term, the other thing on fund managers' minds is whether there may be some residual selling from long-
time Fortescue-backed Capital Group, a US funds management giant that was a substantial shareholder for close 
to a decade.
Capital sold a monster $1.1 billion line of Fortescue shares in June, and dipped below the substantial mark days 
later. It still has at least a few billion dollars invested in the $70 billion iron ore miner.
Sometimes investors hold off from buying after these blocks, thinking there may be more stock to shake loose at 
discounted prices. The block also showed there was not a lot of domestic interest in Fortescue; brokers reckon the 
stock was largely acquired offshore.
Whatever the case, Forrest and Co have more work to do selling this story to the institutional investor community. 
While they're the sort of pack that likes to prove the doubters wrong, it does not hurt to have a few friends out there 
or at least ones that take notice of potentially meaningful strategic pivots.
From the muted reaction, we cannot help to think it's a bit of a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" when it 
comes to green hydrogen.
While investors bagged it when Forrest was trying to ram it out, they seem to be paying little attention now he has 
taken his foot off the accelerator. They're more interested in the iron price.
What's the long-term sustainable iron ore price? You'd be hard-pressed to find too many reputable markets people 
to say it is materially more than yesterday's $US105 a tonne.
If it does go south, absent this green hydrogen business we've heard a lot about recently, where does Fortescue's 
share price go? That's why there are so many "sell" calls on the stock and the problem today.

Highlight: Fortescue announced 700 job cuts this week in a bid to remain ‘lean’. So what does it mean for green 
hydrogen?Get our morning and afternoon news emails, free app or daily news podcast
Body
The iron ore billionaire Andrew Forrest has long vowed to transform Australia’s energy landscape with green 
hydrogen made from renewable energy, even turning up to 2023’s Cop28 in a ship dubbed the “Green Pioneer”. 
But pundits wondered whether the green dream had come crashing down to reality after Fortescue announced this 
week  that it was cutting 700 jobs across its businesses globally as it seeks to remain “lean”, with an unspecific 
number going in its energy unit.
Here we look at the emerging green hydrogen industry and the headwinds – and tailwinds – it faces.
                   What is green hydrogen?                   
Hydrogen, as fans of the periodic table recall, is the simplest element and most abundant in the universe. It makes 
up about 73% of the sun’s mass and one-tenth of yours.
Refineries use hydrogen to crack heavy oil into petrol and diesel, and to make ammonia for fertiliser. It is also an 
important energy store that might one day displace gas or other fossil fuels, used for everything from power 
generation to metal production and heavy transport.
But hydrogen usually needs to be split from other elements and that takes energy. According to the International 
Energy Agency, hydrogen production and use was linked to 900m tonnes of C02 emissions in 2022, or about twice 
that of Australia’s total.
The source of the energy used to split hydrogen is categorised into up to a dozen colours. 
Page 2 of 3
Is Andrew Forrest’s energy dream in peril? The future of green hydrogen in Australia explained
CSIRO highlights a few,  with green hydrogen extracted without greenhouse gas emissions, usually via 
electrolysers that are powered by wind, solar or hydro.
So-called blue hydrogen uses steam to separate hydrogen from natural gas, with resulting emissions sequestered. 
If they aren’t, it’s grey hydrogen. If coal is used (as the Japanese have been eyeing in Victoria  ), it’s brown or black, 
depending on the type of coal. There’s also “pink hydrogen” if nuclear power is the energy source.
                   Is Fortescue quitting the green hydrogen scene?                   
Fortescue said it “remains resolute in its commitment to be the world’s leading green technology, energy and 
metals company with a laser focus on achieving Real Zero [ by cutting 90%  of emissions] by 2030”.
The cost cuts relate to combining the metals and energy divisions into one “to simplify its structure, remove 
duplication and deliver cost efficiencies”.
“We are by no means winding back on our commitment to green hydrogen,” Forrest said in a statement provided to 
Guardian Australia. “In fact, we are doing all we can to back green hydrogen in Australia by investing in renewable 
energy and hydrogen technology every single day.
“The price of power remains a challenge in Australia, and this has been caused by fossil fuels and the subsidies 
provided for fossil fuels.” 
According to the investment bank UBS, Fortescue’s proposed green ammonia plant  at Queensland’s Gibson 
Island needs electricity to cost $20-$30 per megawatt hour to be viable but recent long-term contracts for large wind 
and solar farms are offering $70-$90 per MWh power.
Those price gaps must close if hopes for “green steel” or other green metals that use hydrogen are to be realised.
AGL Energy, meanwhile, confirmed on Friday that Fortescue was ending plans to produce hydrogen at the site of 
its defunct Liddell coal-fired power station. “AGL remains committed to exploring options to produce green hydrogen 
and future fuels at the Hunter [Valley] site in the future if economically feasible,” a spokesperson said.
UBS has a “sell” call on Fortescue shares, predicting they have at least another 10% to fall (building on the 25%-
plus fall in 2024 so far). A big reason for the dip is falling iron ore prices as China’s demand cools – unrelated to 
Fortescue’s hydrogen hopes.
                   What are governments doing?                   
The government will offer a tax credit to subsidise green hydrogen as part of its Future Made in Australia  scheme. 
Producers will receive a $2/kg “incentive” for up to 10 years – between mid-2027 and mid-2040 – for projects 
reaching final investment signoff by 2030.
States, too, are chipping in. South Australia, for instance, has a $500m hydrogen jobs plan  that includes $100m 
state and federal support for the Port Bonython Hydrogen Hub  that aims to produce green hydrogen-related 
exports from 2030.
New South Wales, meanwhile, will offer as much as $3bn to lure similar ventures to that state, with a 2030 “stretch 
target” of 111,000 tonnes a year of green hydrogen output and 700 megawatts of electrolyser capacity.
But other nations are spending much more. The US’s inflation reduction act may end up topping $1UStn ($A1.5tn) 
for decarbonising programs, including hydrogen and electric vehicles among others.
Fortescue cuts were likely related to missing out on being shortlisted for the first $2bn  of the $4bn federal 
government’s “hydrogen headstart” scheme, one source added.
                   What does the hydrogen industry think?                   Page 3 of 3
Is Andrew Forrest’s energy dream in peril? The future of green hydrogen in Australia explained
Insiders say much climate action hinges on “cost-effective” renewable energy, not just the green hydrogen industry.
So-called blue hydrogen might be a near-term solution to make the product cheap enough to foster greater demand 
but “it’s better for the planet if we went straight to green”, one source said.
Fiona Simon, chief executive of the Australian Hydrogen Council, said Fortescue’s move was “less about hydrogen 
than it is about one company and how it’s sought to reassess its priorities”.
That said, “we’ve all known that hydrogen was difficult, and in the last two or three years [experience has shown] 
that is harder than we thought”, Simon said. “It certainly doesn’t signal the death of hydrogen.”
Scaling up the production of electrolysers that use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen will help drive 
down costs, she said.
By some estimates, hydrogen costs would need to drop to about $US2/kg ($A3/kg) to be competitive. One recent 
US government study  puts present costs at $US12 to $16/kg when delivery costs are included.
                   What next?                   
The International Energy Agency estimates global hydrogen demand reached 95m tonnes in 2022, rising about 3% 
that year. Low-emissions sources of the fuel accounted for just 0.7% of demand.
Minh Le, global head of hydrogen for analysts Rystad Energy, said that “as things stand at the moment it will be 
very challenging, if not almost impossible to reach $2 [US] for green hydrogen”.
Still, “the momentum of hydrogen development remains strong”, with “many major auctions in key regions” coming 
through this year in Europe, Japan and elsewhere, he said.
Falling battery costs add to the competitive pressures in areas such as transport. At 14 times lighter than air, 
hydrogen is leaky – with safety issues  – and not yet barbecue ready. 
Rystad Energy’s Nigel Rambhujun said “a lot more work can be done on demand-side policies to incentivise 
potential end-users and reduce the green premium associated with clean hydrogen” with the next 6-12 months 
“critical” for the sector in Australia.
“Without significant government support, green hydrogen will continue to be the most expensive hydrogen colour.”

Bubble bursts for Labor's green hydrogen dreams Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest says Labor should push 
ahead with billions of taxpayer dollars in tax incentives for green hydrogen, yet his own actions reveal a starkly 
different stance. Forrest has made the difficult decision to scale back his green hydrogen initiatives, citing difficulties 
with the commercial viability of the project.
This prudent business decision raises an important question: if green hydrogen projects are not currently viable for 
private investors such as Forrest, why should Australian taxpayers be expected to shoulder the financial risk? The 
discrepancy between Forrest's public advocacy and private actions signals the need for a thorough reassessment 
of taxpayer investments in green hydrogen.
Public funds should be allocated prudently, ensuring that investments are both economically viable and beneficial 
for the broader community, not for billionaires' business interests.
Don McMillan, Paddington, Qld
Friday's editorial ("Hydrogen rush is hitting reality", 19/7) clearly sets out what the federal government should be in 
relation to Australia's ongoing energy supply. Opposition energy spokesman Ted O'Brien says: "Hydrogen was a 
good example of why governments should avoid trying to pick winners and instead diversify the risk for taxpayers." 
The current Coalition stance is effectively that we must leave our options open.
We know from our own and overseas experience that energy technology is developing rapidly. In practical terms, 
we are increasingly seeing new energy supply opportunities revealed. I would like to think we are a fairly pragmatic 
country when it comes to the uptake of new technologies.
As your editorial says, "The responsible thing to do is to safeguard electricity supplies using known technologies 
while alternatives are properly evaluated." We certainly have the skills and political nous to make long-term 
decisions for the benefit of all Australians.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Brilliant letter by Mark Scanlan ("Bowen EV policy driving us into dystopian future", 19/7) on the future for green 
hydrogen and the advent of the zero-emissions Twigster! I hope he has sent copies to the Prime Minister, Energy 
Minister and rent-seekers of government energy investment schemes.
Kerry MacDermott, Binalong, NSW
The chooks have come home to roost. To sustain a renewable energy pipe dream takes a lot of money. Even 
Andrew Forrest, who seems to have lots of it, and government largesse aren't enough to overcome the reality of 
supply and demand. There simply isn't sufficient renewable electricity currently or in the pipeline to service 
Fortescue's proposed production of 15 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2030. Given supply-side issues, the cost of 
renewable energy for the purpose of green hydrogen production is exorbitantly high. The Fortescue pullback has 
punched a mammoth hole in the government's renewable ambitions. It raises serious questions about the reliability 
of the government's forecasts and its promises in the energy space more generally. It's a wake-up call that to wed 
this country's energy security to technologies that are yet to be proven at scale is not only fraught but also 
irresponsible.
Kim Keogh, Claremont, WA
It is hilariously strange to witness the evolution of the views of energy analysts and even Australia's Chief Scientist 
on the outlook for green hydrogen in our energy mix since Fortescue's pirouette on its future application. I wonder 
if our next chief scientist might have a better grasp of the second law of thermodynamics.
There has been so much ignorant, greenwashing bunkum delivered to potential investors around projects to deliver 
hydrogen as a fuel. In fact, the manufacturing process itself consumes about three times as much energy as it 
delivers in use. I've seen wild projects touted as environmentally friendly taking hydrogen from brown coal or 
methane, coupled with carbon capture, while every second element of the periodic table has suddenly become 
"critical". Carpetbaggers and lifestyle company directors have had a field day.
The sad and concerning aspect of this madness is how poorly our government has been advised and the many 
tens of millions of taxpayer dollars that have been splashed around on harebrained projects of dubious merit. Peter

Andrew Forrest caught the market by surprise when he stood up at Fortescue's 2020 annual shareholder meeting 
and laid out a radical plan to transform the company into a green energy giant.
Iron ore prices were surging at the time, and Fortescue was wildly profitable. But Dr Forrest told shareholders 
attending the Fortescue AGM his green dream would take the company to a new level entirely, and by 2030 
Fortescue would be challenging global energy majors such as Chevron.
Fortescue would be targeting production of as much as 235 gigawatts of renewable energy, Dr Forrest told 
shareholders - more than five times the capacity of Australia's National Electricity Market at the time.
The edges of the plan had been leaking out for months, as Dr Forrest and a small group of insiders had been 
touring the world trying to stitch up deals with global governments to allow the company first choice of potential 
energy projects. The company's new subsidiary, Fortescue Future Industries, had signed a deal for the potential 
development of hydroelectric power in Papua New Guinea only a month before, along with early stage agreements 
in Indonesia. And the company had already hired a raft of renewable energy experts - including former Pacific 
Hydro boss Rob Grant - to help form its renewable energy plans.
By the November shareholder meeting Dr Forrest and his team had spoken with more than 25 governments around 
the world, with another 24 on the list for the touring party.
That landmark presentation in November 2020 kicked off a bewildering array of announcements from the tour - 
including early stage agreements with India, Indonesia and Brazil - and plans to get involved in the world's biggest 
renewable energy project, the Grand Inga project in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Alarm bells were ringing in the market by mid-2021, however, when Fortescue's announcement it planned to spend 
up to 10 per cent of its net profits on green energy projects - or $US400m to $US600m that financial year - sparked 
concerns the green energy project was looming as a major distraction from the company's main iron ore business.

Fortescue now marching 'to the one beat'
Fortescue chief executive Elizabeth Gaines faced a hostile reception from analysts and investors at the company's 
regular quarterly production briefing in July, with analysts and fund managers demanding the company give the 
market a "clear business case" for its green energy investments. But resurgent iron ore prices meant the rivers of 
cash were still rolling in and the backlash never really translated into a hit to Fortescue's share price - Dr Forrest 
argues the reverse happened, in fact, as green-focused investment firms piled into the company's stock.
And the growing criticism certainly did not slow the flurry of announcements. By November 2021 FFI had inked 
agreements for hydrogen and renewable energy projects in more than 20 countries, and analysis by The Australian 
estimated that it would cost close to $200bn for Fortescue to make good on delivering just half of those projects.
By then FFI had more 700 staff, its own private jet to ferry energy boss Julie Shuttleworth around the world, and a 
vast portfolio of potential projects.
But even then cracks were appearing in Dr Forrest's green vision. An investigation by The Weekend Australian in 
late 2021 revealed that the internal culture of FFI had become increasingly chaotic amid ruthless internal 
competition - so much so that insiders described its inner workings as being like the Hunger Games.
At the same time Dr Forrest's passion for Fortescue's project - which he genuinely believes is a key part of saving 
the planet from the worst impacts of global warming - riled up the rest of Australia's mining industry, which until then 
had been watching on with bemused fascination, after The Australian revealed the Fortescue founder was lobbying 
for a phase-out of the federal government's diesel fuel rebate scheme, worth billions to the mining industry.
Boiler room explosion It is bizarre to reflect that catalogue only reflects the first year of Fortescue's grand energy 
project.
Even close followers of the company amongst journalists and market analysts struggle to chronicle the bewildering 
array of announcements, promises and backflips - and executive departures - over the next few years.
But if there was a moment that sums up the chaos within the company, it is the complete implosion at the most 
senior ranks in the company in September 2021.
Newly appointed mining boss Fiona Hick left the company only days after Fortescue celebrated its 20th birthday 
with a lavish bash in the Pilbara. She was quickly followed out the door by new chief financial officer Christine 
Morris, high-profile FFI recruit Guy Debelle. In an explosive interview with The Australian, Dr Forrest claimed the 
extraordinary events were sparked after he returned from an overseas trip to find the company's strategy had been 
hijacked by members of its executive team, over differences in opinion over Fortescue's green strategy. "You put a 
lighthouse on a hill and aim at it (but) there was a feeling that another lighthouse was emerging and the 
organisation - particularly when the chairman was overseas for three months - was being pushed towards -another 
lighthouse," he said at the time.
Is the dream over?
The spectacular departure of Hick and Morris did not end the upheaval in Fortescue's executive ranks, far from it. 
But 10 months on, Fortescue now faces another round of major change as Dr Forrest this week reset the 
company's strategy - finally conceding that the company's most ambitious goal, of producing 15 million tonnes of 
green hydrogen a year by 2030, cannot be achieved in the face of soaring global energy costs.
But Dr Forrest rejects any suggestion the company's green energy dream is dead. Speaking to the Australian this 
week, he said the company's commitment to decarbonise its own iron ore operations by 2030 is unwavering, and 
the company will shift its green energy focus to building the massive amounts of wind and solar power needed to 
bring down energy costs and make hydrogen viable.
And as for the 700 staff that will leave as part of the reset? Dr Forrest says that is "heartbreaking", but necessary as 
Fortescue brings its iron ore and green energy arms back together.Page 3 of 3
Fortescue now marching 'to the one beat'
But the tension between those two arms has been at the centre of the chaos within Fortescue since the green 
energy project first began - according to both former Fortescue employees and Dr Forrest's own words along the 
way.
The decision to build Fortescue Energy as a company within a company was a deliberate decision, the Fortescue 
founder told The Australian this week, because it otherwise may not have happened at all.
"I had no choice. I tried for a couple of years to get green energy, and going green into the psyche of Fortescue. 
We had a very good, very well run company, with shareholder returns which hit new records across Australia and 
tens of billions of dollars issued to shareholders. A super successful company - and strong resistance to change," 
he said.
"And you can't have improvement without change. You can't be smug, fat and happy. And so as to not threaten the 
iron ore sector at all with a major new initiative, we did it through a major startup. And that grew and grew." 
Fortescue Energy had more than 1900 employees at the end of June 2023, according to the company's last annual 
report. That may well be dramatically slimmed down by the latest restructuring.
But Dr Forrest says all of Fortescue is now "all marching in the same direction, to the same drum beat". "There is 
no one else that is going to lead the world into a secure and non-fossil fuel future. It may as well be us, so it is us," 
he said. And Dr Forrest rejects any suggestion that Fortescue's latest reset is a sign its green strategy is failing, 
pointing to the green iron technology the company is developing, its acquisition of a role developing in the giant 
Belinga iron ore deposit in Gabon, its early stage green ammonia joint venture in Morroco, and its development of 
new technology in shipping, trucking and rail. "The failure here is a failure of your understanding - and I'm not being 
unkind here. We didn't just go after green hydrogen, we went after green technology - we went after what 
opportunities there could be in changing the world.That led to opportunities being offered to us," he said.

Highlight: Mining executive Andrew Forrest has denied he is abandoning his ambitions for green hydrogen, saying 
the fuel is imperative for combating climate change.
Body
Mining executive Andrew Forrest has described as "a political mischief" reports he is divesting from green 
hydrogen, declaring the energy form would be an "absolutely imperative" tool for combating climate change.
"We are producing green hydrogen as we speak," he said.
"It's a political mischief to say that the world's major green hydrogen champion is turning away from green hydrogen 
- it's completely untrue."
Forrest's Fortescue said on Wednesday it would slash 700 jobs in coming weeks, and merge its renewable energy 
and iron ore divisions, as it seeks to reduce duplication and costs.
Asked several times on Wednesday whether he remained committed to his ambitious goal to produce 15 million 
tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030, Forrest said he remained committed to 15 million tonnes a year in the 
future.
That sparked headlines claiming he was abandoning his ambitions for green hydrogen - which is produced through 
a process of electrolysis and using renewable energies including wind and solar.
Forrest told this masthead he remained resolutely committed to green hydrogen, and described the shift as a policy 
"broadening, not change".
"We have to commit, across the world, to green electricity and green hydrogen. If you don't, you're basically giving 
up on the world," he said.
"For us to say we're giving up on green hydrogen, as some people have tried to twist it, is just like saying you're 
giving up on your kids [and] giving up on the world."
International conflicts including Russia's invasion of Ukraine had driven up the price of all fossil fuels, and dragged 
green electricity with it, Forrest said.
"And there's precisely nothing we can do about it, unless we invest upstream in generating very large quantities of 
green electricity ourselves, which is what the company announced," he said.

'A political mischief': Forrest hits back at green hydrogen detractors
"We're consolidating by investing upstream so we can get the price of electricity down to a point where green 
hydrogen becomes more competitive."
In recent years, Forrest has toured the globe seeking opportunities to produce the huge amount of affordable, 
emissions-free electricity needed to separate hydrogen from water in commercially meaningful quantities.
The potential markets are in replacing hydrogen from gas and coal in the manufacture of fertiliser and chemicals, 
and providing an emissions-free fuel in applications where batteries may be impractical, such as long-distance 
shipping.
However, Fortescue found the cost of that clean energy prohibitively high and now wants to focus on developing 
renewable energy projects to drive down the major cost in producing green hydrogen.
"If the electricity cost is high, then we can't make hydrogen cheaply enough to compete with fossil fuels," Forrest 
told Radio 6PR in Perth on Thursday.
Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen defended the viability of green hydrogen projects, which are 
being developed by more than 50 companies in Australia at a cost of $225 billion.
"Green hydrogen will be one of the best ways Australia can decarbonise domestic heavy emitters and help develop 
robust low-carbon manufacturing," he said.
While Bowen said the federal government was committed to working with the project proponents, opposition energy 
spokesman Ted O'Brien said Fortescue's move had "blown a gaping hole" in Labor's renewables-focused energy 
plans.
"Labor thinks it's picking winners, but we now know they are picking losers, and it's Australian taxpayers who are 
picking up the bill," O'Brien said.
The federal government's $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program is its highest-profile backing of the nascent 
industry. In December, six projects - none backed by Fortescue - were shortlisted for funding. Recipients will be 
announced late this year.
O'Brien said the Coalition had supported the hydrogen industry while in government, and it was optimistic the fuel 
would have a long-term role in the energy mix.

Years before former British SAS soldier turned private investigator Robert Lancaster was paid by Andrew Forrest's 
Fortescue to rummage through mail belonging to the wives, children and employees of his ex-staff, he shared 
some tips about how to carry out an effective surveillance op.
"Once the residence has been located, confirmation of the residence can be usually obtained by speaking with the 
local area mail delivery driver under a pretext," Lancaster wrote in an old article.
This is the man at the helm of a company responsible for following Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen's 
wives to Kmart and their children to school, and he appears to have led an extraordinary life before his top secret 
spy mission for the iron-ore giant.
He served as a British soldier in Ireland during the Troubles, and later set up an investigations and security firm 
based in Sydney which, among other notable jobs, infiltrated picket lines during the bitter 1998 dispute between 
Patrick Stevedores and the Maritime Union to identify "ringleaders" and "instances of intimidation".
Lancaster's Instagram is full of #commandos content too, with numerous posts showing him in military fatigues 
undertaking training and holding large weapons. "In the 80s when you were on the team you were either an 
assaulter or a sniper. I did both jobs. The weapon of choice was the L96A1," he writes on Instagram.
But what's a spy without another identity? According to Lancaster's prolific social media posts and interviews, he 
has also purchased properties in France, including a chateau, which he developed into successful business for 
tourists looking to travel the countryside.
Lancaster has not returned The Weekend Australian's requests for comment, which have been left via social media 
channels and with a call to his office.
Details about the PI can be revealed after Fortescue sensationally alleged Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-
Jensen stole the would-be green energy giant's intellectual property to launch their own start-up, Element Zero.

Along with long term lieutenant of Dr Forrest, Michael Masterman, Fortescue has claimed that after the three men 
left the company's green iron project between 2021 and 2022, the only way they could have rapidly developed their 
own way to process iron ore into metallic iron without burning fossil fuels is by stealing Fortescue's secrets.
The iron ore giant's suspicions prompted the company to launch an urgent court case in May, seeking permission to 
launch raids on properties of Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen to collect evidence in support of their case. In 
order to work out when to launch the raids, Fortescue was required to determine if children under 18-years-old or 
female occupants would be in the properties identified in search orders and when they would be there.
He took the job seriously, with a court hearing he or his company conducted "19 days of surveillance that was 
undertaken of all the respondents and their employees and some family members and wives following people to 
Kmart, sifting through mail and the like".
Lancaster produced a 600 page report, containing shots taken while undercover of Dr Kolodziejczyk's wife and five-
year-old son along with Dr Winther-Jensen's wife and 16-year-old daughter who had been watched as she left for 
school and returned home on one day.
Who is Robert Lancaster?
Lancaster has left a very public profile of himself across social media and online via interviews, and in old stories he 
wrote and published on his business website: Lancaster Global Risk.
He served in the British army, including the 22nd SAS and in Ireland during the Troubles, between 1977 and 1989 
after he joined the military at 16-years-old.
"When I was in the infantry I spent just under three years in Northern Ireland," he tells the Spycraft 101 podcast, 
published about a month ago. "A lot of that was intelligence gathering, a lot of surveillance. A lot of patrolling." In a 
social media post, that shows an old picture with Lancaster in camouflage, he says: "Old school Australian SF. I 
served in 22 SAS and later in the Australian Commandos. I remain a brother." In another, alongside a picture of two 
blokes arm-in-arm sitting in front of five dogs, Lancaster says: "Catch up with Bill a mate from the Australian 
Commandos with his 'wolf pack' at one of his country estates. War stories and wine flowed freely." His time in the 
SAS set him up for a life in the private sector, Lancaster says. He left the military following a divorce and had just 
"had enough". In the early 1990s he moved to Australia following a job offer. He carried out a stint in the reserve 
special forces in Australia from 1990, and then undertook two months-long undercover operations in NSW, he tells 
the Spycraft podcast.
Lancaster speaks highly of his track record as a PI. After he investigated a multimillion-dollar scam in NSW's Urban 
Transit Authority in the late 1980s and early 1990s, he claims 18 people were arrested. "If I would have been found 
out there I'd have probably been disappeared. It was very unionised, it was quite a dynamic situation," he says. He 
survived, and moved on to another undercover gig three weeks later for the NSW State Rail Authority before 
launching what he says is a highly sought after PI business in Lancasters Global Risk based in Sydney. After he 
started off doing jobs for insurance companies investigating the veracity of disablement claims, business soared 
and he says he had about 100 investigations per week within a few years of setting up the company in 1991.
In another story, published on his company's website, he discusses Lancaster's role in one of Australia's most 
bruising industrial disputes: that between the Maritime Union of Australia and Patrick Stevedores in 1998.
After Patrick's entire workforce was sacked and replaced with ex-military men, a month long picket disrupted 
movements across major ports across the country. "While the industrial clash intensified, with surging lines of 
demonstrators, mass arrests, guards in balaclavas with dogs protecting strike breakers, there was another game 
being played behind the scenes," the article says. "In the bush around the container port, hidden in the industrial 
sprawl of Sydney's Port Botany, Lancaster had his operatives, mostly former special forces soldiers, trained in the 
art of concealment and surveillance.Page 3 of 3

"As Lancaster puts it, and talking only because the dispute is now some four years gone: 'We had people in camo 
gear dug into bushland watching where people gathered. We can take video images form up to a kilometre away as 
long as the conditions aren't too hot â€¦ and identify individuals.
"We clearly identified the ringleaders and documented instances of violence and intimidation. We also had people 
infiltrate picket lines with miniature covert cameras, and had people at the front and rear gates and a roving patrol, 
all armed with cameras to record acts of violence and intimidation."
Diversify your business Lancaster says he runs a pension fund and a property portfolio, including in France where 
he says he ran an eight bedroom chateau with a Michelin star chef for guests. His Instagram profile, called 
Plantagenet Manor, is private but the name links to a chateau. It does not appear to be available for stays, although 
an old posting remains online.
"The chateau is located in the centre of historic Chalus on nearly two acres of private grounds, surrounded by high 
walls and hedges and is within walking distance to restaurants, cafes, bars, shops and a lovely Health Spa," its 
description reads. "Plantagenet Manor is a beautiful eight bedroom 'petit' chateau with a heated in-ground pool that 
has gone through a complete renovation with five new bathrooms, gourmet commercial size kitchen (and) modern 
four poster beds." Photos posted to Facebook in 2022 also show some shots of a completed renovation on a 
property in the Sunshine Coast, nestled among palm trees and a crystal blue pool. "After living in Sydney for about 
half of my life it was a big call to move to Queensland," he said. He says had a significant heart attack a few years 
ago; more recently he has suffered another health setback and has pulled back on work. However, he continued to 
work "contract by contract", he told Spycraft.

Transition Andrew Forrest is not alone. Many companies have suffered a similar delusion about a simple, easy and 
cheap future.
Fortescue's hydrogen dreams have come up against the hard energy reality - affordability, reliability and zero 
emissions are difficult to achieve together. But Fortescue is not alone.
For the past decade, many have suffered a similar energy delusion. Promises of an easy transition have given way 
to the realisation that nothing with energy or climate ambitions is simple or cheap.
Only this month, Google, which had claimed to be carbon-neutral since 2007, said it no longer counted offsets and 
that it now aimed for neutrality by 2030 because the energy demand associated with AI had seen its emissions 
increase 48 per cent between 2019 and 2023. Likewise, some Australian funds walked back climate commitments. 
Or just ask Europe.
The hype around green hydrogen should be a case study for those interested in the difficulties when it comes to 
energy and climate.
Despite green hydrogen being seen as the Swiss Army knife for difficult decarbonisation problems, buyers were 
hard to find, largely because the cost remained stubbornly high and the technical challenges more complex than 
envisaged.
Attempts to deliver green hydrogen at $2 a kilogram sounded great at a political level. But, like most politically 
generated targets, ambition is no replacement for hard analysis.
Even with the best assumptions, analysts struggled to get it below $5 a kilogram any time soon. And as with all 
projections, they depended on the assumptions. The rise in interest rates and equipment costs have cruelled low-
cost scenarios.
As clean energy advocate Michael Liebreich noted earlier this year, when it came to hydrogen, "expectations have 
raced far ahead of reality".
Page 2 of 2
Hard energy reality has mugged Fortescue's hydrogen dream
While various governments and the IEA were making grandiose predictions about how much clean hydrogen would 
be produced, they bore no relationship to the real world.
The Sixth Hydrogen Ministerial held last September in Japan predicted global production of renewable/low-carbon 
hydrogen by 2030 would be 90 million tonnes.
This would, Liebreich pointed out, require 60 times more clean hydrogen production than what's already been 
funded. Even more risibly, he noted an annual demand of 50 million tonnes would have to be created from sectors 
that do not use hydrogen.
In other words, the hydrogen story, at best, is based on wishful thinking. Less charitably, it's based on hype driven 
by subsidy chasing.
And with the increasingly likely return of former president Donald Trump to the White House, the wishful thinking of 
hydrogen advocates will face even further setbacks as the new administration seeks to wind back elements of the 
Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. Hydrogen subsidies are on the list.
This isn't to say green or clean hydrogen has no future, rather its application will be more modest - green metals, 
some transport and fertilisers.
Fortescue's about-face reflects the bigger challenge of decarbonising its Pilbara mining operations, for which it still 
claims will be "Real Zero by 2030". Its mines and rail operations annually consume about
700 million litres of diesel.
The push to electrify the Pilbara mines as a way of decarbonising is not straightforward.
Starting with the diesel trucks that carry iron ore, each of these weigh more than 500 tonnes, and carry 300 tonnes 
of ore. Add in trains about 2.8 kilometres in length, all powered by diesel locomotives, there are clear challenges of 
cost-effectively electrifying what is a global logistical operation that operates 24/7.
Doing so requires more than just the rollout of renewable energy. Realistically, the push to achieve net zero in the 
mines requires step changes in technology and its commercial deployment, all of which will take time.
Further, it highlights the need for a more realistic approach to the challenges of decarbonisation.
Whether activists and some policymakers want to hear it, the world is not moving off fossil fuels any time soon. Last 
year saw record demand for oil, coal and gas. This is not about to change.
The real world of energy where demand is only rising, with affordability and reliability the key criteria, is only going 
to make it harder for those companies that have overpromised.
And although Fortescue has taken the hard decision to moderate its decarbonisation ambitions and in the process 
lay off 700 people, it's an open question as to who else will follow suit. There is no shortage of companies that have 
made tough-to-meet commitments that look increasingly unrealistic.

Energy Minister Chis Bowen was remarkably sanguine last week about the implosion of Andrew Forrest's plan to 
produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030.
At lunchtime on Wednesday, Bowen told the National Press Club the green hydrogen transition was progressing "at 
pace", putting Australia on track to become a renewable energy superpower by the end of the decade. Less than 
three hours later, Forrest's Fortescue Metals told investors it was kicking its target down the road from 2030 to a 
destination one stop short of Never Never Land. In the meantime, Fortescue will concentrate on what it does best: 
digging stuff out of the ground instead of building castles in the air.
"Reports of the death of green hydrogen have been greatly exaggerated," said Bowen. Fortescue may have "de-
prioritised" green hydrogen, but $200bn of investment was "in the pipeline". That's renewable energy speak for "the 
cheque is in the mail".
A Boston Consulting survey, published last September, found that 824 green hydrogen projects with a theoretical 
capacity of 21 million tonnes a year were in the pipeline in North America and Europe. But only 2 per cent of the 
announced capacity reached the planning stage, and just 0.2 per cent were completed.
Global energy companies are rethinking the wisdom of pumping billions of dollars of capital into an unproven 
technology with uncertain timing and no guaranteed rate of return. Statkraft, the Norwegian hydro-electricity giant, 
rolled back its plans last month. "We have definitely underestimated the challenges," a company spokesman said. 
"Developing green hydrogen has become much more expensive than we expected." Earlier this year, French 
energy giant Engie dropped plans to build a green hydrogen plant in Portugal. Only this month, the European Court 
of Auditors criticised the European Union's 2030 green hydrogen production target of 10 million tonnes as 
"overambitious", saying it was unlikely to be met and, therefore, shouldn't be included in carbon reduction 
calculations.
It's been less than three years since Forrest boasted about spending $1bn to build the world's largest green 
hydrogen electrolyser manufacturing plant in Gladstone, Queensland.

Forrest explained his plans to convert the Gibson Island ammonia factory in Brisbane to run on green hydrogen. He 
also committed to building the world's first green hydrogen import and export facility at Port Kembla, linked to a 
power station fired by "the miracle molecule â€¦. clean as the day is long â€¦ crystal clean, green hydrogen made 
right here at home".
Much nonsense has been spoken at the National Press Club over the years, but seldom have journalists been 
taken on a flight of fancy quite as crazy as the one piloted by Forrest back in October 2021. "To make green 
hydrogen, you simply split water," he said. "Any old water â€¦ It can be wastewater, desalinated water, sea water 
into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity only.
"It's like a miracle molecule, the Swiss Army knife of energy and green products, versatile and able to decarbonise 
even the most challenging sectors, like, say, iron ore, cement, steel, iron fertilisers, aeroplanes, trucks, trains, cars." 
We now know all this was pure fantasy. The multibillion-dollar projects he promised were technologically unproven 
and economically unfeasible. There was barely a dollar of committed finance behind them and only the flimsiest of 
business cases.
We shouldn't be surprised. Hydrogen has been breaking hearts since 1766, when Henry Cavendish described the 
production of "inflammable air" by reacting zinc metal with hydrochloric acid. Try as they might, technologists have 
never overcome hydrogen's fatal flaw: whatever hydrogen is asked to do, another technology will do it better, safer 
and cheaper.
Forrest's 2021 expectations about the cost of green hydrogen were somewhat wide of the mark. The cost had 
halved, he claimed, because "unlike fossil fuels, green hydrogen was becoming cheaper and would never run out".
Last week he told Nine Radio in Perth: "We just have to work out now how to produce it cheaply enough." The 
collapse of the green hydrogen bubble is a double blow for Bowen.
Green hydrogen manufacturing and the proposed Sun Cable solar development were supposed to provide the 
portable energy that would turn Australia into a renewable energy export power by the end of the decade. Neither 
project is going to happen, certainly not by 2030. The collapse of the business case for green hydrogen puts the lie 
to Bowen's claim that renewable energy is cheap.
Hours before the Fortescue announcement, he was repeating his trite line at the National Press Club. Yet even 
Bowen's cheer squad now doubts the claim, if it is not ready to abandon all of the hopes for a renewable future. 
Green hydrogen still had a great future, an opinion article in Renew Economy claimed. It's just there was "limited 
access to the large amounts of low-cost renewable energy". Quite.
Many of us have been making that point for some time. The lesson for Bowen from the green hydrogen debacle is 
that he should stop clogging his diary with carpet-bagging time-wasters and stick with the technology that actually 
exists. Bowen will never get back the hours he's spent listening to the green hydrogen salesmen peddling miracle 
cures for the planet, just as taxpayers are unlikely to see a return on the billions of dollars of poorly scoped 
subsidies pushed their way.
Yet Bowen is part of a government that believes it understands capital allocation better than the markets. Its 
Treasurer has fallen for the neo-Marxist fantasy of values-based capitalism and the delusion that innovation should 
be driven by the state.
It has a Finance Minister who lacks the wisdom to ask tough questions and a Prime Minister content to leave the 
details to others. Labor will respond to Fortescue's misadventures by throwing more money into its Hydrogen 
Headstart program and associated corporate welfare schemes designed to bridge the gap between the cost of 
manufacturing green hydrogen and the amount customers are willing to pay.
Australia will be caught up in the global sugar war, competing with governments in Europe and North America to 
pile more sugar on the table. However, it will not have the advantage of cheap energy enjoyed by countries blessed 
with abundant hydro-electricity or in which nuclear power is legal.Page 3 of 3

Highlight: Fortescue is about to turn 21, and with age seemingly comes wisdom, as the company puts its 
enormously expensive green hydrogen plans on the backburner.
Body
Andrew Forrest's corporate baby, Fortescue, turns 21 on Thursday. So it seems fitting that the mining billionaire 
and climate change evangelist appears to have taken stock of what's economically and technologically achievable 
in his trailblazing quest to green the planet.
It's a reality check for Forrest and Fortescue, who have perhaps realised that chasing some dreams doesn't make 
sense, and wild ambition more often than not needs to be tempered with some common sense.
While Fortescue is not giving up on its green aspirations, there is clearly a pivot to realism on how it can get there. 
It is looking to move downstream to more conventional green electricity projects - wind and solar. The hundreds of 
billions that investors around the world (including Forrest) have already ploughed into these renewables are a 
testament to the fact that they stack up economically.
But what about green hydrogen, produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using renewable electricity? 
Has Forrest raised the white flag on the technology? Not yet, and maybe never.
The new strategy will lead to a number of green hydrogen projects being "deprioritised", Forrest told this masthead 
on Wednesday, but Fortescue will still hold on to a few.
The way Forrest explained it, Fortescue is "pivoting downstream along the conveyor belt", and when green 
electricity becomes cheap and abundant enough, Fortescue can go back to fuelling Forrest's "green hydrogen 
objectives".
Making green hydrogen, which requires enormous amounts of energy, is expensive using today's technology, which 
is why Fortescue has decided to take a breather and support more established renewable technology.
Costs and reassessments aside, Forrest is also seemingly facing the looming challenge of dealing with the fallout 
from the likely return of Donald Trump to the White House.
Trump's not exactly a climate crusader, but Forrest seems unperturbed.
"What I know about President Biden and Trump is that they will turn on a dime. Both Trump and his nominated vice 
president, J.D. Vance, will act in the best interests of America or get tossed out of government," Forrest said.

"Trump always wants to clear the swamp, [and to do that] he would want to reduce the high-cost structure of the 
swamp, which is the fossil fuel sector."

Meanwhile, the move to reposition Fortescue's green investment will certainly find favour with the miner's 
investors, who have enjoyed some $49 billion in dividends and capital appreciation since the company was listed.
While Forrest still has plenty of shareholders who back his mission, concerns had been raised about the large 
number of green projects Fortescue was investigating and the amount of money (generated from iron ore) that was 
needed to pursue them.
Fortescue said on Wednesday that the repositioning of its priorities would lead to 700 staff, or about 5 per cent of 
the company's workforce, being retrenched. The cuts are part of a broader plan to further consolidate the two arms 
of the company - its renewable energy arm and its iron ore division - into a single operating entity.
Each division will retain its current chief executive, but the next level of executives will be shared across both pillars.
The company's chief legal counsel, Phil McKeiver, who had been running a corporate espionage claim by 
Fortescue against three ex-employees in court, will no longer retain a dual role as company secretary. 
(Fortescue's legal team has been accused of using private investigators to follow three former executives and their 
families. The company accused the men of copying and taking intellectual property when they left to start a rival 
green iron project called Element Zero.)
"People in senior management make the decisions they do, and we don't always agree with them," Forrest said.
"No board member knew about the private investigator and a very enthusiastic group general counsel and company 
secretary wanted to demonstrate that you cannot steal technology and then eliminate that technology that the 
company produced on the way out. That's like Hitler ripping up the bridges retreating out of Poland.
"You can be assured that the temperature turned a little warmer around that gentleman's desk. He took it upon 
himself to tender his resignation (as legal counsel)," Forrest added.
That offer was rejected by Fortescue, with McKeiver staying on as general counsel.

Body
It was in May last year that Chris Ellison, the billionaire founder of Mineral Resources, made a bold and unhelpful 
declaration - that hybrid-work arrangements (working from home) had no place at the mining company.
"If you want to work from home, you don't work here," Ellison sniped. This clumsy, boneheaded remark, uttered in 
the midst of a cultural audit at the company, is typical of a proud oaf like Ellison. He wouldn't have the slightest clue 
that it's the women of MinRes, far more than the men, who rely so heavily on flexible working arrangements - and 
it's women, strangely, who he's still so eager to attract to his workforce.
MinRes has had a longstanding problem with women. Its most senior have departed and its leadership team is 
stacked with Chris's and Marks and Mikes and Darrens.
There are six chief executives in the upper levels of the executive, allmen. There's not even a pretence of diversity, 
a feat in itself. The place is a giant, heaving man-cave, a boys club stinking of chauvinism and Lynx Africa.
One of the most senior women to work with Ellison was lawyer Bronwyn Grieve. She arrived in August 2022 as 
chief people officer and had been tasked with revamping culture at the mining company. In other words, it was her 
job to make the place more amenable - or just slightly less repellent - to women. Blocked at every turn, she quit 
within a year.
So did executive general manager Shelley Robertson, who quit MinRes in March 2023. Grieve and Robertson have 
since ended up at Fortescue, as Margin Call has learned, both now occupying seats on Andrew Forrest's 
executive. Robertson was promoted this month to chief operating officer and Grieve is Fortescue's global 
sustainability and external affairs lead.
Not to mention the profusion of women elsewhere at MinRes who have walked out over some shabby treatment. 
Tania Champion, MinRes's principal tenement adviser, started at Fortescue two months ago as the principal of 
approval planning. Courtney Kelley, MinRes's in-house counsel, ended her two years at the company at the same 
time, according to LinkedIn.

MinRes's best bail to Fortescue
Meanwhile, Ellison, a year on from his outright dismissal of flexible work, is back to making more bold 
pronouncements - this time about his commitment to hiring more women. Here he is at a Macquarie Australia 
conference in May talking about his vision for a "safer work environment" for women.
"I'm building a daycare centre so, ladies, if you want to come and work for me, 20 bucks a day for your kids, we're 
going to be able to accommodate about 140 kids, so all our workforce." This wasn't satire. Nor was the hiring of 
company "ambassador" Julie Bishop to star in a video spruiking the miner as modern and female-friendly.
Oh, if only she knew that the women who get anywhere near the MinRes leadership are out of that place faster than 
a Manhattan rat in a kitchen.
Ellison's problem isn't just hiring women, it's keeping them - and losing the best of them to Fortescue.
Early exit Meanwhile, what to make of Richard Harding's premature exit as CEO of Insurance and Care NSW?
Harding had been booked to leave in October but was quietly desaparecido'd earlier this month, leaving the agency 
and the government flat-footed in finding a replacement.
No change to his LinkedIn, of course; according to that, he hasn't left at all. But he has, and there's been little 
progress identifying a successor.
Part of the problem seems to be a tiff between iCare's chair, John Robertson, and the responsible minister, Sophie 
Cotsis. Their beef centres on control of the appointment process and a broader argument around the agency's 
independence.
The other snag is the board. Once upon a time it was stacked with Liberal Party donors and toadies. Now it's 
Labor's turn to try that on.
Deputy chair Michael Cameron disappeared in November (apparently rissoled for being a Liberal Party member) 
and a month later Unions NSW secretary Mark Morey appeared with a directorship. That's worth at least $100,000, 
and even more if he chairs a subcommittee. Robertson, a former union boss himself, receives $200,000 as chair. 
All of it's easy money for just nine meetings a year.
Nevermind that there's no one on the board with any actual experience in the realm of insurance. The only person 
who comes close is Stuart Farquharson, formerly a CFO at Zurich. He's not on the board but rather acting in 
Harding's role as interim CEO, so he's allowed to sit in the room.
In any case, all this bickering over who gets to run the appointment process is awkward when one considers 
Robertson's position. Cotsis might put up a fight but she knows - or should - that Chris Minns was chief of staff to 
Robbo while he was opposition leader.

Highlight: Mining giant says it will lift spending on its green energy division this year despite setbacks tempering its 
ambitious green hydrogen targets.
Body
Mining giant Fortescue says it will lift spending on green energy technology over the next year and has reaffirmed 
its commitment to developing zero-emissions hydrogen despite scaling back ambitions to produce 15 million tonnes 
of the fuel a year by 2030.
Billionaire Andrew Forrest, Fortescue's founder and executive chairman, has had to hit the brakes on the speed 
and scale of his plans to diversify the world's fourth-largest iron ore miner into a green hydrogen superpower, 
blaming the high cost and the vast amount of renewable energy required to split hydrogen from water.

Perth-based Fortescue last week announced it would slash 700 jobs, put its 2030 hydrogen target on hold and 
merge its green energy and iron ore divisions to reduce duplication and costs.
However, in a briefing on Thursday, Fortescue Energy boss Mark Hutchinson reaffirmed to investors that the 
company was "steadfast" in its commitment to scale up and commercialise green hydrogen - the name for hydrogen 
made using an electrolyser powered by renewable energy to ensure the end product is emissions-free.
Fortescue had initially allocated capital expenditure of $US300 million ($457 million) for its energy division for the 
coming 12 months, but that figure was increased to $US500 million ($763 million) on Thursday. The division's 
operating expenditure would rise from a maximum of $500 million to $700 million, the company said.
"I want to make it really clear: Fortescue is steadfast in our commitment to green hydrogen," Hutchinson said. 
"However, our financial discipline always comes first, and we will never do projects that are not economically 
viable."
Since 2020, Forrest has toured the world promoting the virtues of green hydrogen and seeking to partner with 
governments that have areas suitable for producing the vast amounts of wind, solar or hydropower required.
Green hydrogen is considered a promising future fuel due to its potential to displace fossil fuels and help 
decarbonise industrial processes, such as steel-making, that cannot be simply electrified. However it remains 
Page 2 of 2
Forrest's Fortescue boosts spending to keep green hydrogen dream alive
prohibitively expensive to make and is not yet viable at scale, with most of today's hydrogen still made using fossil 
fuels.
Hutchinson on Thursday said it had become apparent that the ability to source renewable electricity at a cost of 
around $US30 ($45.80) a megawatt-hour was essential for a project to be viable.
In jurisdictions where power was more expensive, he added, Fortescue would invest in plans to build renewable 
energy generators, including in Western Australia and Queensland.
"Where the power costs are not at this level, we will work steadfastly with those economies to help bring down the 
cost of electricity by producing electrons," he said.
Fortescue will initially focus on four key green hydrogen projects in Australia, the United States, Norway and Brazil. 
Further projects in Morocco, Oman, Egypt and Jordan would follow, the company said.
"We totally believe green hydrogen is what the world ultimately needs, that is why we will continue to maintain a 
significant portfolio of projects," Hutchinson said.
The update on Fortescue's green hydrogen strategy came as the company reported record quarterly exports of the 
lucrative steel-making raw material iron ore from its mines in WA.
"It's been an outstanding quarter by the team who rallied together to deliver record iron ore shipments of 53.7 
million tonnes, which was 10 per cent higher than the June quarter last year," Fortescue Metals chief executive 
Dino Otranto said.
"This record result demonstrated the efficiencies gained through our recovery plan following the ore car derailment 
in December 2023."

Fortescue's sweeping restructure goes far beyond removing the duplication of back room functions between its 
energy and mining arms, with a growing number of senior executives set to depart as the company sweeps out 
layers of management.
The cost-cutting comes as the iron ore price dipped below $US100 a tonne this week in the wake of market 
disappointment that a major Chinese Communist Party policy meeting, the third plenum, failed to deliver major 
stimulus packages that might help kickstart the country's ailing construction sector.
Fortescue said last week that it will finalise its restructuring package by the end of the month, with as many as 700 
staff set to depart.
That process is still ongoing, the company said on Wednesday, and some staff initially slated for departure may still 
be offered -alternative roles.
"As we announced last week, as part of our transition to a One Fortescue model we are simplifying and 
streamlining our structure, removing roles from all levels of the organisation, to ensure we are lean, impactful and 
can move quickly to seize opportunities," the company said.
But The Australian understands several senior executives are likely to depart the company, including the director of 
innovation and technology - and formerly head of strategy - John Paul Olivier.
Sources say that Fortescue's boss of its Chichester mining hub, Jay Natesan, is also set to depart the company 
after Fortescue re-established the role of chief operating officer to oversee its mining operations, handing the 
position to former Mineral Resources executive Shelley Robertson.
Also slated to depart, sources say, are global health and safety boss Zara Fisher, and the general manager of the 
company's remote operations centre.

Fortescue looks to shed exec layers
Fortescue said last week the -restructure was largely aimed at ending the duplication of human resources, finance 
and other support roles such as communications between its green energy and mining arms - as well as "the 
simplification of its structure to ensure it remains lean, impactful and agile".
But The Australian understands that that simplification will include sweeping away a large section of its middle 
management, with the company looking to reduce the number of roles at general manager level or above from 
about 130, down to about 40.
Fortescue is set to deliver its -financial year production figures on Thursday, amid widespread expectations the 
company will miss the 192 million-tonne bottom end of its annual production guidance, with consensus expectations 
suggesting the company will only barely break the 190 million-tonne mark.
If realised, the production slip would come as pricing for For-tescue's lower-grade ores comes under greater 
pressure, analysts say, amid expectations the slowdown in the Chinese steel industry will translate into lower iron 
ore pricing.
That has traditionally translated into a widening gap between pricing for higher-grade product and lower-grade ores 
- such as those exported by Fortescue.
Rio Tinto noted in its June quarter production report on Tuesday that signs of a flight to quality had emerged in the 
period, with premiums for lump ore rising and the differential between ore grades pricing widening.
Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest has rejected any suggestion that the restructure represents a backdown on 
the com-pany's strategy of expanding into the delivery of green energy, and Macquarie analysts noted last week 
that Fortescue's share price had broken free of its traditional link to the iron ore price, suggesting that the market 
was valuing its green ambitions at about $4.70 a share.
"Whilst positive for earnings and free-cash flow, we recognise the short-term sugar hit to dividend yields may be 
received well by investors looking to harvest fully franked returns," Macquarie analysts said in a client note.
"However, ETFs seeking hydrogen exposure, or 'long onlys' with strong energy transition mandates may seek to 
reduce -positions on these developments and a slowing of Fortescue's -external green energy business trajectory." 
A sharp iron ore price fall beneath $US100 a tonne would dent Fortescue's returns, but not its -viability. Macquarie 
estimates Fortescue's break even price at about $US40 a tonne - lower than that of BHP at about $US32 and Rio 
at about $US35.
"Fortescue has addressed market downturns in the past with a focus on cost and flexibility. With the recent 
Simandou approval and a higher break-even vs peers, FMG's premium may come under pressure," Macquarie 
analysts said. Fortescue shares closed up 11c on Wednesday at $21.32.

Fortescue's green energy arm will still cost the company more than $1bn in running costs this financial year, 
despite the sweeping cost cuts that will see the company shed about 700 jobs.
Shares in the iron ore major dived more than 5.5 per cent on Thursday after the company missed the bottom end of 
its annual iron ore production guidance, despite shipping a record 53.7 million tonnes of iron ore in the June 
quarter, with the miner's troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project again falling short of expectations.
But despite last week backing away from the most ambitious of its green hydrogen targets, the company said it 
would still spend $US700m ($1.07bn) on running its Fortescue Energy arm, plus another $US500m in capital costs 
as it begins work on its first suite of small green hydrogen production centres.
Fortescue, which is running a redundancy program that will see it shed hundreds of jobs, said on it shipped 191.6 
million tonnes for the full financial year, below the 192 to 197 million tonne guidance.
The company was hit by a train derailment over the Christmas period, and recovered to close on its annual 
guidance target by shipping a far larger proportion of lower grade products - known as super special fines - in the 
June quarter than it would normally sell into the market.
Fortescue shipped 78.1 million tonnes of the product in the full year, up from 68.3 million tonnes in the 20023 
financial year.
The miner also flagged a further potential slippage in exports for the current fiscal period, saying it expected to 
export 190 to 200 million tonnes for the year.
Its traditional dig and ship operations exported 190.4 million tonnes for the year ended June 30, with Iron Bridge 
moving 1.2 million tonnes of concentrate - well below the revised 2 million tonne expectation. The company said 
Iron Bridge shipments were affected by "higher than planned concentrate moisture affecting material handling".
Page 2 of 2
Fortescue shares take a beating
Fortescue said those issues were now largely solved, and it was working towards an alternative solution to the 
long-running water supply issues plaguing Iron Bridge. The company has previously flagged the need to replace a 
length of pipeline to borefields that leaks when placed under high pressure.
The project was now "banking" rainfall and surface water, Fortescue said, an option that "may mitigate" the need to 
replace the high pressure section of the raw water pipeline.
Fortescue now expects Iron Bridge to produce 5-9 million tonnes of concentrate in the current fiscal year, with the 
massive mine expected to hit its full capacity by September next year.
Fortescue mining boss Dino Otranto said the new guidance range reflected shipping constraints at the company's 
operations, and not any expectation output from Fortescue's traditional hematite mines would slip during the year.
"For full year 2025 the bottleneck, as magnetite ramps up, becomes shipping and it does then give us flexibility to 
ramp up and down hematite and magnetite in that portfolio based on market conditions," Mr Otranto told analysts 
on Thursday.
The company's realised price for its iron ore also slipped in the quarter, as the disparity between higher and lower 
grade ores widened. Fortescue said it realised an average $US92.12 a tonne, or about 82 per cent of the 
benchmark index for iron ore grading 62 per cent iron.
In the March quarter, Fortescue sales averaged $US104.48 a tonne, or 85 per cent of the benchmark price. It 
received an average $US103.01 a tonne for the full year.
Fortescue said its cash costs averaged $US18.53 a tonne for the quarter, down slightly, and $US18.24 a tonne for 
the full year.
The mining major is flagging cost increases in the current year, however, with costs expected to run between 
$US18.50 and $US19.75 a wet tonne.
But despite the cost-cutting and restructuring at Fortescue, partly aimed at ending the duplication of support 
functions between its iron ore and energy arms, the company will accelerate spending on its green energy projects.
Fortescue chief financial officer Apple Paget told analysts about a third of the planned $US500m capital spending 
on energy projects would go to the already approved green energy projects in the US, Queensland and Western 
Australia, with another third allocated to Fortescue Zero - formerly known as WAE Technologies - which is looking 
to build hi-tech manufacturing centres in the US and the UK.
About 60 per cent of Fortescue Energy's $US700m operating spend would support the development of new green 
energy projects - including feasibility studies on green hydrogen projects in Norway and Brazil - with the rest 
allocated to Fortescue Zero, she said. Fortescue shares closed down $1.18, or 5.5 per cent, at $20.14.

Fortescue has quietly taken ownership of two Queensland wind farm projects previously owned by private 
companies controlled by its biggest shareholders, Andrew and Nicola Forrest.
The Prairie and Wongalee wind projects near the Queensland town of Hughenden are now owned by Fortescue 
rather than subsidiaries of the Forrest family's privately owned Squadron Energy, according to documents filed to 
the Australian Securities and Investments Commission.
Dr Forrest, Fortescue's executive chairman, said last week that the iron ore miner would slow its push into green 
hydrogen and would instead focus on generating renewable energy. Fortescue executives presented the 
company's quarterly production report to investors yesterday.
The Forrest family owns 36.74 per cent of Fortescue, which has pivoted to clean energy in the past five years.
Squadron bought 75 per cent of wind power developer Windlab in 2020, under a deal that meant Federation Asset 
Management owned the remaining 25 per cent. Windlab has been developing wind farms, including the 
undeveloped Prairie and Wongalee wind projects in Queensland.
A Windlab subsidiary - Wongalee Renewable Energy Farm - applied to federal environment regulators last year for 
permission to install 175 wind turbine generators across 48,000 hectares of land near Hughenden.
Windlab's shareholding in the Wongalee subsidiary was transferred to Australian Fortescue Future Industries on 
February 23 - the day after Fortescue's half-year financial results were released. Fortescue has not mentioned the 
acquisition of the Wongalee project in any market filings.
Ownership of the Prairie wind farm has followed a similar path.
A Windlab subsidiary - Prairie Renewable Energy Farm - applied to regulators in 2022 for permission to build 116 
wind turbines near Hughenden. But documents lodged with the corporate regulator show that, on February 23, 
Windlab's ownership of the subsidiary was transferred to Australian Fortescue Future Industries.
Page 2 of 2
Forrests' wind farms sold to Fortescue after blow to hydrogen plan
The closest Fortescue has come to disclosing its connection to the Prairie and Wongalee projects was in 
November 2022, when the company issued a press release - but not a market filing - that said Fortescue would 
"partner" with Windlab on a renewables "super hub" that included the two projects.
That statement did not say that Fortescue would take ownership of the two wind farms, or whether the company 
would help fund construction.
The Wongalee and Prairie wind projects have not been mentioned in Fortescue's annual report, financial results or 
capital spending schedules in the 20 months since the November 2022 press release.
Asked about the wind farms yesterday, Fortescue energy boss Mark Hutchinson said the company had originally 
thought they could supply clean energy to its proposed green hydrogen projects in Queensland.
Fortescue will not build any large-scale green hydrogen projects in Queensland any time soon and its small 
hydrogen project at Gladstone will purchase power from the grid.
Mr Hutchinson said the wind farms could be "repurposed" to supply power into the national electricity grid, but that 
would probably require the Queensland government to build the CopperString electricity transmission project 
between Townsville and Mt Isa.
Mr Hutchinson said Fortescue would not incur any significant spending on Wongalee nor Prairie "for a few years" 
at least.
ASIC filings suggest Australian Fortescue Future Industries acquired Wongalee and Prairie for an initial 
peppercorn price of $1 each. It is understood the agreement between Windlab and Fortescue would see further 
payments made to Windlab if certain construction and energy generation milestones are achieved.
Windlab has said construction on the wind farms could begin as soon as 2025, with first power as early as 2027. 
However, Mr Hutchinson hosed down those expectations, saying yesterday that it was "very early days".

Fortescue says the cost of mining iron ore in Western Australia could rise by almost 10 per cent in the next year, a 
sign the resources industry's inflation woes are not over.
The prediction for higher unit costs comes as the miner cuts 700 jobs in a bid to reduce duplication across its white-
collar workforce and aims to increase sales volumes.
Fortescue told investors that it was likely to lift export volumes above the 191.6 million tonnes shipped in the 
previous financial year, and wanted to export between 190 million and 200 million tonnes in the next 12 months.
Higher sales volumes shrink unit costs, but Fortescue said the unit costs in WA's Pilbara iron ore district would rise 
by between 1 per cent and 9 per cent in the next 12 months, despite the likely increase in sales volumes.
Fortescue's unit costs rose 4 per cent over the past year; it now costs the company 48 per cent more to dig up iron 
ore than it did in 2018. Further cost pressures are expected; the amount of waste rock Fortescue digs up to access 
saleable iron ore - known as the "strip ratio" - is expected to be higher over the next four years.
Fortescue mining boss Dino Otranto said the need to move more waste rock was a factor driving costs higher. 
"Strip ratios are increasing over the mid term," he told investors yesterday.
Resources companies are also being hit with requests for higher wages and escalating energy costs.
Asked about the job cuts, Mr Otranto said Fortescue had "always maintained the leanest structure possible to 
make sure we are competitive and the leading [unit cost] player in the market".
Fortescue chief financial officer Apple Paget said the miner would also use technology and innovation to mitigate 
rising costs at the mines. Further adoption of autonomous haulage shapes as one way Fortescue might be able to 
lower costs. The company is considering whether to purchase construction machine manufacturer Liebherr's 
autonomous vehicles.

Fortescue's budgeted spending on fleet replacement and decarbonisation of its mines in the year ahead was also 
higher than analysts had expected. UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw described the guidance as "in-line to soft".
Fortescue's cost woes come after Whitehaven Coal managing director Paul Flynn warned last week that 
inflationary pressures remained "rife" despite rising unemployment.
Several coal miners have reported a doubling of unit costs since 2016.
Fortescue shipped 191.2 million tonnes of iron ore in the 12 months to June 30; the first time in five years it has 
reported a sequential decline in export volumes. It shipped 192 million tonnes in the previous financial year.
The decline in volumes was caused by the derailment of an ore car in December. Fortescue tried to make up for 
that outage with a fast finish to the financial year; the export rate over the past three months was higher than ever.
Analyst consensus, measured by Bloomberg, suggests Fortescue is on track to post a $US6.11 billion ($9.3 billion) 
underlying profit next month, up from $US5.5 billion last year.
The promise to ship up to 200 million tonnes in the next year includes a target for the struggling Iron Bridge 
magnetite project in WA of between 5 million and 9 million tonnes. It has fallen short of earlier targets.
Fortescue shares fell $1.18, or 5.5 per cent, yesterday to close at $20.14.

Fortescue's dividend could come under pressure as the company ramps up spending on its green energy projects, 
analysts say, despite the wave of redundancies flagged by the company.
Fortescue said in its quarterly production report on Thursday that it still intended to spend $US1.2bn ($1.83bn) on 
its green energy arm in the current financial year, including operating and capital costs.
The company has a policy of paying out 50 to 80 per cent of its net profits in dividends, delivering a river of cash to 
shareholders as the iron ore price held up in recent years, with Andrew and Nicola Forrest's family interests the 
biggest beneficiary.
But Fortescue flagged an increase in spending on its green hydrogen and energy ambitions this financial year, 
despite the company's decision last week to shed about 700 jobs as it looks to cut costs and reduce duplication of 
back-end functions in its energy and mining arms.
Fortescue is also forecasting capital spending of $US3.2bn to $US3.8bn in its iron ore operations - including 
$US700m to $US900m on decarbonisation spending - and this week said cash production costs could run close to 
$US20 a tonne this financial year, with the company giving a guidance range of $US18.50 to $US19.75 a tonne.
Combined with widening discounts for lower-grade iron ore exports, the spending could put the company's dividend 
policy under pressure, analysts say, with Macquarie suggesting Fortescue may have to extend its borrowing to 
maintain dividend payouts.
"Whilst management spoke of a lean focus and 700 jobs were cut across the business, under our price forecasts 
Fortescue's minimum 50 per cent payout ratio comes under pressure. To sustain the dividend policy, we believe 
FMG may need to increase gearing," Macquarie said in a client note on Friday.
Goldman Sachs analyst Paul Young noted the company's capital spending was increasing to maintain production at 
some of its older mines, and it may need to ramp up spending again if new green hydrogen projects in Norway and 
Brazil - now going through feasibility studies - are given the green light by the company's board.

Fortescue's green expenditure could put pressure on dividends
"We continue to think Fortescue is at an inflection point on capital allocation, and to fund the ambitious strategy, we 
assume the company reduces the dividend payout ratio from the current 65 per cent in the second half of FY24 to 
about 50 per cent from FY25 onwards - the bottom end of the 50 to 80 per cent guidance," he said.
Fortescue narrowly missed its annual export targets, shipping 191.6 million tonnes for the year, below the bottom 
end of its 192 to 197 million tonne guidance range.
But after Fortescue's troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project again missed expected export rates, the company only 
came close to its overall export target after shipping far higher quantities of a lower-grade product known as super 
special fines, which made up more than half of its record June quarter exports.
The iron ore major says it expects Iron Bridge to ramp up production rates of 5 to 9 million tonnes this financial 
year, after shipments of only 1.2 million -tonnes in the year ending June 30.
But Fortescue has also wi-dened its overall export guidance target, flagging shipments of 190 to 200 million 
tonnes.
That suggests shipments from some of its hematite mines could taper off this year, according to Morgans analyst 
Adrian Prendergast. "Management denied this view, commenting that changes in FY25 will only be minor, but the 
facts are hard to dismiss," he said.
"The lack of commentary makes it hard to identify the drivers of the change, but it is clear that FMG has been 
pushing some of its ageing mines hard with strip ratios rising and the need for increased mine replacement 
invariably -increasing." While Mr Prendergast said he still expects Fortescue to maintain dividend yields above 
those of its competitors, softening iron ore prices could put pressure on shareholder payouts. "Fortescue maintains 
a healthy balance sheet, but its capex-heavy mine replacement, decarbonisation, and sustainability investments are 
placing an increasing load on its base iron ore business in terms of capital requirements," he said. Fortescue 
shares closed up 21c at $20.35 on Friday.

An "undisclosed" vendor was offloading $1.9bn worth of shares in the Andrew Forrest-backed Fortescue Metals on 
Monday night in a trade handled by JPMorgan, extending the sell-off in the company since it stepped back from its 
green energy -strategy.
The Australian understands the block was put on the market by an institutional investor offloading its position, with 
fingers pointing to The Capital Group after JPMorgan last month worked on a $1.1bn selldown for the group with 
that deal priced at a 6 per cent discount to Fortescue's last closing price.
The understanding is that the price was being described as "a clean-up trade" for the seller.
Shares on Monday night were being offered at a price range of between $18.55 and $19.10 a share - well below 
Fortescue's Monday closing price, with bids being accepted in 5c increments. The book at the bottom of the range 
was covered on Monday night.
The price equates to a discount of between 8.8 per cent and 6.1 per cent to the last traded share price of $20.35.
On offer was about 100 million securities, or about 3.2 per cent of the shares on issue and equalled about $1.9bn in 
value.
The book build was due to close at 8pm AEST for Australian and Asia investors. Dr Forrest, the billionaire 
Fortescue Metals founder, owns about 36.7 per cent of Fortescue Metals, which has a $63bn market value.
Fortescue shares are now down almost 10 per cent since the company announced a major restructure on July 17, 
which will see about 700 staff depart the company in a mass wave on redundancies, as Fortescue signalled a 
backdown from the most aggressive of its green hydrogen and ammonia targets - including a plan to be producing 
15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030.
Macquarie analysts noted last week that Fortescue's slowdown on its green energy ambitions could lead to a 
selldown by ESG-minded funds, saying that - despite widespread criticism of the lack of financial details of the 
company's strategy - it had helped Fortescue break free of its traditional link to iron ore prices.

"ETFs seeking hydrogen exposure, or 'long onlys' with strong energy transition mandates may seek to reduce -
positions on these developments and a slowing of Fortescue's -external green energy business trajectory," 
Macquarie analysts said in a client note.
Macquarie said Fortescue's green energy strategy could be worth as much as $4.70 a share.
But the iron ore major also delivered a disappointing June quarter report last week with the company falling short of 
its annual export guidance for the year, -despite record shipments in the June period.
While the export miss was relatively minor, analysts also noted that Fortescue's spending on its green projects was 
actually projected to rise for the current financial year, despite the company's announcement that it planned to cut 
jobs and costs and reshape its green strategy towards green iron production and renewable energy infrastructure.
Overseeing the block trade on Monday was JPMorgan's Jonas Troeber, who has been made the sole head of 
equity capital markets for JPMorgan in Australia.
It comes after his ECM co-head, Simone Haslinger, has opted to leave the bank following a period of parental 
leave.
Other changes include Sunil Dhupelia and Peihao Huang, currently co-heads of Asia ex-Japan ECM, becoming co-
heads of ECM for Asia Pacific. Fortescue shares have tumbled almost 30 per cent since the start of January.

  The local share market has finished in the red, but its sharp morning losses mostly moderated in the afternoon - 
although Fortescue wasn't so fortunate, plunging after a massive block trade.
   The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index finished Tuesday 36.4 points lower at 7,953.2, a loss of 0.46 per cent, while 
the broader All Ordinaries closed down 47.7 points, or 0.58 per cent, to 8,176.6.
   The ASX200 began the day by plunging 95.3 points, or 1.19 per cent, in the first minutes of trading, but rose most 
of the afternoon to claw back the bulk of those losses.
   Fortescue's shock double-digit drop accounted for half the day's losses at the close.
   The iron ore giant founded by billionaire businessman Andrew Forrest fell 10.2 per cent to a 20-month low of 
$18.28 after an institutional investor believed to be US-based Capital Group unloaded $1.9 billion in shares.
   There were no major data releases overnight. That will come later, with a key Australian second-quarter inflation 
report due on Wednesday seen as pivotal in determining if the Reserve Bank raises interest rates next week.
   That inflation readout on Wednesday morning will be followed by decisions on interest rates by central banks in 
the US, Japan and the United Kingdom, with US tech goliaths Microsoft, Meta, Apple and Amazon also reporting 
earnings this week.
   Credit Corp kicked off Australian earnings season on Tuesday, with its shares rising 14 per cent to a nearly four-
month high of $17.32 after the debt buyer announced its full-year net profit was down 11 per cent to $81.2 million 
and forecast a $90 million to $100 million profit for 2024/25.
   The surge may have been a relief rally.
   "The stock has been very weak going into the result. We think investor expectations were already very low," E&P 
Capital analyst Olivier Coulon wrote in a note.
   Eight of the ASX's 11 sectors lost ground, consumer staples were basically flat and the consumer discretionary 
and financial sectors both edged 0.2 per cent higher.

   Mining was the biggest loser, dropping 1.9 per cent on the back of Fortescue's plunge. Elsewhere in the sector, 
BHP fell 1.3 per cent to $41.54, Rio Tinto retreated 1.0 per cent to $114.66 and goldminer Northern Star slipped 0.6 
per cent to $13.88.
   The big retail banks finished mixed, with CBA gaining 0.8 per cent to $135.95 and Westpac adding 0.3 per cent to 
$29.08, while NAB was basically flat at $37.92 and ANZ slid 1.0 per cent to a two-month low of $28.52.
   Woolworths dropped 0.2 per cent to $34.38 after the group announced Natalie Davis, its managing director for 
supermarkets, is leaving to become the chief executive of Ramsay Health Care.
   She will replace Craig McNally, who will retire in June 2025 after eight years on the job.
   Shares in the private hospital operator dropped 4.3 per cent to $44.93.
   In the tech sector, Appen ripped 55.8 per cent higher to a more than three-month high of 67c after the AI dataset 
company announced its revenue growth in the June quarter had largely offset the loss of a major contract with 
Google.
   Energy Resources of Australia plunged 42.9 per cent to an all-time low of 2c after advising it expects to spend 
$1.1 billion through the end of 2027 rehabilitating its shuttered Ranger uranium mine in the NT.
   The Australian dollar was buying 65.61 US cents, from 65.56 US cents at Monday's ASX close.

While the ASX has trimmed early losses, it will finish the day in the red.
The S&P/ASX200 dropped 39.40 points or 0.49% to 7,950.20. The index has lost 0.26% for the last five days, but 
sits 1.65% below its 52-week high.
Bottom-performing stocks in this index are Fortescue Ltd (ASX:FMG) and Arcadium Lithium Plc, down 
9.88% and 5.87% respectively. 
Looking at the sectors, Consumer Discretionary was in the green today gaining 0.15%. Consumer Staples gained 
0.11%.
The worst-performed sector was Materials down 1.93%. Energy which lost 0.71%.
Over in small caps, the S&P/ASX Small Ordinaries dropped 0.63% to 3,002.90. Over the past five days, it is 1.07% 
lower.
Fortescue shares plunge
Fortescue took a hammering today as major institutional investors exit the stock, with a major $1.85 billion block 
trade occurring at $18.55 per share. The company lost $5 billion in market capitalisation. Over the past six months, 
the stock has decreased by 37%.

The Financial Review indicated that fund managers were searching for buyers in the range of $18.55 to $19.10 per 
share, reflecting an 8.8% to 6.1% discount compared to Monday's closing price.
Fortescue is currently grappling with various issues, including lower-than-expected guidance, increased capital 
expenditures and potential pressure on its dividend policy due to weaker earnings forecasts.
Analysts are pessimistic about the stock, expecting its valuation premium over BHP and Rio Tinto to diminish. They 
also highlight ongoing execution risks and concerns over low-grade iron ore.
Impact of US earnings season
Saira Malik, chief investment officer of Nuveen, has shared her perspectives on the impact of the US earnings 
season on markets and portfolio strategies for investors seeking solid fundamentals and exposure to major themes 
and trends.
Malik highlights the ongoing volatility in the US political and economic landscape, which may steady slightly as Vice 
President Kamala Harris has secured the Democratic presidential nomination and is now selecting potential running 
mates.
The second quarter earnings results have been mixed, with Tesla and Alphabet underperforming, signalling that the 
benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) may already be factored into technology stocks. Additionally, there is ongoing 
debate over whether the recent shift from momentum and growth stocks to small caps will continue.
In terms of portfolio considerations, Malik suggests that publicly listed global infrastructure is a valuable asset class, 
particularly given the potential for increased market volatility in the second half of 2024. Infrastructure offers solid 
fundamentals and an opportunity to engage with significant themes such as the growth of generative AI and the 
trend towards onshoring and nearshoring manufacturing operations.
Investing in data centres and electric power-generating developers is crucial to support the growing demand for 
generative AI, requiring significant investment in new power-generating capacities globally, especially favouring 
renewable technologies.
Electric distribution utilities are expected to benefit from an expanding customer base, spreading fixed costs over 
more users, which allows for further investment and reduced costs for end-users. Utilities also trade at a 
considerable discount to the S&P 500 Index, offering additional investment opportunities.

  A renewable resource startup accused of stealing trade secrets from mining giant Fortescue is fighting back after 
reams of material was seized from its offices and the homes of two directors.
   The Perth-based firm Element Zero and directors Bartlomiej Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn Winther-Jensen and Michael 
Masterman are facing Federal Court proceedings over the alleged intellectual property breach.
   Fortescue - owned by billionaire Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest - says Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen both 
worked on developing green-iron technology while at the iron ore-mining giant.
   The process was aimed at allowing iron ore to be processed without carbon emissions.
   After the pair resigned in late 2021, they collaborated with Fortescue's former chief financial officer Mr 
Masterman in creating Element Zero.
   He is now Element Zero's chief executive.
   A media report about the startup prompted an investigation by Fortescue, during which the firm hired experts to 
examine Dr Kolodziejczyk's work laptop.
   Private investigator Robert Lancaster was also retained to follow both Element Zero directors from their homes to 
Perth Airport and elsewhere, including the gym and shopping centres.
   While the Federal Court case was filed in April, the proceedings were suppressed until June.
   Weeks earlier, the Element Zero directors' homes had been scoured for relevant material.
   But that seizure is under attack, with Element Zero and the three directors seeking to either overturn or amend the 
orders, limiting the material that Fortescue can view.
   The move was revealed in court documents released on Tuesday.
   Fortescue neglected to tell the court key information about its connection with Element Zero or the directors in 
applying for the orders, their court documents claim.

   More than three terabytes of material had been taken by an order that allowed the indiscriminate capture of "an 
unduly extensive volume and scope of material", Element Zero's lawyer Michael John Williams wrote.
   "The apparent extraordinary invasion of the privacy of the respondents (is) of a kind which exceeds what is 
usually contemplated in proceedings such as these," he said in an affidavit.
   In the lawsuit, Element Zero and the directors have been accused of breach of contract, copyright infringement, 
breach of corporations and consumer law, and breach of their fiduciary duties.
   Fortescue alleges Dr Kolodziejczyk used a USB drive to transfer confidential material and deleted a folder on his 
computer to hide his tracks prior to departing the firm.
   Dr Winther-Jensen is accused of sending company documents to his personal email address in the days after he 
resigned.
   Certain documents regarding Fortescue's green-iron technology were also missing, presumed to have been 
taken by the two directors, the company alleges.
   Fortescue is seeking damages or compensation, which could include any profits gained by Element Zero from 
the allegedly stolen invention.
   Mr Masterman denied the allegations in a statement filed on Element Zero's behalf in June, saying the startup 
had developed its green-metals technology independently.
   The case will next come before the court on August 1, when parties will seek certain further suppression orders.

JPMorgan's equity capital markets team was looking for buyers for $1.9 billion of discounted Fortescue stock after 
yesterday's closing bell on behalf of an undisclosed institutional investor.
Fund managers were told to bid in 5¢ increments, from an $18.55 floor up to a maximum of $19.10 per Fortescue 
share. It represented an 8.8 per cent to 6.1 per cent discount to the last close - and was worth 3.2 per cent of the 
$62.6 billion company.
The book was due to shut at 8pm for Asia Pacific investors, and 1am for rest of the world. JPMorgan was the sole 
bookrunner, and had underwritten the trade at the floor price.
Fingers were pointing at The Capital Group, which on June 14 sold $1.1 billion of Fortescue stock, also via 
JPMorgan. That trade was done at $21.60 a share or a 6 per cent discount to the last traded price.
Yesterday's term sheet said the seller - who wasn't identified - had vouched to lock up their remaining shareholding 
for 45 days. Should the seller be The Capital Group as expected, it would go down to owning about 3.42 per cent of 
Fortescue.
Block trades this size are few and far between, but suggest institutional investors are tiring of Andrew Forrest's 
Fortescue, which seems to be battling major C-suite issues, at the same time as iron ore prices slump, costs rise, 
and its hydrogen ambitions prove unrealistic.
Fortescue shipped 191.2 million tonnes of Australian iron ore in the 12 months to June 30; the first time in five 
years the company has reported a sequential decline in export volumes, after shipping 192 million tonnes in the 
previous financial year. Last Thursday, it warned of higher costs across its WA iron ore operations. Earlier this 
month, it abandoned a target for Fortescue to produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030. Shares have 
fallen 30.8 per cent year-to-date.

Fortescue could use a new friend. And quickly. The stock dropped like a stone yesterday, taking the benchmark 
S&P/ASX 200 down with it.
Why? Because it lost one of its two big long-term backers; the sort of shareholder that picks and sticks and helps 
someone like Andrew Forrest have the certainty and platform to create a $63 billion miner.
That shareholder was US fund manager Capital Group, a rusted-on Fortescue bull that backed Forrest's growth 
story in the early years and collected its substantial dividends later.
It was a great trade for both sides; Fortescue got a steady and loyal institutional shareholder (not as common as 
you might think), while Capital got a substantial stake in a stunningly strong cash machine. This time last year, 
Capital was Fortescue's third-biggest shareholder with a 7.94 per cent stake.
But managers and their views change, and now Capital is on hard retreat. There have been two block trades worth 
a combined $3 billion in the past six weeks via JPMorgan's equities desk, and they can only have come from 
Capital Group. Fortescue stock was down 10 per cent yesterday, dragging the ASX 200 down with it.
What sparked it? We're told it is internal changes at Capital. What matters for Fortescue - and indeed its other 
shareholders now getting washed around in the swell - is where the stock went.
Whoever bought it, it is unlikely that Fortescue has found another Capital Group. Such high-conviction and deep-
pocketed investors are rare; they pretty much do not exist anywhere else.
There are no active managers with substantial stakes at BHP or Rio Tinto, for example, or any of the big four 
banks. Offshore miner Glencore has a good, sticky institutional shareholder with an 8 per cent stake - but once 
again, it is Capital.
So, Fortescue needs to find a way to get a dozen or more smaller institutions - the sort that don't have $5 billion 
tied up in a stock like Capital did at Fortescue this time last year - to invest, or invest more. It needs more 
widespread support than it has had.

Fortescue plunge reveals huge shoes to fill
The steady grind lower in China's bond yields is evidence that investors are betting more rate cuts will be needed to 
stimulate the economy.
Capital did stunningly well on its Fortescue investment. When the investor first disclosed its stake in February 
2015, it had just picked up 67.6 million Fortescue shares at an average $2.34 each.
The stock's now above $18, nearly hit $30 in February, and has paid $11.26 a share in dividends since, which puts 
it in 10-bagger-plus territory.
Fortescue shares yesterday closed at $18.32. The stock traded weakly all day, which suggests some of those 
Capital shares are yet to find a medium-term home. Until they do, it could be a choppy ride.
Capital's big sell orders leave Fortescue holding on to its one long-term backer (two if you count the Forrests' 
Tattarang), China's Hunan Valin Iron and Steel Group, which doubles as a customer.
Hunan Valin bought its initial 260 million shares, still the bulk of its holding, in the 2009 financial year, which means 
its interest predates Capital's. And like Capital, it has also done very well. It paid $US452 million ($645 million) for 
those shares 15 years ago. If it thought about it in Australian dollars, that's an entry price at less than $2.50 a share 
in return for stock now worth more than $18 and having paid $11.71 in dividends. The difference is that it is a 
strategic investor and is yet to head for an exit.
It comes as investors and analysts are still trying to work out what's going on with Fortescue's energy arm. The 
company jettisoned its 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 production target a fortnight ago, although 
management made it pretty clear on last week's quarterly production call that the push was more delayed rather 
than abandoned.

Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has appointed lawyer and Indigenous activist Noel Pearson to the company's board as 
a non-executive director.
The appointment is the culmination of a long relationship between the two men, encompassing support for Mr 
Pearson's educational work in Indigenous communities in far north Queensland to Fortescue's support for 
Indigenous businesses, and some of the causes Dr Forrest has personally championed.
Mr Pearson was one of the prominent guests at Fortescue's 20th anniversary party at a Pilbara mine almost a year 
ago, and Dr Forrest said he had "known and worked alongside" Mr Pearson for almost 20 years and was a long-
term admirer of the Cape York Partnership founder.
"I have known and worked alongside Noel for nearly 20 years and admire and respect him -greatly. Noel is an 
innovative thinker and passionate and for-midable Australian who will bring enormous benefit and insight to our 
board," Dr Forrest said. Mr Pearson was a vocal supporter of Fortescue's "Billion Opportunities" program, launched 
in 2011, which promised to offer $1bn in contracts for companies that were at least 25 per cent owned by 
Indigenous Australians - a figure Fortescue now says has topped $5bn in contracts to more than 190 First Nations 
businesses.
In 2012, Dr Forrest offered $3m in funding to Queensland's Djarragun College, through Mr Pearson's Cape York 
Partnership organisation, which at the time was trying to convince the Queensland government it should be allowed 
to take over the school from the Anglican Church amid allegations of fraud under the school's previous 
management.
A decade ago, Mr Pearson drew public fire from other Indigenous leaders after becoming a prominent supporter of 
the Fortescue founder in his calls for the establishment of cashless welfare cards to reduce alcohol dependency in 
remote indigenous communities. Mr Pearson said in a statement he was honoured to be invited to join the board of 
the company.

"Fortescue is a proud Australian company that is led by its -values from mine site to the boardroom - something I 
have great respect for," he said.
Mr Pearson joins immediately in an expansion to the eight--member Fortescue board, which also includes Dr 
Forrest as -executive chairman, former chief executive Elizabeth Gaines as an executive director, British Olympic 
champion Sebastian Coe and former CSIRO boss Larry Marshall.
Fortescue directors earned fees of at least $230,000 a year in the 2023 financial year, according to the company's 
last annual report, plus additional fees for sitting on boardroom committees. Fortescue shares closed up 12c to 
$18.99 on Thursday.

Respected Indigenous leader Noel Pearson has joined the board of Andrew Forrest's Fortescue, describing the 
iron ore miner as a company with proud Australian values.
The Cape York Partnership founder and prominent campaigner for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
advancement has kept a low profile since the defeat of the Voice to parliament referendum in October.
Dr Forrest said he had deep respect for Mr Pearson, a lawyer and land rights campaigner, and a co-architect of the 
Uluru Statement from the Heart who led the Yes campaign for the Voice. "I have known and worked alongside Noel 
for nearly 20 years and admire and respect him greatly," Dr Forrest said.
"Noel is an innovative thinker and a passionate and formidable Australian who will bring enormous benefit and 
insight to our board.
"Fortescue is fortunate to have a diverse and global board of directors who bring different perspective and ideas, 
ensuring we remain one of Australia's top-performing companies."
Mr Pearson said he looked forward to making a contribution to the "diverse, progressive and successful business". 
"Fortescue is a proud Australian company that is led by its values from mine site to boardroom - something I have 
great respect for," he said in a statement.
Mr Pearson is respected by both sides of federal politics, and has worked closely with prime ministers dating back 
to Paul Keating.
His agenda - which has sometimes put him at odds with progressive figures in Indigenous and national politics - has 
included advocacy on land rights, Indigenous self-determination, boosting employment to cut welfare dependency, 
improving education, parental responsibility and tackling substance abuse.
Mr Pearson withdrew from public view after voters rejected an Indigenous Voice to federal parliament at last year's 
referendum.

Pearson joins Fortescue board
His Fortescue appointment comes as native titleholders, the Yindjibarndi people, are at the pointy end of a 15-year 
legal war with the company over compensation for mining on their land in Western Australia. In 2019, five Federal 
Court judges unanimously backed an earlier ruling by judge Steven Rares that granted exclusive native title over 
2700 square kilometres to the Yindjibarndi, and effectively recognised them as private owners with a spiritual 
connection that allowed them to decide who came onto the land.
But Fortescue has never struck a compensation agreement with the Yindjibarndi people, nor received permission 
from the native title owners to mine their land, despite a decade of mining the steel-making commodity in north-west 
WA. Last month, it abandoned a target for the production of 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 after 
making headlines on the subject for nearly six years.
During this time, Fortescue has experienced high turnover in its executive ranks. The executive in charge of 
Fortescue's fledgling iron ore operations in Gabon, Julie Shuttleworth, left the company in June, adding to the 
growing list of senior executives who have left the company recently.
Green energy division chief financial officer Deborah Caudle quit the company in January after less than five 
months as part of what Fortescue described as a restructuring.
Mr Pearson did not respond to a request for comment.

Highlight: Fortescue's founder Andrew Forrest last month said he had no knowledge of the extensive spying 
conducted on ex-staff and their families, including children.
Body
Fortescue's senior in-house legal counsel directly instructed a private investigator to spy on its former staff, who 
were accused of stealing the mining and green energy group's intellectual property.
Fortescue's founder Andrew Forrest last month said he had no knowledge of the extensive spying conducted on 
ex-staff and their families, including children, and was "surprised to learn of the investigations".
The billionaire, who is the world's 86th wealthiest person according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, said he was 
advised by Fortescue's legal team that the spying was "necessary in order to be granted search orders from the 
Federal Court," in its case. Forrest's wealth is estimated at $US22.8 billion ($35 billion) by Bloomberg.

Forrest issued a warning to his company's external legal team, stating that their engagement was under review 
because of the investigation's tactics and that they "had an obligation to comply with the company's values".
Fortescue has taken legal action against three former employees, Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and 
Bjorn Winther-Jensen, in the Federal Court and has accused the men of copying and taking the company's 
intellectual property when they left to start a rival green iron project called Element Zero.
Masterman, who is Element Zero's chief executive, has called Fortescue's claims "spurious" and said their "green 
metals technology was developed independently of, and is very different from, anything that Fortescue is doing or 
has done in this space". All three men have denied the allegations.
Late on Friday evening, the Federal Court released a swathe of documents from the case, including details from a 
600-page private investigator's report that was commissioned for Fortescue by its external lawyers. Fortescue had 
previously tried to suppress the release of that private investigator's report.
The documents, which also included dozens and dozens of photographs from the investigator's surveillance, 
revealed the extent of the spying conducted on those three former staff members, their children and family 
members, and other staff at Element Zero.

It also revealed that Adrian Huber, a senior legal counsel at Fortescue, gave direct instructions to Lancasters 
Investigations to undertake some of the surveillance activities.
"On Tuesday 7 May 2024, Mr Huber instructed Lancasters Investigations to immediately reinstate their surveillance 
of the below locations in order to locate Dr Kolodziejczyk, and to immediately report to Fortescue any sighting of Dr 
Kolodziejczyk," it was revealed in an affidavit by Paul Dewar.
Dewar is from Davies Collison Cave, the law firm acting for Fortescue in the intellectual property case.
Elsewhere in that affidavit, Dewar detailed again Huber's instruction to Lancasters Investigations. "I am informed by 
Mr Huber and believe it to be true that he today instructed Lancasters to investigate whether Dr Kolodziejczyk and 
Mr Masterman are presently located in [Western Australia's] Port Hedland or Boodarie. I am informed by Mr Huber 
and I believe it to be true that he has today examined Dr Kolodziejczyk's Facebook, X and lnstagram accounts, and 
they do not provide any indication as to Dr Kolodziejczyk's present location."
Huber was also included in the correspondence between Lancasters Investigations and external lawyers, as was 
Phil McKeiver, who was Fortescue's chief general counsel.
McKeiver had last month offered his resignation over the surveillance tactics that were used, but has been retained 
by Fortescue, albeit without his previous responsibility as company secretary.
In Dewar's affidavit, he said it was Fortescue that had engaged Lancasters Investigations "with the aim of 
establishing the identity and location of each of the respondents to the search order application".
The spying that was carried out occurred over a three-week period in April and May this year. It included 
photographing and following the three men, including to the gym, cafes, to the beach, shopping centres, the airport, 
the hairdresser, accountant, and other meetings, as well as to their work and homes.
The spying occurred in Melbourne and Perth and included following Kolodziejczyk and his wife to their child's 
daycare centre. It also included detailing the school times of a teenage family member of Winther-Jensen.
The spying also included details of the arrival of personal mail and packages at the men's home addresses, 
providing walking maps of routes they took, and floor plans of Kolodziejczyk and Winther-Jensen's homes.
Photos were taken of mail delivered to Masterman's home address, and investigators also searched his rubbish bin. 
"It was noted the previous mail was still protruding from the mailbox," the investigator's report said of Masterman's 
house. "Also noted was there were two new letters. A search of the garbage bins noted no new rubbish at this 
time."
Masterman was surveilled by the private investigator even though he was not a party to the search orders that 
Fortescue would seek in the Federal Court.
Element Zero staff who were also not party to the search orders were also photographed and followed by 
Lancasters Investigations, and the report details the use of covert cameras to surveil the office.
Fortescue conducted the surveillance to obtain search orders that allowed it to raid Element Zero's office and the 
homes of Kolodziejczyk and Winther-Jensen, which would result in it gathering almost 3 terabytes of data from 
company documents and their personal devices, email and cloud accounts.
Element Zero's lawyers have objected to the huge amount of data that was gathered during those raids, claiming 
there is a substantial amount of confidential and private information that does not relate to the court case.
Element Zero was formed by Kolodziejczyk and Masterman at the end of 2022. Masterman has had a long career 
in the energy industry, including as chief financial officer of what was then known as Fortescue Future Industries 
(FFI).Page 3 of 3
Fortescue in-house lawyer issued spying orders, court documents reveal
Kolodziejczyk was once FFI's chief scientist and led a push to develop green hydrogen to decarbonise the 
company's mining operations and shipping fleet. Fortescue has since wound down its hydrogen ambitions.
Kolodziejczyk is now Element Zero's chief technology officer. Winther-Jensen also worked as a scientist at FFI 
before joining Element Zero. He departed Element Zero in January this year.
Element Zero ambition is to reduce the carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry. It has 
patented a technology that aims to convert metal ores to metals, not only iron ore, with zero carbon emissions.
Fortescue has said it would "vigorously" defend its intellectual property in the development of cutting-edge 
solutions to decarbonise its Australian iron ore operations by the end of the decade.

Andrew Forrest's Fortescue directly instructed private investigators that followed the families of former employees 
to schools and child care centres and rummaged through their mail, despite the Fortescue founder's attempts to 
distance himself from the scandal.
Documents released by the Federal Court late on Friday show that Fortescue employees oversaw the surveillance 
of three former employees the company has accused of stealing the iron ore giant's intellectual property, not the 
external lawyers hired to handle the case, Davies Collison Cave.
The surveillance was conducted to help Fortescue win search orders over the offices of green energy competitor 
Element Zero, amid allegations three former Fortescue executives - including long-term Forrest lieutenant Michael 
Masterman - took proprietary information with them when they left the company.
As part of the original authorisation, the homes of two other former employees - Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn 
Winther-Jensen - were searched by lawyers acting for Fortescue.
When evidence came to light about the behaviour of the investigation firm - which included spying on family 
shopping trips to Kmart, rummaging through mail and watching the wives and children of former executives for 19 
days - Dr Forrest distanced himself from the actions of the private investigators, and threatened to review the 
contract of Davies Collison Cave.
"I was surprised to learn of the investigations and have been advised by Fortescue's legal team that they were 
necessary in order to be granted search orders from the Federal Court," Dr Forrest said at the time.
"Fortescue's external legal team have been reminded that they also have an obligation to comply with the 
company's values and their engagement is now under review," he said. But an affidavit of DCC senior lawyer Paul 
Dewar, released on Friday, shows that Fortescue engaged and directly instructed Lancaster Investigations in their 
surveillance of the three men and their families.

Fortescue PIs followed former exec families to childcare centres
"Fortescue engaged a private investigator firm, Lancasters Investigations, with the aim of establishing the identity 
and location of each of the respondents to the search order application," says Mr Dewar's affidavit.
"Since 21 April 2024, except in relation to the days of Sunday 5 May and Monday 6 May 2024, Fortescue has 
received reports from Lancasters Investigations regarding each of the Respondents to the Search Order 
Application, including their location." The Australian does not suggest Dr Forrest was aware of the actions of 
Lancaster Investigations, and Dr Forrest has previously denied that he or any member of the board were aware of 
the extent of the covert surveillance.
Dr Forrest has told other media outlets that Fortescue chief legal counsel Phil McKeiver had offered to resign over 
the company's role in the surveillance excess, but that the offer had been refused by joint chief executives Dino 
Otranto and Mark Hutchinson.
"No board member knew about the private investigator and a very enthusiastic group general counsel and company 
secretary wanted to demonstrate that you cannot steal technology and then eliminate that technology that the 
company produced on the way out," Dr Forrest is quoted as saying.
Investigators who followed Mr Masterman used covert cameras to take pictures of the Element Zero director 
outside restaurants and ahead of his attendance at meetings. Dr Kolodziejczyk was followed to cafes and 
restaurants, photographed with his wife and young child - and even followed to a childcare centre.

Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has warned Australia risks losing its place in the global steel supply chain to Africa, 
Brazil and Europe without government and industry ramping up efforts to develop a green iron plan for the 
resource-rich Pilbara.
Western Australia's low- to medium-grade iron ore is facing increased competition from higher grades overseas, 
and the country has little chance of replacing revenue lost to those developing markets, Fortescue said in a 
submission to the Senate inquiry into the Albanese government's Future Made in Australia policy.
"Fortescue is concerned that without the Australian government, WA government and industry uniting to develop a 
focused and funded green iron plan for the Pilbara, the nation runs the risk of losing its long-established and high 
earning place in the global steel supply chain," the submission said.
Fortescue said the Pilbara must transition from low-grade haematite production to high grade green iron production 
with the help of widespread government investment.
"Pilbara iron ore is facing increased competition from higher-grade ores in Africa, Brazil and Europe, and green 
metals processing locations being established in the Middle East," it said.
The mining giant's submission also urged the federal government to tread carefully in developing its national 
interest, given the importance of Chinese investment. "We encourage the Australian government to find the right 
balance regarding national interest considerations and continuing to support foreign investment and trade where it 
brings significant economic and emissions reductions opportunities to Australia," the submission said.
A key hurdle to a viable green iron industry in WA is access to renewable energy infrastructure, WA Chamber of 
Minerals and Energy chief executive Rebecca Tomkinson said.
"We need governments to be making bold decisions, big investment decisions now," she added.
"We don't do an energy transition, and we don't decarbonise and address our scope three emissions in our industry 
without there being a co-ordinated effort across state, federal governments making big infrastructure investments." 
Page 2 of 2
Steel risk without green push, says Fortescue
Ms Tomkinson said the government needed to invest in major common-user infrastructure that would benefit a 
variety of industries.
"Without affordable energy, cheap decarbonised energy, we can't do any of it," she said of the green iron push.
Asked about Fortescue's push for more federal assistance to promote green iron in WA, Premier Roger Cook said: 
"WA is best-positioned to support a low-carbon steel project given our vast reserves of iron ore, mature and 
advanced iron ore industry, local technological know-how, and significant renewable energy opportunities.
"Further opportunities to reduce emissions across the steel-making supply chain are applicable if plants can be 
located near renewable energy precincts." Mr Cook said in May he wanted WA to become the "California of 
Australia," using magnetite and renewable energy to create a green iron future.
A key pillar of Anthony Albanese's re-election pitch to voters, the Future Made in Australia Act, proposes the use of 
government grants, loans and investments to encourage advanced manufacturing and green energy.
The Senate committee received scores of submissions from the private sector, with miners including BHP and 
Fortescue both warning against duplication of government approvals processes.
While broadly supporting the policy, the Fortescue submission said the government could use it to create more 
policies that would better help develop a green iron industry. A government discussion paper estimated that the 
sector could be worth up to $120 billion.

Fortescue investigated its former chief scientist and found he misrepresented his qualifications and experience, 
according to an affidavit in its Federal Court dispute with green iron rival Element Zero.
An internal investigation found Bart Kolodziejczyk overstated his professional record when he applied for the role 
leading Fortescue's technical leap into green hydrogen and zero carbon iron, according to the May 1 affidavit of 
Fortescue lawyer Adrian Huber.
Dr Kolodziejczyk also clashed with executive chairman and billionaire Andrew Forrest, according to workplace 
correspondence from former Fortescue executive Julie Shuttleworth.
Dr Forrest had concerns about Dr Kolodziejczyk's conduct, namely that his criticism of colleagues threatened to 
create a toxic work environment. It culminated in a meeting between the pair where Dr Kolodziejczyk's job was on 
the line.
Fortescue has accused Dr Kolodziejczyk and two other former employees of stealing proprietary IP when they left 
to start Element Zero, which they deny. The affidavit was released by the Federal Court yesterday.
The investigation, which was redacted from the public court file, found "material misrepresentations and 
inaccuracies in respect of activities, positions held and qualifications listed in Dr Kolodziejczyk's Curriculum Vitae", 
according to Mr Huber.
During his time at Fortescue, Dr Forrest became unhappy with Dr Kolodziejczyk's behaviour and attitude, and Ms 
Shuttleworth - chief executive of what was then known as Fortescue Future Industries - documented this in a 
personal letter to the chief scientist.
It also states Dr Kolodziejczyk resigned from FFI on June 14, 2021, and then retracted his resignation the following 
day amid apparent conflict within Fortescue's green energy division over who had oversight of the green iron 
experiment.

Fortescue's chief scientist fudged his CV, court told
Ms Shuttleworth stated: "We are happy you have decided to stay with FFI and look forward to moving on ...this, 
however, will necessitate a substantial behavioural change by you and leads me to our chairman's chief concern, to 
your failure to be a positive and encouraging leader."
The dispute continues.

  Fortescue has pushed back against allegations it had "unclean hands" after spying on former staff sued over the 
alleged theft of green-iron technology.
   The mining giant searched the Perth offices of Element Zero and the homes of the startup's directors Bartlomiej 
Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen, seizing a swathe of computers, devices and documents.
   Fortescue's extensive surveillance of Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen has been revealed in a Federal 
Court lawsuit launched over the alleged theft of trade secrets.
   Before filing the case, the company engaged a private investigator to track the directors from their homes to a 
variety of places including shopping centres, cafes, restaurants, the beach and the airport.
   Fortescue - founded by billionaire Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest - alleges that Dr Kolodziejczyk, Dr Winther-Jensen 
and Element Zero chief executive Michael Masterman used secrets picked up during their time at the mining giant 
to develop their own green-iron technology.
   Mr Masterman, on behalf of Element Zero, has called the allegations "spurious".
   During a hearing on Thursday, Element Zero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman's barrister Chris McMeniman 
slammed Fortescue for the spying.
   "The level of surveillance conducted on the respondents was highly invasive and not necessary,? he told Justice 
Brigitte Markovic.
   Because Fortescue did not divulge crucial information to the judge who signed off the proposed order, this raised 
the question of whether Fortescue had gone to the court with "clean hands" or made the request for the search 
order in bad faith, he said.
   But Justice Markovic criticised the allegations, saying they did not appear in an affidavit that simply mentioned an 
invasion of privacy.
Page 2 of 2
FED:'Bad faith': Fortescue spars with rival over spying
   In material filed with the court, Fortescue has claimed Element Zero raised questions about the investigator for a 
collateral purpose to attract media attention.
   This was rejected by barrister David Studdy SC, who was also representing the start-up and its two directors.
   "The only collateral purpose ... is the extraordinary conduct of Fortescue which is now understandably causing it 
some concern and wanting to shut all of this down," he said.
   Fortescue's barrister Julian Cooke SC criticised the attack, saying the search orders were typical and that 
Fortescue would only be given relevant material from the trove of documents seized after it was sorted through by 
independent lawyers.
   "I mean my goodness, the submissions by the respondents in relation to this are just so far-fetched. It really 
defies logic," he said.
   Mr Cooke said claims Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman's privacy had been invaded were odd as they wanted 
the reports to be made public.
   Mr Studdy rejected this.
   ?We?re not trying to have our cake and eat it," he said.
   Element Zero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman will try to overturn the search orders during a two-day hearing 
from August 19.
   On Thursday, the judge set aside a request by the startup and two executives seeking documents from 
Fortescue ahead of that hearing.
   This material related to reports by the investigator and a computer expert who examined Dr Kolodziejczyk's work 
laptop.
   Mr Cooke called the bid a "massive distraction", criticising his opponents as using an extraordinarily broad 
"scattergun" approach to try and build up their case.
   The judge also rejected a request by Element Zero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman to cross-examine 
Fortescue's external lawyer Paul Dewar.
   In the lawsuit, Element Zero and the executives have been accused of breach of contract, copyright infringement, 
breach of corporations and consumer law, and breach of their fiduciary duties.
   Fortescue is seeking damages or compensation, which could include any profits gained by Element Zero from 
the allegedly stolen invention.

Element Zero could not have invented then designed and constructed its green iron pilot plant in the time frame 
claimed with the budget available to it, a Fortescue employee says, in documents lodged by the iron ore major in 
its federal court case against former employees it says stole intellectual property.
Fortescue has alleged that three former executives including long-term Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman, as 
well as Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen, stole intellectual property developed by Fortescue Future 
Industries (FFI), and used it to launch Element Zero.
The case, lodged early this year, has involved claims that Fortescue, chaired by billionaire founder Andrew Forrest, 
directly instructed private investigators to follow the families of former employees to schools and child care centres 
and rummaged through their mail.
In a trove of documents filed by Fortescue and released by the court on Wednesday, the company paints a picture 
of why it suspected its intellectual property had been stolen.
In one of several affidavits lodged by Fortescue, employee Wayne McFaull says Fortescue's law firm Davies 
Collison Cave Law (DCCL) asked him to compare the timelines and costs of the technologies developed by both 
companies.
"DCCL asked me to provide my opinion as to whether I consider that Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen 
could have invented the Element Zero process and then designed and constructed the Element Zero plant in the 
time available to them between their leaving Fortescue in November 2021 and the Element Zero plant being 
operational in January 2024 (a 26-month period)," he says in his affidavit.
"Based on my analysis of the Fortescue project, the similarity between the Fortescue plant and the Element Zero 
plant, and the reasons below, in my opinion it would not have been possible to deliver the Element Zero plant by 
January 2024, unless the basis of design documents were commenced 12 months earlier in January 2023." Mr 
McFaull was asked by the lawyers to assume Element Zero had access to $5m in funding in its first 20 months.
Page 2 of 3
Fortescue outlines IP theft case
"DCCL then asked me to provide my opinion as to whether or not this funding was sufficient to finance the Element 
Zero project in the first 20 months, assuming that my estimated project timeline is correct," he says.
Mr McFaull says that referring to what Fortescue spent to get to a similar point of development - a figure which was 
redacted - "I do not consider that funding of $5m was anywhere near sufficient to finance a process R&D project in 
the nature and complexity of the Fortescue project and the Element Zero project during the period of December 1, 
2021 to August 1, 2023".
Mr McFaull also says there is an "unexplained resource deficit" in terms of funds, however that figure was also been 
redacted.
An affidavit from another Fortescue employee, Anand Bhatt, says he constructed a timeline of when Dr 
Kolodziejczyk must have started work on the process of using ionic liquids and low temperature iron reduction, 
dating back to June 2020, and running up until the time Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen left Fortescue.
However, a search of the IT systems at Fortescue, which should have revealed documents such as drafts of 
provisional patents and analysis of data, found gaps during key periods when the two men were assumed to have 
been working on the processes.
"I am therefore concerned that Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen have intentionally not uploaded onto the 
Fortescue IT system and/or taken and/or deleted the above work product during or prior to ceasing their 
employment with Fortescue," Dr Bhatt says.
"Based on my analysis of Dr Kolodziejczyk's work on the ionic process at Fortescue ... and my understanding of 
the Element Zero process ... I consider that the Element Zero process is substantially the same process as that 
which Dr Kolodziejczyk took steps to develop while employed at Fortescue. That is because both processes are 
based on a hydroxide electrolyte where the water has been removed to make an ionic liquid." Dr Bhatt also says he 
reviewed Dr Winther-Jensen's email folders at Fortescue and "identified five documents of concern that Dr 
Winther-Jensen emailed from his Fortescue professional email address ... to his personal email address ... 
between his resignation from Fortescue on November 3, 2021 and his final day at Fortescue, November 12, 
2021".
"Each of the five documents is confidential and directly relevant to the Fortescue project.
"Following my review ... I consider that the leaching technical report, iron ore leaching update, TEA Sheet and TEA 
Covering Email contain information that would be of particular value in progressing a competing research and 
development project in relation to the purification of iron ore utilising electrochemical reduction.
"I cannot conceive of any legitimate reason for Dr Winther-Jensen to have sent an email attaching any of these 
documents in the November 2021 period. I am concerned that the confidential information in each document could 
have been misused, could continue to be misused and/or may in the future be misused by Dr Winther-Jensen and 
Element Zero." FFI employee Adrian Huber has also claimed in his affidavit that Dr Kolodziejczyk was the subject of 
complaints he misrepresented his qualifications.
A subsequent Deloitte investigation, Mr Huber's affidavit says, found Dr Kolodziejczyk made "material 
misrepresentations and inaccuracies in respect of activities, positions held and qualifications" in his CV.
A letter published as part of the trove of documents also raises concerns about Dr Kolodziejczyk's behaviour 
following his resigning from FFI in mid-2021, and then later retracting his resignation.
"All of us who serve at FFI, would like to support you and see you successful," the letter, from then-FFI CEO Julie 
Shuttleworth says. "Bart, this however will necessitate a substantial behavioural change by you and leads me to our 
chairman's chief concern, to your failure to be a positive and encouraging leader." The nature of the concerns about 
Dr Kolodziejczyk's behaviour are not detailed in the letter. The matter is scheduled to return to court for an 
interlocutory hearing on Thursday.Page 3 of 3

Fortescue Ltd (ASX:FMG) claims it would be impossible for rival green iron venture, Element Zero, to deliver an 
operational green iron prototype without the mining giant's proprietary technology.
The Andrew Forrest-led mining giant has accused former employees, CFO Michael Masterman and scientists Bart 
Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen, of intellectual property theft, arguing the defendants relied on its 
proprietary technology to advance Element Zero.
In May, Fortescue obtained secret court orders to raid the scientists' homes and Element Zero's office and factory 
units. 
Following a suppression order battle, the Federal Court last week released documents that include affidavits filed by 
Fortescue as the company prepared for the surprise raids.
Those affidavits include two from Paul Dewar, the principal lawyer at Fortescue's representatives, Davies Collison 
Cave Law. Dewar disclosed that Fortescue had instructed Lancasters Investigations to conduct surveillance on 
Kolodziejczyk, Winther-Jensen and a third individual to establish their identities and locations.
The surveillance included detailed observations, such as Winther-Jensen watering his garden and following a 
woman into a shopping centre. Despite a search order granted by Justice Melissa Perry permitting raids on 
Kolodziejczyk's home, Dewar's affidavit revealed that the investigators also spied on properties owned by Michael 
Masterman, who was not targeted by the search orders.

An affidavit from a solicitor for Element Zero, Kolodziejczyk and Masterman, highlighted concerns over the invasive 
nature of the surveillance and the extensive data capture during the search orders. Williams said around three 
terabytes of data were seized, containing confidential and privileged information that was unrelated to the case.
Upon discovering the surveillance, Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest expressed his surprise and warned the FMG 
legal team. 
A new affidavit, from mining and engineering consultant Wayne McFaull, asserts that Element Zero's rapid progress 
could only be attributed to having access to Fortescue's design documents from January 2023. 
McFaull claims that Element Zero's $5 million research fund was not enough for the level of research and 
development they achieved. He said, "Projects in the nature and complexity of the Fortescue project and the 
Element Zero project take a great deal of trial and error."
Element Zero has denied Fortescue's claims and is challenging the private search and seizure orders. A 
preliminary hearing in the Federal Court was set for today, with the full hearing scheduled from August 18.

  Fortescue has been accused of having "unclean hands" for the unnecessary and invasive spying of two former

Fortescue has successfully fended off a move by former executives to win access to the instructions given to 
private investigators who followed the men around for weeks ahead of raids on their homes and offices, amid 
allegations of intellectual property theft.
Fortescue is suing the directors of would-be green steel rival Element Zero over allegations the three - former 
Fortescue chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk, former Fortescue staff member Bjorn Winther-Jensen and long-term 
Andrew Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman - launched their own business using technology they helped develop 
at Fortescue.
The three men deny the allegations, saying Element Zero's technology was developed separately from their former 
work at Fortescue.
In May the Federal Court issued orders allowing raids on the offices of Element Zero, and the homes of Dr 
Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen, to seize the contents of computers and other electronic devices to help 
provide evidence of the accusations.
Ahead of the raids Fortescue hired private investigation firm Lancasters Investigations to watch their houses and 
help find an appropriate time for the raids - a step required by courts ahead of the authorisation of such raids.
But the three men argue the surveillance went far beyond the requirements for the so-called Anton Pillar orders and 
their legal team sought orders for Fortescue to produce the instructions given to Lancasters in court on Thursday, 
arguing the mining major may have had an "ancillary" purpose for hiring the -investigators.
In addition to following the three men and their families around for weeks - including following Dr Kolodziejczyk to a 
childcare centre when he was dropping off his young child - the private investigators recorded details of business 
meetings held by the three men, court records show, as well as using hidden cameras to record the inside of an 
Element Zero research facility unit in Perth.
Page 2 of 2
Win for Fortescue in private eye battle
"We were able to get a close internal view of the facility using a minute covert camera during the surveillance 
period," says one report sent to Fortescue executives by Lancasters investigators.
"Covert video of Element Zero industrial internal space and machinery was obtained." The documents released by 
the court also show Fortescue and its lawyers instructed Lancasters to search through a Pilbara industrial estate 
looking for -information on whether Element Zero was building a pilot plant in the area to test its green steel 
technology.
Despite not being a target of the secret search orders, Mr Masterman was also watched at his Sydney home and 
was followed on business trips, while investigators rifled through his rubbish and mail.
Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest has said neither he or any other member of the Fortescue board 
had any knowledge of the lengths taken by Fortescue's investigators to spy on its former employees, and 
threatened to review the contract of one of the law firms overseeing the case - Davies Collison Cave Law.
Federal Court documents show senior internal Fortescue lawyers Phil McKeiver and Adrian Huber were directly 
involved in issuing instructions to Lancasters. And the documents also show that a second law firm, Seyfarth Shaw, 
was also involved in overseeing the investigator's work.
Seyfarth Shaw was first hired by Fortescue in early 2023 to investigate an anonymous complaint to the company's 
board that Dr Forrest had had an inappropriate relationship with a Fortescue staff member.
On Thursday Justice Brigitte Markovic rejected the orders sought by Element Zero for the instructions issued to 
Lancasters, saying they were likely the subject of legal professional privilege and the concerns aired by the three 
men about the conduct of Fortescue's investigators could be dealt with at a hearing later this month, when Element 
Zero will seek to set aside the original search orders and argue for the return of their data.
Lawyers for Element Zero also lost an application to cross-examine Davies Collison Cave lawyer Paul Dewar over 
allegations the law firm's initial evidence to the court to win the secret search orders made material omissions that 
might have damaged its -application.
While arguing that the cross-examination should not be allowed, Fortescue lawyer Julian Cooke SC also flagged a 
desire to cross-examine Mr Masterman and Element Zero lawyer Michael Williams, if the Element Zero application 
was successful. "I'd seek to cross-examine Mr Masterman and Mr Williams, about their so called privacy concerns," 
he said.

West Australian premier Roger Cook has backed unions seeking to re-establish themselves in the Pilbara iron ore 
industry despite warnings from the nation's biggest miners about risks to productivity and their ability to remain cost-
competitive.
"The Cook government supports WA workers and their unions undertaking collective bargaining with employers for 
better pay and conditions," a spokesman for Mr Cook said.
"Unions play an important role in our society representing workers in a diverse range of industries, including the 
mining and resources sector."
Iron ore royalties generated from largely union-free mines are the backbone of the WA economy, most flowing from 
Rio and BHP. Both companies sounded alarm over the Albanese government's industrial relations changes that 
have allowed unions to force BHP to the negotiating table on a collective bargaining agreement.
WA has already forecast iron ore royalties will fall by more than 35 per cent, or $3.5 billion, in 2024-25. The forecast 
is based on the iron ore price falling to $US71 a tonne amid concerns about the strength of the Chinese economy 
and its real estate market.
The Cook government said the new bargaining provisions in the Fair Work Act were the responsibility of the 
Albanese government.
Under these new rules, unions no longer need to demonstrate that the majority of the workforce supports collective 
bargaining, as long as an agreement is within five years of expiring.
This has opened up terrain for the Australian Workers' Union to pounce, forcing BHP back to the negotiating table 
to start bargaining on wages and conditions at the Mining Area C and South Flank mines. BHP's last agreement on 
this site expired in August 2019.
This is the last agreement covering iron ore mines that can be triggered by federal Labor's new provisions, The 
Australian Financial Review understands. Unlike BHP, Rio is not compelled to negotiate with unions because its 
Page 2 of 2

enterprise agreements expired before 2019. Fortescue has not struck a collective agreement in more than a 
decade.
Still, the big miners fear a return to the strike-prone Pilbara of the 1980s if unions re-establish themselves in an 
industry already grappling with softening prices for the steel-making ingredient and emerging competition from 
Africa, including the Rio-backed Simandou project.
The Chamber of Mining and Energy WA, whose members include Rio Tinto, BHP, Fortescue Limited and Gina 
Rinehart's Roy Hill, said unionisation of the Pilbara had the potential to increase costs and lower productivity.
"While we are fortunate to have a world-class resources industry, we also know Australia is a relatively high-cost 
jurisdiction," CMEWA chief executive Rebecca Tomkinson said.
"Any levers that could further increase operational costs and uncertainty will jeopardise our investment 
attractiveness and need to be carefully considered by all parties."
Unions are known to have targeted BHP and Rio as part of recent recruitment drives with limited success.
Union members made up just 10 per cent of the mining workforce in 2022, down from 16.5 per cent in 2016, 
according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Union membership on mine sites was 44 per cent in 1994. 
Fortescue is understood to be the least unionised of the three biggest miners.
Asked if it was concerned about unions gaining a foothold in the Pilbara, Fortescue said workers already received 
some of the highest wages in the country together with other favourable terms and conditions.
BHP said on Sunday it had been forced to bargain with unions under the new legislation, which does not require the 
unions to establish that the workforce is in favour of bargaining.
Rio has declined to comment on union demands that it come to the negotiating table.

PROFILE | ROSLI WHEELOCK Get to know Fortescue's trailblazer in First Nations engagement, writes Zak Kirkup
Rosli Wheelock's journey to becoming a prominent figure in the mining industry and a key player at resource giant 
Fortescue is a testament to his resilience, vision, and commitment to Indigenous empowerment. His story is not 
only inspiring but also reflects the broader efforts of Fortescue to integrate First Nations values and business 
practices into their operations, culminating in a remarkable $5bn investment with Indigenous service providers and 
suppliers.
Early life and career beginnings Mr Wheelock, a Badimaya/Wajarri man, grew up in Broome, Western Australia, 
spearing, and enjoying the freedom that those early days of growing up in the Kimberley had to offer.
His early life was shaped by the rich cultural heritage of classic Broome, as well as the challenges of Kimberley life. 
While his career began in the pearling industry, seeking more stable employment and driven by a desire to 
contribute more significantly to his community, he enrolled in a Certificate III in Geoscience Practices at his local 
TAFE, setting his sights on the mining and resources sector.
"I started mining in my early 20s," Mr Wheelock recalls.
"Mining just made sense to me personally because of the fly-in, fly-out arrangement, and it offered a clear path for 
career advancement." His early days in the state's biggest industry were marked by a commitment to continual 
learning and development, completing a degree in Mine Engineering and recently earning a Global Executive MBA.
Rise through the ranks at Fortescue Mr Wheelock's career at Fortescue spans over a decade, during which he 
has held numerous leadership roles. Starting off as a technical services superintendent in 2011, he quickly 
advanced through the ranks, as he pressed to always do more - a common theme of his life. He served as the 
production superintendent at Cloudbreak and later as the mining manager at both Fortescue's Cloudbreak and 
Solomon mines, where he oversaw critical operations and drove significant improvements in efficiency and safety. 
In his role as general manager Eliwana, Mr Wheelock was instrumental in the operational readiness and

management of the Eliwana Mine. His strategic vision early on, and his hands-on style saw the successful 
commissioning and operation of the site in December 2020.
In March 2023, Mr Wheelock took on the role of Fortescue's general manager First Nations, where he has been 
instrumental in consolidating the miner's First Nations functions into a cohesive unit. This strategic move has 
streamlined processes and enhanced the company's engagement with Indigenous communities, ensuring that 
Fortescue's initiatives have been both more co-ordinated and more impactful.
Passion for Indigenous empowerment Throughout his personal and professional life, Mr Wheelock has been 
passionate about creating opportunities for Indigenous people. His efforts align perfectly with Fortescue's 
commitment to fostering Indigenous employment, training, and business development, with some of the most 
ambitious targets for Indigenous engagement.
"We have a huge amount of talent within our organisation, and it's recognised which has given the opportunities 
that those individuals deserve on their own merit," Mr Wheelock says.
"It's not because I'm Aboriginal that I am in this critical role; it's because of my track record in running operations, 
managing teams and solving complex problems. However being Aboriginal does give me unique and diverse 
perspectives." Mr Wheelock's personal journey of continuous professional development and his rise to leadership 
positions within Fortescue serve as an inspiration to many Indigenous people. He embodies the potential for 
success when opportunities are made available and supported by strong organisational commitment at every level.
Fortescue's $5bn commitment to Indigenous businesses Fortescue's "Billion Opportunities" program, which began 
in 2011, is designed to boost Indigenous business participation across the company's entire supply chain.
In August this year, days before this magazine was launched, the initiative saw over $5bn in contracts awarded to 
more than 190 Indigenous services and suppliers. In the 2023 financial year alone, there was more than $505m 
spent with Indigenous-owned businesses. Such a significant milestone underscores the company's dedication to 
fostering Indigenous economic independence and meaningful participation well ahead of its time.
Time and again, Fortescue has demonstrated its commitment to seeing Indigenous-owned businesses get a bigger 
share of the pie when it comes to their operations and engagement, but it's not without effort.
As Mr Wheelock says, "We have to make sure we're helping Indigenous-owned businesses remove roadblocks or 
where they're having issues. Our Aboriginal business development team, that's their task, to help ensure they're 
supporting these companies. We're really proud of this achievement.
"Even in Perth, it's not just about where our operations are. We've got things from coffee beans to stationery, we 
look for wherever there's opportunity for Aboriginal businesses to be involved with our organisation."
The broader impact of Fortescue's initiatives Fortescue's approach to Indigenous engagement extends well 
beyond business contracts. The company has over 1400 Aboriginal employees and ensures that there is 
comprehensive cultural awareness training and support for Indigenous heritage across the company.
These efforts are all part of Fortescue's broader strategy to integrate Indigenous perspectives into all aspects of 
their operations. "It makes you realise, when you take a step back and go, wow, we've actually achieved some 
pretty incredible outcomes," Mr Wheelock says.
Net zero commitment Fortescue's dedication to sustainability is encapsulated in its ambitious goal to achieve real 
zero terrestrial emissions by 2030 without the use of carbon offsets. This initiative is a testament to the company's 
forward-thinking approach and its commitment to reducing its environmental footprint.
"Fortescue emits more than 2.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent each year," Mr Wheelock notes. "Our $US6.2bn 
investment in achieving Real Zero by 2030 is a significant step towards mitigating climate change and setting a new 
standard in the industry." The integration of Kooya's electric all-terrain vehicles, for example, into Fortescue's 
operations is a tangible example of how the company's sustainability goals align with its commitment to supporting Page 3 of 3
Leader inspires change
Indigenous businesses. This collaboration with an Indigenous-owned business not only contributes to reducing 
carbon emissions but also ensures that Indigenous enterprises play a central role in Fortescue's decarbonisation 
journey.
A vision for the future Mr Wheelock's vision for the future is closely tied to Fortescue's ongoing efforts to uplift 
Indigenous communities through meaningful engagement and sustainable practices. His leadership and dedication 
continue to drive positive change within the company and beyond. "We are incredibly proud of our approach to First 
Nations engagement, whether it's through business opportunities, employment, or cultural heritage support," he 
says. "The journey has been challenging but immensely rewarding. I look forward to continuing this work and 
making a lasting impact." Rosli Wheelock's story is a powerful reminder of the transformative impact that dedicated 
individuals and forward-thinking companies can have on Indigenous communities in Australia. Together with 
Fortescue, it's these alignments of similar values and dedication which continue to lead the way in Indigenous 
engagement and environmental sustainability, and Mr Wheelock's role will undoubtedly be central to their ongoing 
success. With a strong foundation in operational excellence and a deep commitment to Indigenous empowerment, 
he is poised to help further Fortescue's vision of creating a sustainable and inclusive future. His work not only 
benefits Fortescue but also sets a benchmark for other companies in the industry to follow and helps lift up 
Indigenous people across the country. "

Body
The Prime Minister's decision last month to appoint Jillian Segal as the nation's first anti-Semitism envoy was met 
with cautious words of approval from Jewish leaders and the wider community.
Confusion still reigns over what Segal, an eminent lawyer and businesswoman, can hope to achieve during her 
three-year term. Even some of her supporters don't fully understand the role and, at least politically, regard it as 
nothing more than a sop for the critics - that is, having now named an envoy, Anthony Albanese can safely deflect 
any allegation that his government has been a dithering, equivocating, morally limp-wristed mess on the issue.
What's made matters worse, however, are the consequences of the PM's recent reshuffle of cabinet, which saw 
Andrew Giles not only dumped from immigration but also from his portfolio of multicultural affairs. Both have been 
gifted to Tony Burke, a bete noire of Jewish leaders who've criticised his tepid support for Israel in the aftermath of 
October 7, among other unhelpful, highly questionable remarks and positions.
Burke, for example, backed the right of pro-Palestinian protesters to occupy universities. He's on record quoting 
Hamas casualty figures as fact, and he's pledged full-hearted support for Canterbury-Bankstown Council's decision 
to fly the Palestinian flag - that was in the days after the southern Israeli massacre, well before Israel's ground 
invasion even started in Gaza.
Ironically, he's simultaneously facing political annihilation in his own western Sydney seat of Watson, where an 
activated Muslim population is threatening to oust him over a perception that Labor has been far too pro-Israel since 
the start of the war.
Somehow, Segal is supposed to report her findings on anti-Semitism to this politically conflicted minister, one who 
faces electoral suicide if he puts a foot wrong and who's already demonstrated a total lack of insight and empathy 
on the anti-Semitism itself.
Meanwhile, not a word out of the PM's office about the impending appointment of a Special Envoy for 
Islamophobia. That's because of the genuine struggle to find a moderate Muslim leader willing to take on the role, 
one that the government will accept, and one who'll at least be prepared to condemn what happened on October 7.

Little to envy about the envoys
A tougher benchmark than everyone in cabinet realised, apparently.
Building relationships The last time NSW Lands Minister Steve Kamper was spotted out on the town it was at a low-
key dinner in the company of a corrupt former Hurstville mayor, Con Hindi.
Also in attendance was construction boss Ronnie Wardan, head of Sydney firm Wardan Group, and his employee 
Amanda Ghalloub, but Kamper saw no need to declare this private meeting in his ministerial diary. He told Margin 
Call at the time that Wardan and Ghalloub were family friends and that Hindi wasn't invited but crashed the dinner 
and wouldn't go away. The minister, being a gentleman, just couldn't bring himself to tell Hindi to take a long walk.
The only reason to relive this matter is that Kamper has unfortunately been spotted once again in a deep, offline 
conversation with a prominent character in the NSW property game, this time developer Fouad Deiri, chairman of 
Deicorp, who had the pleasure of chewing Kamper's ear at an NRL football game last weekend.
Kamper told us he was invited to the Dragons v Bulldogs match by the St George CEO and spent most of the game 
in the Captain's Lounge. Not according to one eyewitness, who told Margin Call that Kamper seemed to spend 
much of the game in the Deicorp box.
A spokesman for Kamper said the interaction with Deiri was hardly for most of the match. "The minister dropped 
into Fouad's box for about 15 minutes to distract himself from the score," they said. The Dragons, for what it's 
worth, were snuffed out 28-10 by the Bulldogs, the flak adding: "The minister has known Fouad from when he still 
worked on the tools." That is, for decades, when a much younger Deiri wasn't the leader of a developer-builder 
empire and instead an apprentice carpenter starting out in the trade.
These sightings wouldn't be so awkward if Kamper wasn't the Minister for Lands and Property, a portfolio of 
immense consequence to guys like Deiri and Wardan, and anyone else whose business is real estate. It seems just 
about everyone in this sphere is very old mates with the minister!
Subtle sledgehammer So little love has been lost between Fortescue and three former employees of the company 
accused of stealing intellectual property - if only to establish their own rival green steel start-up concern.
Fortescue's ham-fisted private investigators followed the trio around for weeks, spied on their families and rifled 
through their mail.
But court documents in the case suggest the animosity Fortescue felt towards former chief scientist Bart 
Kolodziejczyk might go back well before the company launched legal action this year.
What other conclusion are we to draw when the mining major named a special report in search of misconduct 
"Project Sledgehammer". Surely a hint of the whacking to come, if nothing else. Kolodziejczyk left the company in 
November 2021.
Ahead of his departure Fortescue allegedly called in Deloitte to run a forensic sweep on his laptop and phone, 
looking for evidence he was taking proprietary information with him.
As it turns out, Deloitte's Project Sledgehammer (released in December) was something of a swing and a miss, 
identifying no wrongdoing.
You'd expect such a bold title to get a mention in court when the trio try to have Fortescue's case against them 
thrown out next week. If nothing else, it offers an easy argument that Fortescue's legal case is as much about 
trying to scare off would-be competitors than it is about IP theft.

Highlight: Court documents reveal a development in the intellectual property case in which Fortescue hired private 
investigators.
Body
Billionaire Andrew Forrest was "generally updated" on a rival's mineral processing technology that converted iron 
ore into green iron, and discussions to test that technology on Fortescue's iron ore, according to court documents.
Forrest's Fortescue Metals Group is suing Element Zero, a start-up that developed that mineral processing 
technology.
Fortescue has claimed in the Federal Court that the three men behind Element Zero, who are ex-Fortescue 
employees, have infringed its intellectual property. It is claimed Element Zero was launched using technology that 
two of the men, who are scientists, had helped develop at Fortescue.
The three men have denied the allegations and stated the technology was developed separately from their former 
work at Fortescue.
In correspondence submitted to the Federal Court, it was revealed that Michael Masterman, a former long-time 
lieutenant to Forrest, was seeking a meeting with Andrew Hamilton, a technical director at Fortescue, and also its 
chief executive, Dino Otranto, in January this year. The meeting was to discuss the technology. Also included in the 
correspondence was Phil McKeiver, Fortescue's chief general counsel and then company secretary.
In that correspondence, Masterman said: "I have kept Andrew Forrest generally updated and let him know that I 
would follow up with you guys." Forrest is Fortescue's executive chairman, the founder of the mining group, and its 
largest shareholder.
The intellectual property court case has made headlines after it was revealed that Fortescue had engaged a 
private investigations group to spy on and follow Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen, the 
three men behind Element Zero. The spying also involved following the men's family members, including children, 
and other Element Zero staff for a three-week period.
The spying was done by Lancasters Investigations, a company founded by former British SAS soldier turned private 
investigator Robert Lancaster, which produced a 600-page report for Fortescue. Lancaster has posted photos of 
himself holding weapons on Instagram, and photos from his days as a soldier. It was revealed in court that 
Fortescue's in-house legal counsel, Adrian Huber, gave direct instructions to the private investigations group.

New evidence in court case as Fortescue takes aim at smaller rival
Reports and emails from Lancasters Investigations were also sent to Seyfarth Shaw Australia, a law firm that was 
also used by Fortescue's board last year to investigate an anonymous claim that Forrest had a relationship with an 
employee. The investigation by Seyfarth cleared Forrest of any wrongdoing, and found that none of the matters 
raised in the anonymous letter were substantiated.
Forrest last month said he had no knowledge of the extensive spying conducted on ex-staff and their families, 
including children, and was "surprised to learn of the investigations".
The billionaire, who is the world's 87th wealthiest person according to Bloomberg's Billionaire Index, said he was 
advised by Fortescue's legal team that the spying was "necessary in order to be granted search orders from the 
Federal Court" in its case. Forrest's wealth is estimated at $US22.3 billion ($33.8 billion) by Bloomberg.

Fortescue's lawyers required the private investigator's report before a search warrant from the Federal Court could 
be obtained. After the search orders were granted, raids were conducted on the homes of Kolodziejczyk and 
Winther-Jensen, and Element Zero's offices, in which 3 terabytes of data was obtained, including from 
Kolodziejczyk and Winther-Jensen's personal emails, cloud accounts, mobile phones and personal computers.
Masterman and other Element Zero staff were the subject of surveillance but not the search orders. Masterman's 
personal mail was rummaged through and photographed by Lancasters Investigations.
Fortescue's McKeiver had last month offered his resignation over the surveillance tactics that were used, but has 
been retained by the mining group, albeit without his previous responsibility as company secretary. He stepped 
down from that role in July.
In court earlier this month, it was revealed that Fortescue had conducted an internal investigation into 
Kolodziejczyk, claiming he had overstated his professional record. This claim was made in an affidavit by 
Fortescue's in-house lawyer Adrian Huber.
Kolodziejczyk is the co-founder of Element Zero, and its chief technology officer. Element Zero was formed at the 
end of 2022.
Kolodziejczyk was once Fortescue Future Industries' chief scientist and led a push to develop green hydrogen to 
decarbonise the company's mining operations and shipping fleet. Fortescue has since wound down its hydrogen 
ambitions. Winther-Jensen was a former FFI scientist before he joined Element Zero. He left Element Zero in 
January this year.
In court earlier this month, Fortescue was successful in preventing Element Zero's lawyers' attempt to access 
instructions given to Lancasters Investigations. Element Zero's lawyers also lost an application to cross-examine 
Davies Collison Cave lawyer Paul Dewar over claims the law firm's initial evidence to the court to obtain the search 
orders made material omissions, which might have damaged its application.
During those hearings, Julian Cooke, senior counsel representing Fortescue, said his client's case had nothing to 
do with the meetings between Fortescue and Element Zero in January this year, when it was said: "Your process is 
different to our process."
"That's not part of our case," Cook said. "Our case is they worked on our dime on a confidential process, the ionic 
process which they then, without our permission, utilised in the Element Zero process. That's the third part of the 
case. The second part of the case is then they took documents to develop - to construct and design their pilot 
plant.It has got nothing to do with any alleged similarities between our process and their process which we accept, 
not dispute ..."Page 3 of 3
New evidence in court case as Fortescue takes aim at smaller rival
Element Zero said it wanted to reduce the carbon footprint of iron ore, Australia's most lucrative export industry. It 
has patented a technology that aims to convert metal ores to metals, not only iron ore, with zero carbon emissions. 
Fortescue said it would "vigorously" defend its intellectual property in the development of cutting-edge solutions to 
decarbonise its Australian iron ore operations by the end of the decade.

Just weeks ago Fortescue shed 700 workers and dumped a target to be a major producer of green hydrogen by 
2030, but the miner's billionaire owner Andrew Forrest still insists his native Pilbara can supply the globe with green 
iron.
Straight from a dinner in China the night before, the company founder pointed to the red dirt at his feet at 
Fortescue's Cloudbreak mine, said, "this is rich iron," then turned his hand up to the blue sky and said, "and that is 
energy."

The simple proposition of combining ample raw material and energy occurring in the same place will succeed or fail 
on practicalities.
When questioned about whether he is overly ambitious, Forrest always has the justified retort that many doubted if 
then tiny Fortescue could break the BHP-Rio Tinto duopoly and become the third force in Pilbara iron ore mining.
Fortescue's $53 billion market capitalisation is proof he got it right, but Forrest's next challenge is tougher.
His first success, in iron ore, was as a late entrant into an existing business. This time he wants to be one of the first 
movers into a sector that hardly exists outside the laboratory.
Steelmaking produces by some counts 10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Most of it is made from 
iron ore - a mix of iron and oxygen - in huge integrated steel plants.
First the oxygen is removed in a process called reduction, using coal for heat and to aid the chemical reaction. The 
result is iron, and an enormous amount of carbon pollution. Next the iron is refined and turned into steel.
Forrest wants the first, most polluting part of the process, to be done in the Pilbara and to ship the zero-emissions 
green iron to the world.
Page 2 of 2
Andrew Forrest isn't giving up on his green iron Pilbara dream
On Friday he turned the first sod on what in 12 months' time is to be a $75 million electric smelting furnace to test 
different ways of producing 1500 tonnes of green iron a year.
Right now it is a flattened piece of dirt, but Fortescue was keen to show progress elsewhere. Zero-emissions iron 
needs zero-emissions iron ore, and Fortescue is aiming for its mining to be fossil-fuel free by 2030.
That will require more than two gigawatts of solar and wind generation and massive battery storage to provide 
reliable power - enough for about a million homes, the company said.
Fortescue said the plant would use green hydrogen from one of the company's facilities, as well as an electric 
smelting furnace.
The project milestone follows Fortescue's announcement last month that it would cut 700 jobs and merge its 
mining and energy divisions, as it also tempered its ambition to be a major producer of the clean fuel hydrogen.
Forrest has maintained he is committed to green hydrogen, and on Friday, West Australian Premier Roger Cook 
said hydrogen had an important role to play in remote areas such as mine sites.
"WA is on its way to becoming a global clean energy powerhouse, and a major producer, user and exporter of 
green iron," Cook said.

Mining magnate Andrew Forrest has shrugged off a fall in iron ore prices, arguing lower steel production in China 
was a normal part of the long-term commodity cycle.
Iron ore prices this week dropped to a 21-month low after China's largest steelmaker put the industry on edge by 
saying the sector faced a crisis more acute than the downturns of 2008 and 2015.
While acknowledging the current dip in iron ore demand, Dr Forrest said he was confident in the long-term outlook.
"I think there is still very high demand in China. The iron ore consumption doesn't go up in a straight direction, it has 
a jiggered edge on an upwards curve and we're in one of those downward edges right now, but the trend will still be 
strong.
"If you look at the big mega-trends out there, I'm not worried about their trends going up or down because they 
happen to go up or down towards an upwards curve." According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, that 
country's steel production in July was 82.94 million tonnes, down 9 per cent on the previous month, as mills cut 
back due to subdued demand, lacklustre prices and tightening margins.
Iron ore's price has dropped to its lowest level since November 2022, $US95.25 a tonne, after topping $US144 a 
tonne on January 3, and the downturn has put pressure on major Australian iron ore -producers.
Dr Forrest was in the Pilbara on Friday showcasing his new green hydrogen technology, declaring it could easily be 
"Australia's biggest ever industry." Fortescue's mission to build a sustainable iron supply chain in Western Australia 
kicked off on Friday with the founder showing off their latest hydrogen-powered technology at the green energy hub 
at Christmas Creek mine.
The $US50m project is expected to produce more than 1500 -tonnes per annum of green iron metal, with 
production anticipated in 2025. But while demand for the metal hit a near two-year low after China pulled back its 
orders, Dr Forrest said he was not fazed.
Page 2 of 2
Forrest shrugs off iron ore price pullback
"I just came back from China where I went to ascertain with our leaders, with China's leaders, where they want to 
go with green metals," he said.
"The pollution over the skies of China isn't sustainable. They need to keep on building their cities but if they can do 
it in a way that doesn't cause any harm then they're going to take that shot." The Christmas Creek processing plant 
will use green hydrogen produced at Fortescue's gaseous and liquid hydrogen facility, the largest of its kind in 
Australia, together with an electric smelting furnace to produce high purity green iron. Once established, the 
company hopes to supply the final product to almost any steel plant globally.
Dr Forrest in July abandoned ambitious green -hydrogen targets in a major -business backdown, pulling back from 
the company's goal of producing 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year by 2030.
Standing behind the all-new hydrogen-powered haul truck prototype, dubbed "Europa", Dr Forrest said that once 
the old fleet of 80 trucks was replaced, the company would save about 4500 litres of diesel everyday, eliminating up 
to three million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions per year.
Clean-burning hydrogen has been hailed as a potential solution to a range of climate-related energy challenges, 
from fuelling trucks to generating electricity.
Very little hydrogen is produced from sustainable energy sources today; most is made using natural gas and fossil 
fuels.
Fortescue plans to use solar or wind energy to power electrolysers that split water into hydrogen and oxygen. 
Producing hydrogen as an economically viable energy source in Australia is high on Dr Forrest's priority list, but he 
could not estimate when that would happen.
"Oil is about $80 a barrel now. When oil started, let's be clear, it started at equivalent dollars of $1600 a barrel, like, 
you know, 20 times current.
"Industries don't start at really economic prices and then bingo," he said. The billionaire was joined by Fortescue 
Metals chief executive Dino Otranto for a ceremony to mark the start of civil works at the site.
"Hydrogen and fuels made using renewable energy will have a role to play in decarbonising mining, whether it's in 
buses, heavy mining equipment such as haul trucks and excavators, or producing green iron," Mr Otranto said. 
"This renewable hydrogen plant is versatile, enabling us to produce gaseous and liquid hydrogen to be used to 
power our mining equipment prototypes, while also providing the added benefit of refuelling our fleet of coaches at 
Christmas Creek." Dr Forrest also celebrated awarding $5bn to 200 First Nations businesses through the Billion 
Opportunities Program, which was established in 2011.
"This program has really been a game changer for us and it wouldn't be where it is today without the dedication of 
all of you - our First Nations business partners, and the incredible Fortescue team driving forward this -initiative." 
The reporter travelled to WA as a guest of Fortescue.

  Allegations about the theft of trade secrets by "nefarious" former Fortescue staff was a debacle that misled a 
judge before she ordered their homes be raided and a swathe of material seized, a judge has heard.
   The mining giant has sued the directors of Perth startup Element Zero - Bartlomiej Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn Winther-
Jensen and Michael Masterman - claiming they used confidential information gained while working at Fortescue.
   These secrets were allegedly used to develop their own green-iron technology to process the valuable ore without 
carbon emissions.
   In May, Element Zero's offices and Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen's homes were searched under order 
of Federal Court judge Melissa Perry.
   Computers, devices and documents were seized as part of the process.
   The court order was granted in secret, giving the startup's directors no notice their premises were about to be 
raided.
   It has been challenged by lawyers for Element Zero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman, who argue the judge 
was not presented with all relevant information and was misled to think Fortescue had a strong case.
   As a two-day hearing began on Monday, barrister David Studdy SC called search orders "a nuclear weapon in the 
court?s armoury?.
   It was the duty of anyone seeking those orders to do so in the utmost good faith, providing all evidence to a judge, 
even that which could be used to contest the application, he said.
   Fortescue did not do this, hyping up its weak case as strong by failing to bring the court's attention to key 
information, Mr Studdy told Justice Brigitte Markovic.
   ?There has been an industrial-scale forensic debacle and that would not be mandated by allowing the orders to 
stand," the barrister said.

   The mining giant - which is controlled by billionaire Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest - falsely portrayed Dr Kolodziejczyk, 
Dr Winther-Jensen and Mr Masterman as dishonest by claiming they had engaged in "industrial-scale misuse", the 
barrister added.
   There was no evidence any technology used by Element Zero was developed while at Fortescue, he told the 
court.
   The mining giant claimed in court documents this material was missing because it had been taken.
   Instead, Mr Studdy suggested the material never existed.
   "This missing documents theory ... it is just absolutely preposterous," he said.
   In applying for the search order, Fortescue also falsely painted actions taken by the former employees such as 
deleting files or using USB sticks in a "nefarious" light, he added.
   Dr Kolodziejczyk deleted files from his personal laptop after being told to do so ahead of his resignation, while Dr 
Winther-Jensen sent Fortescue files to his personal email account as he was afraid he would lose access to his 
work account before he left and still had tasks to finish, the court was told.
   The highly intrusive search orders were also too broad, allowing Fortescue to go on a "fishing" expedition when 
the company should have only been allowed to obtain specific documents related to the court case, Mr Studdy said.
   In the lawsuit, Element Zero and the executives have been accused of breach of contract, copyright infringement, 
breach of corporations and consumer law, and breach of their fiduciary duties.
   Fortescue is seeking damages or compensation, which could include any profits gained by Element Zero from 
the allegedly stolen invention.
   Fortescue is planning to produce green iron from its Christmas Creek site in the Pilbara region of Western 
Australia by the end of 2025.
   The hearing continues on Tuesday.

  Allegations about the theft of trade secrets by "nefarious" former Fortescue staff misled a judge before she 
ordered their homes be raided and a swathe of material seized, a judge has heard.

Prize behind Mark McGowan's fifth job
Frontier Energy is one of those ASX-listed renewable energy companies longer on dreams than revenue. And yet, it 
still managed to recruit one of the country's most powerful recent premiers, Mark McGowan, as its new non-
executive chairman.
Frontier's chief executive Adam Kiley announced McGowan's appointment yesterday as the company seeks to 
develop a parcel of land 120 kilometres south of Perth for a solar project. The recruiting coup was celebrated by the 
solar shillers at the Smart Energy Council as a "major milestone".
How did Frontier get onto McGowan's radar? We can take a stab. Frontier's largest shareholder is mining 
Perthonality Grant Davey, who owns about 10 per cent of the renewable explorer's stock, and until yesterday was 
the company's chairman.
In 2022, Davey was among the millionaires and billionaires at the WA Telethon Ball, the state's premier charity 
commandeered by Kerry Stokes. That year, the top prize was a private lunch with Stokes and Prime Minister 
Anthony Albanese, with the winner ferried across the Nullarbor on a private jet donated by Tim Roberts. Davey bid 
for it, but Roberts - no fan of the mining entrepreneur - gazumped him, bidding $525,000 for the pleasure.
That left Davey instead bidding on a private audience with (who else) McGowan. Did a charity event to raise money 
for sick kids facilitate a meet-cute that ended up with a cushy post-political job on the board of a new energy 
company? Please dial down the Perthiness of it all.
McGowan getting poached into non-executive director land doesn't come free. Signing on, he was handed 2 million 
share options, vesting over the next two years at levels between 20¢ and 40¢.
They are already in the money, and on the news of McGowan's recruitment, the share price jumped another 9 per 
cent to 50¢. Nice business for Davey and the other members of the board, including Dixie Marshall, the former Nine 
newsreader who left journalism last decade to run Colin Barnett's media operation.

Has anyone sought more mileage so quickly in their post-political life than McGowan? The Frontier gig is his fifth 
since announcing his shock exit from the premier's residence in May last year.
They're hardly benevolent public service roles either: he is now an adviser to BHP, Chris Ellison's Mineral 
Resources, the soon-to-be private APM (which flew him to the Melbourne Cup for some reason), and on the roster 
of Joe Hockey's Bondi Partners.
The public knows veteran politicians will seek private sector careers to make the kind of money they couldn't get 
while in office. That it's often adjacent to their past responsibilities is part of the uncomfortable bargain. Whatever 
McGowan's doing (so soon after proffering up excuses of being "burned out" and "exhausted"), is beginning to look 
like a wind-up.
Twiggy fills the ranks
with his PhD advisers
For billionaires, nothing counts so much as loyalty.
That's no doubt a large part of why Fortescue founder Andrew Forrest is pursuing former employees through the 
courts, where his case against former Fortescue scientists Bartlomiej Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen 
opened yesterday.
And it's probably why his current scientific team has been bolstered by those he can trust. Chief among them are 
those who have seen him through academia's best instrument of torture. We speak, of course, of the PhD.
In 2019, Forrest was one of a few Australians to survive (and secure) a doctorate. In said document, he thanked a 
number of academics and technicians, a startling number of which later ended up involved in his corporate-
philanthropic empire.
There's Dr Shanta Barley, who was thanked for providing "technical, logistic, intellectual and moral support". She 
now works at Fortescue in the role of chief climate scientist, having first been hired by Forrest's philanthropic 
Minderoo Foundation in 2020.
Professor Sarah Dunlop was, at the time of Forrest's PhD, a head of school at the University of Western Australia. 
She's also with Minderoo now, where she heads up the Plastics and Human Health division.
Forrest also thanked Professor Daniel Pauly, who doesn't appear to work directly for Forrest. But Seas Around Us, 
the research institute he heads, worked with Minderoo on its Global Fishing Index.
Forrest's PhD also notes the fieldwork and in-house technicians at the Centre for Marine Futures. Of the five names 
he thanked, fully three (Alex McLennan, Claire Raphael and Nikki De Campe) have, in the five years since, worked 
or work for Minderoo.
There's nothing untoward about any of this. Minderoo is a charity shaped by Forrest's interests, and he likes marine 
biology enough that he did a PhD on it.
Billionaires always fill their courts with shiny personages that enter their orbit, and while few entourages look like 
this, relatively few billionaires have spent much time on campus.
Then, there's the trust thing, and Forrest has, by virtue of familiarity, more reason to put stock in this group of 
scientists than the ones he reckons ran off with Fortescue's trade secrets to start hydrogen start-up Horizon Zero 
(they are defending the case).
Before being convinced to undertake his PhD, Forrest donated $65 million to the University of Western Australia, 
funding a new residential hall, scholarships and post-doctoral fellowships. The university can't begrudge him luring 
away a few star academics. Though, not the biggest star. The person most integral to his PhD was Professor Page 3 of 3
Rear Window
Jessica Meeuwig, whose parents he effusively thanked in its first page ("this immense character can only wellspring 
from enlightened and encouraging parenting", he gushed).
Dr Meeuwig has never worked for Fortescue. Though Forrest briefly invested in Buru Energy, the gas business 
founded and, until Friday, chaired by her husband.
Gabby RBA spills
its press flacks
Last week, Labor hack turned lobbyist Stephen Conroy called deputy Reserve Bank governor Andrew Hauser "a 
failed ideologue", "wrong", and "a wanker". Or a "tosser", he added, translating for the British recruit.
This childish tirade was sparked by a spicy speech in which Hauser lamented the "extraordinary certainty" of the 
"gurus and charlatans, geniuses and buffoons" quoted on the path of interest rates.
Conroy - whose TG Public Affairs lobbies for embattled telcos and unpopular supermarket chains - could be 
precisely the kind of overconfident, underqualified commentator Hauser was thinking of. Still, if the intention is for 
Reserve Bank figures to keep giving interesting speeches, its figureheads are going to need some serious PR 
support.
No one could realise this better than newish chief communications officer Sally Cray, a former political headkicker 
who used to be Malcolm Turnbull's principal private secretary.
Nearly two weeks ago, she embarked on a root-and-branch restructure of the two dozen-strong RBA comms team. 
It has effectively spilled their jobs, forcing all of them to reapply for new, reconfigured roles in the Hunger Games 
arena. All are now waiting to find out if they've been successful. May the odds be ever in their favour.
Seasoned insiders described this whole process as very unlike the central bank. Though, surely, that's the point. 
The review of the bank, commissioned by federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers last year, spends a whole chapter on the 
RBA's communications strategy, in the aim of radically boosting the central bank's transparency and accessibility.
The government ordered the review in the wash-up of former governor Phil Lowe's disastrous prediction interests 
rates wouldn't rise until this year. But no political good deed goes unrewarded. Now, the newly chatty bank is using 
the press conferences the government forced upon it to discuss everything from government spending to the nature 
of public interest rate debate.
It's the kind of thing oppositions love, and it's driving the government crazy. Can you believe it asked for this?

Big organisations such as Fortescue, Cleanaway, Wesfarmers, Korea Zinc and the Royal Automobile Club of 
Victoria have been caught up in the collapse of the Australian division of a controversial US hydrogen vehicle 
manufacturer.
Hyzon Motors aimed to become the Tesla of hydrogen trucks when it listed on the Nasdaq in July 2021, but has 
since lost 99 per cent of its value and is now making a low-ball offer to acquire its failed Australian subsidiary out of 
administration.
The collapse of Hyzon's Australian subsidiary was triggered when the parent refused to extend financial support in 
July, and comes as the struggling US company is on track to exhaust its cash reserves within seven months at the 
current rate of spending.
The demise of Hyzon Motors Australia is the latest setback for the struggling hydrogen sector and comes after 
Fortescue chairman and hydrogen enthusiast Andrew Forrest conceded in July that the sector would not grow as 
quickly as he originally hoped.
It also comes after Fortescue-backed hydrogen plane developer Universal Hydrogen collapsed in the US in July 
after burning through almost $150 million of investor capital.
Hyzon had delivered 10 hydrogen buses to Fortescue and was also working on hydrogen-powered rubbish trucks 
for Cleanaway when its Australian subsidiary was placed in administration on July 11. The subsidiary collapsed 
owing $29.9 million to its creditors, and the list of creditors included 45 local employees.
Hyzon Motors Australia had worked to retrofit hydrogen fuel cells into diesel trucks and buses from a site controlled 
by the RACV in Melbourne's south-east.
An Australian subsidiary of Korea Zinc, Ark Energy, was owed $2.89 million at the time of collapse, Cleanaway was 
owed $1.36 million and Wesfarmers subsidiary Coregas claimed $288,000.
The vast majority of Hyzon Australia's $29.9 million of debts were owed to Hyzon entities in the US and China.

Hydrogen collapse hits big Australian firms
Despite vowing to cease working in Australia as part of efforts to focus more on North American markets, Hyzon's 
parent entity is now trying to acquire the Australian subsidiary under a deed of company arrangement that has been 
recommended by the administrator, PKF partner Jason Stone.
Mr Stone told creditors they would get a better dividend if they accepted Hyzon's offer, because the US and 
Chinese subsidiaries of Hyzon would not claim their full debts if the offer was accepted. But he said the Hyzon 
parent could seek repayment of its secured debts if the Australian subsidiary was instead put into liquidation.
"In the event the proposal is not accepted it is understood that HMI [Hyzon's US parent] and the other related party 
entities will seek to prove [reclaim debts] in the liquidation," Mr Stone said.
He said the best-case scenario under a liquidation was for creditors to receive 7¢ for every dollar owed by Hyzon 
Motors Australia. But he said creditors could receive between 19¢ and 60¢ for each dollar owed if they accepted the 
takeover by the US parent company.
Fortescue was named as a debtor to Hyzon Motors Australia, allegedly owing the collapsed company just over 
$55,000. Mr Stone did not explain in his report why Fortescue owed the money; however, he did say there was one 
"after sales client" who had been invoiced for "spare parts and other support charges".
Hyzon had transferred just over $1 million into an accountant's trust account in case Fortescue claimed repairs 
under warranty on the 10 hydrogen buses it had purchased.
Mr Stone said the administrators were eligible to collect those warranty reserves, and he had ordered the third-party 
accountant to return the money.
"To date this has not occurred and proceedings may need to be issued to recover the funds," he said.
There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Fortescue.
The 10 hydrogen coaches are used to ferry workers between their mine site accommodation and the airport at 
Fortescue's Pilbara iron ore mines.
Australian businessman Craig Knight led Hyzon to a Nasdaq listing in July 2021 amid a wave of cheap money and 
a boom in hydrogen stocks.
But the stock has since lost more than 99 per cent of its value on the back of a regulatory probe and the failure of 
the company to ramp up sales as quickly as hoped.
Mr Knight stepped down in mid-2022 and is barred from being a company director for five years after the US 
Securities and Exchange Commission accused him of making false statements about Hyzon's progress.
Hyzon shares hit a new low of US5.4¢ on Friday.
Most other hydrogen stocks have also suffered steep falls over the past three years.
Norwegian electrolyser manufacturer Nel is down 85 per cent since January 2021, while scandal-plagued Nikola 
Motors is down 99.6 per cent since June 2020.
Electrolyser manufacturer Plug Power has lost 96.5 per cent of its value since January 2021.
Aside from higher interest rates and slow progress on technology delivery, hydrogen stocks have suffered from the 
fact subsidies promised under the US government's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have proved far harder to access 
than expected.
Sentiment towards hydrogen has also suffered from perceptions that Republican nominee Donald Trump may scrap 
the hydrogen incentives in the IRA if returned as president in November.Page 3 of 3

  Fortescue staff who left to form their own rival startup challenged extensive search orders of their homes and 
offices as a cynical distraction to avoid properly defending allegations of trade secret theft, a court has been told.
   Lawyers for the iron-ore giant on Tuesday said the case brought against Perth startup Element Zero and three of 
its directors was bolstered by the implausible explanations for their actions, including copying confidential 
documents to their personal laptops and email accounts.
   "The strong prima facie case ... has become even stronger when taking into account the respondents' evidence," 
barrister Julian Cooke SC told the Federal Court.
   The Andrew Forrest-controlled mining giant claims Element Zero directors Bartlomiej Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn 
Winther-Jensen and Michael Masterman used trade secrets gained while working at Fortescue for their new 
enterprise.
   This material was allegedly used to develop their own green-iron technology, to process the valuable ore without 
carbon emissions.
   In May, Element Zero's offices and Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen's homes were searched under order 
of Federal Court Justice Melissa Perry and four terabytes of material was seized.
   The court order was granted in secret, giving the startup's directors no notice their premises were about to be 
raided.
   Element Zero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman are trying to discharge this search order before Justice 
Brigitte Markovic.
   On the second day of the hearing, Mr Cooke said the order should remain and the bid to overturn it was "ill-
conceived".
   He slammed the bid as an expensive, cynical attempt by Element Zero and the directors to avoid filing a defence 
and properly face the allegations brought against them.
Page 2 of 2
FED:Fortescue slams 'cynical distraction' in IP-theft case
   ?The respondents' discharge application has been a monumental waste of time and a distraction from the real 
issues to be decided," he told the court.
   The evidence before Justice Perry revealed a strong case by Fortescue and the very real risk that documents 
would be destroyed, hidden or squirrelled away if search orders were not granted, the barrister said.
   Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen had admitted copying confidential material to their personal devices 
before they resigned.
   But they have provided various reasons as to why this action was legitimate, such as being ordered to do so while 
working from home or fearing they would lose access to Fortescue's IT systems.
   These explanations were "inherently improbable and implausible", Mr Cooke said.
   The Element Zero directors did not respond to evidence suggesting they had access to confidential information 
used to establish the startup, the court was told.
   Those secrets included a patent proposal for iron-ore processing technology discussed while they were at 
Fortescue in December 2020.
   Dr Kolodziejczyk had been "too scared" to address these issues front-on because he knew that nothing he could 
say would help him defend the lawsuit, Mr Cooke said.
   Other evidence of the alleged use of confidential information included analysis showing Element Zero could not 
have established a pilot plant for processing green iron - as it did so in 26 months - without significant help from 
knowledge gained at Fortescue.
   "The respondents feared to address the matter by direct evidence because this would have exposed facts 
unfavourable to them,? Mr Cooke said.
   Justice Markovic will deliver her decision at a later date.
   In the lawsuit, Element Zero and the executives have been accused of breach of contract, copyright infringement, 
breach of corporations and consumer law, and breach of their fiduciary duties.
   Fortescue is seeking damages or compensation, which could include any profits gained by Element Zero from 
the allegedly stolen invention.
   Fortescue is planning to produce green iron from its Christmas Creek site in the Pilbara region of Western 
Australia by the end of 2025.

The plunge in the iron ore price - almost halving since its peak in January - is good news for the rest of the world, 
but just terrible to awful news for us.
It is especially bad news for BHP and Rio and their shareholders, who have had their share prices slashed by more 
than 20 per cent as a consequence.
It's been even worse news for Fortescue and its green groupie chairman and now co-biggest shareholder "Twiggy" 
Forrest.
Its share price is down 43 per cent, and teetering.
Fortescue is especially sensitive to the rise and fall of the China-driven iron ore price. One, because that's all it has 
- it's 100 per cent iron ore, and almost all of it goes to China. But secondly and more potently, its iron ore is inferior 
to BHP's and Rio's (and Brazil's Vale).
This is great when China is booming and iron ore is in demand; the price Fortescue gets starts to approach the 
BHP/Rio price.
But when the opposite occurs, as now, its iron ore price falls further and faster; and the drop in the price comes all 
and straight off Fortescue's profit.
And, obviously, its company tax bill. The same goes for BHP and Rio. Hence, their pain is also Treasurer Jim 
Chalmers's pain. And so ours.
For instance, as I've argued, it's going to be critical for the government to repeat its $300 electricity rebate in the 
2025-26 year.
But will the post iron ore-plunge budget numbers be able to afford it? The obviously unknown - but critically 
important for us - question is what happens in China, not just next year but through the rest of the 2020s.
Page 2 of 2
A few worries to iron out
Though the big spenders in Canberra are unable to understand it, it's not just the budget revenues built on China 
but our entire economic prosperity.
Even if it doesn't buy them directly from us, like it does iron ore, China drives both the prices of and the volumes of 
coal and gas we sell into the global market.
If their prices really plunged, and stayed down for any extended period, for all the post-fossil fuel fantasies of people 
like Forrest and the minister for destroying our energy system, Chris Bowen, the Aussie dollar would really collapse 
and this country's economy would become a rubbish heap.
Yet, that would actually be good news for the rest of the world. Lower iron ore and energy prices would feed into 
lower prices for everything - and I really mean everything - across the world.
You would see sustained near zero inflation, much lower interest rates, and booming economies. Some of that 
prosperity would even filter down to our trash heap.
Now as for the three companies themselves, apart from his now essentially abandoned hydrogen fantasies, Forrest 
has shown zero interest in diversifying away from the total reliance on iron ore and on a never-ending China growth 
story.
After actually going long on iron ore and China, by selling out of fossil fuels, BHP is now trying desperately to 
diversify into other commodities. Rio, extraordinarily, has just doubled down in Africa on its iron ore exposure.

  Fortescue staff who jumped ship to form their own resources startup were too scared to tackle the accusations

   "The strong prima facie case ... has become even stronger when taking into account the respondents' evidence," 
barrister Julian Cooke SC said.
   The mining giant claims Element Zero directors Bartlomiej Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn Winther-Jensen and Michael 
Masterman used confidential information gained while working at Fortescue for their new enterprise.
   Those secrets were allegedly used to develop their own green-iron technology, to process the valuable ore 
without carbon emissions.
   In May, Element Zero's offices and Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen's homes were searched under order 
of Federal Court Justice Melissa Perry.
   The court order was granted in secret, giving the startup's directors no notice their premises were about to be 
raided.
   Element Zero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman are trying to discharge this search order before Justice 
Brigitte Markovic.
   On the second day of the hearing, Mr Cooke said the search order should remain and the bid to overturn it was 
"ill-conceived".
   The evidence before Justice Perry revealed a strong case by Fortescue and the very real risk that documents 
would be destroyed, hidden or squirrelled away if search orders were not granted, the barrister said.
   Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen had admitted copying confidential material to their personal devices 
before they resigned.

   But they have provided various reasons as to why this action was legitimate, such as being ordered to do so while 
working from home or fearing they would lose access to Fortescue's IT systems.
   These explanations were "inherently improbable and implausible", Mr Cooke said.
   The Element Zero directors did not respond to evidence suggesting they had access to confidential information 
used to establish the startup, the court was told.
   Those secrets included a patent proposal for iron-ore processing technology discussed while they were at 
Fortescue in December 2020.
   Dr Kolodziejczyk had been "too scared" to address these issues front-on because he knew that nothing he could 
say would help him defend the lawsuit, Mr Cooke said.
   Other evidence of the alleged use of confidential information included analysis showing Element Zero could not 
have established a pilot plant for processing green iron - as it did so in 26 months - without significant help from 
knowledge gained at Fortescue.
   "The respondents feared to address the matter by direct evidence because this would have exposed facts 
unfavourable to them,? Mr Cooke said.
   In the lawsuit, Element Zero and the executives have been accused of breach of contract, copyright infringement, 
breach of corporations and consumer law, and breach of their fiduciary duties.
   Fortescue is seeking damages or compensation, which could include any profits gained by Element Zero from 
the allegedly stolen invention.
   Fortescue is planning to produce green iron from its Christmas Creek site in the Pilbara region of Western 
Australia by the end of 2025.
   The hearing continues.

Andrew Forrest's Fortescue "painted" his former executives as shady actors who were planning to snatch the 
mining giant's green iron secrets in order to convince a judge she should allow the company to execute raids on 
their homes and offices, the Federal Court has heard.
Directors of Fortescue's would-be green steel rival Element Zero, including former Fortescue chief scientist Bart 
Kolodziejczyk, staff member Bjorn Winther-Jensen and long-term Andrew Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman, 
made the claims on Monday as they tried to convince Federal Court judge Brigitte Markovic why extraordinary 
search orders granted to Fortescue should be thrown out, arguing they should not have been granted. The search 
orders, obtained by Fortescue in May, were granted by judge Melissa Perry based on allegations the men stole 
Fortescue's intellectual property, including claims that Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen deleted emails and 
documents relating to the green steel concept from their personal laptops just before they resigned.
But the Federal Court heard on Monday that Justice Perry was not told the men were instructed to work from home 
in the weeks before they left Fortescue, and since their IT access was cut off they were forced to work on their own 
devices and asked to delete some documents because there were copies.
"Her Honour is reading that material and no doubt thinking this is a classic former employee case that people on the 
way out the door â€¦ having resigned, have made off with highly confidential information," Element Zero barrister 
David Studdy SC said.
Earlier, Mr Studdy said Justice Perry was repeatedly told the ex-Fortescue executives engaged in "industrial scale 
misuse" of the mining giant's confidential -information.
"That phrase â€¦ cannot be excused as a throwaway line or a barrister flourish. Her Honour was being informed 
from the outset â€¦ that in effect the respondents were dishonest," the court heard.
As well, Mr Studdy said there was "no evidence they actually took documents, stole or made off with (the 
documents) unlawfully", but that was precisely the "picture that has been painted to Her Honour (Justice Perry)".

Fortescue 'portrayed former execs as dishonest', court told
Instead, the men were required to "finalise outstanding intellectual property work" in the weeks after they resigned, 
the court heard. Mr Studdy said that during raids on the homes and offices of Dr Kolodziejczyk, Dr Winther-Jensen 
and Element Zero, private material not relevant to the legal dispute was taken, including the entire contents of 
Element Zero's server, personal Google accounts used for emails, contents of personal mobile phones, a laptop 
and hardware required to run "particular experiments" conducted by Element Zero. Mr Studdy said his clients were 
"very concerned" a large amount of private and "highly confidential" material, including some belonging to third 
parties, was taken.
It was also alleged that Mr Masterman, who is a party to the proceedings, was discussing Element Zero technology 
with Fortescue up until February this year to explain how it worked, but Justice Perry was not told about this.
Justice Markovic said that even if the search orders were discharged, "the fact is you can't undo what's been done".
Mr Studdy responded that if his clients were successful, then the material collected from their homes and offices 
could at least be returned to them and taken out of the hands of independent solicitors.
"The material non-disclosure and inaccurate and misleading information put before the court caused Her Honour 
â€¦ to find a strong primary case contrary to the true position," he said.
The extraordinary legal fight between Fortescue and Element Zero was revealed in July, weeks after the raids 
were carried out. Fortescue hired a private eye, Robert Lancaster, to spy on Element Zero staff and their families, 
including rummaging through their mail, following wives of the directors to Kmart and taking pictures of their 
children. Fortescue's barrister Julian Cooke will defend his client's position on Tuesday when the matter returns to 
court.

Fund managers including Ellerston Capital's Chris Kourtis and brokers are turning bullish on Andrew Forrest's 
Fortescue, despite the slumping iron ore price weighing heavily on the longtime ASX pariah.
In the past two weeks, four equity research firms - Citi, Morningstar, JPMorgan and Morgans Financial - have 
upgraded their outlook for the iron ore giant, all citing Fortescue's beaten-up share price as attractive for investors.
Likewise, Mr Kourtis, portfolio manager at Ellerston Capital, told investors this month he had switched out the fund's 
holding in BHP for a stake in Fortescue, noting the latter had fallen much harder than its peers this year.
"Following the sharp de-rating, we believe FMG now offers a compelling entry point at current bombed-out levels," 
Mr Kourtis told investors, adding this was the first time the fund had owned the stock.
Analysis by The Australian Financial Review earlier this year found that Fortescue was the least-held of the ASX's 
10 largest companies by Australian fund managers. That trend appears to have continued, according to a report 
from JPMorgan, which ranked the miner as the "most unloved" stock among Australian hedge funds.
That may start to change, however, with three buy ratings on Fortescue shares, marking the most bullish outlook 
on the stock from analysts in more than 18 months. Morningstar upgraded its Fortescue rating to hold.
Last week, Citi analysts said the company's 100 per cent iron ore exposure had "proved problematic", but it 
nonetheless slapped a buy rating on the shares given the historically cheap price.
"[We] upgrade to buy given the depth of the valuation discount rather than our still cautious iron ore view," Citi 
analysts told investors last week.
The slew of buy ratings follows a 41 per cent decline in Fortescue shares since the start of the year, outpacing a 
retreat in iron ore peers BHP and Rio Tinto, which have fallen 21 per cent and 19 per cent respectively in 2024.
The shares have been weighed down by falling iron ore prices, which was down as much as 30 per cent this year 
on slowing global growth and waning demand from China's property sector.

Weak share price lures funds to Fortescue Iron ore
The weaker commodity price arrives at an already challenging time for Fortescue, which last month delayed its 
much-hyped push into green hydrogen and continues to battle a federal court case relating to an IP feud with three 
former executives.
Further, signs that longtime funding partner US-based Capital Group has been selling billions of dollars in shares 
have also hurt investor confidence in recent weeks.
Despite the headwinds, Mr Kourtis said the bearish outlook was reflected in its already-weak share price.
"Negative sentiment around sluggish but flat Chinese steel demand, elevated China port inventory and an 
improving iron ore supply outlook from West Africa have weighed on the big three Australian iron ore producers," he 
said.
"However, we believe the valuation buffer now accounts for much of the risk to spot prices moving below $US100 a 
tonne."
While the steepening sell-off in iron ore and mining shares - the commodity fell 9 per cent last week to trade well 
below $US100 a tonne - caught Fortescue buyers off guard, it was profitable for some hedge funds. Those include 
Sydney's Sage Capital, which said its short against Fortescue was the top contributor to returns last month.
Looking ahead, Sage Capital portfolio manager Sean Fenton said he remained bearish on the outlook for iron ore. 
"We anticipate iron ore and lithium to remain weak due to excess industrial capacity created in China due to 
domestic policy that encourages the economy to diversify away from housing," he said.
Others also remain cautious, with nine of the 16 equity analysts covering the stock sticking with a sell rating. UBS 
reiterated its sell recommendation this week, saying the iron ore miner was more exposed to further weakness in 
the iron ore price than diversified miners BHP or Rio Tinto.

Lawyers for Andrew Forrest's Fortescue are doubling down on their legal fight against the company's would-be 
"green iron" competitor, telling the Federal Court they were justified securing extraordinary orders to raid their rival's 
homes and offices after an extensive surveillance operation.
The dispute broke out after Federal Court judge Melissa Perry granted search orders to Fortescue in May, allowing 
the mining giant to take information including mobile phones, laptops and personal Google accounts belonging to 
former Fortescue executives Bart Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn Winther-Jensen and long-term Forrest lieutenant Michael 
Masterman and their green iron start-up, Element Zero.
Fortescue alleged the three men who founded Element Zero stole the mining giant's confidential intellectual 
property; that being how to produce so-called green iron - a carbon dioxide-free technology - to launch their own 
company.
On Tuesday, Fortescue barrister Julian Cooke SC said the scope of items taken from Ele-ment Zero properties 
and businesses was necessary and the "extent" of a surveillance operation carried out by private investigator 
Robert Lancaster before the raids was a "collateral issue".
"(There was) a real risk if information (about the pending court case) was provided in advance, there was a real risk 
that information might have been destroyed, hidden or squirrelled away," Mr Cooke said.
Later, Mr Cooke said Element Zero's argument that Fortescue's surveillance - which included following the wives of 
Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen to Kmart, rummaging through their mail and taking pictures of Element 
Zero offices and plant - was conducted in "bad faith" should be rejected.
"It's true the private investigator reports are detailed, but so what?" he said. "They reflect the standard basis on 
which reports are commissioned." In their bid to have the search orders thrown out, Element Zero barrister David 
Studdy SC on Monday argued that Fortescue failed to tell Justice Perry that Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-
Jensen were instructed to work from home in the weeks before they left Fortescue, and since their IT access was 
cut off they were forced to work on their own devices and asked to delete some documents because there were

copies. Mr Cooke said Element Zero's bid to have the search orders discharged was a "cynical attempt" to prevent 
his client from viewing material seized in raids and to delay filing their defence.
"The discharge application has been a monumental waste of time and is a distraction from the real issues to be 
decided," he said.
Documents and emails referred to intellectual property concepts about "green" projects, including the green iron 
concept, the court was told. Mr Cooke said the evidence before Justice Perry supported her conclusion that 
Fortescue had a "strong prima facie case" in favour of granting the search orders.
Significantly, he denied Ele-ment Zero's claim that Justice Perry should have been told they were co-operating with 
Fortescue to allay the mining giant's concerns in December last year and January this year by meeting with it to 
discuss technical differences between the organisations' green technologies - before she approved the search 
orders.
"Mr Masterman was co-operating because he wanted to persuade Fortescue there were no relevant similarities 
between the Element Zero electrochemical reduction process and the Fortescue electrochemical reduction process 
so that Fortescue would not bring a case on any such claim," Mr Cooke said.
"Fortescue's pleaded case â€¦ is (not) that the Element Zero process is the same or similar to the Fortescue 
particle process.
"Rather, the respondent misused what's defined as the Fortescue Confidential information - the ionic liquid 
research and development which is fundamentally different from the Fortescue particle process." Mr Cooke said 
Fortescue also claims Element Zero misused its confidential plant information.
Mr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk were in court for Tuesday's hearing. Federal Court judge Brigitte Markovic has 
reserved her judgment in the interlocutory matter.

Analysts are warning investors against jumping back into the beaten-up mining giants, given Beijing is offering little 
hope of stabilising China's property crisis, presenting a continuing headwind for commodity prices.
The red flag from Morningstar comes as iron ore's spot prices hover near a two-year low of about $US95 a tonne. 
Prices have plunged more than 30 per cent this year as weakness in China's construction activity hurts steel 
demand, leaving mills unprofitable and unwilling to buy the commodity.
That has whacked the valuations of the sharemarket's largest mining stocks - BHP and Rio Tinto are down about 
20 per cent this year, and Fortescue has plunged more than 40 per cent.
Although the Chinese government has increased support for its property sector, Morningstar believes much more 
needs to be done to stabilise the industry and trigger a sustained rebound in mining shares.
"The price falls are justified in our view and are a rational reaction to demand headwinds from China. All three 
miners were overvalued. They are now fairly valued," said Morningstar equity analyst Jon Mills.
"There is little for an investor to do but hope for a turnaround in China. We think that is unlikely."
The bearish outlook chimes with that of the hedge fund industry, which has been targeting iron ore stocks. Short 
positions in Rio Tinto are sitting at the highest level in at least three years and bets against Mineral Resources have 
hit a record.
It's also been fuelled by a wave of short-sellers in Asia pulling money out of poor-performing Chinese equities and 
redirecting the funds into targeting Australian mining stocks.
"Asian hedge funds have been aggressively shorting Australian resource stocks as a proxy for what they expect to 
see from China - weak growth," said Bell Potter strategist Richard Coppleson.
Analysts also agree that Fortescue is the most vulnerable to lower iron ore prices, given it is a pure-play producer 
and its margins sit well below rivals BHP and Rio Tinto. That is partly because Fortescue sells a lower-grade 
Page 2 of 2
BHP, Rio Tinto still at risk from China crisis Iron ore
product compared with the 62 per cent iron ore benchmark. This means it costs more for customers because of the 
waste created when transporting and processing the ore, the additional energy/coal per unit of steel, and lower 
blast furnace productivity.
This results in a lower realised price compared with the benchmark. In the 10 years to June, Fortescue realised a 
23 per cent discount compared with the benchmark price.
While the eventual ramp-up of Fortescue's higher-grade Iron Bridge joint venture will help, Morningstar warns that 
the company's margins will fall more than its rivals if iron ore prices continue to decline.
However, not everyone agrees. Some fund managers - including Ellerston Capital's Chris Kourtis - and brokers are 
turning bullish on Fortescue, citing its low share price as an attractive entry point for investors. Morningstar has 
also flagged the risk from BHP's exposure to the Chinese economy, given the mining giant's earnings are 
dominated by iron ore and copper.
"With demand for many commodities likely to soften as the China boom ends, particularly iron ore... we think the 
outlook is for earnings to materially decline," Mr Mills said.
BHP is regarded as the most resilient to weaker iron ore prices because of its low-cost and high-quality assets, 
making it one of the few miners that remains profitable through the commodity cycle.
It's why UBS has nominated it as the best option for investors amid weaker prices, but it also warns that the stock's 
price-to-earnings ratio is trading up towards its long-term average.
"On a historical basis, BHP does not appear to be especially cheap currently," said UBS analyst Lachlan Shaw, 
who has a "neutral" rating on the stock.
The broker has the same recommendation for Rio Tinto, and notes that both companies will derive about 30 to 40 
per cent of their earnings outside iron ore in the next two years.
The share prices of both closely follow the iron ore price, given it is the core driver of earnings - a trend UBS 
expects to continue until that equation changes.
That could spell further trouble for both stocks - some analysts predict that iron ore prices will drop below $US90 a 
tonne.

More details about the extraordinary surveillance detail placed on ex-Fortescue executives amid a court blow-up 
can be revealed, as news emerges that multiple "operatives" spied on homes for up to 17 hours per day in the lead 
up to raids.
The Federal Court released a tranche of evidence lodged in the intellectual property war between Andrew Forrest's 
Fortescue and its would-be green steel competitor, Element Zero on Thursday.
A brawl has broken out between the mining giant and its former staff Bart Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn Winther-Jensen and 
long-term Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman over allegations they stole Fortescue's green technology secrets 
to launch a rival.
In one affidavit, a solicitor acting for Element Zero, Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman said the level of 
surveillance conducted on the men was "highly invasive" and not necessary to confirm their location before raids 
were executed on their properties to preserve information.
"The surveillance reports indicate that surveillance was conducted on Mr Masterman's residential premises in 
Sydney and Perth, as well as surveillance on Mr Masterman personally," it read.
"I am not aware of any reason why it was necessary to conduct surveillance on Mr Master-man, given Mr 
Masterman was not a recipient of a search order.
"I note â€¦ the private investigator searched Mr Masterman's garbage bin and mail box and followed an elderly lady 
who parked on Mr Masterman's front lawn to Officeworks." As well, the solicitor said Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr 
Winther-Jensen's residences were under "heavy surveillance" between April 21 and May 12, typically for about 14 
hours a day but up to 17 hours a day.
"Surveillance operatives followed Dr Kolodziejczyk closely including to his son's daycare â€¦ and Dr Winther-Jensen 
to parks, shopping centres and to a cancer awareness charity event," the solicitor said.

Later he said: "Based on my review of the surveillance reports, I believe additional surveillance was carried out on 
Mr Masterman that has not been disclosed by Fortescue." Other details about the surveillance missions were 
revealed, including that Element Zero staff were followed by private investigators to their residences and shops 
after leaving the office.
As well, Element Zero's cleaners were followed by "Fortescue's surveillance operatives" and title searches were 
obtained of people who visited Element Zero's office, according to the affidavit.
The affidavit claimed the surveillance reports showed at least 685 hours of surveillance was carried out on the men 
and their families and staff between April 21 and May 12. A Federal Court judge has reserved her decision on 
whether or not the search orders obtained by Fortescue should be thrown out.

An army of short-sellers is nervously watching the rebound in iron ore prices this week amid signs Beijing will 
introduce more measures to stabilise China's property crisis.
The iron ore spot price has climbed for three sessions to trade at $US97.90 a tonne, according to S&P Global 
Platts. Futures added 0.8 per cent to $US99.25 a tonne yesterday, and have bounced more than 7 per cent from 
last week's two-year low of $US91.45.
The swift rebound follows a 9 per cent plunge in prices last week, which added fresh momentum to Asian hedge 
funds targeting Australia's largest mining stocks.
Short positions in Mineral Resources hit record levels this week, and bets against Rio Tinto are at the highest in 
more than three years.
That trade has paid off, with BHP, Rio Tinto, Fortescue and MinRes down more than 20 per cent this year, but 
there are signs of that unwinding after all four miners rallied on Wednesday.
BHP jumped 2.6 per cent from its low, Rio Tinto gained 2.7 per cent, Fortescue 4.9 per cent and MinRes 7.5 per 
cent. All four extended those gains yesterday. "Asian hedge funds were still shorting Aussie resource stocks 
[yesterday morning], but as they saw iron ore still rallying, it looked like they went to the sidelines to see if this is a 
false recovery, or it keeps going and takes iron ore back above $US100," said Bell Potter strategist Richard 
Coppleson.
That "would be a disaster for all the shorts and see some trying to cover".
Iron ore's rapid turnaround has been triggered by reports that Beijing is considering a new funding option for local 
governments to buy unsold homes. It would involve the issue of so-called special bonds, which are currently 
restructured for use in infrastructure and environmental projects.
The potential support follows a series of rescue packages that have failed to stabilise China's real estate market - a 
big source of iron ore demand.
Page 2 of 2

That included 500 billion yuan ($104 billion) of funding to purchase excess housing inventory for conversion to 
affordable homes. But with market estimates indicating that between 2.5 trillion yuan and 7 trillion yuan is needed to 
absorb the excess housing in China's property sector, traders have been left disappointed.
Analysts remain divided on the direction of iron ore prices and mining stocks from here.
Morgan Stanley strategists told clients yesterday they did not expect iron ore to stay under $US100 a tonne for 
longer than one to two months because lower prices would force higher-cost producers to curtail supply.
The broker estimated that about 80 million tonnes of production was making losses at current prices, with about 93 
per cent of that coming from Chinese supply.
Morgan Stanley also said the increase in supply from Australia and Brazil in the first half, which weighed on prices, 
looks to have passed.
"Although a rebound in iron ore prices will benefit all iron ore miners, it is likely to benefit higher-cost miners more," 
noted its equity analyst Rahul Anand.
For that reason, the broker prefers Minerals Resources followed by Rio Tinto. It has an "overweight" rating on both 
stocks.
It is "equal weight" BHP and remains "underweight" Fortescue given the company's continued spending on green 
energy, which threatens its free cash flow generation and future dividend payouts.
That stands in contrast to some fund managers - including Ellerston Capital's Chris Kourtis, who sold his fund's 
BHP stake to buy Fortescue, and other brokers who have upgraded the stock to a buy.
Morningstar also warned investors this week it was too early to jump back into beaten-up mining stocks, given 
Beijing had offered little hope of stabilising China's property sector.
And Westpac, which has been one of the most vocal iron ore bears, is sticking with its view that prices of the 
commodity will drop below $US90 a tonne this year.
"If we do see iron ore back into the late $US90s, we want to sell it again for that coming drop into the $US80s," said 
Westpac's head of commodity and carbon strategy Robert Rennie.

For everything written about the iron ore price and its dip below $US100 a tonne, one statistic stands out.
Only 1 per cent of Chinese steel mills are currently profitable.
One per cent - that's hard to fathom. Yes, it is not unusual for Chinese steel mills to operate at a loss, but for only 1 
per cent to be making money is ridiculously low and unlike anything seen in the past five years.
The 1 per cent statistic comes from a survey by Mysteel, a Chinese reporting agency.
The survey also showed these steel mills' hot metal output had dropped materially - much more than at the same 
time last year.
Goldman Sachs' commodities research team picked it up and said iron ore's "fundamental outlook remains bleak". 
They called the past week's recovery rally - where iron ore bounced off its $US92 ($135) a tonne low to the high 
$US90s - "unsustainable".
"While both port and in-plant iron ore stocks declined this week, visible stocks remain elevated compared to 
'normal' August levels," the broker said. "And mills' destocking (despite the drop in iron ore prices) could be an 
indication of a negative production outlook."
Goldman struggles to see how iron ore can go back above $US100 without a material increase in hot metal 
production.
Why? Because on the supply side of the ledger, supply is strong - just ask Australia's big three listed iron ore 
miners, or Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting.
And iron ore may need to stay below $US100 a tonne for a while to shake out some of the lower-quality miners (not 
our big four) and lead to any sort of supply-side response.

The 1 per cent that should spell fear
Compounding the price fall is that Chinese iron ore stocks at ports and mills are near six-year highs - which means 
they have plenty of stock sitting around even if that supply-side shake-out does arrive.
Some iron ore watchers are calling it the end of the greatest commodity boom this century; one that has been 
especially good to Australia.
They don't think China has a rabbit to pull out of the hat - something that would spark construction and demand for 
steel - as it has repeatedly done when required in the past 15 years.
It creates an interesting backdrop for BHP and Fortescue's full-year results, due tomorrow and on Wednesday.
The last time we heard from Fortescue, chief executive Dino Otranto was phoning in to the June quarter production 
call from China and talking up how hungry customers were for his company's iron ore, including from its Belinga 
project in Gabon, Fortescue's first outside of Australia. We expect he'll still feel pretty bullish, even if data coming 
out of China is weak. It will be a similar test for BHP's Mike Henry.
How can Chinese steel mills keep buying so much iron ore when they don't make money?
On the economic front, Goldman's China property team also cut forecast property starts and completions for 2024, 
while its China economists think there is rising risk to Chinese growth. You don't have to be a genius to work out 
what that would mean for steel demand.
And it is not just Goldman pointing out these weaknesses in China. Bank of America's August China consumer 
sentiment survey found only 30 per cent of respondents thought they would spend more in the coming six months, 
down from 45 per cent in June, while income growth and future income expectations also weakened.
You couldn't blame Australia's large-cap fund managers for booking a post-reporting season trip to China to see it 
for themselves. It is a huge concern, particularly for the Pilbara miners - who collectively export more than 1 billion 
tonnes of iron ore a year to China - and their investors. The Baowu chairman's "severe winter" proclamation for the 
steel industry comment lingers.
Of course, the big Australian miners can still make good money with iron ore at less than $US100 a tonne.
At $US95 a tonne, where it was a week ago, UBS analysts said BHP had the strongest margins thanks to its 
industry-leading cash costs and higher iron content than WA rivals, and would still make more than $US50 a tonne. 
Brazil's Vale, Rio Tinto and Fortescue are next best, in terms of the majors.
UBS said Mineral Resources is highest on its value-in-use cost curve, reflecting its higher-cost Pilbara hub 
production, and early phase ramp-up at the Onslow iron ore project.
UBS says the supply-side response will come - it always does. Iron ore had traded below $US100 a tonne seven 
times since its peak in May 2021 ($US233 a tonne) and each time the market adjusted by supply exiting. The 
question is whether it takes a bit longer for the adjustment to help the iron ore price, given port stocks.
Whatever happens in the near term, analysts and fund managers have called for iron ore to be below $US100 a 
tonne for years. It is not unexpected.
While it's a big deal for miners' profits, it is also material to Australia's budget, given iron ore accounts for nearly 
one-fifth of this country's exports. A $US10 a tonne decrease would shave $5.3 billion off Australia's nominal GDP 
this year and $500 million from tax receipts, according to the federal budget papers, making it one of the budget's 
biggest swing factors.
That makes it a big deal for the country. If the bears are right, and Australia's hungry iron ore customer is past its 
peak, the country will have bigger things to worry about than BHP, Rio and Fortescue's share prices and dividends.Page 3 of 3

Body
Take two of Melbourne's most lauded billionaires, arm them with a phalanx of eminent lawyers, and square them off 
against each other over a carve-up of wealth and assets - accumulated over half-a-lifetime of marriage.
Yes, it's been a decade since rich-lister Alex Waislitz and his ex-wife Heloise Pratt - daughter of the late cardboard 
tycoon Richard Pratt - ended their union on seemingly amicable terms. Both moved quickly to find new partners, 
both equally raffish: Waislitz with singer-actor Rebekah Behbahani (currently filming a reality TV show while also 
being sued by her sister) and Pratt with former Noiseworks rocker Jon Stevens, once a fiance to Jodhi Meares until 
she had him charged with domestic assault (police withdrew the case months later).
Nearly 10 years divorced and not a murmur of any financial discord between them. Both achieved spectacular 
wealth through their joint-ownership of Thorney Investments, started by Waislitz in the early 1990s, although 
Heloise was basically born into luxury through her late father's success with Visy.
But whatever held until now as a fragile peace appears to have shattered, with Margin Call learning of a breakdown 
in efforts to finalise their financial separation.
This has been months in the making, leaving an impasse and a pile of legal letters that lawyers have been unable 
to clean up themselves.
Uglier still is the fact that Heloise is allegedly moving to make a greater claim on her ownership of Thorney 
Investments. Margin Call hears she wants a sizeable portion of the group, potentially enough to take it off her ex-
husband and relegate him to the very bottom of the annual rich list, or off the steep cliff that follows Glencore CFO 
Steve Kalmin (in 250th place, with a net wealth of $590m). Her camp says that because it was her father's seed 
money injected at the start of the business, she's technically entitled to more - even though it was repaid.
And perhaps there's some truth to this claim.
In 1991, Waislitz was given a $1.15m parcel of Amcor shares by his late father-in-law, which was parlayed into a 
$300m investment portfolio by the end of the decade. Waislitz's current net wealth is estimated to be in the order of 
Page 2 of 3
Billionairrre rich-listers in carve-up
$1.5bn. Heloise, chair of the philanthropic Pratt Foundation, and still listed as a director of Thorney, is worth at least 
double that amount, but given her family's ownership of Visy and Pratt Industries, a far more dizzying sum is just as 
possible.
The devil in all this is that while Heloise may demand a greater claim, Waislitz could conceivably do the same with 
the Pratt wealth, which could make a mess of matters, though even if he's tempted to hit that button Waislitz will still 
have to wait his turn.
Someone is already attempting to make a play on the family estate and its trust, Paula Hitchcock, a 27-year-old 
half-sister to Heloise and her siblings Fiona Geminder and Anthony Pratt. This happens once every couple of years 
or so, meaning Waislitz will have to get in line.
Mine battle Desperate not to have its name besmirched, Rio Tinto is sicking its top scientists onto one of the world's 
most influential academic journals.
They're demanding Scientific Reports, a peer-reviewed title that shares a publisher with the prestigious Nature, 
retract a paper that criticises Rio's bid to develop Europe's biggest lithium play in western Serbia.
Haven't heard of the Jadar project? It's one of the hottest political potatoes in the Balkans right now, worth $2.4bn 
and likely to cement Rio's reputation as a leading lithium producer - if it goes ahead.
Opposition to the project has drawn thousands of protesters onto Belgrade's streets and at one point dragged in 
Serbian tennis ace Novak Djokovic.
Now, Rio chief scientist Nigel Steward and three Serbian colleagues are blasting nasty letters to the editor of 
Scientific Reports, demanding it withdraw a July paper that said Jadar is "not worth mining in terms of 
environmental risks" and will "certainly destroy one of only three water-bearing areas in Serbia".
Wrong, wrong and wrong, says Steward's letter, which attacked a swag of apparent inaccuracies in the research 
paper, which, for a start, said the mine site would cover 2,431 hectares. Rio scientists say Jadar will only run to 220 
hectares.
Also in dispute is the study's claims that liquid waste will end up being stored on a flood plain, and that Rio's 
exploration drilling has already contaminated the region. We'll spare you the technical reasons for why this triggered 
the scientists but it does involve the finer points of dry tailing and storage.
To be fair, there's an abundance of self-interest at play from everyone throwing mud in this sandbox. The study's 
lead author, Dragana Dordevic, happens to be a longstanding critic of Rio's plans. Meanwhile, the Serbian 
academics who signed Steward's letter are notably featured on the very Environmental Impact Statement that Rio 
submitted to Serbian regulators.
Scientific Reports might be a venerated periodical, but, hang on, it's also made some appalling retractions in recent 
years.
One 2018 paper went viral after careful readers noticed Donald Trump's face in a picture of baboon faeces that 
accompanied the study.
Another said phone-hunching could cause a horn to grow on the back of your neck. It was retracted, as was a 2020 
study linking integrity to body weight, which, to be fair, at least explains why newly-elected Australian PMs always 
look slimmer once they hit the Lodge.
Dodgy tactics The hired-goons at Lancaster Global really stooped to some pathetic lows in their surveillance of 
former Fortescue executives Bart Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn Winther-Jensen and Michael Masterman.Page 3 of 3
Billionairrre rich-listers in carve-up
For anyone unfamiliar, these are the men who left Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Group to start a rival green-iron 
outfit, Element Zero, and who remain in a court battle over allegations they stole intellectual property from the 
mining major.
Fresh filings in the case shed even more light on how operatives (hired by Fortescue) behaved in their pursuit of 
Kolodziejczyk.
Margin Call has learned they tailed Kolodziejczyk's wife as she dropped her daughter at childcare, the really sad 
part being that the joes were idiotic enough to get burned and actually fled when she confronted them. There's also 
a Kolodziejczyk neighbour mentioned in the papers who claimed to have expressed concerns about an occupied 
car with heavily-tinted windows idling on the street for three straight evenings. This at a time when neither 
Kolodziejczyk, his family, or anyone else involved in Element Zero had a clue that Fortescue was in a beef with 
them - or that PIs were on their case.

  Iron ore and energy group Fortescue Ltd says it is focused on a 20-year mission to build the world a green metal 
supply chain - and a new industry for Australia.
   Fortescue was "doubling down" on green metals because they provided a significant growth opportunity and a 
way to rethink the entire iron and steel sector, metals chief executive Dino Otranto said on Wednesday.
   Within 12 months, granules made from Pilbara iron ores, with hydrogen derived from sun-powered renewable 
energy as the reducing agent, would show the world what was possible, he said.
   Site works started in August on the $US50 million ($A74 million) Christmas Creek "green iron" trial plant in the 
Pilbara region of Western Australia.
   The target is annual production of more than 1500 tonnes, using existing hydrogen production infrastructure at a 
green energy hub that includes production, storage and refuelling infrastructure for the mining fleet.
   Mr Otranto said there was "insatiable demand" for green products in China.
   "Australia is uniquely positioned for its next boom beyond commodities ... that's why we're putting so much effort 
into our green iron plant in Christmas Creek," he said.
   Group chief financial officer Apple Paget said the strong balance sheet, with cash of $US4.9 billion and net debt 
of $US0.5 billion at June 30, supported growth projects, including green iron.
   But progress on Fortescue's $US4 billion Iron Bridge project which is better suited for supporting green steel 
production than lower-grade ore from the Pilbara, has faced delays over pipeline leaks.
   Its first magnetite mining operation, 145km south of Port Hedland, is designed to produce a wet concentrate sent 
along a slurry pipeline.
   At full tilt, Iron Bridge could deliver 22 million tonnes of high-grade concentrate and jump-start South Australia's 
plans to exploit its magnetite reserves for future green iron and steel.
   The group's $US6.2 billion decarbonisation plan includes the deployment of an additional two to three gigawatt of 
renewable energy generation and battery storage, in addition to electric haul trucks and green locomotives.

FED:Fortescue 'doubling down' on green iron despite leaks
   A 100-megawatt solar farm undergoing commissioning at North Star Junction near Iron Bridge will avoid up to 
125,000 tonnes of carbon emissions from operations every year, according to executive chairman Andrew Forrest.
   "This is the first of more than one gigawatt of solar infrastructure that we will build before the end of the decade," 
he said.
   One of the world's largest iron ore companies, revenue rose eight per cent to $US18.22 billion and cash on hand 
was $US4.9 billion.
   Fortescue posted a three per cent rise in underlying net profit to $US5.68 billion for the 12 months to June 30, 
with shipments steady at 191.6 million tonnes.
   Hematite shipments were 190.4Mt and magnetite shipments 1.2Mt.
   Revenue rose eight per cent to $US18.2 billion as hematite average revenue rose eight per cent to $US103/dry 
metric tonne. But its costs rose four per cent on labour and other pressures.
   By meeting the future market for green metal, Fortescue also plans to become one of the world's largest 
consumers of green hydrogen.
   For example, the production of 100 million tonnes of green metal would involve around 8Mt of green hydrogen.
   But according to energy CEO Mark Hutchison, Fortescue is "realistic about the pace of the current global energy 
transition" and "financial discipline always comes first".
   "We will never make investments that are not economically viable," he said.
   Fortescue declared a fully franked final dividend of A89 cents, for a total dividend of $A1.97 - up from $A1.75 a 
year earlier.

Fortescue Metals Group Ltd has achieved its third-best financial result with an underlying profit after tax of $US5.7 
billion, reflecting a 3% increase. 
Revenue rose by 8% to $US18.2 billion with the company receiving $US103 per tonne of iron ore, also an 8% 
increase.
Despite these gains, the profit result fell short of consensus estimates of $US6.12 billion.
The company provided guidance for iron ore shipments in the current year to be between 190 million and 200 
million tonnes, nearly consistent with the 192 million tonnes shipped in the previous year.
Expected C1 cost for hematite production is projected to rise slightly to $US18.50-$US19.75 per tonne, compared 
to $US18.24 in the previous year. 
The company's iron ore division is expecting a modest increase in shipments, which offsets the green energy 
division's reported loss of $US659 million in the past financial year.
Projected spending for its green energy division is set to exceed $US1.2 billion this year.
Fortescue Metals CEO Dino Otranto said, "The team has delivered another year of outstanding performance 
contributing to the third highest earnings in Fortescue's history and free cash flow of US$5.1 billion.
"This was achieved while remaining focused on safety with our lowest ever Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate 
of 1.3 across our iron ore operations.
Page 2 of 3
Fortescue delivers net profit after tax of US$5.7 billion
"We celebrated a number of significant milestones including first ore from the Flying Fish and Hall Hub deposits as 
well as the commissioning of our gaseous and liquid hydrogen plant which is the largest of its kind on a mine site in 
Australia.
"We will use the hydrogen from this plant for our Green Metal Project, which we commenced work on earlier this 
month.
"We also now have several electric excavators operational across our mine sites and, as a demonstration of our 
values in action, our aerodrome at Cloudbreak became the first in Australia to have a fully operational, solar-
powered airfield lighting system.
"Reflecting our ongoing commitment to delivering shareholder returns, the board has declared a fully franked final 
dividend of A$0.89 per share, bringing total dividends declared for FY24 to A$1.97 per share. This represents a 
70% payout of net profit after tax."
Green energy focus
Despite green energy losses, the company is committed to its energy transition ambitions.
"We're steadfastly committed to the green energy transition and making solid progress towards our goals, while 
also maintaining the financial discipline that has made Fortescue a success for the past 20 years," Fortescue 
Energy CEO Mark Hutchinson said.
"This year, Fortescue took our first energy projects to Final Investment Decision. We turned the soil to launch 
Arizona Hydrogen, our green hydrogen project in the United States, and started work on Gladstone PEM50, a 
50MW green hydrogen project utilising Fortescue's own electrolyser technology.
"Our board has also agreed to fast-track two more projects, with Holmaneset in Norway and Pecém in Brazil 
progressing to feasibility phase.
"We officially opened our Gladstone Electrolyser Centre in Queensland earlier this year and started selling our 
electrolyser systems. This technology and our other Fortescue Zero products and solutions are key to everything 
we are doing.
"Not only are we using them to decarbonise our own mining operations by 2030, we're also now selling them to 
other customers, so they too can eliminate emissions.
"These are significant achievements, and we must continue to be focused, move fast, be agile and deliver for our 
shareholders and our customers." 
Finances in review
Fortescue achieved a total of 191.6 million tonnes in iron ore shipments during FY24, bolstered by robust 
operational performance across its hematite supply chain and the first shipments from the Iron Bridge project.
The company reported a revenue increase of 8% compared to FY23, reaching US$18.2 billion. This growth was 
driven by an 8% rise in the average revenue from hematite, which stood at US$103 per dry metric tonne (dmt).
The hematite C1 cost also saw a 4% increase, reaching US$18.24 per wet metric tonne (wmt). This was primarily 
due to higher labour rates and cost escalations related to the mine plan, though these were partially mitigated by a 
continued emphasis on cost control.
Fortescue's underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 7% year-
over-year to US$10.7 billion, reflecting the revenue increase. The underlying EBITDA margin remained strong at 
59%.Page 3 of 3
Fortescue delivers net profit after tax of US$5.7 billion
Meanwhile, the company's underlying net profit after tax (NPAT) rose by 3% to US$5.7 billion. This increase was 
mainly due to the higher EBITDA, although it was partially offset by increased depreciation and amortisation 
expenses stemming from higher capital expenditure and the commissioning of assets, including Iron Bridge, in 
FY24.
It maintains a robust balance sheet, characterised by low-cost, investment-grade terms and the absence of financial 
maintenance covenants.
As of June 30, 2024, the company reported a cash balance of US$4.9 billion and gross debt of US$5.4 billion, 
resulting in a net debt position of US$0.5 billion. Fortescue's credit metrics remained strong, with a gross debt to 
last 12 months earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) ratio of 0.5 times and a 
gross gearing of 22%.
The company also demonstrated strong cash flow performance, with net cash flow from operating activities 
reaching US$7.9 billion, a 7% increase from the previous year. Free cash flow grew by 18%, totalling US$5.1 
billion.
In FY24, Fortescue's total capital expenditure and investments amounted to US$2.9 billion. This included US$1.9 
billion for sustaining and hub development, US$271 million for exploration and studies, US$155 million for iron ore 
projects, US$224 million for decarbonisation efforts, and US$317 million invested by Fortescue Energy.
Looking forward, FY25 guidance based on an assumed FY25 average exchange rate of AUD:USD 0.68 is:
  
• Iron ore shipments of 190-200 million tonnes, including 5-9 million tonnes for Iron Bridge (100 per cent 
basis);  
• C1 cost for hematite of US$18.50-US$19.75/wmt;  
•Fortescue Metals capital expenditure of US$3.2-US$3.8 billion; and  
•Fortescue Energy net operating expenditure of approximately US$700 million and capital expenditure of 
approximately US$500 million.

  Australian mining giant Fortescue Ltd has reported steady iron ore production as it slows the pace of its push into 
green hydrogen.
   The iron ore and energy group on Wednesday posted a three per cent rise in underlying net profit to $US5.68 
billion for the year to June 30 as higher iron ore prices offset inflationary pressures.
   Fortescue reported full-year shipments largely unchanged at 191.6 million tonnes from operations in the Pilbara 
region of Western Australia, with a second-half record of 97 million tonnes.
   One of the world's largest iron ore companies, revenue rose eight per cent to $US18.22 billion, and cash on hand 
was $US4.9 billion.
   The group's $US6.2 billion decarbonisation plan includes the deployment of an additional two to three gigawatt of 
renewable energy generation and battery storage, in addition to electric haul trucks and green locomotives.
   By meeting the future market for green metal, Fortescue plans to become one of the world's largest consumers 
of green hydrogen.
   But energy CEO Mark Hutchison said "we are realistic about the pace of the current global energy transition" and 
"financial discipline always comes first".
   "We will never make investments that are not economically viable," he said.
   Executive chairman Andrew Forrest said the group remained "resolutely committed" to meeting its real zero target 
by 2030.
   "It is the responsibility of every company to join us in moving to a world that is no longer reliant on fossil fuels," Dr 
Forrest said.
   While the global shift was at a critical juncture, the Fortescue's emissions in FY24 were around 10 per cent less 
than forecast, he said.
   In the critical minerals portfolio, Fortescue has an exploration focus on copper, lithium and rare earths.

Highlight: A month after shedding 700 workers Andrew Forrest's iron ore miner Fortescue has posted an annual 
profit of $8.4 billion supporting a $2.2 billion pay out to the company founders family's interests.
Body
Fortescue has beefed up its dividend payout for the full year despite posting a modest jump in profit, handing a 
$2.24 billion windfall to the miner's biggest shareholders Andrew and Nicola Forrest.
The iron ore miner on Wednesday posted an underlying net profit of $US5.7 billion ($8.4 billion) for the 12 months 
to June, slightly below forecasts, as it battled higher costs and a slump in iron ore demand from its key customer 
China. Revenue for the period edged up 8 per cent to $US18.2 billion.
Fortescue received an average of $US103 a tonne for the 192 million tonnes of iron ore it shipped in the financial 
year, however the price of the steelmaking ingredient has dropped by more than a third since January.
The miner announced a final dividend of 89¢ a share, taking its full-year dividends to $1.97 a share (a payout ratio 
of 70 per cent), higher than the payout ratio of 65 per cent a year earlier. Andrew and Nicola Forrest own a 36.7 per 
cent stake in Fortescue.

The latest results come as Fortescue has had to re-evaluate its green energy ambitions, cutting 700 jobs in July, 
as it scaled down its plans to become a green hydrogen superpower. The company had earlier set a target of 
producing 15 million tons of green hydrogen (produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen molecules using 
renewable energy) a year by 2030.
Fortescue is also more exposed to the dip in iron ore demand, compared to its more diversified rivals - BHP and 
Rio Tinto. Iron ore accounts for almost 90 per cent of Fortescue's operating sales revenue.
Jarden's analysts said on Wednesday that while the miner's underlying earnings met consensus expectations, net 
profit after tax for the year fell short by 10 per cent due to increased depreciation. They added that continued falls in 
the iron ore price would put the miner's future dividends under pressure, forcing Fortescue to keep a tight leash on 
costs.
Fortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said the result was the third-highest earning in Fortescue's history.

Meanwhile, Fortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson said the division had achieved its two final 
investment decisions during the year to produce green hydrogen in Arizona and Queensland.
The company expects to spend up to $US3.8 billion on capital works in its mining division, and the nascent clean 
energy business will be funded with about $US700 in operating expenses and $500 million of capital expenditure.
Fortescue shares were trading 1.8 per cent weaker at $18.30 in afternoon trading.

Fortescue investors counting on a bright green sky
Investors in Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Metals Group, who just want its healthy dividend stream to keep going, 
are having to live with a lot of "green sky".
At the iron ore miner's annual results presentation to analysts on Wednesday, even the most experienced 
observers had questions about the details of the plans of its energy arm, wondering when or if the company's 
ambitious green energy projects around the world would make money.
While there was a lot of focus on the strength of the earnings from Fortescue's iron ore operations in its full-year 
results, its green energy arm, Fortescue Energy, reported a loss before depreciation, interest, tax and amortisation 
of $US659m ($970m) for the year.
Fortunately, the iron ore business, which contributes almost 90 per cent of its $US18.2bn in revenues, is still so 
profitable that the company reported underlying earnings before interest, tax and depreciation of $US10.7bn - up by 
7 per cent over the year.
On the face of it, it was a strong set of results, particularly given weakening global iron ore prices, with the company 
reporting its third-strongest earnings ever.
Shareholders, including Andrew Forrest and his wife Nicola, were rewarded with a 70 per cent dividend payout with 
total dividends of $1.97 a share - a payout of a cool $6.1bn.
But while the outlook for iron ore demand in China remains a key determinant of its future earnings in the short 
term, most of the questions in the analysts' presentation were on the plans for the Fortescue Energy business.
The word "green" got mentioned a lot. Green hydrogen, green ammonia, green iron â€¦.
The company now has two distinct arms, Fortescue Metals run by Dino Otranto, who oversees its profitable iron 
ore operations, and Fortescue Energy, run by Mark Hutchison, who oversees Fortescue's array of green projects.

TWIGGY'S BIG CHALLENGE
Such is the status of Fortescue Energy these days that the two are described as "co-CEOs" reporting to Forrest as 
the globetrotting founder and executive chair.
After looking at a wide array of potential green projects round the world, and facing rising energy costs globally, 
FMG has had to focus its thinking this year, scaling back its green hydrogen ambitions and announcing in July that 
FMG would be cutting 700 jobs from the total business.
The Energy division is expecting to spend $US1.2bn during the year - $US700m on operations and $US500m on 
capital expenditure (a significant increase on the $US317m capex for the energy arm in the financial year just 
ended).
The division, which had its gestation period in several trips around the world by Forrest in his jet in the depths of 
Covid, has now settled on its first energy projects.
It recently turned the first sod on its green hydrogen project in the US, Arizona Hydrogen, which is expected to start 
construction this year with production set for 2026, and started work on a 50MW green hydrogen project in 
Gladstone in Queensland using FMG's own electrolyser technology. Production of green hydrogen from the 
Gladstone plant is expected to begin in 2025, potentially getting to 22 tonnes of green hydrogen a day.
Next on the horizon, but not yet given the final go ahead by the FMG board, are a 300MW green ammonia project 
in Holmaneset, Norway, and a green hydrogen project in Pecem, Brazil. These are "progressing to feasibility 
stage".
The company is expecting the Norwegian project to cost something just over $US1bn, with the Brazilian project 
potentially costing three times that - a total potential capital outlay of more than $USS4bn.
But Fortescue executives were at pains to point out that not all of that would be put on the FMG balance sheet, 
with the company expecting to get some money from the EU for the Norwegian project and other investors 
expected to come in to help finance both projects. Just how much FMG would need to spend on the projects and 
when they would make a profit was not clear.
Further down the track are potential projects in Morocco, Oman, Egypt and Jordan.
Energy chief Hutchison assured analysts that the company's "financial discipline always comes first. We are only 
focused on those projects which are economically viable." He said the green hydrogen market was "still 
developing", with the cost of power needed to make green hydrogen projects in many countries economically viable 
too high.
"What we don't do is give up," he said. "When power costs are prohibitive, we will work to bring those costs down.
"Longer term, we totally believe that green hydrogen is what the world ultimately needs which is why we continue to 
maintain a significant portfolio of potential projects. There's plenty to be excited about and we are focused on 
making business decisions that make sense, economically and commercially." Executives also argued that FMG's 
green iron plans would also provide more revenue in China. Otranto said the company was "doubling down on 
green iron". He now believed the opportunity for it in China was "much, much higher than expected" following a visit 
to the country.
Beijing, he said, had recently mandated that 10 per cent of all its coal-fired boiler feedstock would have to be 
ammonia.
This, he said, would translate into demand for 300,000 tonnes of ammonia a year which would need some 50 
million tonnes of hydrogen to produce.
"The train has definitely left the station," he declared.Page 3 of 3
TWIGGY'S BIG CHALLENGE
Once content to sit back and watch iron ore shipments sail out of the Pilbara to China, FMG shareholders will need 
to get with the program when it comes to green technology - its potential and its green-sky economics.
Forrest is effectively asking his shareholders to back him in his green-energy vision, arguing that he has done it 
when it comes to iron ore and he will do it again when it comes to green-energy projects. FMG shareholders need 
to sit back, buckle up their seat belts and strap in for the ride, as they count their dividends.

Fortescue is "doubling down" on green iron, and says the market for green products generally is "much, much 
larger" than it previously believed, as the company looks to sink $US1.2bn ($1.76bn) into its energy division this 
year.
But the company's co-chief executive Dino Otranto said a massive investment into new renewables and associated 
energy infrastructure was needed if Australia was going the grasp the opportunity to capitalise on a generational 
shift in the commodities market.
This opportunity encompassed both green iron, with Fortescue, chaired by billionaire founder Andrew Forrest, 
aiming to produce its first green metal from Pilbara ores within a year from its $US50m Christmas Creek pilot plant, 
and ammonia which Fortescue said China has flagged will be an important feedstock for its power plants going 
forward.
The iron ore miner and energy developer reported on Wednesday that its Fortescue Energy division lost $US659m 
in the 2024 financial year, which the company capped off with an announcement in July that it would cut 700 jobs 
across the broader business and scale back its green hydrogen ambitions.
But Mr Otranto said on Wednesday that Fortescue is still firmly committed to the green opportunity, and Australia 
had the chance to position itself to benefit from the next commodities boom, which would be squarely focused on 
products such as green iron and ammonia.
"We will show the world that it is possible to make green iron metal - 95 per cent plus pig iron that is in granules out 
of Pilbara-based iron ore with hydrogen as a reducing agent, derived from the sun and in the future, the wind," Mr 
Otranto said.
"So within a year, you'll see us making, I think, further announcements around what the next stage of green iron 
development in Australia or around the world will look like." Mr Otranto said the company was focused on proving 
its green iron technology at the Christmas Creek plant, and would scope sites around the world with abundant 
renewable energy sources.

GREENER IRON ALL THE RAGE
On the earnings front, Mr Otranto said Fortescue delivered its third-best result to date, with underlying profit after 
tax of $US5.7bn, up 3 per cent.
Revenue rose 8 per cent to $US18.2bn, with the company receiving $US103 per tonne for its ore, also up 8 per 
cent.
Iron ore guidance for the current year is for shipments of 190Mt-200Mt, compared with 191.6Mt in the 2024 financial 
year.
Mr Otranto said it was another year of "outstanding" performance. Fortescue will pay a dividend of 89c a share on 
September 27, down from $1 for the same period last year. The company's shares closed 1 per cent lower at 
$18.44 on Wednesday.

Andrew Forrest's humiliating retreat from his overblown, overstated green hydrogen ambitions have been well 
docu-mented in recent weeks. But what's the harm in a recap?
Not only has the Fortescue empire abandoned plans to produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030 (it 
was supposed to have started on that objective last year), but now up to 700 workers who've been banging away at 
the pipedream are also facing the sack.
A sad outcome, and one that adds a dimension of absurdity to unseen photographs helpfully leaked to Margin Call 
this week.
You've heard of the comical meme known as How it Started vs. How it's Going? Well, what a difference these 
images show.
In the first, Fortescue officials lay out a tapestry of dreams to Credit Suisse bankers, in 2020, enwrought with 
details of a green hydrogen start-up that, by 2028, they said, would have an energy output "larger than Saudi 
Aramco â€¦. and growing".
Utter tosh, of course. Saudi Aramco remains the biggest energy company on the planet. To say Fortescue is on 
track to be situated in the same ballpark, let alone the same galaxy, is preposterous. The company will be lucky to 
produce 20,000 tonnes of hydrogen a year if it manages to complete its first-round projects by 2028. No one would 
be daft enough to hold their breath for that, except maybe the Fortescue spokeswoman who answered our inquiry, 
and who told us the company remained "proud of the progress" it had made so far.
We really shouldn't laugh. Tread softly, for you tread on their dreams. The second photograph features Forrest and 
a trio of Fortescue employees - former chief of staff Claudia Blanch, company lawyer Emily Ward and ex--security 
chief Damien Rogers - in front of Saint Basil's Cathedral in Moscow at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, an odd 
sight for a billionaire so fervently on the side of Ukraine these days.

Forrest still dreaming of power
Forrest reportedly seeded $750m into a fund with BlackRock's Larry Fink for the reconstruction of the war-torn 
nation, while his Minderoo foundation separately committed $20m to worthy causes.
But in 2021, Forrest was giddy about Russia, hamming it up in Red Square and busily talking green hydrogen to an 
economy that backstrokes lazily through pools of oil and gas revenue.
At a St Petersburg economic forum held that year, Forrest met with Russian Deputy PM Alexander Novak and 
apparently an oligarch or two. Regulation stuff, how could he not? Did he smack himself with birch leaves in a 
banya, too? Scope out a dacha? We'll never know.
And obviously this all preceded Forrest's withdrawal from Moscow, where he no longer has business, although one 
might argue the writing was already on the wall for Kyiv as Twiggy paid a visit to the Kremlin.
Which makes us wonder: what was he doing there in the first place?
Ex-PwC man pops up A rare sighting this week of Sean Gregory dipping his toe back into public life. Gregory, for 
those with short memories, was one of eight partners to be booted from PwC Australia in the aftermath of that 
business with tax secrets.
A year on since PwC shoved him off a plank accusing him (and others) of failing to stop the proverbial train before 
the crash, he was spotted on stage at a tech and AI forum hosted on Tuesday by the Australian British Chamber of 
Commerce.
Guests included WiseTech CEO Richard White, former News Corp exec and ABC deputy chair Peter Tonagh and 
Microsoft's Steven Worrall (the tech giant having sponsored the gathering).
This would be Gregory's first time raising his head above the parapet since the mess of last year. He happens to be 
a director of the ABCC and has been for two years, according to his LinkedIn account, which explains why he was 
running the forum.
As for what Gregory's been up to, word around town is that since the ugliness of PwC he's been studying the 
business of artificial intelligence at MIT, with ambitions, apparently, to start a VC play on the same theme. We put 
that to him, but he declined to comment.
More ACU pain Philosopher Stephen Finlay, formerly of the Australian Catholic University, was left unemployed last 
month after his position and those of his colleagues were unexpectedly terminated from the Dianoia Institute.
It's harder to come by a more heartless decision by the university and its vice-chancellor, Zlatko Skrbis. Foreign 
scholars left safe jobs at prestigious universities to be lured to ACU in 2019 on the promise of stable employment. 
They, along with Finlay, are all out of a job, with Finlay making his feelings known last month.
"My family and I are now in a dire situation, as the timing of this could hardly be worse," he wrote on Facebook. 
"While I am dying to be able to share more about events at ACU, I cannot say more at present." And perhaps now 
we know why.
Listed on Monday in the Melbourne division of the Fair Work Commission is an unfair dismissal case between 
Finlay and the university, with Skrbis and others named as the respondents. Deputy president Bernadette O'Neill 
will oversee the matter via the modern method of "Teams".
Given the contemptible treatment Finlay and his colleagues absorbed, this kind of court action would seem to have 
been inevitable, with others surely lining up to pursue the same course.
After all, ACU sold them out, along with the entire philosophy institute, to address financial woes of the university's 
own making. We asked ACU for a comment but it declined.Page 3 of 3

Minding P-2's and Q's Companies and governments live or die by the credit scores they're awarded from the ratings 
agencies. Mistakes, you'd imagine, would come by rarely.
Or maybe not, judging by a curious release from Moody's this week. Margin Call's interest was piqued by a sudden 
upgrade to Qantas's short-term credit rating from Moody's, the timing of this adjustment a bit odd considering the 
airline won't report its annual profits for another week.
But it's not that Moody's has suddenly gleaned fresh insight into the airline's credit worthiness. Instead, it has 
uncovered a three-year-old mistake in its own homework.
We'll spare you the jargon, but essentially it "mistakenly assigned" a short-term rating known as P-3 to Qantas, 
instead of P-2.
The difference?
A rating of P-2 suggests a "strong ability" to repay short-term debt obligations, according to Moody's guidelines. The 
alternative of a P-3 rating isn't exactly a deadly downgrade, but it's more like an "acceptable ability" to repay those 
obligations.
Not that this flub seemed to bother Qantas much - it never even raised a complaint. And sure, mistakes happen, but 
it does bring into question whether the ratings agencies are the paragons of exacting analysis and impeccable 
reputation they claim to be.

Young fogeys of
private clubs unite!
Speaking in generalities, the membership of Australia's elite private clubs splits by generation.
Those who joined when it was just what successful men did are often not particularly fond of gender rules, keen on 
modernising, or passing on membership to their daughters, should they have any.
It can be a rather different situation for younger members. Those under 40 ("young" being a relative term here) 
joined when it was explicitly not something most of their generation did.
By spending their time at a private membership club over, say, a pricey gym or business networking group, they 
made a deliberate choice. They don't want female members. And they get very uppity at the old codgers keen on 
foisting such a thing upon them.
Being a young fogey can be isolating. And so, last night in Melbourne, a portion of the memberships of the city's 
four leading private members clubs gathered at the Athenaeum, where an earlier vote of the membership showed a 
distinct preference for segregation among the younger set.
Call it a show of force from conservative members of the Athenaeum Club, Melbourne Club, Australian Club and 
Savage Club. It follows concerns about the salami tactics by which Athenaeum's general committee seemed to be 
allowing women into the place (most recently into the Drawing Room, to align the club with "proper etiquette and 
social norms").
At the dinner, a presentation was planned on the mental health benefits of single-sex spaces. And then, the young 
fogeys would no doubt have compared tactics and strategies.
After all, it's hard being counter-cultural.

Twiggy's 'ambassador'
left holding her bags
Even as executives fled Fortescue, one didn't leave Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest's side.
In August last year, off went CEO Fiona Hick (after six months) and CFO Christine Morris (two months). Guy 
Debelle was out from the board a week later. Some 11 executives had left Fortescue in three years. It was former 
CEO Elizabeth Gaines who stayed.
Turns out she had so many reasons to! Last year, Fortescue shareholders found out that Gaines' transition from 
non-executive to executive director as a result of a reshuffle came with a $794,856 one-off exertion payment, 
relating to her role as Fortescue's first "global ambassador".
This fee was to compensate for the additional "work, time and travel commitment" that came with her emissary 
duties. It was awarded on top of a $1.97 million payment she was given for her CEO reign in 2023, and another 
$1.05 million for FY24.
Those inducements are unwinding. Yesterday, Gaines' executive director pay was effectively slashed in half to 
$500,000 to reflect a "reduction in time commitment" for the former CEO. This is after proxies objected to her pay.
Still, a decision to remove her travel allowance is a head-scratcher. How can a global ambassador fulfil her duties 
around the, err, globe, if she's left carrying her own bags through Perth International? Could it be that the position 
was a nebulous panic title that her boss gave her so she wouldn't follow others out the door?
Besides, if the company had need of a global ambassador, wouldn't it be the bloke spending an inordinate amount 
of time crossing timezones in a private jet? University lectures on lethal humidity. Media hits in the Bloomberg 
London studio. Drone shows over Manhattan. Global ambassador for Twiggy is as useful as being spokeswoman 
for Donald Trump: you may as well wait to hear from the big mouth.
Gaines isn't the only one in line for a pay cut. Former Reserve Bank board member-cum-Village People enthusiast 
Mark Barnaba will no longer be the lead independent director on the Fortescue board, where he was paid $1.26 
million for FY24. That duty will soon fall to ex-CSIRO boss Larry Marshall.
But there are still plenty of benefits in staying in Twiggy's graces. Both Barnaba and Gaines were added to the 
board of Western Australia's Greatland Gold in 2022. Two weeks later, it was reported that Twiggy's Wyloo Metals 
had taken an 8.6 per cent stake in the gold and copper explorer. That's the thing about boardroom jobs, the most 
qualified candidates are so often the ones already in the contact book.
Gaines also sits on the board of the West Coast Eagles. She's there along with Fortescue's new PR chief Nicole 
Moody (another coincidence surely).
Gaines is so well favoured, she's talked about in Perth as the next leader of the influential AFL club. You have to 
wonder if crossing the Nullarbor to watch cellar-dwellers lose at the MCG can hold a candle to flying through Paris.
Jon Adgemis' vintage
yacht seeks buyers
What's the saying? The two happiest days in a boat owner's life are the day they buy the boat, and the day they sell 
it.
So, we arrive at the situation facing embattled publican and ex-KPMG dealmaker Jon Adgemis, who's living an 
intriguing day-to-day life riding the debt markets, holding off creditors, all the while living the life of a budding 
Hollywood producer on Sydney Harbour. Imagine the stress!Page 3 of 3
Rear Window Young fogeys of private clubs unite!
Some of the properties in his Public Hospitality Group have been seized. But in June, Deutsche Bank and New 
York-headquartered Muzinich came to the rescue with a $400 million refinancing package.
That eases the pressure somewhat. For now. But it doesn't mean that Adgemis can't take steps to show things are 
changing. And that's where the boat comes in.
He owns the 95-foot yacht called Hiilani. But unlike some of the more modern craft doing laps of the harbour, his 
Hiilani has a distinctly vintage feel. It was once owned by celluloid royalty Shirley Temple.
News has reached us that Adgemis is seeking buyers for the yacht, turning to a local dealer to gauge interest. 
Offloading the yacht is part of the owner's quest seeking a more humble, less flashy life, apparently. The seafaring 
elite are hardly affected by the cost-of-living crisis. Though this is too retro a toy for the Bondi plastic set.
However, there's always other ways to extract cash flow. Celeb accountant Anthony Bell's Ghost 2 recently played 
a starring role in Ryan Gosling's Fall Guy this year, set around Sydney Harbour. Did the studio pay for the pleasure 
to have the yacht moored in one of the movie's central scenes? Adgemis certainly has new friends in the industry.
Remember Jon: a ship is safest in the harbour, but it is not built for that.

As our two biggest iron ore exporters dress themselves up as future-facing copper companies, third force 
Fortescue has nowhere to hide. In fact, it does not even want to.
Fortescue's future is firmly Pilbara iron ore. It will spend $US4 billion ($5.9 billion) this year developing hubs and 
mines, exploration and trying to decarbonise its operations, mostly focused on iron ore. Energy - the hydrogen part - 
is slated to get only $US500 million of it.
That's not to say Fortescue wants to keep doing what it has always done. It knows China is changing - as is what it 
wants from Australia and the miners that sell it 1 billion tonnes of red dirt a year.
For 60 years, China has bought that red dirt and burnt it with metallurgical coal (mostly from Queensland) to make 
steel. It got more hungry as its property and infrastructure construction stepped up, sending the price of iron ore to 
more than $US100 a tonne, where it has mostly stayed.
But China's growth has slowed, including in the all-important property sector, its steel mills have dropped production 
and even bulls such as Fortescue co-CEO Dino Otranto see the difference.
"We're in the middle of China changing," he says.
What China wants, Otranto says, is higher grade and cleaner products to help decarbonise its own industries, 
including those steel mills. There are ongoing talks about how this will play out inside China and Fortescue is trying 
to deal itself into the discussions; executive chairman Andrew Forrest was in China for such talks yesterday and 
Otranto will be there next week, he says.
Fortescue's plan is to sell China what it is calling "green metal" - made in Australia, using that same red dirt from 
the Pilbara. It would dig up the dirt, and use hydrogen (not coal) to make a product that looks like a granule and 
export it to China (via its railway and port infrastructure).
The steelmaking bit would still happen in China - that is important - but without the need to burn coal, and without 
the pollution that would usually spill into the air and hang over major cities including Beijing and Shanghai.
Page 2 of 2
Australia's iron ore future is different, not dead
"Up until now, it hasn't been economic to do it," Otranto says. "We are on a mission to make it economic."
To make it economic, Fortescue probably needs China's (and Australia's) help. It would need Chinese equipment, 
capital and skills at its production sites, the first of which is a small green energy hub at its Christmas Creek mine in 
the Pilbara. Fortescue hopes it can produce 1500 tonnes of green iron metal a year with first production in 2025.
To get from there to 100 million tonnes or even the whole 191.6 million tonnes shipped in FY24 would be a huge 
task, requiring huge investment. It cannot happen overnight. There are plenty of sceptics - as there have always 
been around Fortescue's ambitious plans - as Otranto acknowledges. "Some of the sceptics still say it is not 
economic and 'you're wasting your time'. We don't agree with that."
To make it work, Otranto says Fortescue (and Australia) need to attract China's capital, which is looking to replace 
the big blast furnaces that have burnt Australia's iron ore and coal to make steel. He says that money is making its 
way into Brazilian, African and Saudi technology. "That's why we need to muscle our way back in and say 'no, our 
ores have a future'," he says.
The key to it all is bringing the capital cost down - which in Saudi Arabia, for example, means concessions, 
approvals for land access and the like. Otranto says the Australian government needs to think similarly here - China 
has always wanted our commodities, and the next ones are sun and wind.
It's interesting to hear Otranto talk so passionately about it on results day. Our three big miners are dealing with 
China's slowdown in different ways, with BHP and Rio Tinto spending a lot of time talking up electrification and their 
copper portfolios. The word "copper" appeared 78 times in BHP's results presentation on Tuesday, as James 
Thomson wrote, while "iron ore" featured just 14 times.
Copper does not get a mention at all at Fortescue. Its buzzword is "green" - which can be green metal, green 
hydrogen, green energy and even "green pioneer".
Fortescue shares dropped 1 per cent to $18.44 on Wednesday, following its result. UBS said earnings fell slightly 
short of expectations, but the 89¢ a share final dividend was better than expected.

Fortescue will use debt, government grants and equity sell-downs to minimise the toll on its balance sheet from the 
estimated $US4 billion ($5.9 billion) cost of its next two hydrogen projects.
Insights into the potential capital required of the next wave of hydrogen projects came as Fortescue raised its 
dividend by 16 per cent and reported a $US5.7 billion annual underlying profit yesterday.
Total dividends for the year of $1.97 a share translate into $2.2 billion for Andrew and Nicola Forrest, who 
collectively control 36.7 per cent of Fortescue.
The iron ore miner announced in July that it would slow its push into hydrogen as part of an austerity campaign that 
would involve 700 job cuts. The belt-tightening comes at a time when analysts believe weak iron ore prices will 
drive a 15 per cent slide in revenue in the year ahead.
But Fortescue has not fully abandoned the nascent hydrogen sector, and plans to bring projects in Norway and 
Brazil to the board for an investment decision over the next 12 months.
Fortescue energy chief Mark Hutchinson said both projects would, in fact, make green ammonia, a compound of 
hydrogen and nitrogen that was easier to transport than hydrogen.
He said a plan to build an ammonia project at Holmaneset in the Norwegian fjords would cost in the "low $US1 
billion" range, with construction expected to start in 2025 and first production by 2027.
But Mr Hutchinson stressed that Fortescue did not plan to cover the full $US1 billion price tag, with the European 
Commission already pledging (EURO)204 million ($335 million) towards the project.
"We would get going on the project, we would bring bank debt in at some stage, probably at financial close, of 50 to 
60 per cent, and then we would sell down some of the equity," he said of the project's funding.
Mr Hutchinson did not provide an exact cost estimate for Brazil's Pecem ammonia project, but said it would be 
"three times the size" of the Norwegian project.

Fortescue has made similar remarks about the funding structure for its energy projects in past years, but has so far 
fully funded its hydrogen projects in Arizona and Gladstone.
The company had $US4.9 billion of cash on hand and net debt of $US500 million at June 30.
Credit rating agency Moody's Investor Services said those metrics left Fortescue well-placed to invest in projects 
even though the outlook for iron ore prices was soft.
"This leaves Fortescue with significant capacity as the company steps up its decarbonisation efforts and capital 
expenditure for Fortescue Energy in fiscal 2025, while considering further green energy projects," said Moody's 
analyst Sean Williams.
Fortescue's total capital spending in the next year will be between $US3.7 billion and $US4.3 billion, with only 
$US500 million going to energy projects, while up to $US900 million of the spend will be on decarbonising its iron 
ore mines.
Fortescue vowed to continue returning between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of earnings to shareholders as 
dividends. The $1.97-a-share dividend total for 2023-24 equated to a 70 per cent payout ratio; an improvement on 
last year's 65 per cent.
The stronger dividend was made possible by an 8 per cent rise in revenue on the back of stronger iron ore prices, 
and came despite a rare decline in annual export volumes.
It was also made possible by an austerity campaign that saw Fortescue announce 700 job cuts last month, on top 
of hundreds of job cuts in the previous 15 months.
Analyst consensus measured by Bloomberg had pointed to a $US6.09 billion underlying profit.
Morgans analyst Adrian Prendergast said higher than expected depreciation and amortisation charges were the 
major reason why Fortescue's profit result was lower than expected.
Fortescue shares have lost 36.5 per cent of their value since January 1, and Mr Prendergast believed the stock 
was offering good value at current levels.
"The stock had become oversold following two discounted block trades in two months and fears around China 
growth [where we expect much more stable iron ore fundamentals]," he said.
Benchmark ore with 62 per cent iron was fetching $US101.10 a tonne on Tuesday, according to S&P Global Platts.
Yesterday's Fortescue accounts also revealed that former chief executive Fiona Hick was paid $2.4 million for 
working eight months in 2023-24.
Her resignation was announced in August last year, but she remained employed until February 28. Her pay was 
described as $327,205 of fixed remuneration, plus a $2.08 million "termination payment".

We can't help feeling just a bit sorry for Gillon McLachlan, the new chief executive of Tabcorp, who fronted his first 
results announcement yesterday after just 18 days in the role. That would be a big ask for any leader, but the 
former AFL boss was tasked with selling an extraordinarily difficult message.
First, there was the $1.4 billion write-down of the value of Tabcorp's core wagering business. Then there was the 
abandonment of the group's TAB25 strategic plan to boost digital revenue, slash costs and double return on 
invested capital. Third, he had to warn that costs are actually likely to increase next year due to inflationary 
pressures. And finally, McLachlan had to (quite reasonably) tell investors that it's too early to have his own strategic 
vision in place.
There's an element of what's called kitchen-sinking about all this; that's when a new CEO comes in, junks their 
predecessor's strategy, attempts to rebase expectations and creates room to engineer a turnaround; it's better to 
get all the bad news out of the way at once - that is, throw in everything, including the kitchen sink - than dripfeed 
misery on long-suffering shareholders.
History says it's a common strategy, and a reasonable one - but it's not without pain. While McLachlan insists 
Tabcorp's assets are strong (particularly its mobile app) and there is still plenty of opportunity to unlock value in a 
competitive wagering market, the 15 per cent fall in Tabcorp's share price yesterday was no surprise.
Now the market awaits McLachlan's rescue plan. As he said, this is a company still in turnaround mode - and will be 
for a while.
Sell-side surprise
Barrenjoey's Glyn Lawcock had a simple follow-up question for Fortescue: what's your overall sense of the iron ore 
market? Fortescue co-CEO Dino Otranto said it was mid-transformation, however "we are very encouraged by the 
diversification and robustness of the Chinese market". He said the demand for green products in particular was 
"much, much higher than expected".

Chart of the day
Retiring Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci pulled a page from the Commonwealth Bank playbook to show 
how tough various parts of the Australian community are doing it. The message? It's surging housing costs, not 
higher food spending, that is weighing most on household budgets. Indeed, the graph shows spending on food has 
fallen sharply recently, below long-term averages, as rent and mortgages have soared.
What caught our eye
Fortescue: The miner is trying to do two things at once: significantly transform its business and pay hefty dividends. 
Can it pull it off? It's walking a fine line. The good news is that it starts with a pristine balance sheet and only 
$US500 million ($735 million) in net debt (equivalent to one-tenth FY24 free cash flow), which makes funding this 
year's $US4 billion-odd capital expenditure and its future-facing projects easier. Fortescue also plans to tap third-
party investors for stakes in its hydrogen plants, should they progress as planned. Meanwhile, it is paying 70 per 
cent of profits as dividends. That is a lot. For comparison, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, which has a much 
lighter growth ambition, returned 79 per cent of profits in FY24, while rival BHP returned 54 per cent and Rio Tinto 
50 per cent. (Rio's was for the six months to June 30 only.)
Woolworths Group: One of the fascinating aspects of Coles' and Woolworths' profit results was the sharp increase 
in e-commerce sales, with revenue in the WooliesX division rising 19.8 per cent, and EBIT surging a staggering 94 
per cent to contribute three-quarters of the earnings growth in the flagship food division. No wonder Brad Banducci 
suggested the changing digital landscape was the big thing his successor Amanda Bardwell needed to watch.
APA Group: Gas pipelines owner APA Group's numbers are heading in the right direction; distributions were up 2 
per cent in FY24, and it expects the same again this year. The two big things on results day, though, are the threat 
of tighter regulation in its legacy gas pipelines patch and renewables expansion, particularly in the Pilbara. On 
regulation, it's about six months since the Australian Energy Regulator kicked off its review, which at its worst could 
put gas transmission on a similar regulatory footing to electricity. APA boss Adam Watson says there is still no need 
to change - and cites the review's public submissions, none of which raise significant concerns with the current 
framework. The fact there is a review alone has created uncertainty, which stifles investment, and means gas 
infrastructure to deal with a generational change in supply (from the south-east to up north) isn't being built. That 
leaves part of the country at serious risk of running out of gas in the next few years. It's serious. In terms of the 
Pilbara, APA has a $3 billion pipeline of wind farms, battery storage and other renewable energy infrastructure it 
wants to build, and service the likes of BHP Group as they decarbonise. How that pipeline progresses is what we're 
watching.
Flight Centre: We loved the "Turner index" - Flight Centre's airfare affordability index, named after managing 
director and co-founder Graham Turner. It tells us it costs $1509 to fly from Sydney to London, the equivalent of 
four days' pay based on the average Australian's wage. Pre-COVID, Flight Centre tells us it only cost three-days' 
work/pay ($1039), while it was almost a week's wages 10 years ago, 1 weeks' wages 20 years ago, five to seven 
weeks' wages 50 years ago, and 1 times the average annual wage when Qantas first flew to London in 1947. The 
numbers may be a bit fuzzy - the fare from 50 years ago is based on Turner's personal recollection, for example - 
but they show how much more affordable airfares are than they used to be, even if they are not quite at pre-COVID 
levels.

Fortescue is "doubling down" on green iron, and says the market for green products generally is "much, much 
larger" than it previously believed, as the company looks to sink $US1.2bn ($1.8bn) into its energy division this 
year.
But the company's co-chief executive, Dino Otranto, told The Australian a massive investment into new renewables 
and -associated energy infrastructure was needed if Australia was going the grasp the opportunity to capitalise on a 
generational shift in the commodities market.
This opportunity encompassed both green iron - with Fortescue, chaired by billionaire founder Andrew Forrest, 
aiming to produce its first green metal from Pilbara ores within a year from its $US50m Christmas Creek pilot plant - 
and ammonia, which Fortescue said China had indicated would be an important feedstock for its power plants.
The iron ore miner and energy developer reported on Wednesday that its Fortescue Energy division lost $US659m 
in the 2024 financial year, which the company capped off with an announcement in July that it would cut 700 jobs 
across the broader business and scale back its green hydrogen ambitions.
But Mr Otranto said on Wednesday that Fortescue was still firmly committed to the green opportunity, and Australia 
had the chance to position itself to benefit from the next commodities boom, which would be focused on products 
such as green iron and ammonia.
"We will show the world that it is possible to make green iron metal - 95 per cent-plus pig iron that is in granules out 
of Pilbara-based iron ore with hydrogen as a reducing agent, derived from the sun and, in the future, the wind," Mr 
Otranto said.
"So within a year, you'll see us making further announcements around what the next stage of green iron 
development in Australia or around the world will look like." Mr Otranto said the company was focused initially on 
proving up its green iron technology at the Christmas Creek plant, and would then scope sites around the world with 
abundant renewable energy sources.

Fortescue doubles down on green tilt
"Our first step is proving the technology with the lower to mid-grade hematite out of the Pilbara, because that is the 
step that really hasn't been done yet," he said.
"Right now, the green iron projects around the world utilise a very high-grade feed, and there's not many places 
around the world that actually produce that.
"So if you wind the clock forward and the trend of decarbonising our steel industry, there will be a real challenge for 
high-grade iron ore. "So the world needs to solve low to mid-grade iron ore and for Australia, where we hold a pre-
eminent position in this space, we see endless opportunities to develop a green iron metal industry here in 
Australia." Fortescue Energy co-chief executive Mark Hutchinson told The Australian on Wednesday that green 
iron plants would gravitate to areas with abundant and cheap renewable energy, which Australia currently lacked at 
the necessary scale.
Mr Hutchinson said the Pilbara was blessed with good sun and wind resources, but more investment was needed.
"The bit that we lack right now is the capital investment and getting the cost down," he said.
"And it's not an equipment issue, it's an installation issue, an operational issue, and that's really the big thing we've 
got to solve as a country, because we have the resources, it's just too expensive." Mr Otranto added that power 
"unlocks everything", pointing to the historic establishment of the Whyalla and Newcastle steel -operations on the 
back of coal supplies. He said the company was "doubling down on green iron", with a recent visit to China 
demonstrating to the company's management that the green shift was going to present a huge -opportunity.
"When I was there a few weeks ago, the Chinese government made an announcement that 10 per cent of all coal-
fired boiler feedstock will be ammonia," he said. "And if you do the numbers, China burns two billion tonnes of 
thermal coal a year, 10 per cent of that by mass is 300,000 tons of ammonia. That's nearly 50 million tonnes of 
hydrogen to get to that ammonia amount." Fortescue Energy this year is focused on four main projects: its 80MW 
Arizona hydrogen project on which it is expected to start construction this calendar year with production set for 
2026; its 300MW Holmaneset green ammonia project in Norway targeted to start construction in 2025; its Pecem 
green hydrogen project in Brazil for which the design process has started, and; the Gladstone PEM50 project, 
which is a two-stage 50MW green hydrogen project that will operate alongside the company's Gladstone 
electrolyser manufacturing plant.
Mr Hutchinson said the company would look to sell down stakes in those projects as they progressed. Fortescue 
Energy is expected to spend about $US700m on operations and $US500m on capital expenditure in the current 
financial year.
On the earnings front, Mr Otranto said Fortescue delivered its third-best result to date, with underlying profit after 
tax of $US5.7bn, up 3 per cent.
Revenue rose 8 per cent to $US18.2bn, with the company receiving $US103 a tonne for its ore, also up 8 per cent.
The result was a miss on consensus profit estimates of $US6.12bn, while revenue was in line with market 
expectations.
Iron ore guidance for the current year is for shipments of 190-200 million tonnes, compared with 191.6 million 
tonnes in the 2024 financial year.
The company is expecting its cost for hematite production to come in at $US18.50-$US19.75 a tonne, up from 
$US18.24 for 2024.
Fortescue will pay a dividend of 89c a share on September 27, down from $1 for the same period last year. Total 
dividends for the full year were $1.97, up 13 per cent. UBS said the earnings result was "a solid finish to FY24, 
despite key earnings metrics falling slightly short of expectations".Page 3 of 3

Billionaire Andrew Forrest's Fortescue Future Industries Technologies is backing a white hydrogen push in the US 
via a $22m stake deal.
Fortescue will buy a 39.8 per cent stake in ASX-listed developer HyTerra for $21.9m, subject to the target's 
shareholders approving the 3.4c-per-share and 5.1c-per-share options subscription deal. HyTerra is exploring for 
white hydrogen (and helium) resources within its fully owned and operated Nemaha project in Kansas. White 
hydrogen occurs naturally underground and is extracted using conventional techniques.
"This investment would enable HyTerra to have a strong financial position going forward; but it's the possibility to 
propel the global decarbonisation journey with such a visionary company that is truly exciting," executive director 
Benjamin Mee said.
Fortescue's big dividend payout was the focus on Thursday after losses in its energy division and strong profits 
from iron ore.
Fortescue co-chief executive Dino Otranto told The Australian a massive investment in new renewables and -

Iron ore giant Fortescue will no longer buy voluntary carbon offsets, citing doubts over their effectiveness in cutting 
emissions, in the latest backlash by an Australian corporate against the booming industry.
"Fortescue will no longer buy voluntary carbon offsets unless required by law, as offsets have been shown to be 
troubled by extensive concerns about quality, lack of additionality and an inability to deliver real reductions in 
emissions," the company said in its annual -report.
Fortescue's shift, which has been underway since September last year, mirrors moves by other large corporates 
such as Telstra, which announced in June it would also stop using offsets in favour of direct action to reduce 
emissions.
Telstra was, until then, the largest single participant in the government's Climate Active carbon-neutral labelling 
program, which is currently under review.
The telco, speaking with The Australian in June, shied away from criticising carbon offsets. BHP and Woolworths 
have also moved away from offsets.
Companies in the past have offered products that are "carbon neutral", based on the fact that consumers or the 
company itself had bought carbon offsets sufficient to offset the emissions from the product's production.
The trend now is to focus on reducing actual emissions rather than buying financial instruments to offset them. 
However, for many companies there is a level beyond which it is difficult to abate, and offsets remain useful.
Fortescue, founded by Andrew Forrest, is aiming for what it calls Real Zero, which involves using no fossil fuels or 
offsets in its Scope 1 and 2 emissions profiles.
"Fortescue has a plan to decarbonise our Australian terrestrial iron ore operations (Scope 1 and 2) in the Pilbara 
by 2030," the company says.
Page 2 of 2
Fortescue sounds offsets alarm
"We have identified the solutions needed to eliminate approximately 90 per cent of terrestrial ... emissions from our 
Australian iron ore operations and are actively working to identify solutions for the final approximately 10 per cent." 
Macquarie, in a research note entitled "Carbon neutral no more", points out that Google recently announced it was 
no longer maintaining operational carbon neutrality, having bought three million tonnes of offsets in 2022, while 
Shell has withdrawn its carbon offset targets and several airlines including Delta, Easy Jet and JetBlue have 
canned their carbon neutral schemes.
Macquarie says this is being driven by both credibility concerns and regulatory scrutiny.
"In January the European Union parliament approved new regulation, under which, carbon offsets will not be 
allowed to contribute to product carbon neutrality claims from 2026," Macquarie says.
"There are also currently negotiations between the EU member states and parliament on the use of offsets for 
company carbon-neutral claims.
"In Australia, there is a strategic review of the Climate Active certification under way, with proposals to drop the 
term carbon-neutral and tighten the use of offsets." Macquarie says at the moment, 25 per cent of the companies in 
the ASX100 claim carbon neutrality or have a carbon-neutral target, and 7 per cent have a carbon-neutral product.
"Given greater scrutiny and greenwashing concerns, we may see a decline in the percentage of Australian 
companies offering carbon-neutral products or using carbon offsets to reach carbon-neutral targets, particularly 
from companies which are using a large volume of international offsets," Macquarie says.
Macquarie says there are particular quality concerns around international offsets, and says almost 80 per cent of 
the offsets used by Australian listed companies under the Climate Active scheme were international.
"Globally, according to a Bain & Company survey of 137 global companies in the fourth quarter of 2022, less than 
25 per cent of corporate respondents plan to use carbon offsets despite more than 90 per cent having a net 
zero/carbon-neutral target by 2050," Macquarie said.
"It was flagged that more than 50 per cent of corporate respondents attributed their unwillingness to participate in 
the voluntary carbon market to market imperfections and a lack of transparency on climate impact and quality. 
Further, about 40 per cent of companies had concerns regarding reputational as well as legal risk." In Australia, 
Macquarie said that while voluntary demand for Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCU) grew by 21 per cent over 
the year to the end of March, more than half of the trade in Australian credits was being pushed by the Safeguard 
Mechanism's requirements, "and will likely be used by Safeguard entities to meet compliance obligations as 
Safeguard baselines decline".
The ACCU spot price had remained stable at around $34 per tonne, however, indicating that Safeguard-driven 
demand was not yet pushing prices higher. Last year, the Albanese government announced a review of the Climate 
Active certification, originally introduced in 2017 and rebranded in 2019, with proposed updates including removing 
the term "carbon-neutral" and implementing stricter requirements.

Fortescue: They're dodgy
Fortescue has belled the cat on carbon offsets, saying they'll no longer buy them unless they are forced to, 
because in lay terms, they're dodgy.

moves by other large corporates such as Telstra, which announced in June it would also walk away from the use of 
carbon offsets in favour of direct action to reduce its emissions.

BillionaireAndrew Forrest s Fortescue is stepping up efforts to decarbonize the world s fourth-biggest iron ore 
miner by market cap with the purchase of $2.8 billion worth of electric-powered mining equipment.
Fortescue is buying 475 emissions-free machines from Germany s Liebherr-International AG, to replace two-thirds 
of its mining fleet in western Australia, the Australian miner said in astatementWednesday. The company s single 
largest order includes 360 autonomous battery-electric trucks, 55 electric excavators and 60 battery-powered 
dozers, it said.
 This deal is expected to create one of the world s largest zero emission mining fleets and represents a major 
breakthrough in the pursuit of a mining industry no longer reliant on fossil fuels,  Fortescue said. The fleet will be 
used in Fortescue s iron ore operations in the remote Pilbara region in Western Australia and will cut costs in the 
longer term while meeting its emission reduction goal.
The contract will help both companies meet their decarbonization targets, according to Fortescue. Liebherr and 
Fortescue target to have a comprehensive and large scale zero emission mining ecosystem operational by 2030, 
the Australian miner said.
 As part of the deal, Liebherr and Fortescue will deploy a complete autonomous battery-electric haulage solution 
for large scale mining operations,  the statement said. The partners are also jointly developing a hydrogen-powered

heavy haul truck, dubbed  Europa,  which has recently made the 1,100-kilometer journey from Perth to the Pilbara 
region where it will undergo site-testing at the mines.
Forrest, who founded Fortescue in 2003, has been transforming the iron ore giant into a green energy powerhouse 
and backs the development of hydrogen for fuel. With a networth of $15.3 billion that he shares with his family, 
Forrest is the third-richest in Australia, according toForbes  real timedata.

Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest has challenged the mining sector to follow his company's lead after signing a 
"jaw-dropping" $US2.8bn ($4.06bn) equipment deal with German company Liebherr, which will convert two thirds of 
the company's mining fleet to zero-emissions battery technology over the next couple of years.
Core to the deal is Fortescue-developed fast-charging technology which will robotically deploy a 6MW charger, 
which can charge a haul truck in 30 minutes, providing six hours of run time.
Dr Forrest, speaking from the MINExpo event in Las Vegas, said the deal was likely close to, if not the largest 
single mining equipment deal in Australian mining history, and signalled that the days of greenwashing in the sector 
were over.
"We invite all companies in the mining, heavy industry and haulage sectors to join us," he said.
"The solutions are there, and the missing ingredient is leadership. The time of others persuading you that 
greenwashing is a better return to shareholders and your community is over.
Dr Forrest said the size of the deal was "jaw-dropping".
"It really does point the way for the future of the mining industry going zero emissions, and it points the way for 
heavy industry running out of excuses," he said.
"If these two companies are issuing their largest agreements ever, and it's 100 per cent zero emissions, then that 
tells you which way heavy industry, particularly the mining industry, is going.
"This is where the smart end of town is going. This is where we're leading, and we're doing it for shareholders." 
Under the deal with Liebherr, Fortescue will purchase 360 autonomous, battery-electric trucks, 55 electric 
excavators and 60 battery-powered dozers.
The deal is an expansion of an original agreement struck between the two companies in 2022, for 120 haul trucks.

FORREST: EASY TO GO GREEN
Fortescue developed the battery technology to be used in the haul trucks and jointly developed the Automated 
Haulage Solution, with the trucks employing a robotic charging system which will avoid issues such as having to 
queue machines for charging, the company said.
"All of the trucks in this fleet will ultimately be equipped with a zero emission battery power system developed by 
Fortescue Zero and the jointly developed Autonomous Haulage Solution - both of which were built to be scalable 
so they can be retrofitted onto existing Liebherr haul trucks," the company said. "This means that trucks purchased 
today are already future-proofed for tomorrow.
The T 264 fleet, about 360 trucks, has already begun arriving to Fortescue's Western Australian operations. On 
Wednesday, Fortescue shares closed up 4.7 per cent to $18.85.

Fortescue Zero and the jointly developed Autonomous Haulage Solution - both of which were built to be scalable 
so they can be retrofitted on to existing Liebherr haul trucks," Fortescue said. "This means that trucks purchased 
today are already future-proofed for tomorrow.
"The AHS, which was co-developed using both companies' expertise, also includes an energy management system 
that co-ordinates the static recharge assignments for the trucks and ensures the charger is fully utilised without 
causing queuing on site.
"Equipped with robotic connection options, the charger can provide up to 6MW of power and charge the current 
battery-electric T 264 in 30 minutes." The new T 264 trucks will begin onsite validation at Fortescue's Pilbara 
operations at the end of 2025, the company said.
"The approximately 360-strong T 264 truck fleet has already begun arriving to Fortescue's Western Australian 
operations, with the first trucks delivered to Fortescue's Eliwana mine in October 2023," the company said. "The 
initial 240-tonne capacity trucks will be converted to zero-emission powertrains before 2030.
"However, most of the fleet will be supplied in battery-electric configuration from first arrival." Four autonomous 
trucks are in validation at Fortescue's testing site, the company said, with the first deployment of operational 
autonomous trucks expected in the first quarter of 2025.
"All T 264 trucks are arriving autonomy-ready and will be progressively deployed to autonomous operations across 
Fortescue's sites," it said. "Validation of the full autonomous battery-electric solution is expected to be complete in 
early 2026." The new vehicles, once in operation, will represent about two-thirds of the current mining fleet at 
Fortescue's operations.
Fortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said the charging solution, which had its genesis in technology 
developed by Fortescue for electric car racing, was the "disruptive technology".
"A year ago, nobody would have even thought about a 6MW charger," he said. "And in fact, we've got a concept 
called boost charging in the works, which could bring the current charging time of minutes down to seconds, and 
that will unlock even further productivity increases.
"As it stands, the first-generation charger and power system combination is already a better offering than its diesel 
equivalent in the market." Other companies will also be able to buy the technology, with Mr Otranto saying there 
was already strong interest at the MINExpo event. The deal also includes the supply of 55 R 9400 E electric 
excavators, while a zero-emissions dozer is under development.

Most of the attention around the government's gambling ad reforms is focused on what appears on TV. And look, 
no one likes settling in for Friday night footy and finding out their eight-year-old has memorised Sportsbet slogans.
Everyone knows there will be new some types of restrictions on advertising announced soon, covering both TV and 
online. But what about the entirely new generation of gambling content that slips through the cracks, and in fact, is 
not considered advertising at all?
Take Dabble, the self-described Millennial bookmaker that has taken a lot of the social usability of Facebook and 
mashed into a betting account. Customers place bets like any other bookie, but they also set up social media 
profiles and follow each other.
One way it rapidly grew was relying on real Facebook pages and automated chatbots to lure (mostly) men with free 
tips if they signed up for accounts.
Then there was ex-AFL player Heath Shaw who joined as an investor. He did wonderful things, like when he posted 
a video promoting Dabble in a male mental health Facebook group that discussed things such as depression, 
anxiety and suicide.
Red flags? Pish posh. Tabcorp sensed an opportunity. The ASX-listed wagering giant under now-ousted chief 
Adam Rytenskild was struggling with the youth market, so the company invested $33 million into Dabble for a 20 
per cent equity stake in 2022. Last year, Tabcorp's investor relations general manager Terry Couper joined 
Dabble's board.
Cashed-up - and with a new veneer of respectability - Dabble keeps growing.
Take the case of Benny Scarf, whose online videos have turned him into a star. In his videos, Scarf tells his 
"punnas" he'll place 5¢ for every Instagram follower he has on a "best bet" (being a short-priced favourite). At day 
82, he's got more than 184,000 followers, so the clips show him flashing wads of $100 bills, walking into his local 
TAB, and bantering while he puts down $9000 punts, often on fringe country races on a weekday.
Page 2 of 3
Rear Window Tabcorp's youth bookie has its own viral star
Next he's watching the race in his living room, sometimes swinging a golf club, screaming at his runner to come 
home. He loses his marbles if he loses, and like the best viral videos, it's fun stuff! But yes, sure, make no mistake, 
it's promoting degenerate problem gambling.
It's made him into the industry's version of an influencer. In his recent video from the track, he's mobbed by 
strangers wanting selfies with him. One follower recently asked what everyone was thinking under a recent video: 
"Does anyone know how Benny is funding this?"
Would you believe he's getting money from Tabcorp's Dabble? It gives him a fee for all the followers who use the 
link in his bio, or by entering his name at sign-up.
It's affiliate marketing, and in some cases online bookmakers are known to share the losses of a customer with the 
person who referred them. Dabble did not return a request for comment, and neither did Scarf.
So, take a step back. An online bookmaker part-owned by Tabcorp is giving money to someone who films viral 
videos of himself spending thousands of dollars a day in a TAB. And because he doesn't explicitly promote a 
company in the video, well, it's not "advertising" is it? No legal disclaimers. Just a customer acquisition funnel 
strapped to Instagram's rocket algorithm.
One recommendation many skipped over in late Labor MP Peta Murphy's inquiry was banning "commissions being 
paid to staff or any third party involved in the referral" of gambling services. That would make the gambling 
influencer business less lucrative.
Last week, new Tabcorp boss Gillon McLachlan used this masthead to say all staff were being told to return to the 
office five days a week. Scarf reacted to the news, writing sarcastically: "Bad guys in turmoil."
Oh, Benny. If only everyone got to spend their office hours down at the TAB.
Fortescue puts words
in Rio's mouth
Grandiose claims are not uncommon for Fortescue's Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest. But when his mining company 
announced a $3 billion contract with German mining manufacturer Liebherr, it was someone else singing his 
praises.
"Fortescue's partnership with Liebherr marks a turning point in the history of the mining industry," the release 
quoted Rio Tinto chief Jakob Stausholm as saying. And he didn't stop there, further praising the "foresight and 
courage" of "first mover Fortescue", with the consolation that "while we can't always be first, we can be fast 
followers".
If any Rio Tinto shareholder thinks their usually understated chief executive is sounding a lot like Forrest, well, 
they'd be right.
Turns out it was Fortescue operatives who drafted and suggested the quotes to Rio Tinto, which never approved 
them despite them being sent to journalists shortly after 7am yesterday.
The erroneous release was withdrawn 90 minutes later, with Fortescue telling journalists the quotes were 
"mistakenly included". But no hard feelings. Stausholm, who had indicated he was open to some public comment, 
instead wrote on Fortescue's LinkedIn post later in the morning, lauding the company for a "significant" agreement 
that constituted a "bold step".
So, what do we make of this, besides the inadvisability of not getting exceedingly generous quotes duly signed off? 
Well, it's instructive in once more revealing the breadth of Fortescue's ambition. Not only does it aim to mine 
without carbon emissions (the Liebherr trucks will not run on diesel), but it hopes for the broader industry's 
wholehearted praise and gratitude for leading the way.Page 3 of 3
Rear Window Tabcorp's youth bookie has its own viral star
This is even as Forrest, in the same release, lashed said industry majors for their lack of leadership, lamenting with 
all the certainty of an Old Testament prophet how "the time of others persuading you that greenwashing is a better 
return to shareholders and your community is over".
Is this the best way to convince others to join Forrest's crusade? One may as well hope for the heavens to open 
and bestow a permanent halo atop Twiggy's forehead, a voice ringing out and proclaiming celestial approval of his 
mission. We wouldn't count on it, but hey, a man can dream.
PwC chairman sells
publishing business
New PwC chairman John Green has been a banker and a lawyer, as well as the proprietor and chairman of his own 
family-run publishing business.
All three careers are now drawing to a close, the last with the sale of the Green family's Pantera Press to Hardie 
Grant, due to be completed at the end of this month.
Prominent Pantera authors include political journalist Simon Benson, media entrepreneur Tim Duggan, and 
iconoclastic political activist Nyunggai Warren Mundine. And then, there was John Green himself, who as well as 
chairing the family business, has through it released a series of financial thrillers.
Some suggest an imagination not ill-placed in considering how, for example, wonky consultants could knowingly or 
inadvertently bring an organisation to its knees.
Consider the blurb for The Trusted, released in 2013 and focused on financial terrorists keen on destroying Wall 
Street "from the inside".
"What if the people we trust most are those we should trust least," the author asks. What indeed.
Green's author biography notes he stopped working as a banker two years before the global financial crisis, 
"enough of a lag so no one could accuse him of starting the whole mess". It also notes his status as an "aficionado" 
of "magic and mentalism".
We can't think why board recruiters don't regularly require such skills. Just think how familiarity with sleight of hand 
could have helped the previous members of PwC's governance board.

Legendary prospector Mark Creasy celebrates his 80th birthday next week - and what better way to mark the 
occasion than to drop $140m buying himself a gold mine as a present.
That's if he can wrest control of collapsed miner Calidus Resources from its creditors.
Creasy dropped an absolute bomb in July to buy its debt from Macquarie after the bank put the company into 
receivership.
Creditors will hold a vote on Friday and the expectation is that Creasy will end up owning the business, even as he 
faces an 11th-hour bid from Petra Capital to recapitalise the miner and pay him to go away.
But why shouldn't he have his own mining operation?
The guy has spent a lifetime building a fortune ($1.4bn, according to The Australian's annual rich list) out of 
squinting at spots in the desert and selling the treasure underneath to the highest bidder.
And while, yes, it's fun playing finders-keepers - and retaining a stake in whatever is sold, as Creasy does, most 
famously with a set of gold deposits sold to Joseph "Diamond Joe" Gutnick in the 1990s - the irony is that he's 
never sunk his hands into the messy business of running an actual gold project.
If we're right about this (and we are) any deal with Calidus should mark the first time his companies have actually 
owned a working gold mine. Notoriously private, Creasy wouldn't respond when we asked.
And it isn't the only late-life change for the legendary digger. As we reported two years ago, he and partner Annie 
Guo welcomed a baby, which, arriving now at the age of tantrums and bitter defiance, should make running a 
remote mine in the kiln of WA's northwest seem like a refreshing vacation.
Overpriced Libs Prices are clearly booming on the rubber-chicken circuit.
We're at a loss to explain why, but the expense of attending a Liberal Party fundraiser is getting way out of hand.
Page 2 of 2
Prospector Creasy gets his mine
A private dinner scheduled with John Howard for October 15 was originally priced at $10,000 a pop - that was 
halved two weeks later, presumably because the expense was exorbitant. The same event (on Lygon Street, 
Melbourne) is now being offered for 20 people, instead of 10, at a cost of $5000. Cheaper, but hardly a steal.
Dinner with Peter Dutton isn't much more affordable. He's down for an event in Canberra next month where tickets 
are selling for $10,000, or roughly double what Anthony Albanese and members of his cabinet charge. Dutton has a 
second event in the offing, also $10,000, to be held in Melbourne around the same time.
Are we to take this jacked-up pricing as a signal of Liberal confidence in their own polling numbers?
For an example of just how inflated this fundraising bubble has become, take a look at Liberal hopeful Tim Wilson.
He's not even a member of parliament (anymore) yet he's charging $10,000 "per plate" for a lunch with New 
Zealand's Regulation Minister David Seymour, someone who, according to Wilson, "is coming to Melbourne to do 
one lunch in support of my campaign to take back Goldstein".
Unexpected, too, that a conservative-minded Seymour, leader of the right-wing ACT Party, would be embraced so 
wholly by a moderate like Wilson, whose invitation says: "It will truly be a wonderful lunch with robust and enlivening 
discussion." No doubt. But for ten large?
The market for bloviating is definitely due for a correction. Taking a stand A low-hanging morsel from Fortescue's 
continuing beef with Element Zero and its co-founders Michael Masterman, Bjorn Winther-Jensen and Bart 
Kolodziejczyk, all of whom stand accused of stealing intellectual property to start their rival green iron business.
A veritable library of affidavits have been lodged with the Federal Court, from both sides, but one previously-
redacted number demands renewed attention.
Rat-holed inside 691 pages filed by Adrian Huber, Fortescue's senior legal counsel, are details of a confidential 
investigation that had been run into Kolodziejczyk. He held the role of chief technology officer at Fortescue Future 
Industries from late 2019 until his resignation in October 2021, at which time "concerns" were raised over his 
qualifications and experience "as represented on his resume".
That much has been reported. The short version of the story is that Fortescue alleged Kolodziejczyk - coldly 
referred to by the investigation as "the Subject" - misrepresented his CV and the former chief scientist, in his own 
affidavit, denied ever doing so.
Lesser known until now is that Fortescue was sufficiently miffed about these "numerous gaps" that it hit up 
recruitment firm Gerard Daniels - two years after it recommended Kolodziejczyk for the job - asking for its money 
back.
Gerard Daniels, it said, had "admitted in writing that they had failed to manage the reference check process 
properly", resulting in a Fortescue claim for $67,000. "The employee due diligence had effectively been outsourced 
by FMG (Fortescue Metals) to Gerard Daniels," the report said.

  Ex-Fortescue staff maintain they developed technology for green steel outside their roles with the mining giant as 
it lands a major court win in its case for alleged intellectual property theft.
   The Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest-controlled iron ore miner is suing the former employees, including a former chief 
scientist, and their company in the Federal Court.
   The court on Friday dismissed an application by the ex-employees to return evidence located during searches of 
their homes and computers as part of the case.
   Justice Brigitte Markovic also ordered the former employees pay Fortescue's legal costs for contesting the 
application.
   Fortescue says its ex-chief scientist Bartlomiej Kolodziejczyk and technology development lead Bjorn Winther-
Jensen applied green-iron technology they helped develop while working for the miner to form rival startup Element 
Zero.
   The firm is suing the men as well as Element Zero and its chief executive, Michael Masterman, who also 
previously held a key role with Fortescue.
   In a statement following Friday's judgment, an Element Zero spokesperson said the group was looking forward to 
the matter going to trial.
   "As Element Zero will demonstrate, its technology was developed independently of Fortescue," the statement 
said.
   Mr Masterman said in an affidavit he had maintained relatively regular contact with Mr Forrest after leaving 
Fortescue, including attending parties and the funeral of the billionaire's father.
   During that time, neither Mr Forrest nor any of the other Fortescue bosses he spoke with raised any concerns 
about the technology being used by Element Zero, he said.

FED:Miner's ex-staff defend disputed tech after court loss
   In May, Element Zero's offices and Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen's homes were searched under order 
of Federal Court Justice Melissa Perry and four terabytes of material was seized.
   Soon after, the group filed an interlocutory application claiming the search orders were granted on incorrect 
grounds and seeking to have them overturned and the material returned.
   "The original search orders, which were carried out after unprecedented surveillance of Element Zero employees 
and strangers by private investigators, represented massive over-reach by Fortescue," the Element Zero 
spokesperson said.
   Lawyers for Fortescue labelled the bid to retroactively overturn the search order a "monumental waste of time" 
and an attempt to avoid properly facing the allegations being levelled at the ex-employees.
   In granting the search order, Justice Perry said there was a strong prima facie case from Fortescue and if the 
searches had been flagged in advance there was a real risk information might be destroyed or "squirrelled away".
   In the lawsuit, Element Zero and the executives have been accused of breach of contract, copyright infringement, 
breach of corporations and consumer law, and breach of their fiduciary duties.
   Fortescue is seeking damages or compensation, which could include any profits gained by Element Zero from 
the allegedly stolen invention.
   The matter will return to court on October 23 for a case management hearing.

  Mining giant Fortescue has landed a major court win as it pursues ex-employees - including a former chief 
scientist - for alleged intellectual property theft.
   The Federal Court ruled on Friday to dismiss an application by the ex-employees to return evidence located 
during searches of their homes and computers following the alleged corporate espionage.
   Justice Brigitte Markovic also ordered the former employees pay Fortescue's legal costs for contesting the 
application.
   Fortescue says its ex-chief scientist Bartlomiej Kolodziejczyk and technology development lead Bjorn Winther-
Jensen applied green-iron technology they helped develop while working for the miner to form rival startup Element 
Zero.
   The Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest-controlled iron ore miner is suing the men as well as Element Zero and its chief 
executive, Michael Masterman.
   In May, Element Zero's offices and Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen's homes were searched under order 
of Federal Court Justice Melissa Perry and four terabytes of material was seized.
   Soon after, the group filed an interlocutory application claiming the search orders were granted on incorrect

A group of former Fortescue employees has failed to convince a court to throw out evidence gathered through a 
search of their property, in a ruling that boosts Fortescue's case against the former employees' company Element 
Zero.
Fortescue has accused Element Zero founders Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-Jensen 
of taking intellectual property from Fortescue to advance their green-iron start-up, and Fortescue controversially 
used surveillance then search-and-seizure methods to gather evidence against them. The Federal Court on Friday 
dismissed attempts by Element Zero to have the search-and-seizure tactics ruled invalid.
Fortescue's use of private investigators was described by Element Zero as a "massive overreach" because the 
surveillance reports included photographs of children and private homes, and details obtained by rifling through mail 
and following family members.
In July, Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest distanced himself from the use of private investigators and reports of 
spying on the children of the Element Zero founders, saying that the surveillance and search raids did not align with 
the "values" of the mining giant.
But Friday's ruling means evidence seized during the searches that followed the surveillance campaign may be 
admissible in court when the matter goes to trial. Fortescue can also order Element Zero to pay costs.
Federal court judge Brigitte Markovic's reasons for judgment will not be published until next week.
Element Zero is developing a low-carbon method for turning iron ore into higher-value green iron.
All three of the Element Zero founders previously worked in Fortescue's clean energy division, with Dr 
Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen involved in the scientific work to develop green-iron manufacturing methods.

Dr Kolodziejczyk has insisted Element Zero's manufacturing methods were developed after he left Fortescue, but 
the miner believes important information was taken from its laboratories. "Fortescue remains committed to 
protecting its intellectual property and investment in green technologies, and looks forward to progressing the 
matter to a final trial," a Fortescue spokesman said on Friday.
A spokesman for Element Zero said the company still believed Fortescue had over-reacted by ordering the 
surveillance. "Element Zero will review the judgment before determining whether to appeal today's decision," he 
said.
Separately, Fortescue has told shareholders Dr Forrest will cast his substantial vote in favour of his re-election - 
and that of other incumbent directors - if investors vote to spill the miner's board next month. Fortescue suffered a 
"first strike" against its remuneration plan at last year's shareholder meeting.

Andrew Forrest's Fortescue appears to have secured a preliminary win in its extraordinary court fight with would-be 
green steel competitor, Element Zero.
Federal Court judge Brigitte Markovic dismissed an application brought by ex-Fortescue staff Bart Kolodziejczyk 
and Michael Masterman to have extraordinary search orders - which allowed for raids on their homes and offices, 
and resulted in the seizure of millions of documents, including personal photos - thrown out.
But Justice Markovic withheld publishing her reasons for the judgment so the parties could propose redactions, 
according to orders published on Friday.
Dr Kolodziejczyk and Mr Masterman argued the orders, granted secretly in May, were based on "misleading 
information".
A Fortescue spokesman said: "Fortescue remains committed to protecting its intellectual property and investment 
in green technologies, and looks forward to progressing the matter to a final trial." While Justice Markovic dismissed 
the bulk of their application, an Element Zero spokesman said the court vacated certain orders in relation to the 12 
million files seized as part of the search orders, "including confidential information of Fortescue competitors". "The 
effect of the decision is that the material is quarantined and the parties can now move into the standard phases of 
the proceedings," the spokesman said.
"Element Zero maintains that the original search orders, which were carried out after unprecedented surveillance of 
Element Zero employees and strangers by private investigators, represented massive overreach by Fortescue," he 
said.
"Element Zero continues to rapidly advance its green metals technology, with its trial plant near Perth already 
producing high-quality green iron and the development of its Pilbara operations proceeding on schedule." He said 
the start-up would "demonstrate its technology was developed independently of Fortescue" and said that the 
company would review the judgment before making a decision about whether to appeal it.

Forrest secures first win in court
"Element Zero continues to believe Fortescue's legal action is unnecessary and entirely without merit and looks 
forward to the matter going to trial," he said.
Element Zero will have to pay Fortescue's costs.
Fortescue has sensationally claimed the men stole the company's intellectual property.
It claims that Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen deleted emails and documents relating to the green steel 
concept from their personal laptops just before they resigned.
Private investigators, led by former SAS soldier Robert Lancaster, spied on the former Fortescue executives - 
along with Bjorn Winther-Jensen - for up to 17 hours a day in the lead-up to the raids to determine the location of 
the men and whether social workers needed to attend if minors were involved.
But lawyers for the start-up argued Fortescue's spies overreached, including following the wives of Dr 
Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen to Kmart and rummaging through mail and garbage bins.
They also took pictures of their children leaving school. Fortescue shares closed 1.1 per cent lower at $19.76 on 
Friday. The stock has lost almost a third of its value since the start of the year.

Fortescue's plan to cease emitting carbon by 2030 could earn the company at least $50 million a year from a new 
federal government carbon credit scheme, but chairman Andrew Forrest's disdain for offsets may prevent the miner 
from accepting the windfall.
Dr Forrest has vowed that Fortescue will not rely on offsets to achieve "real zero" emissions across its iron ore 
mines by 2030. The billionaire has previously labelled offsets as a "scam".
But the imminent launch of the Albanese government's new carbon credit scheme - known as Safeguard 
Mechanism Credits (SMCs) - is offering Fortescue a lucrative incentive to start selling offsets to other companies.
Companies that cut emissions faster than required by the federal government's Clean Energy Regulator will be 
rewarded with an SMC for each extra tonne of carbon they abate beyond their target. Those that earn SMCs will be 
able to sell them to rival emitters that have failed to deliver their emissions reduction targets for the year.
Fortescue will earn vast quantities of SMCs if it delivers on its "real zero" goal because its actual emissions in 2030 
would be dramatically lower than the emissions allowance granted to the company by the Clean Energy Regulator. 
Fortescue will be permitted to emit about 1.4 million tonnes of carbon pollution in 2030 if it maintains current iron 
ore production rates. If the company delivers on its promise to emit no carbon in 2030, it will earn about 1.4 million 
SMCs in that year alone.
The Albanese government has signalled that trading of SMCs will begin early next year and that the exact price of 
an SMC will remain unclear until trading begins.
But based on the ceiling price imposed on the carbon credits regime by the Albanese government last year - $75 a 
tonne indexed to the consumer price index plus 2 per cent - analysts believe Fortescue could make between $50 
million and $150 million from selling SMCs in 2030.
The potential revenue boost from selling SMCs has prompted debate inside Fortescue over its hardline stance 
against carbon offsets.

Fortescue eyes $50m carbon credit free kick
Asked whether Fortescue planned to sell the SMCs it would earn in the future, a spokesman for the miner said no 
decision had been taken.
"Fortescue is finalising its position on the implications of the reformed Safeguard Mechanism and is working 
closely with the government," he said.
"We will do this consistent with our broader approach to voluntary and compliance carbon markets, which is that the 
core focus must always be the delivery of real reductions in emissions."
Fortescue has a huge task ahead to cut emissions to zero within six years; the miner's scope 1 and scope 2 
emissions rose by about 7 per cent in the year to June.
Fortescue exceeded its legislated emissions allowance for the year by about 120,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas. 
Despite the company's disdain for offsets, it was legally obliged to buy about $4.2 million worth of Australian Carbon 
Credit Units (ACCUs) to atone for the excess carbon emitted in 2024.
Fortescue says it will only buy ACCUs when legally forced to, and the spokesman reiterated the company did not 
plan to rely on offsets or carbon capture to achieve its 2030 target.
"We will show that decarbonisation is good for business and creates greater value for shareholders while 
safeguarding our planet," he said.
Fortescue estimated in 2022 that it would need to spend $US6.2 billion to achieve "real zero" in the Pilbara mining 
district by 2030.
Oxford Sustainable Finance Group director Ben Caldecott last month praised Fortescue's plan for getting to zero 
emissions by 2030.
"The plan is marked by high ambition and well-defined actions, underpinned by accountability mechanisms to 
ensure systematic delivery across the organisation," he said.
Rival miner Rio Tinto expects to spend up to $US6 billion ($8.8 billion) on works that will halve its carbon footprint 
by 2030.

Highlight: In tough times for many junior ASX mining companies, luring a "big dog" onto the share register to add 
financial grunt has become a common boardroom pursuit.
Body
After a few years of "easy money", a big chunk of the small-cap mining sector has recently found the going tough as 
global financial pressures have seen widespread interest in the highly-speculative bottom end of the market come 
to a screeching halt.
And that has required more business agility than ever, including strategic boardroom moves to try and attract 
established, big-spending partners to the share register.
In this second edition part of our occasional "Big Dogs" feature series, we look at four companies which have 
received both a timely cash injection and a share price boost up to recent highs after announcing a tie-in with a 
much bigger player in the industry.
A good case in point is Kincora Copper, which revealed on May 28 that global gold giant AngloGold Ashanti had 
signed a staged earn-in joint-venture (JV) agreement for its Northern Junee-Narromine Belt (NJNB) project in New 
South Wales' renowned Macquarie Arc region.
AngloGold has the right to spend $25 million on exploration to earn an initial 70 per cent in the JV, with either a 
further $25 million spend or completion of a preliminary feasibility study (PFS) required to increase its stake to an 
80 per cent interest.
The two companies will target the prospective project that includes the Nyngan and Nevertire licences, where a 
wide range of near-untouched, sizeable intrusive-related copper-gold targets will be tested by the one piece of 
equipment that always lets you know exactly how things are - the ever-honest drill bit.
Market punters took a liking to the news, with the share price that closed at 3.6c on May 24 before the trading halt, 
bolting out of the gates on the morning of the announcement.
The price opened at 4.6c that day and shot to an intraday high of 5.7c. It then continued its march forward in the 
next few weeks, hitting 7c on June 3 and then touching its year-high of 7.1c on June 14 for a near 100 per cent gain 
since the announcement.
Volumes that had as few as 12,000 shares swap hands the day before the trading halt, took a leap of faith with 
much higher-than-normal volumes and exceeded more than a million units in a single day for the first time this year. 
Page 2 of 3
'Big Dogs' keep adding bite for junior mining partners
A whopping 1.3 million shares changed hands on May 31 and more than 2 million units found a new home on the 
next trading day on June 3.
The Macquarie Arc porphyry copper-gold geology is recognised as a globally-significant region, with two of 
Australia's biggest copper-gold producing mines - Newmont Corporation's massive Cadia operation and the 
Evolution Mining-Sumitomo Group's Northparkes mine.
In the 2023 financial year, Cadia produced a whopping 597,000 ounces of gold at a stunningly low cost of $45 per 
gold ounce, due to huge credits from the copper that is also produced at the site.
The NSW Government recently released a report indicating the Macquarie Arc has produced more than 14 million 
tonnes of copper and hosts some 50 per cent of the State's gold endowment.
Another company benefitting from a tie-in with a powerful player is HyTerra after it revealed to the market on August 
29 that iron ore giant Fortescue's wholly-owned subsidiary, Fortescue Future Industries Technologies, will invest 
$21.9 million to acquire a 39.8 per cent stake in the company at a price of 3.4c per share, subject to shareholder 
approval.
The Fortescue investment funds will enable the expansion of the exploration drill program at HyTerra's Nemaha 
project in the State of Kansas in the United States. A two-well drill program will be stretched to a six-well campaign 
after the investment has been finalised.
HyTerra is pursuing the discovery of white hydrogen at Nemaha as it aims to assist the push towards global 
decarbonisation. White hydrogen, also known as natural hydrogen or geologic hydrogen, is a gas formed 
underground by natural processes and extracted by conventional methods.
Funds will also contribute to plans for significant additional leasing and geophysics to be conducted at Nemaha. 
The two firms plan to enter into a strategic alliance agreement to advance the project and explore new opportunities 
globally.
News of the tie-in resonated with the market, helping the 3.1c closing price before the Fortescue reveal to leap at 
the open to 4.8c and touch an intraday peak of 5.5c.
The share price bounced around for a few days on massive volumes, with 90.6 million units swapping hands on the 
day of the announcement, followed by 64.3 million on August 30 and 29.2 million the next trading day. Overall, the 
price has remained positive since, with it trading predominantly in a 4c to 5c range.
Green Technology Metals also got the market excited when it advised of a strategic investment from South Korea's 
21st-biggest listed company, the US$16.95 billion (AU$24.8 billion) market-capitalised EcoPro Innovation Co.
The world-leading electric vehicle (EV) battery metals producer agreed to subscribe for an $8 million, two-tranche 
placement in Green Technology. It provides a foundation for co-operation between the two firms, as Green 
Technology strives to become the first integrated lithium producer in the Canadian province of Ontario.
The investment was made at a significant premium to the market price.
Executed agreements cover proposals for upstream and downstream activities, including potential mine 
development and proposed lithium conversion facilities. It provides for a 12-month option to have exclusive rights to 
negotiate and agree on staged investments in the Seymour and Root projects in the expectation of negotiating a 
possible JV agreement for either or both projects.
The deal also includes the option to undertake negotiations to form a comprehensive agreement for co-funding a 
prefeasibility study (PFS) for the Canadian lithium conversion facility, which may in turn lead to a JV for completing 
a definitive feasibility study (DFS) and the co-development of the North American plant.Page 3 of 3
'Big Dogs' keep adding bite for junior mining partners
Green Technology's shares rallied on the prospect of the South Korean giant bolstering the company's promising 
projects after recent times for virtually all juniors in the lithium space that could best be described as bleak.
The stock opened at 9.2c on August 20 after previously closing at 6.4c, then jumped to hit an intraday high of 9.5c 
on bigger than normal volumes. It ran again two days later, touching 11c on volumes of 2.8 million shares traded, its 
heaviest trading day since March, for a 71.88 per cent increase after the news of the tie-in.
Like a lot of junior mining companies in the rare earths space, Peak Rare Earths has seen its market capitalisation 
and share price tumble south in the past few years. Yet, its Ngualla rare earths project seems to be kicking goal 
after goal.
The company's shares hit a 12-month low of 17.5c on July 19 prior to revealing on July 24 that Chinese rare earths 
company Shenghe Resources Holding Co., through its Singaporean subsidiary, had agreed to subscribe for a 50 
per cent interest in the Ngualla Group UK from Peak, which retains the remaining 50 per cent.
Ngualla Group has an 84 per cent interest in the Ngualla rare earths project and Shenghe agreed to stump-up a 
cool $96 million for its slice of the pie.
The market obviously liked what it heard and pushed the share price to 22c at the day's trading open after the 
news, before reaching an intraday high of 23c. It then traded sideways for a period before touching 24c on 
September 5.
Shenghe's big investment into the junior's rare earths project came after other positive developments for Peak, 
including its significant, new partner entering into an offtake agreement for 100 per cent of the rare earths 
concentrate from the project for an initial term of seven years.
The icing on the cake came in the form of a consortium of lenders signing a non-binding indicative term sheet for 
the funding of a US$176.6 million (AU$256.7 million) debt solution for the Ngualla operation.
The lump sum contribution from Shenghe will fund the development of the project, in addition to the balance of the 
project's capital costs to be met by a Shenghe-arranged debt facility - a la the consortium's non-binding term sheet.
Peak has no requirement to contribute towards equity funding for the project. It now holds a 42 per cent interest in 
Ngualla and Shenghe has also moved to 42 per cent, with the Government of Tanzania holding the remaining 16 
per cent.
It all just goes to show that adding a bit more bark can, in fact, lead to a harder bite.

carbon offsets or carbon capture and storageFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updatesGet our breaking

Body
About $45 trillion of global business revenue is covered by corporate “net zero emissions” pledges but iron ore 
billionaire Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest thinks the whole net zero thing is “fantasy”.
“Now is the time to walk away from net zero 2050, that hasn’t been anything really but a con to maintain fossil 
fuels,” Forrest said last week. 
What was needed instead, Forrest said, was “real zero”, and he was confident his Fortescue iron ore business 
would stop using fossil fuels by the end of this decade while shunning the use of carbon offsets or carbon capture 
and storage.
So what is “real zero” and could Fortescue really decarbonise a business that’s part of a global steelmaking 
industry responsible for about 9% of global CO2 emissions?
                   Attack on net zero                   
Forrest’s attack on “net zero” is not likely to win him many friends.
A recent stocktake of net zero pledges around the globe by Net Zero Tracker  found 60% of the 200,000 largest 
companies have net zero targets covering about $45 trillion in revenue.
But the analysis also said only 61 of the net zero plans of those 1,145 companies met all integrity criteria, such as 
the appropriate use of offsets or whether the target covers the entire climate impact of a company.

Andrew Forrest says net zero is ‘fantasy’ so his goal is ‘real zero’. What does he mean – and can he achieve it?
The original concept of “net zero” was for global economies to end almost all fossil fuel use and then use 
technologies, many not proven at scale, to directly cut atmospheric CO2.
But examples are legion of major corporates  buying carbon offsets, some of dubious quality, to make their 
emission reduction targets instead of actually cutting fossil fuel use.

Claire Snyder, the founder and director of Climate Integrity, said: “Andrew Forrest is right on this: the ‘net’ in net 
zero is a loophole that is frequently exploited.
“Fossil fuels are the primary cause of climate change, yet hardly any companies have explicit plans to phase out 
coal, oil and gas from their own operations.”
                   Old lies and offsets                   
Fortescue’s latest climate transition plan , published last month, reflects Forrest’s disdain for carbon offsets. 
Offsets and carbon capture are not part of Fortescue’s plans.
Fortescue says its annual emissions that it has direct control over were at 2.72m tonnes of CO2-equivalent last 
year. Most of that comes from the diesel burned by haulage trucks, trains and ships, and the gas burned for power 
generation at its mining sites.
By 2030, Fortescue aims to have eliminated all those fossil fuels with a combination of green fuels (such as 
ammonia for shipping and clean hydrogen for power generation) and battery electric vehicles charged with 
renewables.
Simon Nicholas, a global steel sector analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said 
Fortescue’s operations are concentrated in the remote Western Australia Pilbara region, giving the company ample 
access to solar and wind and the space needed to build them.
“It seems like the technology to enable Fortescue to reach real zero is either already available or will be soon,” he 
said.
“Real zero by 2030 is very ambitious, but even if they hit the target a bit late, they will have transformed operational 
mining emissions and laid the path for others to follow.”
                   A much bigger problem                   
Fortescue’s (and the climate’s) much bigger problem comes when its iron ore goes to overseas steelmakers that 
use combinations of coal, gas and fossil-fuel powered electricity to turn the ore into iron, and the iron into steel.
The indirect emissions (called scope 3) from the shipment and use of Fortescue’s iron ore last year were 100 times 
the company’s direct emissions: about 262 Mt CO2-e (for comparison, Australia’s entire annual emissions are now 
at 440 Mt).
About 97% of that is emitted in the steelmaking process. But Fortescue has a target for “net zero scope 3 
emissions by 2040” – an odd choice of the “net zero” phrase given Forrest’s dislike of it.
But could it be done?
Most of Fortescue’s iron ore is low-grade and not suitable for a process known as Direct Reduced Iron (DRI), 
where the ore is turned into iron metal using gas. But this process could be emissions free, Nicholas said, if the gas 
was replaced by clean hydrogen.Page 3 of 3
Andrew Forrest says net zero is ‘fantasy’ so his goal is ‘real zero’. What does he mean – and can he achieve it?
Fortescue says it is working on ways to tweak the DRI process that would allow use of its lower grade ore to 
produce “green metal”, while also developing higher grade ore deposits (such as its massive Iron Bridge mine  ). 
The company is also building a pilot green metal production plant. 
The company told analysts a few months ago that “pivoting to producing green metal” was its planned next step.
Once you have iron, about a third of steelmakers use electric arc furnaces to produce the steel and these too can 
be powered by renewables.
“The technology to decarbonise iron and steelmaking is already available,” Nicholas said.
“Electric arc furnaces and renewable energy are perfectly mature technologies. DRI is also mature and in use today 
at commercial scale. 
“The technology to do this at commercial scale is available now,” he said, pointing to a green steel manufacturing 
plant in Sweden. 
                   Clean power and influence?                   
But questions linger over how much control Fortescue can have over the source of power generation for electric 
arc furnaces.
Furnaces not powered by renewable electricity, but using Fortescue’s ore or green iron would still leave the 
company with scope 3 emissions.
“The key challenge is what happens to Fortescue’s future green iron production when it reaches steelmakers in 
places like China,” Nicholas said.
On this, Fortescue’s plan just says it will “partner” with customers and establish a “green metal value chain”.
Temperature Check asked Fortescue why it had used the term “net zero” for its scope 3 target and how it would 
convince its customers to go “real zero”.
A Fortescue spokesperson said ending reliance on fossil fuels “is the only way to secure the global temperature 
goals of the Paris agreement” and the company backed “all companies and governments” in phasing out fossil fuels 
“no later than 2040”.
Fortescue was working with “global science-based standard setting entities” to understand trends that could 
“impact best-practice Scope 3 target”, the spokesperson said, adding the company may change its position.
“Fortescue has a policy to not use voluntary [carbon] offsets towards its real zero 2030 target and only supports 
genuine decarbonisation solutions such as investment in green iron and other innovations necessary to eliminate 
scope 3 emissions in the iron ore industry.
“If every company takes the necessary action to reduce their scope 1 and 2 emissions, for which they are directly 
responsible, then globally scope 3 emissions will decline quickly.”

Fortescue says the Albanese government should consider tying a lucrative fuel tax credit to decarbonisation efforts 
for Australia's mining giants, but insists it is not advocating for the subsidy to be scrapped for farmers and minor 
players.
The Commonwealth's diesel fuel excise covers the costs of maintaining public roads, and all users, including mining 
companies, pay it. But companies can claim a tax rebate when the diesel is used on private roads - such as those 
on mine sites or farms - as these are maintained by their owners.
Fortescue maintains the diesel tax credit provides more disincentives than incentives for miners to decarbonise, 
and is pushing for change.
"The government needs to think about levelling the playing field so that companies that do want to decarbonise and 
shift to clean fuel sources are on a level playing field with those that stay in the current environment," said the 
company's director of global sustainability and external affairs, Bronwyn Grieve.
"It could look at structuring the diesel fuel tax credit in a way that allows some companies - the big fossil fuel users, 
your top, big-tier mining companies - to be eligible for some of those credits, only where they are willing to invest 
those credits into a proper decarbonisation program."
The world's biggest miner, BHP, declined to comment on Fortescue's proposal. But the company's support for the 
fuel credit remains steadfast. Rio Tinto also declined to comment.
The mining giants are collaborating on battery/electric-haul truck trials in the Pilbara.
The Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, which counts Fortescue as a member, said it backed clean 
energy incentives, but didn't want the fuel credit to change.
"We do not support proposals to change the diesel fuel rebate," said AMEC chief executive Warren Pearce.

Tie diesel fuel credits to emission cuts: Fortescue Energy rebate
"Fortescue has been having discussions with government about the introduction of incentives to encourage 
decarbonisation within industry. That's something that industry can support, and our member companies are 
working hard to reduce our emission in line with net zero targets."
Ms Grieve insisted Fortescue was not advocating for the fuel credit to be scrapped for farmers and smaller miners, 
"nor are we pushing for an immediate cessation or removal of the diesel fuel tax credit".
"We think there are much more nuanced and sensible solutions in the near term that can be adopted," she said.

The Federal Court has found that Fortescue failed to disclose a key matter when applying for search orders to raid 
the homes and business of its would-be "green" steel competitors, but it ultimately sided with the mining giant in an 
intellectual property fight.
Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has accused its former executives, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Michael Masterman, of 
stealing its trade secrets to launch their company, Element Zero.
In May, Fortescue secured from the Federal Court search orders to raid Element Zero properties in order to seize 
and preserve material that could be relevant or used as evidence in potential future litigation.
But Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Masterman asked Federal Court judge Brigitte Markovic to discharge the earlier orders 
granted, on the basis that Fortescue's prima facie case was overstated and there was material nondisclosure 
among other alleged issues.
While Justice Markovic threw out Element Zero's application, she said Fortescue should have told the court about 
a commercial relationship between it and Mr Masterman.
"I am not satisfied that the EZ respondents have established that Fortescue had a weak prima facie case," she 
said.
"The question is whether evidence of Fortescue's relationship with Element Zero, through Mr Masterman, and the 
discussions it had about the different concerns it held in December to January 2024 was capable of having affected 
the court's decision, in particular in relation to the consideration of the risk of destruction. In my view, on balance, it 
was.
"The fact of the ongoing relationship, and the issues raised and discussions with Element Zero in the latter part of 
2023 and early 2024, were facts which should have been brought to the court's attention on the application for the 
search orders.
Page 2 of 2
Judge backs Fortescue in IP stoush
"Those facts were relevant to the question of whether there was a real risk of destruction given past co-operation, 
albeit about different issues." Element Zero had also asked the court to set aside the search orders because it 
claimed surveillance conducted in the lead-up to obtaining them was excessive.
It emerged that Fortescue employed former SAS soldier Robert Lancaster to spy on Element Zero staff and its 
families for up to 17 hours per day. The surveillance included following family members to Kmart, rummaging 
through mail and taking pictures of their children leaving school.
Element Zero argued the surveillance reports produced presented a misleading picture to the court, which coloured 
it as "nefarious" and "dishonest".
But Justice Markovic accepted surveillance conducted by private investigators was necessary.
"As I have already observed, the private investigator's reports are lengthy and detailed," she said.
"However, on their face they do not disclose any collateral purpose. Rather, they attempt to provide information 
necessary for an application for search orders and as required by the court's search orders practice note.
"One way of obtaining that information is to instruct qualified persons to attend at and observe premises. In this 
case, Fortescue chose to do so by instructing a private investigator firm.
"Finally, that the surveillance reports were lengthy, to a degree repetitious and perhaps inelegantly expressed, 
cannot justify setting aside the search orders." A spokesman for Element Zero said it wanted the search orders set 
aside primarily based on Fortescue's "failure to disclose the ongoing commercial relationship" with Fortescue.
"Although Element Zero believes that the orders should have been set aside, and is still considering challenging 
that result, it is pleased that the court varied the search orders to quarantine all of the materials seized during the 
raids," he said.
"This means that Fortescue cannot access any of the 12 million documents and must now follow standard 
discovery processes." A Fortescue spokesman said it would continue to "rigorously protect its intellectual property 
in every part of its green energy, technology and metals business".
"With Justice Markovic's decision, two Federal Court judges have now found a strong prima facie case that the 
Element Zero parties misused Fortescue's confidential information and breached its rights, and have determined 
that there was a real risk of destruction of crucial evidence if the search orders were not granted," he said.
"The Element Zero parties sought to set aside the search orders on five grounds, all of which failed. To obtain the 
search orders, Fortescue was required to satisfy the Federal Court that it had a strong 'prima facie' case against 
the Element Zero parties, that those parties possessed important evidence, and that there was a real possibility that 
they might destroy or hide that evidence." As well, the spokesman said: "In rejecting the ... attempt to set aside the 
search orders on the ground of 'material nondisclosure', Justice Markovic found that while certain matters relating to 
prior meetings were not disclosed, this was unintentional and would not have changed Justice Perry's decision to 
grant the search orders given the conclusions reached from Fortescue's substantial body of evidence."

Length: 983 words
Body
Australia, Oct. 15 -- The Federal Court of Australia issued the following judgement on Oct. 4:
1 On 30 April 2024 the applicants, Fortescue Limited, Fortescue Future Industries Pty Ltd (FFI) and FMG 
Personnel Services Pty Ltd (together, Fortescue), commenced this proceeding against Element Zero Pty Limited, 
Bartlomiej Piotr Kolodziejczyk, Bjorn Winther-Jensen and Michael George Masterman as respondents. At the time, 
Fortescue filed an originating application and statement of claim (SoC).
2 Element Zero was registered on 7 December 2022. Element Zero is a start-up that has technology to convert 
metal ores such as iron and nickel into pure metal using intermittent renewable energy. Mr Masterman is a director 
and shareholder of Element Zero and its chief executive officer (CEO), Dr Kolodziejczyk is the chief technology 
officer and a shareholder and director of Element Zero, and Dr Winther-Jensen is a shareholder of Element Zero 
and was its research and development manager and from 7 December 2022 to 11 January 2024 a director. Dr 
Winther-Jensen ended his employment with Element Zero in December 2023.
FORTESCUE'S EX PARTE APPLICATION
3 The proceeding first came before Perry J in her Honour's capacity as general duty judge on 9 May 2024 on an ex 
parte application made by Fortescue for search orders. The transcript of the hearing on 9 May 2024 discloses that 
her Honour was provided with affidavits and submissions dated 8 May 2024 prior to the hearing, and that some 
additional affidavits were provided at the hearing. The hearing lasted for approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes. 
Towards its conclusion, her Honour said:
The last thing - this is the - to my mind at the moment, I can indicate that I do agree that there is a strong prima 
facie case that's really established by a very substantial body of evidence. And there's also, one would have 
thought in light of the matters that have been covered in the written submissions, a real risk that if information were 
provided in advance and it weren't inter partes application, there is a real risk that information might be destroyed or 
hidden, squirrelled away. And obviously, the prejudice - you've clearly established prejudice of a very substantial 
nature to the applicants in the event that the orders are not made, so that I do consider it's appropriate to make the 
orders, but subject to that concern.
Page 2 of 3
FEDERAL COURT OF AUSTRALIA ISSUES FULL COURT DECISION FOR FORTESCUE, ET AL. V/S 
ELEMENT ZERO, ET AL. CASE
And after reviewing Fortescue's proposed orders added:
I mean, as I said, I've been very carefully through the written submissions. And then having those, having the 
benefit of being taken through the evidence in a closely and in the structured way that you have, has led me to the 
view that it is appropriate, subject to addressing the particular issues I've raised, to make orders in the nature that 
are sought.
4 On 9 May 2024 the Court made interim suppression orders pursuant to s 37AI of the Federal Court of Australia 
Act 1976 (Cth) and otherwise adjourned the proceeding to 14 May 2024 to allow Fortescue to deal with a number 
of matters raised by her Honour principally in relation to practical issues that might arise on execution of the 
proposed orders.
5 On 14 May 2024, when the proceeding was next listed before Perry J, the search orders were made. Those 
orders are directed to Element Zero, Dr Kolodziejczyk, Dr Winther-Jensen and the occupants of three identified 
premises. Relevantly, the search orders permit searches to be undertaken in accordance with their terms at the 
premises and require the recipients or targets of the search orders, referred to as "You", among other things:
(1) to permit members of the "Search Party", as defined, to enter the premises so that they can carry out the search 
and other activities referred to in the search orders;
(2) having permitted members of the Search Party to enter the premises, to:
(a) permit them to search for and inspect the "Listed Things" as defined in Sch A to the search orders, and to make 
or obtain a copy, photograph, film, sample, test or other record of the Listed Things;
(b) disclose to them the whereabouts of all the Listed Things in their possession, custody or power, whether at the 
premises or otherwise;
(c) disclose the whereabouts of all computers (including smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices), computer 
disks, drives or memory (including portable drives and USB drives), electronic information storage devices or 
systems, and online accounts (including all cloud and email accounts) at or accessible from the premises in which 
any documents among the Listed Things are or may be stored, located or recorded and cause and permit those 
documents to be copied or printed out;
(d) do all things necessary to enable the Search Party to access the Listed Things including by opening or providing 
keys to physical or digital locks and enabling them to access and operate computers and online accounts and 
providing them with all necessary passwords, access credentials and other means of access;
(e) permit any "Independent Lawyer", as defined, to remove certain specified things into their custody; and
(f) permit any "Independent Computer Expert", as defined, to search any computer (including any smartphone, 
tablet and other mobile device), computer disk, drive or memory (including any portable drive and USB drive), any 
electronic information storage device or system, and online accounts (including all cloud and email accounts) at or 
accessible from the premises, and make a copy or digital copy of any of the foregoing and permit any Independent 
Computer Expert to remove any of the foregoing from the premises in accordance with the terms of the search 
orders.

Body
The Indigenous Business Review Cassandra Baldini , Zak Kirkup and David Prestipino turn the spotlight on 10 
Indigenous business leaders, highlighting their influential roles across diverse sectors, showcasing their 
contributions as drivers of economic and social change in our country. This is not an exhaustive list, but rather a 
glimpse into the varied and multifaceted careers these leaders excel in, from corporate boardrooms to grassroots 
enterprises
Colleen Hayward AM Colleen Hayward's appointment as an independent non-executive director at Mineral 
Resources (MinRes) is more than just a boardroom position, it's a testament to the company's commitment to 
meaningful Indigenous engagement and leadership.
As a highly respected Noongar Elder from Western Australia with extensive experience across health, education, 
and community development, Hayward brings a unique and invaluable perspective to the operations of Mineral 
Resources.
Throughout her life, Hayward has been resolute about the importance of authentic engagement with Aboriginal 
people.
"Every bit of business that happens in this country happens on Aboriginal land," she points out, underscoring the 
need for businesses to recognise and respect this reality by engaging meaningfully with traditional owners and 
Indigenous communities.
This mission is evident in MinRes' procurement strategy, which has seen an extraordinary increase in spending with 
Indigenous-owned businesses.
From just $2.6m in FY21, the company's engagement skyrocketed to $68m in FY24, benefiting 44 Indigenous 
businesses.
This growth is not just about meeting targets; it's about fostering real, sustainable economic development.
Page 2 of 5
The game changers
"It's not procurement for procurement's sake," Hayward explains. "It's about partnering with the most capable 
individuals to deliver the services we require." MinRes' approach goes beyond transactional relationships, with a 
range of program in place to support Indigenous businesses through initiatives such as Business Startup Grants, 
tailored finance solutions through dedicated finance facilities, and in-house support for business set-up and 
sustainable growth.
The impact of these efforts is perhaps best illustrated by the personal stories that emerge from MinRes' 
collaborations. Hayward shares one particularly inspiring example: "I was at a lunch recently, and there were a 
couple of the traditional owners there â€¦ and they were over the moon in terms of their personal experience. In 10 
months, because of their engagement with MinRes they were buying their own house, and they had never been 
able to do that before." This story, one of many, underscores the transformative potential of MinRes' strategic 
support for Indigenous businesses, enabling them to achieve economic stability and growth in ways that have a 
profound impact on the broader community.
Despite these achievements, Hayward acknowledges that there is still a long way to go, particularly in increasing 
Indigenous representation at the highest levels in corporate Australia.
Currently, there are only four Indigenous directors on ASX 300 boards. This figure starkly contrasts with the 
increased public sentiment calling for greater Indigenous involvement.
"People don't know the skills and expertise that we can bring â€¦ and when you don't know, you get a bit scared. 
Fear breeds paralysis. But it's actually time, in this country, for everyone to be a bit brave," she says.
It's clear that companies like MinRes continue to make bold steps to address this disparity across the country, and 
in so doing not only enhance their own governance and community engagement but also lead by example for 
others to follow. Hayward's leadership at MinRes serves as a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when 
Indigenous voices are not just included but are actively shaping the future of corporate Australia.
Mike Westerman Glencore Copper industrial lead Mike Westerman oversees a global workforce of 30,000 
employees. His formative years growing up on sheep and cattle stations, combined with his education in the Tom 
Price community in the Pilbara, gave him a first-hand introduction to the mining industry and shaped his leadership 
style. Drawing on his rural and Indigenous heritage, Westerman emphasises the importance of fostering strong 
relationships at both grassroots and corporate levels. In discussing the First Nations business landscape, he 
highlights that true success lies in the ability to add value and deliver tangible results, affirming that dedication and 
effectiveness can drive achievement in any endeavour.
"My career has involved a fair bit of sacrifice, including living in places others wouldn't and taking on responsibilities 
others didn't want. There have also been some risks involved, such as moving to new locations or taking on 
challenging jobs. And, of course, a bit of luck - being in the right place at the right time and showing up when 
needed."
Gordon Cole Noongar man and Cole Supplies chief executive Gordon Cole has a strong entrepreneurial spirit that 
has led him to work across various industries within the Indigenous business sector. Since co-founding the 
Indigenous-owned wholesaler in 2013, specialising in workwear, safety, health, medical and industrial products, 
Cole has held key roles, including board director at First Australians Capital and chair of the Noongar Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry. He describes the Indigenous business sector as vibrant, healthy and on an unprecedented 
growth trajectory.
"I've really enjoyed my time in business and have started to explore further opportunities for our sector in business, 
trade and investment, where we aim to scale up and become greater participants in the economy."
Wayne Bergmann Wayne Bergmann is the managing director of Leedal Pty Ltd, where he focuses on fostering 
economic independence and opportunities for Aboriginal communities in the Kimberley region. He previously 
served as the CEO of the Kimberley Land Council, negotiating multibillion-dollar native title agreement. He is 
executive chair of the National Indigenous Times and Professor of Practice at the University of NSW.Page 3 of 5
The game changers
A published author, Bergmann's strategic leadership has driven commercial success by advocating for Indigenous 
business participation, securing significant investments and facilitating partnerships that empower Aboriginal people 
to achieve economic self-sufficiency.
"All my life in business I have been told 'you can't do that', such as with the National Indigenous Times. To see the 
things that I've put effort into, in the Indigenous space, where it has failed in the past, and to see it become 
successful, has become an incredible feeling to make things happen that no one else believed could happen. With 
grit and determination you can do anything." "Business has been a single value of my whole life. Working for a 
living. But for the first 30 years, most of my life was about social justice and the biggest challenge was pivoting and 
finding the balance between that mission and being an entrepreneur."
Noel Pearson Hailing from the Guugu Yimidhirr community of Hope Vale on the southeastern Cape York Peninsula, 
Noel Pearson is a prominent Indigenous lawyer, academic and activist who founded the Cape York Partnership in 
2004. The non-profit organisation focuses on empowering Indigenous families and communities to pursue lives of 
value, freedom and prosperity. Pearson has long championed Indigenous self-determination and economic 
development, with a focus on tackling systemic inequalities and promoting practical solutions for community 
empowerment. His influential work has shaped national discussions on reconciliation, Indigenous policy reform and 
economic participation. Recently, Pearson was appointed to the board of Fortescue Metals Group, further 
extending his influence into corporate leadership and the resource sector.
Amanda Healy Under Amanda Healy's leadership, Warrikal has become one of Australia's most successful 
Indigenous-owned engineering companies, providing significant employment and training opportunities for 
Indigenous people in the resources sector.
Simultaneously, as CEO of Kirrikin, she champions Indigenous artists by transforming their works into globally 
recognised fashion statements, bridging culture and commerce.
Healy has spoken extensively about her leadership journey, and the impact she aims to make through her 
businesses. Reflecting on her early career in the mining industry, she notes she had to be tough to succeed in a 
male-dominated environment, but she has always focused on building strong relationships with both employees and 
traditional owners. She emphasises the importance of leading by example and leveraging entrepreneurship to 
support Indigenous artists and communities, such as through Kirrikin, her luxury fashion brand that returns profits to 
the artists and supports small Indigenous businesses.
At Warrikal, Healy aims to provide opportunities for Indigenous workers and has grown the company to a significant 
size with a diverse workforce. She acknowledges the challenges in achieving a 20 per cent Indigenous workforce 
target but remains committed to expanding opportunities for Indigenous participation in the industry. Healy is also 
passionate about using her platform to address the lack of generational wealth among Indigenous communities, a 
challenge she has personally faced and strives to overcome through her business ventures.
Amanda is clear on the future when it comes to Indigenous business leaders: "We need to have a bigger say in it 
and we're never going to get there unless we are taken seriously, unless people start to see us functioning and 
operating at the highest possible level, and understand that we're just as smart as everyone."
Ben Wyatt Renowned as the first Indigenous treasurer (WA) for any Australian state or territory and the first 
Indigenous person appointed to the board of an ASX-200 company, Yamatji man Ben Wyatt continues to be a 
significant force in economic reforms and fiscal management. Speaking on the positive growth within the 
Indigenous business landscape, Wyatt highlights the increasing opportunity for Indigenous entrepreneurs. In his 
current role as an independent non-executive director on the boards of Rio Tinto and Woodside Energy, he 
emphasises that the resources sector can play a pivotal role by ensuring Indigenous communities are included in 
economic opportunities through partnerships, procurement and investment in Indigenous-owned businesses.

Sharna Collard Balladong and Wilmen woman Sharna Collard's leadership journey began in 2015 with the launch 
of Australia's first Indigenous-led and owned fleet company, Kooya. As the current chief executive, Collard reflects 
on the family-run enterprise's mission to address the critical need for Indigenous-owned businesses in the fleet 
sector.
"We diversified into the fleet sector with Kooya because there were no other Aboriginal businesses in this space. 
Recognising this untapped market gave us the confidence to fulfil this need," she explains.
Collard, alongside her father Kim, who initially served as chief executive before transitioning to chair, have been 
instrumental in driving the company's growth. Starting as fleet manager, Collard quickly showcased her potential, 
advancing to general manager in 2018 and assuming the top role a year later.
"I've grown with the business and now understand every facet of it," she says. "'The importance of Aboriginal 
leadership in business cannot be overstated. While Aboriginal ownership is crucial, effective management and 
leadership are essential for maintaining the company's cultural integrity." Reflecting on Kooya's early challenges, 
Collard admits it wasn't an easy start. "I don't mind admitting it was certainly trying," she says.
"There was some hesitance from businesses to engage with Kooya because we are in the professional and 
financial services sectors, where Aboriginal businesses are under-represented." Despite these initial obstacles, 
Kooya quickly established itself in the market. "Kooya has stood the test of time, and now, looking at our customer 
base, we have a series of blue-chip clients, including Fortescue, BHP, Telstra and Chevron," Collard says.
Fortescue began its partnership with Kooya in 2018, initially leasing services for 34 assets on a single mine site. At 
the end of last year, the contract was renewed and expanded to include 110 electric Tuatara Ultra Terrain Vehicles 
for Fortescue's Pilbara sites. Kooya now manages leasing activities across three mine sites for Fortescue: 
Solomon, Eliwana and Iron Bridge.
"The key to the success between Kooya and Fortescue has been incremental growth. It began as a small 
opportunity, which required Kooya to prove our worth by providing excellent customer service and be competitive, 
as is often the case in business," Collard says.
She highlights that the partnership is built on a shared mission to drive Fortescue's decarbonisation goals.
"There is a strong synergy and alignment between First Nation businesses and our commitment to decarbonisation. 
Over the past 12 months, we executed the exclusive master decarbonisation contract with Fortescue, allowing us 
to work closely with them towards their decarbonisation objectives." Beyond business, Collard's leadership is 
deeply connected to social impact. The Bibbulmun Fund, established in 2014, channels 5 per cent of Kooya's net 
profits into community initiatives. The fund supports leadership and entrepreneurship programs and contributes to 
health initiatives such as the Purple House Foundation's renal dialysis support.
"A crucial aspect of Kooya's offering is its focus on the Aboriginal social impact. My dad and I and many Aboriginal 
people/individuals recognise that governance is rooted in reciprocity and giving back. To embody this principle, we 
established the Bibbulmun Fund to support and contribute to our communities," she says.Page 5 of 5
The game changers
Reflecting on her journey so far, Collard expresses pride in what she's achieved. "As a proud Aboriginal woman in a 
male-dominated field, I take great pride in my role as a leader. I strive to create change and lead by example, 
demonstrating the impact of Aboriginal leadership in driving progress and inspiring others," she says.

Business acumen Mark Barnaba has an uncanny ability to forge close relationships that turn into long-term 
opportunities, writes Jennifer Hewett.
Mark Barnaba met a brash, young New York property developer in 1988. Donald Trump had sold the iconic St 
Moritz hotel in Manhattan to Alan Bond for $US180 million. Barnaba was Bond's young executive assistant.
"Even then, Trump was just extraordinarily firm in his own views regardless of what others thought," Barnaba says. 
"He's not easily persuaded."
It's one more adventure in a now crowded corporate history that features Barnaba's close relationships with some 
of Australia's most famous - or infamous - business leaders.
Barnaba promised to work for an almost equally brash and persuasive West Australian entrepreneur for two years 
in exchange for Bond's help in funding his degree from Harvard Business School.
This was after Bond had read an article about the ambitions of a bright, young university medallist in The West 
Australian newspaper and immediately called him in for a chat.
The Bond empire collapsed before Barnaba's two years was up. Barnaba jokes he was "green as a cabbage" while 
Bond was ditching assets - from Chilean phone businesses, to Heileman Brewing, to private aircraft - in a desperate 
attempt to stay afloat.
But he describes the ability to listen and observe as key to an "incredible education", leading to many more 
encounters with more billionaire entrepreneurs.
That list includes Andrew Forrest and Robin Khuda. Barnaba has been on the board of Fortescue Metals Group 
since 2010. He will step down as lead independent director next month but remains as deputy chairman.
He is also independent chairman of Australia's latest global success story, AirTrunk, the big data centre developer 
bought by Blackstone last month for a staggering $24 billion.
Page 2 of 5
A director with a golden touch for connecting
The evening the sale was announced, Khuda celebrated over dinner at Barnaba's spectacular riverside home in 
Perth's Mosman Park. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was another guest.
Chalk it up as another remarkable day and night in the life of one of the country's most well-connected directors - 
but in almost the mirror image of the stereotypical Melbourne club directors who once dominated corporate 
Australia. It's the triumph of new money and new opportunities over old - always with the lure of more to come, new 
records to beat.
Barnaba, for example, is also chairman of Greatland Gold, which is in the news after paying $US475 million ($709 
million) for Newmont Mining's gold and copper assets in Western Australia. This was the largest capital raising in 
mining in the UK in seven years. Next step is an ASX listing in 2025.
Barnaba, 61, is the son of immigrant Italians and credits his own supportive family for his rise.
But he has also always forged other tight personal connections, helping him become a major player in corporate 
consultancy work in WA before an array of senior executive roles and directorships.
Over those decades, this has involved stints with McKinsey and his own boutique advisory firms, executive roles at 
Macquarie Bank and board positions on prominent corporate, sporting and not-for-profit businesses, including the 
Reserve Bank board.
His enthusiasm for what has been achieved - and by whom - is undimmed.
He happily describes his old friend Forrest and his new mate Khuda as "incredible Australians" he's been fortunate 
to work alongside.
"It's a privilege working with companies like Fortescue, AirTrunk, Greatland, even in a prior life the RBA and 
Macquarie," he says.
"Think about how many companies there are that have really exported themselves out of Australia."
It translates into Barnaba's belief in the success of founder-led companies or those that are still greatly influenced 
by the original DNA in shaping the culture.
"At the end of the day, what separates those companies is culture," he says. "They are all different cultures, but 
they are distinctive and they are world-class.
"It's difficult to argue that the organisations aren't materially better off still having their founders there."
According to Barnaba, Blackstone is a strong, very supportive and natural owner of AirTrunk and will "bring a lot to 
the party".
"Both Blackstone and Robin asked me to stay because if it wasn't for Robin, I wouldn't want to be there," he says.
"Often you have to ask: do you make a decision based on the naked nature of the opportunity or on the quality of 
the individuals involved? Ideally, you want all of one - the people - and some of the other - the opportunity."
So he probably wouldn't have gone to work at Macquarie in 2011, he insists, had it not been for people he greatly 
admires, such as former chief executive Nicholas Moore and ex head of Macquarie Capital Robin Bishop, doing the 
asking.
But Barnaba also fosters an instinctive ability to translate personal attachments into long-term business 
opportunities. When Barnaba became chairman of AirTrunk in October last year, an enthusiastic Khuda cited his 
extensive background in scaling fast-growing businesses, his entrepreneurial acumen and deep understanding of 
capital markets.
Yet the major link, personal and professional, was Macquarie and its original investment in AirTrunk.Page 3 of 5
A director with a golden touch for connecting
As the business prepared itself for an IPO or sale, Barnaba replaced Ani Satchcroft, Macquarie Asset 
Management's head of infrastructure, as chair. She happened to be married to Alex Satchcroft, an ex-Macquarie 
banker, who had worked with the current head of risk, Andrew Cassidy, when Ben Brazil was one of the investment 
bank's key deal makers.
Naturally, Barnaba and Brazil have been friends since their 20s. Naturally, Alex Satchcroft and Cassidy also knew 
Barnaba well from their overlapping time at Macquarie. Naturally, Cassidy asked Barnaba if he would take a call 
from Ani Satchcroft.
Those sorts of intricate relationships are liberally sprinkled over Barnaba's corporate record. But are they a little too 
close for claims to independence? The top echelons in Australia's business community can seem incestuous in 
their circles within circles, the WA business community even more so.
Barnaba has been close friends with Forrest for decades, for example, as well as being Fortescue's deputy 
chairman since 2017 and lead independent director since 2014. Forrest's private company Wyloo Metals has 
become a cornerstone investor in Greatland.
Barnaba will only step down as lead independent director after proxy advisers last year questioned the 
remuneration packages and the sudden exits of a relatively new CEO, Fiona Hicks, along with other key executives.
Fortescue said at the time that Barnaba's replacement would "be a key component of the board's renewal strategy" 
even though Barnaba will stay as deputy chairman.
Forrest has, of course, made an art form of defying the traditional corporate rules and restraints to build a massive 
business.
"If anything, I feel more independent than I have during my whole tenure because independence is a state of mind 
and not an outcome dedicated by length of service on a board," Barnaba argues.
"If you spend enough time on a board with colleagues, you get to know them well and end up sharing aspects of 
your lives together.
"But it doesn't have to - and shouldn't - impair independence. It never has for me. It's just not in my nature. I wear a 
badge of objective and independent thinking."
Take that, corporate governance specialists.
What is never in question is Barnaba's admiration for Forrest.
"The man is one of the country's greatest ever industrialists," he says.
"There's no other way to frame that. He has got stamina and energy and vision like no one I have ever known."
And Barnaba has known Forrest a long time.
After several years operating out of London with McKinsey, his initial foray into the boutique advisory world in Perth 
in the mid-1990s soon included work for someone he had first encountered while still at the University of Western 
Australia.
"He doesn't remember that, but I remember it, because Andrew always made an impression." Barnaba says drily.
By the time of their renewed acquaintance, Forrest was trying to develop Anaconda Nickel before being forced out 
in 2001 by investors dismayed at their losses.
The relationship survived and thrived - unlike Forrest's standing with many Australian investors and US 
bondholders.Page 4 of 5
A director with a golden touch for connecting
Barnaba has been along for most of the wild ride since the indefatigable Forrest began to build again with 
Fortescue.
This included another near-death corporate experience after the iron ore price collapsed against a heavily indebted 
business, requiring radical new debt restructuring to be set up at hyper-speed.
Fortescue's perilous dance with survival is in the past. Despite delays or missteps in Forrest's more recent forays 
into areas such as green hydrogen and nickel, the company is securely enough grounded in the iron ore wealth of 
the Pilbara to accommodate his ambitions to help lead the energy revolution.
"Andrew's mantra, which we all believe, is to show you can do real zero - not net zero, real zero - profitably and 
Fortescue is in the process of showing that," Barnaba says firmly.
That may prove an even bigger test than creating a new iron ore business.
Nor does Barnaba see any conflict in holding his view on renewables while chairing a massive data centre operator 
grappling with the extreme, unresolved energy demands of data centres in an artificial intelligence world.
AirTrunk, he says, is one of the most sustainably aware and advanced companies globally, with a policy of net zero 
by 2030.
"The ones that do it best are the ones that do it from within," he says. "If it's forced on you, you never get as far as 
quickly."
All such challenges were beyond any board's thinking in the distant era when Barnaba started his corporate 
consulting career.
In 2001, the WA consulting business he started with two mates and veteran deal maker John Poynton was sold for 
$44 million.
"You wake up and think: 'I've got balance sheet'. I never expected that to occur in my 30s," he says, calling it 
another "life-changing experience".
He went deeper into boutique investment banking, co-founding Azure Capital with Poynton, before selling out of 
that in 2010 and taking up the role with Macquarie.
Unusually for the perpetually smooth Barnaba, the break with Poynton was personal as well as professional.
None of his activities stopped him holding an extensive variety of WA board roles over the years, ranging from 
chairman of Western Power to president of the West Coast Eagles to executive chairman of the UWA Business 
School to chairman of the Black Swan State Theatre Company.
Barnaba was, of course, also friendly with a range of influential federal Liberal cabinet politicians at the time, 
including factional enemies Julie Bishop and Mathias Cormann. Nicholas Moore was not the only one to make jokes 
about Barnaba being Mr WA.
But being asked to join the RBA board in 2017 allowed an easy exit from Macquarie. No one imagined a pandemic 
would transform monetary policy during his six-year role.
"There's no playbook and you are having to make real-time decisions with imperfect information," Barnaba reflects 
on that extraordinary time.
He won't join any criticism of former governor Philip Lowe over his forward guidance about interest rates staying low 
for years. Not only did this guidance fail to contemplate surging inflation, it ensured Lowe's unpopularity with the 
public and politiciansPage 5 of 5
A director with a golden touch for connecting
"It's important to note that the executive, the governor, will put forward a recommendation but it's a decision by the 
board. Phil Lowe was an outstanding governor and we were terribly fortunate to have him. He stood tall and he did 
it with integrity.
"Michele Bullock has been a wonderful choice as well."
But as he looks out over the glorious vista of the Swan River, the optimistic Barnaba sees troubles ahead.
Those include many of the typical business concerns, especially in the mining industry, about the impact of the new 
industrial relations laws, excessive regulation and a tax system no longer fit for purpose.
He is also greatly concerned about inequality, he says, particularly given the cost of housing.
"So what are our issues? Inequality and making sure that the best society is the one that looks after the most 
disadvantaged," he says.
"Two is social unrest. Three is that Australia still creates opportunities.
"The day we fail to celebrate, or don't generate, an Andrew Forrest or a Robin Khuda is the day we will lose the 
aspirations of those who are so important to creating our next industries." AFR

Highlight: Andrew and Nicola Forrest are stepping down from the philanthropic foundation they founded together, 
with the news coming just over a year after they announced their marriage separation.
Body
Andrew and Nicola Forrest have announced they will both step down from the philanthropic foundation they 
founded together.
The announcement comes just over a year after they announced their marriage separation.
The pair will step down as co-chairs of Minderoo Foundation, which they founded together in 2001, and have 
appointed barrister Allan Myers to the role of chair.
In an announcement made on Thursday morning, the foundation said Nicola and Andrew Forrest would stay on as 
non-executive directors.
"We couldn't be more proud of what has been achieved over the past 23 years … it is the right time for change on 
the board," the pair said in a joint statement.
'Unshakeable passion' for future
Mr Forrest, who is one of Australia's richest men, is also a non-executive director of the Perth-based iron ore miner 
he founded, Fortescue which last year raked in a reported $US6.2 billion ($9.2 billion) net profit after tax (NPAT).
Together, Andrew and Nicola Forrest control 37 per cent of Fortescue. 
"I have an unshakeable passion for steering the world away from a potentially catastrophic future, and will continue 
to steer Minderoo, Tattarang [the pair's investment company] and Fortescue in the one direction — to ensure we 
leave our planet liveable for future generations," Mr Forrest said in a statement.

Ms Forrest echoed the sentiment and said the decision to step down reflected her confidence in the foundation's 
new leadership.
"Guided by its new strategy, Minderoo and its partners are in an even stronger position to face up to these 
challenges together, and stepping aside is a confidence-call in our future trajectory and the impact we will make," 
she said in a statement.
Their successor, Mr Myers, has served as a Minderoo board member since 2014 and is also a governor of the Ian 
Potter Foundation and chair of The Ramsay Centre.
Minderoo has committed millions to philanthropic ventures both in Australia and overseas.
In 2022, Mr Forrest committed $US500 million to a multi-billion dollar fund to help rebuild Ukraine alongside the 
country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
This year he offered to build and install automated gates at border crossings in Gaza to improve the flow of aid into 
the region.
Jobs losses
In April 2024, it was reported about one third of the 300 staff at Minderoo Foundation lost their jobs in a bid to cut 
administration costs. 
The charity's finances were bolstered a year earlier when the pair donated one-fifth of their Fortescue shares to 
Minderoo.
Fortescue also cut 700 jobs in July, which Mr Forrest said was an effort to streamline the company.
The cuts had raised questions about whether Fortescue was slowing its push into green hydrogen, which is 
produced from clean energy sources, after the company also flagged it was abandoning its target to produce 15 
million tonnes of green hydrogen a year.
Mr Forrest has spent the last few years selling the idea to governments around the world as a future fuel source for 
industry as it decarbonises.
"We're not pulling back. This is something which I genuinely believe in," he said at the time.
Andrew and Nicola Forrest announced their split in July 2023 after 31 years of marriage.
"Our friendship and commitment to our family remains strong," they said at the time.
"There is no impact on the operations, control or direction of Fortescue, Minderoo or Tattarang.

Andrew Forrest and his ex-wife Nicola will step down as co-chairs of their family's $8 billion philanthropic 
foundation, with the billionaire mining magnate saying he will focus on his Fortescue iron ore empire.
The Minderoo Foundation has directed the family's philanthropic efforts since it was founded in 2001. It will be 
chaired by former Melbourne University chancellor Allan Myers, a high-profile barrister.
The leadership shake-up comes just months after the organisation slashed its workforce by close to one-third as 
part of measures to ensure more of the endowment money reached the intended beneficiaries.
"This is a significant responsibility, and I've elected to step aside as chair of the Minderoo Foundation, so I may 
focus on driving the global adoption of real zero - the elimination of fossil fuels across Fortescue and global 
industry," Dr Forrest said.
Nicola Forrest is seeking to set up her own new charitable foundation called Coaxial Foundation. Coaxial was 
registered in January and its constitution says it will focus on early childhood education and gender equality.
It is not clear where the foundation will source its funding from, but Ms Forrest is the ultimate owner of 50 million 
Fortescue shares that were put into a new company called Coaxial Ventures in June last year.
Mr Myers has served on the Minderoo board since 2014 and is a former National Gallery of Victoria chairman.
Last year, the Forrests gave 220 million Fortescue shares to the Minderoo Foundation, one-fifth of their holdings, 
worth $5 billion, making it one of the largest philanthropic organisations in the world.
The Australian Financial Review revealed several months after that grant that the Forrests had separated after 31 
years of marriage.
Nicola Forrest said the decision to step aside as co-chairs was a show of confidence in how the Minderoo 
Foundation was performing.

"Guided by its new strategy, Minderoo and its partners are in an even stronger position to face up to these 
challenges together," she said in a statement.
Minderoo Foundation chief executive John Hartman has flagged the charity will direct more money into 
collaborations and partnerships. The charity supports cancer research, ocean research and initiatives to end 
slavery, and has provided millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
The Minderoo Foundation spent $268 million in the 12 months to the end of June last year, up from $178 million in 
the previous year.
The tax-exempt charity booked $35.2 million in employee expenses, up from $25.4 million.
Despite stepping down as co-chairman, Dr Forrest is expected to continue working on key Minderoo Foundation 
causes and will remain on the board.

Andrew Forrest and Nicola Forrest will step down as co-chairs of the family's philanthropic foundation six months 
after a re-set that resulted in about 100 employees being shown the door.
Their resignations as co-chairs at the Minderoo Foundation mark the latest upheaval within the Forrests' business 
and philanthropic empire since the couple separated after 31 years of marriage.
Dr Forrest said he had opted to step aside to focus on his work as executive chairman of iron ore miner Fortescue 
and its ambitious emissions reduction targets.
Both Dr Forrest and Ms Forrest, who founded Minderoo more than 20 years ago, intend to stay on the board.
Prominent businessman and barrister Allan Myers will take over as chairman of Minderoo, which spent about 
$268m on various causes in 2022-23.
Last year, the Forrests tipped in 220 million Fortescue shares, worth about $5bn at the time, to make Minderoo one 
of the biggest philanthropic foundations in the world. The couple confirmed their separation soon after the share 
allocation.
In a joint statement on Thursday, the Forrests said it was an appropriate time to step aside as co-chairs.
"We couldn't be more proud of what has been achieved over the past 23 years and, with Minderoo's 2030 strategy 
now finalised and being implemented, it is the right time for change on the board," the Forrests said.
The Forrests said that, with Mr Myers as the independent chair, Minderoo would continue to deliver on its "mission 
to forge a fair future by challenging inequalities and campaigning for meaningful change".
The Forrests' daughter, Grace, left the Minderoo board in May, along with former Dow Chemicals chief executive 
Andrew Liveris.

Forrests step down as co-chairs of Minderoo
And although she remains committed to Minderoo, Nicola Forrest is in the process of setting up the Coaxial 
Foundation to pursue additional philanthropic objectives.
The Minderoo restructure earlier this year cut the workforce by about a third and ruffled feathers within the 
foundation that operates out of offices in Perth.
It was overseen by Minderoo CEO John Hartman, who last month stood down as a director of the Forrests' private 
company, Tattarang. His resignation left Andrew and Nicola as the sole directors of Tattarang, the entity that 
controls about two-thirds of the Forrest family's shares in Fortescue and most of their private business interests.
Mr Hartman remains CEO of both Minderoo and Tattarang.
Mr Myers, a Minderoo director since 2014, said he was honoured to become chairman. "The unprecedented 
generosity, vision and optimism of Andrew and Nicola Forrest is embodied in the Minderoo Foundation. I will do my 
best as chair to help realise their aspirations for the enduring benefit of Australia and the wider world," he said.
Dr Forrest said the foundation would continue its important work, which in recent times had focused on helping 
vulnerable communities; gender and equality; and protecting oceans. "I have an unshakeable passion for steering 
the world away from a potentially catastrophic future, and will continue to steer Minderoo, Tattarang and Fortescue 
in the one direction - to ensure we leave our planet liveable for future generations," he said.

Western Australia's workplace safety watchdog has issued Andrew and Nicola Forrest's $8bn philanthropic 
foundation with an improvement notice in the fallout from an incident where one of its employees needed to take 
extended time off work.
WorkSafe WA has given the Minderoo Foundation until January to comply with the notice, which is linked to an 
internal update of the charity's guidelines for dealing with matters such as psychosocial safety, and any employee 
concerns about sexual and other forms of harassment.
A WorkSafe spokeswoman confirmed Minderoo had been issued with the improvement notice and given a 
compliance deadline.
It is understood the notice was issued after WorkSafe inquiries sparked by an employee taking 10 days or more off 
work to deal with psychosocial trauma.
Under WA regulations, Minderoo was required to self-report the injury because of the length of time the woman 
spent off work.
The improvement notice was issued after a WorkSafe inspector spoke to senior figures at Minderoo and was told 
the foundation had started to update its reporting guidelines and procedures.
Minderoo was given five months to complete the update and to roll out appropriate staff training in line with its 
guidelines.
There is no suggestion Minderoo did not handle the matter properly or that the incident is connected to last week's 
announcement that the Forrests were stepping down as co-chairs of Minderoo.
High-profile lawyer and businessman Allan Myers will take the reins as Minderoo chair while the Forrests, who 
announced their separation last year, remain on the board.

Minderoo confirmed it had self-reported an incident to WorkSafe and received an improvement notice. "We notified 
WorkSafe of an isolated incident," a spokesman said.
"The matter is confidential, and it is not appropriate to discuss the incident. However, as soon as we became aware 
of the incident we took immediate action.
"We take all matters relating to safety seriously. While we have policies, training, reporting and support services in 
place, this improvement notice reinforces the work already under way and the need to continuously improve." In a 
joint statement last week, the Forrests said it was an appropriate time to step aside as co-chairs with Minderoo's 
2030 strategy finalised and being rolled out. Dr Forrest also said he wanted to focus on his role as executive chair 
of iron ore miner Fortescue.
The WorkSafe revelations come amid rumblings about the workplace culture at Minderoo, where 150 staff have 
been shown the door since April as part of -efforts to ensure more funds go -towards causes that include helping 
vulnerable communities and protecting oceans.
One former employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they had concerns about psychosocial safety at 
Minderoo. "There is clearly a cultural problem, I don't think that is a great secret," the employee said.
Another source at Minderoo spoke of unrealistic workloads and being pressed to work on tasks outside their 
employment contract. Some of the concerns were borne out in a staff survey.
Others have praised the Forrests and Minderoo CEO John Hartman for their achievements in philanthropy and 
leadership through the foundation's overhaul.
Minderoo became one of world's biggest philanthropic foundations in June last year when the Forrests tipped in 220 
million shares in iron ore miner Fortescue. The shares were worth about $5bn at the time and represented about a 
fifth of their total shareholding in the miner.
The foundation, started by the couple more than 20 years ago, subsequently went through a shake-up and staff 
clean-out. The reset included a new structure and executive team, and cutting the workforce from about 350 to 200.
Apart from Mr Hartman, the rest of the Minderoo nine-member executive team are women.
The foundation made one of its biggest grants last year to a gender fund aimed at achieving a fairer world for 
women and girls.
The watchdog took Fortescue to court last year, alleging the miner had failed to supply work safety authorities with 
documents relating to 34 cases of -alleged sexual harassment.
For-tescue was charged with 34 counts of refusing or failing to comply with a requirement to provide documents to 
a WorkSafe inspector within a specified period.
The legal showdown involved legislation introduced after a WA parliamentary inquiry shed light on sexual 
harassment and assaults on women in the mining industry. Fortescue said at the time that it did not want to reveal 
the identity of those mentioned in the documents to WorkSafe inspectors, but was "committed to upholding the 
highest standards of workplace health and safety and has zero tolerance for inappropriate behaviour in the 
workplace". WorkSafe's dropped the charges after reaching agreement with Fortescue on an "enforceable 
undertaking" that included handing over the documents. and a commitment to tackle inappropriate workplace 
behaviour.

  Archaeologists working for Fortescue and an Indigenous group they're fighting in court have accused the mining 
giant of destroying more than a hundred heritage sites.
   For 15 years, the Yindjibarndi people have been battling iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group, the company 
founded by billionaire Andrew Forrest.
   Some traditional owners in Western Australia's northwest say the rifts between family and community members 
triggered by the dispute may never heal.
   Among the stoushes is a long-running compensation fight, which briefly returned to the Federal Court last week.
   An expert report accepted into evidence found 249 sites within the mine footprint were protected under the State 
Aboriginal Heritage Act, which means they can be destroyed or damaged.
   More than half of those sites, where humans were living 40,000-45,000 years ago, have been destroyed.
   The joint report was produced by Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation's archaeologists Peter Veth and 
Caroline Bird, and Fortescue's expert Douglas Williams.
   The trio agreed that a more detailed investigation could have been done to mitigate the loss of some sites.
   The report also found that Fortescue might have been able to exploit weaknesses in the WA government's 
administration of Aboriginal heritage.
   Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation is suing Fortescue and the WA government for mining at the Solomon 
Hub since 2013 without consent.
   About 75 per cent of the mine's 400 square kilometre footprint, an area the size of Darwin, extends across the 
Yindjibarndi native title determination area.
   Fortescue said it was committed to seeing the court case settled so all the Yindjibarndi people could benefit.

WA:Miner destroys more than a hundred Aboriginal sites
   "Fortescue has offered compensation to the Yindjibarndi people in the past and we continue to be ready to settle 
this by paying compensation," a spokeswoman said.
   "Fortescue pays financial compensation as part of all seven of our native title agreements."
   The Solomon Hub in the Hamersley Ranges is 60km north of Tom Price in the Pilbara.

An Aboriginal heritage site described by two archaeologists as the oldest of its kind is among almost 250 such 
locations destroyed, damaged or earmarked for harm at Fortescue's Solomon iron ore hub in the Pilbara.
An expert report lodged in the Federal Court last week as part of the Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corp's potential $1bn 
legal claim against Andrew Forrest's mining heavyweight detailed how charcoal and artefacts recovered from one 
site at Solomon suggested human habitation dating back as many as 59,000 years ago.
Archaeologists Peter Veth and Caroline Bird, who were commissioned by the Yindjibarndi to investigate the 
significance of the Solomon mining hub sites, said that would make the site, known as TRYINPAD13-03, "the oldest 
known for the Pilbara and indeed the entire arid zone of Australia". The site has since been destroyed.
The accuracy of that estimate was challenged by the archaeologist enlisted by Fortescue, Doug Williams, who 
described it as "highly speculative".
All three archaeologists, however, agreed the sites pointed to human habitation in the area since at least 42,500 
years ago.
The scientific significance of the various sites are being considered by the court as it weighs up what if any 
compensation Fortescue owes the Yindjibarndi for the mining it has carried out on land over which the Yindjibarndi 
holds Native Title rights.
Also admitted as evidence this week was a joint report signed by economics consultant Murray Meaton and PwC 
partner Campbell Jaski - engaged respectively by Yindjibarndi and Fortescue - examining the calculation of -
potential royalty-based compensation. Those experts considered royalties of between 1 per cent and 0.55 per cent, 
which if ultimately found by the court would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the -Yindjibarndi.
The Solomon hub has to date exported around $50bn of iron ore since 2013 and is expected to continue operating 
for decades.

'Oldest' Pilbara Aboriginal site destroyed
Fortescue was granted approval to damage or destroy 249 sites across the area under Western Australia's 
Aboriginal Heritage Act, the same legislation that gave Rio Tinto the legal authority to destroy the Juukan Gorge 
rockshelters in 2019.
Excavations at the Juukan Gorge rockshelters before their destruction had found charcoal and other artefacts that 
suggested they had been inhabited as long as almost 43,000 years ago.
In their report, Professor Veth and Dr Bird said there were five rock-shelter sites within Solomon "which by virtue of 
their great age and repeated occupation through time are, in our opinion, based on our study, training and 
experience as archaeologists, of national significance".
Those sites included TRYINPAD13-03.
The pair was critical of how -little information from the -excavation works at Solomon had been made available 
publicly, given the wider cultural, public and research value of the sites.
"There appears to be a lack of dissemination and publication of excavation site reports for early Aboriginal 
occupation and use of the [Solomon hub]. It is not clear why this information has not been disseminated for wider 
heritage management and significance assessment both in the Pilbara and the wider Australian arid zone," they 
said.
Mr Williams, who among other roles is the ACT Heritage Council's expert for archaeology, said Professor Veth and 
Dr Bird had relied on a "relatively uncritical analysis" of the estimated dates for the sites.
He said the estimate for TRYINPAD 13-03 was based on just 22 recovered artefacts and there were indications 
there had been mixing of the deposit over time.
A spokeswoman for Fortescue said the company was committed to seeing this matter settled "so all Yindjibarndi 
people can benefit".

Fortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto has called on the Albanese government to fast-track a review of its 
climate safeguard mechanism which he said was "entirely compromised" by diesel tax credits and holding back the 
mining industry from decarbonising.
The mining giant also warned the West Australian government against palming off responsibility for local 
greenhouse emissions to Canberra, and said if the state wanted to streamline approvals it should instead prioritise 
green projects over traditional mining developments.
Mr Otranto said the state government needed to resist the allure of leaving policing of greenhouse emissions to the 
Commonwealth via the safeguard mechanism, an instrument he believes is compromised by the diesel fuel tax 
credit.
"Putting all the focus on the safeguard mechanism to address emissions reduction in WA is concerning," Mr Otranto 
told The Australian Financial Review.
"In the mining sector, the safeguard mechanism is entirely compromised by other initiatives such as the diesel fuel 
tax credit. We encourage the federal government to bring forward its review, so the mining sector can focus on 
investing in decarbonisation."
The safeguard mechanism is slated for review in 2026-27.
Calls for a review mark an escalation in Fortescue's attack on the diesel tax credit system, which allows mining 
companies to claim a tax rebate when the diesel is used on private roads.
Fortescue's director of global sustainability and external affairs, Bronwyn Grieve, earlier this month told the 
Financial Review the government should consider tying the lucrative fuel tax credit to decarbonisation efforts for 
major miners.
Page 2 of 2
Fortescue pushes Canberra for emissions safeguard review Exclusive
Fortescue argues the cost incurred by companies paying for Australian carbon credit units when they don't meet 
prescribed emission reduction levels under the safeguard mechanism are outweighed by the value of the diesel fuel 
tax.
But Productivity Commission commissioner Barry Sterland said the policy was working to prompt big emitters to 
reflect on their emission abatement opportunities.
He said while the commission wanted to see the safeguard mechanism expanded to cover more industrial players 
and heavy transport, he did not believe it was being undermined by fuel credits.
"I don't think that necessarily works at cross purposes, I think there's a different complex argument to be had about 
the transport fuel space," Mr Sterland told The Australian Financial Review Energy and Climate Summit in Sydney. 
"I think, regardless, the safeguard sends a signal into that sector."
The call for a shake-up of the safeguard mechanism comes a week after the WA government announced it would 
strip its environment protection agency of the power to assess mining and other major project applications on their 
emissions.
The government cited legal advice that suggested the Commonwealth should be responsible.
The move, which the government argued would reduce duplicative assessments between the state and federal 
systems, was lauded by the WA mining lobby and energy giant Woodside, but condemned by environmental groups 
and the Greens.
Asked whether the federal government would consider bringing forward its review, a spokeswoman for Climate 
Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen said the safeguard mechanism was driving down emissions from the 
nation's biggest industrial facilities.

There's no bigger story in town than Richard White's legal feud with Linda Rogan. The latest development saw both 
of them abandon their torrid legal beef on Tuesday after White buckled and agreed to pay an undisclosed 
settlement amount in the millions of dollars.
For that price, Rogan withdrew the raft of unpalatable allegations that she's levelled at the WiseTech founder, 
namely that he invested in her wellness -business in exchange for sexual relations.
Spurred by that glowing cinder of scandal, a parade of women have stepped forward to accuse White of 
ungentlemanly conduct, including on social media.
Instead of Instagram, White used LinkedIn to slide into the DMs of the women he fancied. One woman he met, 
Jenna Riches, told The Australian that he presented her with a bunch of flowers, which is sweet enough â€¦ except 
there was a dildo sticking out among the chrysanthemums. Or perhaps they were roses? Riches never confirmed 
the genus of flower.
More material here is that the staggering drop in WiseTech's share price, the $2bn wipe-out to White's net wealth, 
and the reputational whacking he's received (top of low, bottom of medium on the public shaming scale) could have 
all been buried beneath a pile of NDAs for a fraction of the sum he's now agreed to pay.
Margin Call has established with impeccable authority that Rogan made an attempt last year to settle her feud with 
White for a bargain basement price of about $400,000, or what White probably spends restringing his rare guitars 
each year.
It was an offer extended during the early months of 2023, at which point Rogan had been locked out of the 
Vaucluse mansion that White had purchased for her - and at a time when Rogan was alleging that White owed her 
more than $91,400 for the furnishings she had bought. It's that amount that she later successfully sought months 
later to garnish from his bank account, setting the fuse on this palaver between them.
Page 2 of 3
Cut price could have solved issue
A Sydney solicitor (referred to Rogan by someone in the Cranbrook parent network) -approached White's camp 
with the offer, which was refused, and which must now be regarded as one of the worst decisions ever made by a 
man with much, much more to lose than $400,000.
White, clinging for life to what remains of his good name, chose not to comment on that.
Change of address If British corporate regulators ever need to write to Fortescue, it's very important that they know 
the company owns its own building.
That's the only conclusion that can be drawn from a bizarre little update to the company records in the UK this week 
of Fortescue Zero, which noted a change of address for the miner's UK subsidiary.
Another management shake-up? Or have they moved? Curious if so, given they only bought the Ã‚Â£16m ($31.1m) 
building a year ago, and moved in in April.
But no! On closer examination the address change is little more than a missive to Companies House to announce a 
rebrand had officially arrived in the village of Kidlington, just outside Oxford.
In future, rather than writing to Fortescue Zero at Oxford Spires Business Park, correspondence should be 
addressed Fortescue Zero, The Fortescue Building.
Still, it cost the company a cool Ã‚Â£8.8m to pay out the lease on its former HQ, according to its financial 
statements, so you'd probably want to make sure you get full value from the branding where you can.
Fortescue Zero's annual accounts, released at the end of August, show a Ã‚Â£22m loss for the year - on revenue 
up 45 per cent to Ã‚Â£112.6m.
The improvement, its directors say, is due to extra business coming in from Fortescue's own decarbonisation 
programs in Australia. But the extent of Fortescue Zero's remaining outside business is, alas, not clear - the 
company has taken advantage of UK rules that allow it to duck reporting related-party transactions in wholly owed 
British subsidiaries of offshore companies.
Blackwattle spray The danger of spraying your opinion around in the name of publicity is that you're always in 
danger of making yourself look like a bit of a goose.
Take Sydney investment house Blackwattle Partners. After launching in 2023 with $60m in seed capital, the fund 
manager has done a nice job of getting its name in the financial press.
Calling on Rio Tinto to abandon its dual-listed structure in June was met with a shrug by the mining giant, but 
sparked a new round of discussion about Rio's listed structure.
And then there is Rio's $US6.7bn takeover offer for lithium play Arcadium. Blackwattle mid-cap fund manager Tim 
Riordan rushed out a statement decrying the deal as soon as it hit the market, saying it would never, ever vote for 
the bid without a substantial bump and expressing "disappointment" that the board and management had agreed to 
the deal.
That, as an aside, was given short shrift by Arcadium chairman Peter Coleman, who told a Perth newspaper he'd 
never heard of Blackwattle, hadn't received its letter, and was only taking it on faith that it was a shareholder. 
Arcadium wasn't in Blackwattle's top five mid-cap fund holdings in September, by the way, according to its latest 
fund statement.
But then the weekend press brought out Blackwattle's Ray David on the subject of lithium, talking up Rio's offer as 
potentially one of the company's finest acquisitions.
"Buying low-cost lithium assets such as Arcadium at current lithium prices makes total sense to us as Rio Tinto 
shareholders," David said.Page 3 of 3
Cut price could have solved issue
David manages a different Blackwattle fund, to be fair, so there's no suggestion of Takeovers Code breaches. And 
investment managers are entitled to their own opinions.
But, as David reminded Margin Call when asked about the disparity of views, there are a lot of distressed lithium 
companies on the market and not many buyers - which you might think would also resonate with his colleagues 
across the hall.

Fortescue Metals Group's earnings results are out for the first quarter of the current financial year and they point to 
a failure to maintain momentum following the last quarter of 2024's strong finish.
Slowing shipments
In particular, the Pilbara-based iron ore giant reported a considerable slowing of shipments - with just 47.7 million 
tonnes of iron ore shipped during the three months ending September 30, 2024, a 4% increase compared to the 
same period last year but an 11% decline from the previous quarter.
Despite the downturn, Fortescue argued that the shipment volume represented a record for the first quarter, 
supported by a 1.6-million-tonne contribution from its Iron Bridge Magnetite Project.
Yet the company continues to face challenges at the project, which has experienced delays and operational issues 
in the past.
Investors underwhelmed
Analysts at Citi noted that Fortescue's shipment figures were in line with market expectations, but investors 
responded negatively, sending the stock down 4% in early trading to A$18.98.
Fortescue also reported that its production costs for wet tonnes of haematite ore surged 12% over the quarter to 
US$20.16.
Page 2 of 2
Fortescue shipments fall in September quarter as costs rise sharply; green energy momentum flatlines
The company attributed the increase to inflationary pressures and a higher strip ratio at its mines.
Chief executive Dino Otranto said he was confident the company remained on track to meet its full-year shipment 
guidance of between 190 million tonnes and 200 million tonnes, with Iron Bridge expected to contribute between 5 
million tonnes and 9 million tonnes.
Environmentally conscientious investors were left disappointed by the lack of significant updates from Fortescue's 
renewable energy division.
Fortescue Future Industries chief executive Mark Hutchinson reported only that the company continued to make 
progress on its green energy projects across Australia, the US, Norway and Brazil.
The renewable division posted a loss of US$970 million at the end of the 2024 financial year, with further cost 
increases expected this year, pushing combined net operating and capital expenditure to around US$1.2 billion.
Fortescue's cash reserves stood at US$3.4 billion as of the end of September, down from US$4.9 billion at the end 
of June.
The company's debt remains at US$5.5 billion after payouts of US$1.9 billion in dividends and investments of 
US$780 million in capital expenditure.

The chief executive of Fortescue's energy business, Mark Hutchinson, has assumed a leadership role at a 
religious organisation that says sex should exclusively be between married heterosexual couples, despite the iron 
ore giant's stated support for sexual and gender diversity.
Mr Hutchinson and wife Angelina became directors of Alpha International last year, putting them at the helm of a 
global Christian group that seeks to transform society through a "re-evangelisation of the nations".
London-based Alpha offers courses to help people "discover and develop a relationship with Jesus". Some 1.8 
million watched its videos in the past year alone. The courses are aimed at teenagers, those preparing for marriage, 
and couples trying to salvage or "affair-proof" their marriage. The courses also preach abstinence before marriage, 
tell married people to serve their partner's sexual needs even when they don't feel like it, and claim that prayer can 
cure illnesses such as cancer.
Mr Hutchinson does not appear in the video courses but is one of 17 directors of the global organisation. He is also 
a director of Alpha International and Alpha Australia National Office.
In one episode of the Alpha Youth series, Canadian pastor Jason Ballard told his teenage audience that "Jesus 
wants to guide us" in our sexuality.
"Have you ever thought about the idea that God invented sex? The Bible is clear about it. Sex is designed for a 
man and a woman in the commitment of marriage," he said. "God invented sex, and it has the power to bring 
people together, build families and give life, and because it is powerful, it can also cause a lot of damage when it is 
misused."
Mr Ballard's comments are one of several instances in Alpha video courses where sex is exclusively depicted as an 
act between a man and a woman.
Fortescue has positioned itself as a champion of sexual and gender diversity and supports this through a dedicated 
employee group called Fortitude. The company won an award in July from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
Page 2 of 2
Fortescue boss leads anti-gay group
of Western Australia for its diversity program, and in 2022 it painted one of its mining trucks in rainbow colours as a 
show of support. Fortescue was a supporter of not-for-profit group PrideWA in 2021.
Mr Hutchinson did not respond for a fortnight when asked by The Australian Financial Review whether Alpha's 
messages were at odds with Fortescue's stated values. He also declined to say whether he was happy for his 
team at Fortescue to include people in same-sex marriages.
As a result of Mr Hutchinson's silence over the past two weeks, his views on same-sex marriage are not known.
Shortly after the Financial Review published this story online yesterday, a Fortescue spokesman issued a 
statement saying the company was committed to diversity and encouraged people from different faiths and 
backgrounds to join its workforce.
"All our staff live by the Fortescue values in every aspect of their employment, fostering an inclusive, safe working 
environment for all employees," said the Fortescue spokesman.
Former National Australia Bank head Andrew Thorburn was forced to step down as chief executive of AFL club 
Essendon in 2022 because the team believed his religious links clashed with its values.
Mr Thorburn was, at the time, the chairman of City on a Hill Church, which posted at least one sermon that 
condemned abortion as murder and another that reportedly described homosexuality as a sin.
The board of Alpha International also includes British reverend Nicky Gumbel, who has raised concerns with 
Church of England bishops about their plan to introduce prayers for same-sex couples.
The Alpha Youth course also tells its audience that illnesses can be cured by prayer. In one episode, a woman 
named Crystal expresses a belief that worship cured her cancer, rather than the chemotherapy she was receiving.
In the same episode, Mr Ballard said he watched a cross-eyed girl, Shannah, have her vision fixed by prayer.
"I noticed right away when she looked at me, she had been healed. I could see it in her eyes, they were working 
together perfectly ... God had healed her."
In the Alpha marriage course, the host Sila Lee said staying attractive after marriage is an act of kindness to one's 
spouse, encouraging her audience to service their spouse's sexual desires even when they don't feel like it.
"Being responsive may mean taking the initiative to make love as a deliberate choice, even though we may be tired 
or feeling stressed by work, or the circumstances don't match up to our highest expectations," Ms Lee said.
The Hutchinsons became directors of an Australian registered company, Alpha Australia National Office, in 
November 2021. A charity of the same name and company number has been registered with the Australian 
Charities and Not-For-Profits Commission since 2013. The charity reported more than $9 million of revenue in the 
18 months to December and donated more than $1 million to Alpha International, the UK company that has counted 
the Hutchinsons as directors since last year.

Fortescue's would-be green steel competitor Element Zero is challenging a Federal Court's decision to side with 
the mining giant after it gained legal permission to raid the homes and offices of former employees.
Fortescue got the green light in May to execute search orders on properties and offices linked with ex-Fortescue 
executives Bart Kolodziejczykï»¿ and Bjorn Winther-Jensen over allegations they stole trade secrets to start their 
own business.
The executives, and Michael Masterman, were spied on by private investigators employed by Fortescue in the lead 
up to the raids. Element Zero had claimed the surveillance was excessive, but Federal Court judge Brigitte 
Markovic accepted it was necessary in response to an application to have the search orders thrown out. Justice 
Markovic ultimately decided Fortescue was legally -entitled to carry out the search -orders and seize millions of 
documents ahead of more court -action, but she acknowledged Andrew Forrest's company made a "material non-
disclosure" when it failed to alert the court about a commercial relationship between it and Mr Masterman.
"I am not satisfied that the EZ respondents have established that Fortescue had a weak prima facie case," she 
said.
"The question is whether evidence of Fortescue's relationship with Element Zero, through Mr Masterman, and the 
discussions it had about the different concerns it held in December to January 2024 was capable of having affected 
the court's decision, in particular in relation to the consideration of the risk of -destruction. In my view, on balance, it 
was." On Wednesday, during a brief case management hearing, legal counsel for Element Zero told Justice 
Markovic they had filed a "narrow" application for leave to appeal part of her decision.
"On Friday there was an application filed on a narrow point around â€¦ material non-disclosure," the court heard.
"It's an application that's made without seeking order to stay anything taking place in proceeding before you.
"The application is directed solely to the question of leave." The application will not disrupt the ongoing court matter, 
and it will be heard by a single judge in due course, the court heard.

Element Zero up for a fight in spy case
It means Element Zero is still trying to have the search orders thrown out and discharged, and is seeking orders 
from the court that it may not have to pay costs if it succeeds.
A spokesman for Fortescue told The Australian it would vigorously defend Element Zero's -attempt to have the 
decision of the court overturned.
"Two Federal Court judges have found a strong prima facie case that the Element Zero parties misused 
Fortescue's confidential information and breached its rights," he said. "Fortescue remains committed to protecting 
its intellectual property and investment in green technologies, and looks forward to progressing the matter to a final 
trial." Element Zero had asked the court to set aside the search -orders because it claimed surveillance conducted 
in the lead up to obtaining them was excessive.
It emerged that Fortescue employed former SAS soldier Robert Lancaster to spy on Element Zero staff and their 
families for up to 17 hours a day. The surveillance included following family members to Kmart, rummaging through 
mail and taking pictures of their children leaving school.
Justice Markovic declined to set aside the search orders based on those claims, however.
"The private investigator's reports are lengthy and detailed. However, on their face they do not disclose any 
collateral purpose. Rather, they attempt to provide information necessary for an application for search orders and 
as required by the court's search orders practice note," she said. "One way of obtaining that information is to 
instruct qualified persons to attend at and observe premises. In this case, Fortescue chose to do so by instructing a 
private investigator firm."

Fortescue says there are no product quality issues with its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project despite a failure 
to attract the premium prices expected by the market.
Iron Bridge produced 1.6 million tonnes of iron ore concentrate in the three months to the end of September, a 
small but welcome step forward for a project hit by multiple numerous cost and schedule blowouts.
Fortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said the premiums for Iron Bridge concentrate had not been in line 
with what the company anticipated. He said this was a result of oversupply and other factors in China rather than 
any issue with the product.
Iron Bridge product is 67 per cent iron so should attract a premium to the Platts benchmark price for 65 per cent 
iron ore. Instead, it sold at a 3 per cent discount in the September quarter after attracting a 1 per cent premium in 
the June quarter.
Iron Bridge, built at a cost of $US3.9bn, was originally supposed to be producing 22 million tonnes per year by June 
2023.
Fortescue said it remained on track to hit Iron Bridge production guidance of 5-9 million tonnes in 2024-25 and was 
having some success in finding a solution on water supply after major issues with a pipeline. The latest questions 
around Iron Bridge came as Fortescue struggled to keep a lid on costs at its core iron ore hematite iron ore 
operations in the Pilbara.

Fortescue Energy boss Mark Hutchinson told staff he loves diversity in the workplace despite leading a religious 
group that advocates for heteronormative sexual values.
Mr Hutchinson issued a message to Fortescue staff on Thursday to break his silence over how he juggles his 
leadership role at religious group Alpha International with Fortescue's stated support for workplace inclusivity.
Alpha is an evangelical Christian group which broadcasts video sermons that tell teenagers that Jesus wants to 
"guide" them in their sexuality, and tells them the Bible is clear about how sex should be practised.
"The Bible is clear about it; sex is designed for a man and a woman in the commitment of marriage," says Canadian 
pastor Jason Ballard in one of the videos distributed by Alpha.
Mr Hutchinson declined to comment for a fortnight when asked by The Australian Financial Review earlier this 
month whether his leadership role at Alpha clashed with Fortescue's stated support for LGBTQ employees.
But Mr Hutchinson wrote to Fortescue staff on Thursday after the Financial Review published details of Alpha's 
sermons and its mission to "re-evangelise the nations".
"Our entire global workforce come from different faiths, religions and backgrounds - and what I love is our diversity 
in all of its forms," he wrote.
"I love our values and our diversity. These values guide me as CEO in everything I do."
A former Fortescue staff member, who identifies as homosexual, said it was notable that Mr Hutchinson spoke in 
"generalities" in the message and did not directly mention LGBTQ staff members.
The former staff member said Mr Hutchinson's generalities were at odds with Alpha's very precise description of 
how sex should be practised.

Mr Hutchinson's note to staff came on the same day that Rio Tinto struck a three-year support deal with PrideWA, 
the LGBTQ advocacy group that cut ties with Fortescue in early 2022 after a short partnership.
Rio Tinto iron ore boss Simon Trott directly named LGBTQ employees as a group he wanted to support.
"As one of Western Australia's largest employers, we deeply value our LGBTQIA+ team members and remain 
committed to building a safe and inclusive environment where everyone can be themselves," he said on Thursday.
Rio will have a float in Perth's Pride Parade on November 23, and Mr Trott said close to 100 employees were 
expected to march beside the float.
PrideWA chief Lauren Butterly said the new deal showed that Rio "values their LGBTQIA+ employees, as well as 
our Western Australian LGBTQIA+ community".
Fortescue revealed on Thursday that its unit costs in the West Australian iron ore division were 12 per cent higher 
in the three months to September than at the same time last year.
Fortescue blamed the cost surge on higher than normal movements of waste rock, and signalled unit costs should 
be lower in the months ahead.
Fortescue shipped 47.7 million tonnes of ore in the three months to September.
Fortescue's annual meeting of shareholders will be held in Perth on November 6.

Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest has told his leadership team they must commit to corporate diversity and 
support for same-sex couples, prompting energy boss Mark Hutchinson to issue an apology for how he handled 
being linked to a religious group that promotes anti-LGBTQIA+ values.
Dr Forrest and Mr Hutchinson both wrote internal messages to appease Fortescue staff on Sunday night, after Mr 
Hutchinson was required to square the company's inclusive values with his directorship of Christian organisation 
Alpha International, which believes in a strictly heteronormative sexual ideology.
Alpha International broadcasts video sermons that tell teenagers that Jesus wants to "guide" their sexuality and that 
the Bible is "clear" that sex should exclusively occur between men and women within marriage.
Mr Hutchinson declined to comment for a fortnight when The Australian Financial Review asked him whether those 
views were compatible with Fortescue's stated diversity values, which include support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, questioning, intersex and asexual people.
He broke his silence on Friday with generalised references to his love for diversity, but no explicit assurance for 
LGBTQIA+ employees. The message prompted some Fortescue staff to raise their concerns with the board.
Dr Forrest's comments appeared to validate their anguish.
"I understand and acknowledge exactly what you felt, and I thank you for bringing it to me," said Dr Forrest in the 
note to staff. "I would like to reassure you all on behalf of our board, that we are resolutely committed to the cause 
of equal rights. We expect and require the same of our leadership.
"We deeply value Fortescue's LGBTQIA+ community. At a personal level, I stand with you."
Mr Hutchinson issued his own apology on Sunday night when he declared his support for sexual equality at 
Fortescue.

Fortescue chief to staff: 'I have let you down'
"After speaking with some of you over the past few days, I am aware that by failing to clarify my views on same-sex 
relationships in my comments last week that I have let you down," he said.
"This was certainly not my intention, and I apologise unreservedly. I wish to state clearly that I am supportive of 
everyone in a same-sex marriage and same-sex relationships and value the LGBTQIA+ community. I believe that 
all of us are equal, and I accept and support every member of our team."
Mr Hutchinson remains a director of Alpha, according to corporate records.
"I have always supported and lived by all Fortescue values and policies and this is what leads me every day in my 
role as energy CEO," he said.
Fortescue has two chief executives, Mr Hutchison and Dino Otranto, who runs the company's iron ore business.
Dr Forrest said Fortescue's commitment to diversity was not just about social benefit, but designed to ensure the 
company had access to the best minds.
"If we are to stop the uncontrolled march of climate change, we need every mind at the table. Focused and free. 
That means working relentlessly to cultivate a culture where everyone feels comfortable to bring their full self to 
work," he said.
Fortescue has an in-house community of LGBTQIA+ staff called Fortitude. The WA Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry has praised the company for its work on corporate diversity.

Highlight: Billionaire Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest has withdrawn from a bid to transform Australia's largest sheep 
station into a green energy hub, blaming delays in government approval.
Body
Mining billionaire Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest has withdrawn from a bid to purchase Australia's largest sheep station 
with the goal of turning it into a green energy hub.
Mr Forrest's Fortescue Metals Group first indicated its intention to acquire the 1-million-hectare Rawlinna Station, 
1000km east of Perth, on the Nullarbor Plain, in April 2023.
The company – via its subsidiary Fortescue Future Industries – had planned to generate renewable energy on the 
historic station, which spans an area roughly the size of Sydney. 
But now, about 18 months later, the ABC can reveal that FMG has walked away from the sale.
In a statement, a Fortescue spokesperson cited "extended delays" in ministerial approval as cause for the decision 
to withdraw.
"We have been waiting for ministerial approval of the transfer for 11 months," the spokesperson said.
"With policy ambiguity remaining regarding government approval, we have chosen to withdraw from the sale of 
Rawlinna, which was always a long-term energy opportunity for Fortescue."
A state government spokesperson said applications for "significant areas of land" were complex and required 
"rigorous assessments".
They said the Land Administration Act required the state government to be "satisfied the transfer would not result in 
a concentration of control of pastoral land as to be against the public interest".

"The decision by the applicant to withdraw the application for consent was a matter determined by them," the 
spokesperson said. 
Rawlinna Station's parent company, Jumbuck Pastoral, has been contacted for comment.
What's next for Rawlinna?
Established in the 1960s, Rawlinna is one of Australia's most iconic sheep stations.
But questions now surround its future.
In an online newsletter posted in July 2023, Jumbuck Pastoral said Rawlinna had been "sold to Fortescue Future 
Industries".
Fortescue said withdrawing from the sale provided "certainty" to the Rawlinna workforce, many of whom 
wereevacuated earlier this year after record-breaking rainfallon the Nullarbor.
Fortescue said it remained committed to "long-term green energy opportunities" in the Nullarbor and south-east 
WA "via alternative arrangements".

The chief executive of Fortescue's energy division, Mark Hutchinson, has quit the board of a religious group whose 
evangelical attitudes towards sex raised concerns among employees of the mining giant last month.
According to documents filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on October 29, Mr 
Hutchinson is no longer a director of Alpha Australia National Office.
AANO is the local chapter of the global religious group Alpha International, which publishes videos that tell 
teenagers Jesus wants to "guide" their sexuality and promotes an exclusively heterosexual, post-marital and 
gender-binary version of sex.
Revelations that Mr Hutchinson held a leadership role at Alpha had raised concerns among some Fortescue staff, 
who believed Alpha's preachings on sex were at odds with Fortescue's stated support for diversity.
In a written message to staff on October 25, Mr Hutchinson assured them that he loved diversity. He wrote another 
message to them on October 27 to concede that he had failed the employees by not explicitly declaring his support 
for LGBTQIA+ people.
"I wish to state clearly that I am supportive of everyone in a same-sex marriage and same-sex relationships and 
value the LGBTQIA+ community," he said in the second note.
The documents, which were submitted to ASIC this week, said Mr Hutchinson's exit from the AANO board was 
effective from July 18, 2023.
At the time of publishing this article, he remained a director of the UK-registered Alpha International.
Aside from its views on sex, Alpha's video sermons also tell viewers that prayer can heal physical illnesses such as 
cancer and crossed eyes.
Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest wrote to staff on October 27 saying that he expected the company's 
leadership to be "resolutely" committed to equal rights.

Influential crossbench MPs say unwinding a lucrative fuel tax credit for major mining companies will be a key 
objective after the next election, where they could wield the balance of power in a minority government.
Teal independent Kate Chaney from the mining state of Western Australia is working to build support in parliament 
for changes to the diesel fuel tax credit system for big miners, and aims to pursue the reforms in future parliaments 
if she's re-elected.
She already has the backing of several east-coast colleagues, including Wentworth MP Allegra Spender and 
independent ACT senator David Pocock, who have confirmed they will pursue an overhaul to the tax credit system 
after the next election.
"This will stay on the agenda... it creates headwinds for decarbonisation that we can't afford to have when we need 
to make sure Australia doesn't get left behind," Ms Chaney told The Australian Financial Review.
Ms Spender said a minority government scenario could prove the best opportunity to pursue bold economic reform, 
and agreed the fuel credits should be linked to decarbonisation efforts for major miners.
"I know that Kate is passionate about this, and so am I," Ms Spender said.
"We need to have long-term reform in the tax system and the diesel fuel rebate is an example of that.
"There is an opportunity for broader economic reform that I would certainly back that would be sympathetic to what 
miners are seeking as well."
The diesel fuel excise levied on drivers at the bowser covers the costs of maintaining public roads, but companies 
can claim a tax credit when the fuel is used on private roads, including mine sites.
Iron ore and coal miners received about $2.3 billion of the diesel fuel tax credits paid out in 2020- 2021, according 
to Parliamentary Budget Office figures, which amounted to about a third of the overall amount paid.

Crossbench eyes tax credit overhaul Exclusive
The independent MPs argue the fuel credit system is undermining decarbonisation in the resources sector, and 
major miners should only be provided credits if they spend it on efforts to reduce their carbon emissions.
Senator Pocock said the tax credits amounted to "a fossil fuel subsidy" for major miners.
"It is locking in the use of diesel because if you stop using diesel, you stop getting the fuel tax credits. Let's reshape 
it and tie it to decarbonisation," he said.
As polls suggest the Albanese government is at risk of losing its majority in the next federal election, due by May, 
the support of independent MPs could prove crucial for any future government.
But Federal Resources Minister Madeleine King said there was no appetite to overhaul the tax credit system, which 
was critical for farmers.
"We are not changing the diesel fuel rebate. Farmers and miners get the rebate for vehicles that only operate on 
private roads that are not funded by the taxpayer," she said.
The crossbench foray into the debate comes just weeks after mining giant Fortescue also advocated for fuel tax 
credits to be tied to decarbonisation efforts, putting it at odds with its competitors and paving the way for a potential 
fight within the resources industry.
Ms Chaney said she had spoken with Fortescue representatives about the reforms, and that the credit should 
remain in place for farmers. She said any company that claims less than $50 million should receive the original 
credit, which would capture most farmers.
Minerals Council of Australia chief executive Tania Constable pushed back at Fortescue and Ms Chaney's 
suggestions, saying removing the credits would weaken the economy.
"We already have effective mechanisms to reduce emissions; tinkering with our tax system won't help us achieve 
these goals," she said.
Teal independent member for Warringah Zali Steggall agreed with her crossbench colleagues that the credits 
should not be taken away from farmers, but said miners should not receive them at all, regardless of whether they 
were tied to decarbonisation efforts.
Senator Pocock accused mining companies of hiding behind farmers on the issue, given agriculture had more 
social capital than the resources sector.
The Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, which counts Fortescue as well as Rio Tinto, BHP and 
Hancock Prospecting as members said it did not support changes to the tax credit system.

Australia's biggest sheep station, Rawlinna, has been listed for public sale for the first time since being developed in 
the 1960s by veteran grazier Hugh MacLachlan - after mining magnate Andrew Forrest abandoned plans to acquire 
it for a renewable energy project.
Spanning 1,046,323 hectares - about the size of Greater Sydney - Rawlinna Station, about 400 kilometres east of 
Kalgoorlie, has a carrying capacity of almost 70,000 sheep and is considered a "wool powerhouse". It shares its 
border with the Trans Australia train line running from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie and is a stop on the Indian Pacific 
luxury train route. The Australian Financial Review's Street Talk column revealed in April last year that Fortescue 
had entered into a conditional contract with the MacLachlan family's Jumbuck Pastoral to purchase the station's 
pastoral lease and continue to run it as a sheep operation while developing a renewable energy project. The 
acquisition was conditional on approval from the West Australian government.
A Fortescue spokeswoman confirmed the company was no longer proceeding with the acquisition of Rawlinna 
Station. "We have been waiting for ministerial approval of the transfer for 11 months. Following this extended 
period, with policy ambiguity remaining regarding government approval, we have chosen to withdraw from the sale 
of Rawlinna, which was always a long-term energy opportunity for Fortescue," said the spokeswoman.
"Fortescue remains committed to pursuing long-term green energy opportunities in the Nullarbor and south-east 
WA region via alternate arrangements."
Jumbuck Pastoral has now appointed Elders to sell Rawlinna via a staged expressions-of-interest process 
commencing this month. Price expectations are understood to be above $20 million for the land (excluding 
livestock).
Mr MacLachlan, a relative of former AFL chief executive and new Tabcorp boss Gillon McLachlan, discovered the 
site for the sheep station in the mid-1950s as he was travelling from South Australia to Perth on the Indian Pacific.
When the train stopped at a remote siding called Rawlinna, he observed that it had good quality underground water 
and saw the potential for a vast sheep operation across the vast open saltbush, bluebush and grass plains.

Key sheep station on sale
Mr MacLachlan first placed a survey peg in the ground in the 1960s. Through careful planning and substantial 
investment, he turned it into the largest sheep station in Australia and an iconic property in the livestock sector. 
Among its standout features is a 400-kilometre boundary fence.
Rawlinna is part of 136-year-old Jumbuck Pastoral, one of the country's biggest sheep and beef producers. 
Jumbuck still controls vast agricultural landholdings despite the MacLachlans splitting up their rural empire last year 
following the departure of brothers Jock and Callum from the business.
Following the breakup, Mr MacLachlan and his daughters Airlie MacLachlan, Islay McKenzie and Brooke Yates 
retained Blina Station in WA, Bulgunnia Station and Commonwealth Hill in SA, and Gunbar Station in NSW, as well 
as Rawlinna.
Jock MacLachlan took charge of McCoys Well Station in South Australia and Derby Station in Western Australia 
while Callum retained Wave Hill Station and Killarney Station in the NT.
"This represents a rare opportunity to acquire Australia's largest sheep station during a period of unprecedented 
growth in demand for quality Australian fibre and protein," said Elders executive general manager of network Tom 
Russo.
"The station is strategically located to give access to both the western and eastern markets and is a powerhouse of 
wool production, having carried up to 69,000 sheep in recent history. The short-term opportunity is immense as 
Rawlinna has benefited from an outstanding season and is very conservatively stocked presently."

Mining magnate Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest's Fortescue Metals Group has officially pulled out of its planned 
acquisition of the enormous parcel of land that hosts Western Australia's largest sheep station, Rawlinna Station, 
following extended delays in receiving ministerial approval.
Cornerstone of Australian farming
Rawlinna Station, managed by Jumbuck Pastoral, has long been a cornerstone of the Australian sheep industry 
and one of the country's largest shearing operations.
The decision, confirmed by the company on Saturday, leaves uncertainty over the future of the iconic 1-million-
hectare property - for reference, that's the size of Sydney - 1,000 kilometres east of Perth on the Nullarbor Plain.
Fortescue, through its green energy subsidiary Fortescue Future Industries, had proposed transforming Rawlinna 
Station into a renewable energy hub.
Green energy production goals
The acquisition, first announced in April 2023, was part of Fortescue's broader strategy to expand green energy 
production across WA, with the enormous tenure intended to play a key role in this vision.
And yet 18 months after the initial bid, the company decided to abandon the transaction, citing "extended delays" 
and "policy ambiguity" surrounding government approvals.
Page 2 of 2

A WA Government spokesperson pointed out the complexity of processing applications for such large tracts of land, 
noting that these assessments are governed by the Land Administration Act, which seeks to prevent excessive 
concentration of pastoral land ownership in private hands.
Still intending to be green
Fortescue's withdrawal, according to the spokesperson, was therefore a decision entirely within the company's 
discretion - moreover, it marks another instance of Forrest pulling out of a green deal before it came to fruition.
The company that runs Rawlinna confirmed its commitment to continuing its operations following Fortescue's exit.
Fortescue, meanwhile, said its intention was still to explore "long-term green energy opportunities" in the Nullarbor 
and southeast WA through other avenues, and claimed it will continue to remain active in the region's renewable 
energy landscape.

pedalling on renewable hydrogen.
   Fronting shareholders in Perth on Wednesday, Dr Forrest defended the company's green overhaul he admitted 
had attracted "harsh criticism, harsh doubt" from naysayers and shoulder-shrugging arrogance from equipment 
suppliers.
   "This is surely the moment we put those doubts to rest," Dr Forrest said, hailing a recent deal with Liebherr Group 
to develop haul trucks, excavators and dozers using Fortescue technology.
   The US$2.8 billion agreement included 360 autonomous battery electric haul trucks, 55 electric excavators and 
60 battery electric dozers under development.
   "We are no longer just a mining company, we are a massive energy company as well," he said.
   Despite "bumpy" iron ore prices, he said Fortescue posted its third-highest annual profit of US$5.7 billion in fiscal 
2024 and distributed A$6 billion in a higher dividend to shareholders that rewarded their "faith" in the company.
   But Fortescue recently cancelled green hydrogen and ammonia plans at the Middle Arm precinct in the Northern 
Territory and jettisoned plans for work with energy giant AGL on a green hydrogen plan at the Liddell site in NSW.
   The iron ore giant in September released an externally verified climate transition plan to reach "real zero" 
emissions by 2030, but missed an investment decision deadline on a landmark green hydrogen project on Gibson 
Island in Queensland.
   Earlier in 2024, Fortescue dumped plans to produce 15 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen annually by 2030 
and axed 700 jobs.
   Dr Forrest told shareholders green hydrogen would be "critical" to decarbonising heavy industries that can't be 
electrified and "vital" for Fortescue's plans for a "massive" green iron ore industry in the Pilbara.

   But he has called for more government support, including deals on cheaper power prices, as the alternative fuel 
will become viable if production costs come down.
   He has described the level of American subsidies as a "straitjacket on the industry" that work against climate 
goals and missed out on Australia's multi-billion-dollar handouts under the federal hydrogen headstart program.
   Fortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said green iron needed political support because the costs were 
still a barrier to getting the new industry off the ground.
   As a big polluter, Dr Forrest reiterated that the group would eliminate emissions "profitably" from mining 
operations by 2030.
   "Real zero means we will no longer use diesel, we will no longer use gas - Fortescue will be entirely powered by 
green energy," he said.
   He said the patented "ecosystem" would include electric trucks, charging stations, green energy and a new fleet 
management system that could be licensed across the stubbornly hard-to-abate industry.
   Fortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson said "significant value" would flow back to the company from 
the technology including battery systems to meet a gap in the market and dual-fuel ammonia vessels that get the 
world a step closer to green shipping.
   Executive turnover has slowed after a mass exodus in 2023, although Mr Hutchinson is reportedly fending off a 
staff revolt over his role as director at Alpha International, a Christian organisation that is anti-gay.
   The AFR reported Dr Forrest told his leadership team they must support LGBTQIA+ couples and corporate 
diversity more generally, prompting an apology to staff from Mr Hutchison.

Some of the world's biggest pension funds are pushing back against bonus packages potentially worth millions of 
dollars for Fortescue chief executives Dino Otranto and Mark Hutchinson.
Fortescue intends to grant the performance rights regardless of whether shareholders vote down the move at the 
company's annual general meeting in Perth on November 6.
The iron ore miner is not required to put the matter to a vote or bound by the outcome, but gave an undertaking to 
do so in response to a massive protest vote against its remuneration report at last year's annual meeting.
Three major US pension funds have aligned against the bonus packages for Mr Otranto, who runs the company's 
mining division, and its green energy boss Mr Hutchinson.
SBA Florida, which has about $US238bn in assets under management, said there was insufficient disclosure of 
performance targets and weighting for the short-term incentive awards.
The California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS) and the California Public Employees' Retirement 
System (CalPERS) are also opposed, although not major shareholders.
Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest and Nicola Forrest own about 37 per cent of the company.
Fortescue intends to grant up to 208,656 performance rights to Mr Otranto and up to 248,001 rights to Mr 
Hutchinson.
The performance rights could be worth up to $4.6m to Mr Otranto on top of his fixed remuneration which increased 
to $1.75m on January 1 this year.
Mr Hutchinson stands to gain up to $5.46m in addition to his fixed salary of $2.08m if he can deliver on some of 
Fortescue's green energy and hydrogen ambitions, which stalled in July when the company moved to cut 700 jobs.

Fortescue execs face bonuses backlash
In its AGM statements to shareholders, Fortescue said the granting of performance rights did not require 
shareholder approval under the Corporations Act or ASX listing rules.
Fortescue said in the interests of good governance and transparency the board had decided to seek shareholder 
approval.
It is one of the measures agreed by Fortescue to placate shareholders after a first strike on its remuneration report 
in 2023. More than 52 per cent of shareholders who voted last year opposed the remuneration report.
The backlash came after more than a year of leadership upheaval that saw CEO Elizabeth Gaines step aside, her 
replacement Fiona Hick exit after a short stint in the top job as well as the departure of chief financial officer Ian 
Wells and other executives.
Fortescue's move to pay Ms Gaines and Mr Wells special recognition payments of $1.98m and $1m respectively 
earned a rebuke for proxy advisory firms, with CGI Glass Lewis saying "such ad hoc discretionary payments on 
retirement are unusual among ASX 100 entities".
Fortescue does not expect to have issues with this year's remuneration report after moving to address shareholder 
and proxy adviser concerns.
"The board has heard this feedback and while it retains the ability to apply discretion to incentive outcomes, it will 
not make discretionary payments that do not clearly align with shareholder interests," the company said in its 2024 
remuneration report.
Three resolutions on performance rights, including those for Mr Otranto and Mr Hutchinson, that will be put to a vote 
on Wednesday are separate to the remuneration report.
Fortescue told investors Ms Gaines, now a part-time executive director and global ambassador for the company, 
had agreed not to participate in the performance rights plan even though she was eligible.
Fortescue said that if shareholders voted down the resolutions on Mr Otranto and Mr Hutchinson it would need to 
reconsider their remuneration packages for 2025-26 and could offer equivalent cash incentives. Fortescue noted 
some of the targets that applied to the two chief executives were market sensitive and said it would provide more 
disclosure in the 2024-25 annual report.

Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest has backed China's economic might and iron ore demand to 
withstand any trade war escalation after Donald Trump won the US election.
Dr Forrest called for clarity on the future of the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act and other green 
energy-focused policies.
Dr Forrest said he did not share the concerns of West Australian Premier Roger Cook that a US trade war with 
China could affect the mining industry and threaten jobs. Sources within the Fortescue leadership team believe 
China could dramatically boost economic stimulus in response to any move by the US to ramp up tariffs.
"The amount of horsepower in the tank of China's economy and the ability to self-stimulate is phenomenal. You've 
seen just the edge of it," Dr Forrest said after Fortescue annual general meeting in Perth.
"I know that they (China) have so much ready to roll that, whichever way it goes, Australia is going to be all right.
"The biggest trading partner the US has ever and will ever have is China. Let's not forget that they butter each 
other's bread." Most commentators expect Mr Trump to take an axe to green energy incentives, with implications for 
Fortescue's $US550m ($841m) hydrogen project in Arizona. Dr Forrest said Fortescue was already unhappy 
about some of the rules around the Arizona project and needed more certainty on the future direction of the IRA.
"If you have a look at the IRA, it might get adjusted â€¦ we need clarity," he said.
"The reason why we're not hammering into it is because we need clarity around some of the rules, which has been 
put off to after the election." The Fortescue founder described Mr Trump as a "pragmatic economic guy" who might 
see the sense in pursuing investment in green energy.
"He's toed the election line. He's been really positive about green energy. He's been really positive about fossil 
fuels. Will he lean forward as much (into green energy), I don't know. But remember, he's an economic pragmatist, 
so he's going to follow the money." Dr Forrest was speaking after Fortescue comfortably avoided a second strike

on its remuneration report. The company had moved to quell shareholder unease over ad hoc payments made to 
departing executives in 2022-23.
Indigenous leader Noel Pearson and infrastructure investment expert Rao-Monari were elected to the board and 
shareholders overwhelmingly endorsed bonus packages for metals division chief executive Dino Otranto and his 
energy division counterpart Mark Hutchinson.
Shareholders received no update on when Fortescue might make final investment decisions on the Holmaneset 
hydrogen project in Norway and the Pecem project in Brazil.
In response to a request from Australia Shareholder's Association for more information on where money was being 
spent within the loss-making energy division, Dr Forrest promised to provide a more detailed breakdown.
In July, Fortescue retreated from its green hydrogen ambitions, shed about 700 jobs and abandoned a target to 
produce 15 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030.
The company shifted its focus to renewable electricity and to producing green iron in the -Pilbara.
Mr Otranto told the meeting a major barrier to green iron production in Australia was the high cost of renewable 
energy. He said Fortescue would need the help of government to launch the technology-dependent industry.
"If this new industry is to truly succeed in Australia, we cannot do this alone. The cost of green energy is still a 
significant challenge here in Australia, and the barrier to getting a green metal industry off the ground which will 
revolutionise Australia," he said.
"With the help of government, I firmly believe we can establish a new green metal industry here in the Pilbara." Dr 
Forrest said Fortescue wanted help in the form of approvals and infrastructure, not taxpayer handouts or 
incentives.
Fortescue recently completed a 100MW solar farm near its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite operations. Dr Forrest 
said it was eyeing a big increase in capacity to 3GW and pointed to the $US6bn funding set aside to reach the 
company's decarbonisation target. Asked about the land required, Dr Forrest said it was substantial but indicated 
traditional owners and other stakeholders were keen to become involved. "People are looking for income, and I 
know on our properties I really welcome it because the diversification of income is a really good idea," he said.
Dr Forrest again defended Iron Bridge after revelations WA work safety authorities had intervened over exposure to 
dust high in crystalline silica, which if inhaled can cause lung cancer and other diseases. Asked if he was worried 
about the health of workers, Dr Forrest said: "Of course, that's my first concern. We are all over it like nappy rash." 
Safety inspectors issued one prohibition notice, and four improvement notices in September related to dust 
management at Iron Bridge.
Iron Bridge, built at a cost of $US3.9bn, was originally supposed to be producing 22 million tonnes of high-grade 
iron ore concentrate a year by June 2023. The operations produced 1.6 million tonnes in the three months to the 
end of September and have been plagued by various setbacks and cost blowouts. "You have a look at the 
magnetite projects to ramp up around the world. It's not perfect, but it's going really well," Dr Forrest said.

It takes only two words to mesmerise investors this year: data centres.
They are red-hot. It's part artificial intelligence, part cloud adoption and part big tech, colliding in the sweet spots 
where public and private markets and infrastructure and real estate (together "real assets") meet. Investors are 
hooked.
We've seen all sorts of proof points recently - AirTrunk's $23.5 billion sale, NextDC's back-to-back equity raisings, 
AustralianSuper's multibillion-dollar bet and David Di Pilla's opportunistic (and still pending) IPO.
But the one that is hiding in plain sight, and doing things its own way, is $70 billion warehouses and logistics parks 
developer, operator and fund manager Goodman Group. It told investors it was crossing into data centres last year, 
and has since added about $25 billion to its market capitalisation.
What's it done to date? A lot of preparation work. It has the sites, has scurried together a 5 gigawatt power bank - 
up from more than 3GW when the plans were first unveiled mid-last year - including 2.6GW of secured power and 
another 2.4GW in advanced negotiations, and has started digging trenches at a few sites.
It has also been talking to potential co-investors (or capital partners) and customers, including the big tech 
companies who need homes for their AI training machines, and hiring engineers and other staff with the appropriate 
expertise. Greg Goodman, the conductor, gave his latest update yesterday. He revealed only a little bit more than 
the last time he fronted analysts in August, really.
The secured powerbank, for example, was up to 2.6GW from 2.5GW. He's talking more about developing turnkey 
data centres - fully designed, built, powered, installed - and even operating them, although can and will also do 
lighter "powered shells" for the opportunity.
Where exactly are these data centres, though?
What's the rollout schedule?
Page 2 of 3
Goodman's striking run at data centres Closing Bell
How quickly can that 2.6GW power bank turn into revenue?
Who exactly is Goodman Group in talks with to invest in them?
What are the expected returns?
Goodman punted a lot of the questions, or at least the specific answers to them, into next year.
He wasn't evasive, so much as not yet ready for the full reveal. He promised a more fulsome update when he fronts 
the market with his company's half-year results in February, saying 2025 would be a big year for project starts.
It sounds like he expects to be building data centres in the US, Europe, Japan and Australia next year. Some of 
them will be co-located with Goodman's logistics assets, others will be standalone. Artarmon in Sydney, the only 
specific site to get a callout during the analyst briefing, is the latter.
Analysts and investors are lapping it up. There was no dissent on the call, no pushing Goodman to be more specific 
about the returns/investors/sites - he gave away enough to satisfy curious minds, but kept coming back to next 
February's more comprehensive briefing. The shares are up more than 40 per cent so far this year.
This sort of organic expansion plan is rare in Australia. Such plans tend to only take place where a big player in one 
industry spots a gap in a new or booming adjacent industry - like a warehouses builder getting into powered shells, 
or pay TV company Foxtel getting into streaming with Kayo/Binge.
Listening to the call, we couldn't help but think Goodman Group's treatment was a stark contrast to another large 
cap's ambitious organic expansion plans: Fortescue's move into hydrogen and energy more broadly.
Fortescue's calls are met with demands for more details: where are the sites, what's the rollout schedule, how 
quickly can it turn into revenue, who are the co-investors, what are the expected returns - all the same stuff that is a 
bit vague at Goodman Group.
It's got to the point where analysts are sick of talking and hearing about it until there are binding agreements worth 
disclosing, even if the message is delivered by Andrew Forrest, another of Australia's great founder class who has 
created plenty of value for long-term shareholders.
It shows the difference of being hot - or not. Data centres are clearly hot (hydrogen still not), with demand right now, 
customers keen to sign long-term contracts and infrastructure and real estate investors willing to invest in new 
projects to underwrite developments. That reduces the risk involved of a logistics park developer switching over to 
data centres, which can cost $1 billion-plus and take years to build.
It is a credit to Greg Goodman's ability to spot an opportunity and make a run for it.
He's doing it without any acquisitions ("it's highly competitive if you want to buy anything already operational", he 
says) or diluting shareholders with equity raisings, preferring to build capability within his existing team and utilise its 
existing sites. (So is Fortescue for that matter, albeit there is much more scepticism around the clean energy end-
market and no sign that customers are willing to step up today to underwrite big developments.)
The other thing that helps Goodman is that his core logistics business is in rude health. It reported 97.5 per cent 
occupancy across its industrial and warehouse assets at September 30, which includes partnership sites, and 4.9 
per cent like-for-like net property income growth. It reaffirmed FY25 operating earnings per share and distribution 
guidance, and isn't reliant on one customer (China) like Fortescue.
If Goodman pulls it off, it will be one of the great strategic pivots.
For now, having added tens of billions to Goodman Group's value, it is already one of the most valuable organic 
growth strategies we've seen on the ASX. Goodman's job is to turn that value, which is based on potential, promise 
and things like land banks and sites, into built and functioning data centres.Page 3 of 3

Australia's largest sheep station has been publicly listed for sale after an existing deal with mining magnate Andrew 
'Twiggy' Forrest's ASX-listed Fortescue fell over.
Jumbuck Pastoral listed the 1,046,323ha Rawlinna Station for sale, more than a year after it emerged that 
Dr"Forrest and Fortescue Metals Group via subsidiary Fortescue Future Industries, had entered into a conditional 
contract to purchase the sprawling outback station.
Located 400km east of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, Rawlinna is regarded as Australia's largest operating sheep 
station, covering an area about the size of Greater Sydney, and carrying up to 69,000 sheep in recent seasons.
A Fortescue spokesman said the transaction had been left in limbo for almost a year while waiting for approval 
from the WA government.
"Fortescue is no longer proceeding with the acquisition of Rawlinna Station. We have been waiting for ministerial 
approval of the transfer for 11 months," the spokesman said.
"Following this extended period, with policy ambiguity remaining regarding government approval, we have chosen 
to withdraw from the sale of Rawlinna, which was always a long-term energy opportunity for Fortescue.
"Withdrawing from the sale provides certainty for the Rawlinna workforce and the Nullarbor community in relation to 
the current and future operations at Rawlinna." Fortescue said they remained committed to pursuing long-term 
green energy opportunities in the Nullabor and southeast WA.
Following the withdrawal, Jumbuck Pastoral listed the station publicly, via a staged expression of interest campaign 
via Elders.
It is understood the station is for sale bare (excluding livestock), and it is expected to attract offers greater than 
$20m.
Page 2 of 2
Twiggy abandons Rawlinna Station purchase
"The portfolio of agricultural assets that has been acquired by Jumbuck over many years of sustained investment is 
truly extraordinary," said Elders executive general manager of network, Tom Russo.
"Whilst the divestment of Rawlinna constitutes a significant sale, in the context of their overall portfolio, this is 
merely a refinement to better align the asset base with Jumbuck's strategy moving into the future. Jumbuck's 
intention is to continue to invest in the improvement and growth of their proudly Australian family-owned agricultural 
enterprise.
"Given the strategic advantages and efficiencies that can be achieved by operating an enterprise at this scale, we 
anticipate receiving offers from both large private and corporate investors within Australia and -internationally." 
Rawlinna Station was established in the 1960s after Hugh MacLachlan sighted a remote siding called Rawlinna as 
he was travelling from South Australia to Perth on the Indian Pacific. Last October, the 136-year-old company split 
their 5.2 million-hectare empire of 12 stations between brothers Jock and Callum MacLachlan and their father, 
Hugh. Jumbuck Pastoral retained the 112,000ha Gunbar Station alongside the 513,000ha Commonwealth Hill and 
309,600ha Bulgunnia Station in South Australia and 254,648ha Blina Station in WA's Kimberley following the carve 
up.

London | Fortescue boss Andrew Forrest says he has already received overtures from Donald Trump, and he will 
urge the US president-elect to switch from a "drill, baby, drill" push for more fossil fuels to a renewables-focused 
policy of "build, baby, build".
Speaking from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, where he is attending the annual COP climate summit that many 
CEOs have shunned this year, Dr Forrest eschewed his usual high-intensity rhetoric on the climate crisis, instead 
talking Trump's language of dollars and cents.
He said Fortescue had estimated the cost of sticking with natural gas at its iron ore operations would leave "not a 
lot of change at all out of $US17 to $US18 billion" ($26 to $28 billion) - almost three times the $US6.2 billion cost of 
the miner's "real zero" shift to fully renewable power.
"The president-elect's office did reach out to us on the night of the election. And we'll be more than pleased to 
explain why real zero is the cut-through for financing what I call the economic transition," he said.
Trump, a climate sceptic, has vowed to junk President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which is offering 
$US369 billion of subsidies and incentives to companies involved in the energy transition, including Fortescue.
Instead, he wants the federal government to get behind a renewed expansion of the oil and gas industry, using the 
slogan "drill, baby, drill".
Dr Forrest conceded the slogan was "kind of interesting, catchy".
"But look where it's got us - it's got us to unreliable, unpredictable, fluctuating energy prices, which have had an 
extreme negative effect on everyone's living costs," he said.
"What I say is, 'build, baby, build': build out these [green energy] systems, replace fossil fuel completely and 
forever, and it's a great investment.

Forrest uses dollars to make sense with Trump Energy transition
"What the president-elect will look at hard, climate sceptic or not, is that the best investment the US can make is 
sitting on the table. And it's proven, thanks to Fortescue."
Although Fortescue has scaled back some of its energy-transition plans, particularly on green hydrogen, it still 
hopes to decarbonise its mining operations in the Pilbara, without relying on carbon offsets, by 2030.
In the US, Fortescue has allocated $US550 million to its proposed Phoenix Hydrogen Hub, envisaging an 80-
megawatt electrolyser and liquefaction plant with a production capacity of up to 11,000 tonnes a year of liquid green 
hydrogen.
Dr Forrest said that winding back the IRA would be unlikely to shift Fortescue's US investment plans, "but it would 
make other projects around the world more attractive".
Axing the IRA would "certainly make the US less competitive", he said. "'Drill, baby' drill' - as opposed to 'build, 
baby, build' - is not going to drive economic growth. It's not going to drive full employment."
Dr Forrest said he was using COP29 in Baku to road-test his pitch to the Trump administration.

Mining billionaire Andrew Forrest has become the first business leader to back a proposed treaty setting concrete 
deadlines for the global phase-out of fossil fuels.
The Fortescue boss used the backdrop of this year's COP climate summit in Azerbaijan to pledge his support for 
the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, which was launched in 2019 to end the expansion of fossil fuels and 
accelerate the transition away from coal, oil and gas.
The treaty has already been endorsed by the European Parliament, the World Health Organisation, more than a 
dozen countries, 120 cities and almost one million people - including scientists and 100 Nobel Prize laureates.
Forrest, who is estimated to be worth $34 billion, acknowledged the role his $54 billion iron ore empire had played 
in the climate crisis while calling on world leaders to take urgent action.
"Devastating hurricanes and flooding across the world are causing unprecedented economic damage and mortality, 
all due to our warming ocean. Columbia has just declared a state of disaster due to torrential flooding," he said.
"The world is watching. The only solution that can bring our energy costs down and decarbonise the planet at the 
same time is to stop burning fossil fuels.
"We need to stop talking about Net Zero and instead move to Real Zero - the complete elimination of all 
greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the extraction, use and burning of fossil fuels.
"The company I founded, Fortescue, is part of the global group of major companies and conglomerates that are 
responsible for all the industrial pollution in the world which is by far and away the largest pollution group of 
humanity.
"Fortescue is one of Australia's biggest polluters - but will economically eliminate fossil fuels to be Real Zero by 
2030. If we can do it, others can too."
Fortescue maintains it is on track to decarbonise its operations in Western Australia's Pilbara region by 2030 
through the use of wind and solar energy, despite having cut back its ambitious green hydrogen plans.

The mining giant's prominent chair has been vocal in his opposition to the expansion of oil and gas projects, 
including Woodside's $18 billion Scarborough gas export project in his home state.
Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative chair Tzeporah Berman said she hoped Forrest's influence would 
encourage other business leaders and philanthropic organisations to pledge support the movement.
The move came just days after Minderoo Foundation, the charity Forrest founded with former wife Nicola, hosted 
Pacific leaders and government representatives to discuss a possible Australia-Pacific hosted COP-31 in 2026.

Fortescue has appointed a new chief executive to run what was known as Williams Advanced Engineering in the 
latest leadership shake-up in the company's green energy division.
Ellie Coates will be in the driver's seat at Fortescue Zero Power Systems, a business that started life as an 
offshoot of the Williams F1 racing team and was acquired for $US222m in 2022.
She will become the third chief executive at the UK-based business in the past six months and steps into the role 
post a major Fortescue reset that saw the company slash 700 jobs and slow its push into green hydrogen. The 
business is tasked with adapting the technology applied in racing electric cars in Formula E to moving big volumes 
of iron ore using haul trucks under Fortescue's goal to eradicate greenhouse gas emissions in its mining 
operations.
Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest doubled down on his commitment to stop using diesel in the 
company's mining operation by 2030 at the weekend by backing a proposed fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty. Ms 
Coates will report to Fortescue energy boss Mark Hutchinson, who stepped in to run Fortescue Zero after the 
sudden departure of Judith Judson in June.
A separate business within the energy division - Fortescue Zero Hydrogen Systems - is run by Cameron Smith, 
who also reports to Mr Hutchinson.
The work done by Fortescue Zero Power Systems is integral to Fortescue's $US2.8bn ($4.3bn) partnership with 
Europe-based Liebherr to jointly develop zero emission mining machinery -solutions.
Fortescue expects to purchase about 360 autonomous battery electric trucks, 55 electric excavators and 60 battery 
powered dozers under the deal.
Liebherr's role is to provide the chassis while the battery power systems will be supplied by Fortescue Zero.
Ms Coates, previously Fortescue's executive director of strategy and innovation, will move from Perth to the UK in 
her new role.

A Fortescue spokesman said Mr Hutchinson would remain chief executive of the Fortescue energy division.
The $US2.8bn figure on the Liebherr partnership represents the cost to the Fortescue mining division of buying 
trucks and other machinery.
Mr Hutchinson recently told analysts Fortescue Zero would capture some of the revenue from the sales. "We just 
have to remember that a big part of that flows back to Fortescue Zero because a big part of the trucks is the power 
system," he said.
Ms Judson was appointed chief executive of Fortescue Zero in 2023 as it opened two new -facilities in the UK and 
foreshadowed a recruitment drive. She lasted less than a year before returning to her home in the US.
Fortescue has budgeted $US6.2bn to achieve a switch to renewable energy to decarbonise its iron ore operations 
by 2030. Dr Forrest described the company as one of Australia's biggest greenhouse gas polluters at the weekend, 
but said it could convert the burning of one billion litres of diesel equivalent a year into "long-term profitable green 
energy assets" by 2030.

What was once a pipe dream is becoming a reality now that mining industry giants are investing in zero-emissions 
solutions, but there's still a long way to go. By Cameron England
ELECTRIC VEHICLES MIGHT still be a green badge of honour in our cities but, at Twiggy Forrest's Pilbara 
operations, they're part of a revolution helping to transform Australia's mining sites. Those pictures of giant, diesel-
hungry haul trucks and trains that have defined the nation's mining sector for decades may soon be consigned to 
the history books as resource companies go electric.
Fortescue, for example, is in the process of purchasing 360 autonomous battery-electric trucks, 55 electric 
excavators and 60 battery-powered dozers as it joins other big miners, such as BHP, in a bid to solve the sector's 
dependency on diesel. But it's an expensive transition and with upfront capital costs up to double that of diesel, 
some players in the mining sector are looking for government help.
In a recent report, the Electric Mine Consortium, which counted South32, Barminco, IGO and Sandfire as members, 
called for tax incentives to help drive mine electrification, arguing it could reduce operating costs to 56-88 per cent 
of the diesel-powered equivalent. The report says there were significant financial and health and safety benefits 
from going electric, but the cost was a deterrent. Only 60 per cent of Australian miners say they will transition to 
electric power in their next development.
The report says high capital cost is the primary barrier to adopting electric equipment for 76 per cent of miners 
surveyed, while 50 per cent lack confidence in its operational effectiveness. "Across the Australian industry, there is 
a clear consensus that the major barriers to progress are the capital cost and the confidence in new electric 
equipment," the report says.
Capital tax incentives - such as Canada's 30 per cent investment tax credit and its accelerated capital cost 
allowance which allows faster depreciation - would help, according to the report. It also notes that Australia's diesel 
tax credit will cost taxpayers $37bn from 2024-30 but, not surprisingly, with such industry dependence on diesel, it 
stops short of arguing for its removal.

ELECTRIC VISION
Despite the costs, the big miners are increasingly talking up their commitment to dump diesel, and some are 
developing radical technology solutions as part of the transition. BHP, for example, will trial a new energy transfer 
system in its Caterpillar vehicles at its Jimblebar and Escondida sites. The dynamic energy transfer system 
converts energy from the mine site's power source, uses an electrified rail system to transfer the energy to the 
truck, and a machine system to transfer the energy to the truck's powertrain.
Caterpillar, one of the world's biggest suppliers of diesel-powered heavy vehicles, says the rail system is a "highly 
deployable, mobile solution that can be customised to customers' specific site layouts".
BHP plans to source 500MW of renewable power and storage in the Pilbara by 2030 and says it will have its first 
all-electric truck fleet operating before the end of the decade. The global miner says it is on track to deliver "at least" 
a 30 per cent reduction in scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 against a 2020 baseline, and has 
maintained its aspirational target to be net zero by 2050.
Fortescue, meanwhile, has signed a $US2.8bn ($4.2bn) deal with German truck manufacturer Liebherr, which 
aims to convert two-thirds of its mining fleet to zero-emissions battery technology over the next couple of years.
Part of the Fortescue push has its genesis in Formula 1 technology: two years ago, the miner bought Williams 
Advanced Engineering, an offshoot of the legendary F1 team founded by the late Sir Frank Williams. The 
company's battery technology will play a key role in enabling Fortescue to electrify its haul fleet, with rapid charging 
at the core of its strategy. The fast-charging F1 technology can charge a haul truck in 30 minutes, providing six 
hours of run-time, and Fortescue chief executive Dino Otranto says that while that's impressive, it's just the 
beginning.
"We've got a concept called boost charging in the works, which could bring the current charging time of minutes 
down to seconds," says Otranto. "That will unlock even further productivity increases. As it stands, the first 
generation charger and power system combination is already a better offering than its diesel equivalent in the 
market." The deal with Liebherr builds on a 2022 purchase of 120 haul trucks from the German company.
The problem of heavy haul vehicles queued for charging is an issue for the miners, but Fortescue will use a robotic 
charging system, which, combined with the fast charging times and autonomous vehicle operation, is designed to 
solve that issue.
Four autonomous trucks are now being checked at Fortescue's testing site, with the first deployment on site 
expected in the first quarter of 2025 with validation of the complete autonomous battery-electric solution expected in 
early 2026. Fortescue also aims to sell its technology to other companies in the mining sector, once it has been 
proved up.
In its 2024 Global Metals and Mining Outlook, KPMG said the resources sector would have to pull off a remarkable 
feat in coming years - both dramatically reducing its carbon footprint while increasing minerals output. "Global 
demand for minerals indispensable to a low-carbon economy, such as copper, lithium, cobalt, nickel and graphite, is 
expected to increase fourfold by 2040," the professional services firm said. "At the same time, metals and mining 
companies are highly carbon intensive. The mining industry accounts for two to three per cent of global carbon 
emissions and metals production comprises an additional eight to 10 per cent. Combined, metals and mining are 
responsible for more than half of greenhouse gas emissions from global industry."

Billionaire Andrew Forrest s Fortescue is deepening investments to decarbonize the iron ore giant s mining fleet 
with the purchase of $400 million of emissions free heavy mining equipment from China sXCMG.
XCMG will supply over 100 electric-powered heavy mining equipment to Fortescue s Pilbara mining operations 
starting 2026 through 2030, the Australian miner said in astatementon its website.
The transaction comes on top of a$2.8-billion contractsigned by Fortescue with Germany s Liebherr-International 
AG in September for 475 emissions-free machines to replace two-thirds of the company s mining fleet in western 
Australia.
The XCMG equipment will eliminate millions of liters of fossil fuels from its iron ore operations over the life cycle of 
the assets, Fortescue said.
The contract with Fortescue XCMG s largest order outside of China for mining equipment covers battery electric 
wheel loaders, wheel dozers, water carts, float prime movers and graders.
 We re moving rapidly to decarbonize our Pilbara iron ore operations and eliminate our Scope 1 and 2 terrestrial 
emissions by 2030,  Dino Otranto, CEO of Fortescue Metals, said in the statement.  To achieve this target, we will

A so-called "green metal" start-up has lodged an appeal in a bid to overturn a judge's decision that allowed mining 
giant Fortescue to seize millions of files from the homes and offices of its staff as part of a battle over intellectual 
property.
Element Zero, founded by ex-Fortescue executives Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-
Jensen, is accused of stealing the Andrew Forrest's clean energy trade secrets before they launched their own 
business.
Fortescue secured search -orders from a Federal Court judge in May. The orders allowed it to carry out surprise 
raids on the houses of Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen to seize millions of files for their case off the back of 
what the Element Zero personnel described as "unprecedented" surveillance.
Mr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk challenged the initial decision to grant Fortescue the search orders. Federal 
Court judge Brigitte Markovic dismissed their application.
A Fortescue spokesman reiterated a previous statement. "Fortescue will vigorously defend Element Zero's 
attempt to have the decision of the court overturned," he said. Now, the Element Zero team has lodged an appeal 
against Justice Markovic's decision to allow the search orders. She had found Fortescue failed to inform the 
primary judge about a series of meetings involving the two companies and a nondisclosure agreement signed by Mr 
Masterman.

Fortescue has turned to a Chinese machinery manufacturer as it races the clock to hit executive chairman Andrew 
Forrest's ambitious target to decarbonise the company's iron ore mines by 2030.
The company will spend up to $US400m ($618.2m) on equipment from Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group as it 
hedges its bets on the project to electrify its mining fleet.
Unlike Fortescue's partnership with Europe-based Liebherr, the XCMG machinery will not make use of battery 
power systems developed by Fortescue Zero.
The off-the-shelf XCMG equipment is expected to start arriving at Fortescue's mine in the Pilbara in 2026.
The supply contract is XCMG's largest outside of China for mining equipment and covers the supply more than 100 
battery electric wheel loaders, wheel dozers, water carts, float prime movers and graders over four years to 2030.
The deal comes four months after XCMG signed a $US110bn deal with Rio Tinto and its joint venture partners to 
supply diesel-electric trucks and graders for the Simandou project in Guinea.
Fortescue has budgeted $US6.2bn to achieve a switch to renewable energy to decarbonise its iron ore operations, 
which currently burn about one billion litres of diesel equivalent a year.
Fortescue estimates the rollout of the XCMG machinery will cut diesel consumption by about 40,000 litres a year. 
Most of the costs associated with purchasing the XCMG equipment will come from Fortescue's sustaining capital 
expenditure budget and is aligned with its scheduled asset replacement cycle.

A "green metal" start-up is appealing against a judge's decision that allowed mining giant Fortescue to seize 
millions of files from the homes and offices of its staff as part of a battle over intellectual property.
Element Zero, founded by ex-Fortescue executives Michael Masterman, Bart Kolodziejczyk and Bjorn Winther-
Jensen, is accused of stealing the Andrew Forrest's clean energy trade secrets before the three launched their own 
business.
Fortescue secured search orders from a Federal Court judge in May. The orders allowed it to carry out surprise 
raids on the houses of Dr Kolodziejczyk and Dr Winther-Jensen to seize millions of files for their case following what 
the Element Zero personnel described as "unprecedented" surveillance.
Mr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk challenged the initial decision to grant Fortescue the search orders, but 
Federal Court judge Brigitte Markovic dismissed their application.
A Fortescue spokesman reiterated a previous statement about the case: "Fortescue will vigorously defend 
Element Zero's attempt to have the decision of the court overturned," he said.
"Two Federal Court judges have found a strong prima facie case that the Element Zero parties misused 
Fortescue's confidential information and breached its rights.
"Fortescue remains committed to protecting its intellectual property and investment in green technologies, and 
looks forward to progressing the matter to a final trial." The Element Zero team has lodged an appeal against 
Justice Markovic's decision to allow the search orders.
She had found Fortescue failed to inform the primary judge about a series of meetings that took place involving the 
two companies and a subsequent nondisclosure agree-ment that was signed by Mr Masterman.
"The primary judge erred in failing to set aside the search orders made by the duty judge on 14 May, 2024 â€¦ after 
finding there was a material nondisclosure by Fortescue when making their ex parte application," the appeal 
application says.
Page 2 of 2
Element Zero appeals against raid decision
"The primary judge ought to have set aside the search orders, in whole or in part." Justice Markovic found that it 
was not "Fortescue's intention to mislead the court" and there was no misuse of the search orders as alleged.
But Element Zero disagrees, and its application also says the judge erred because Fortescue did not disclose that 
Dr Kolod-ziejczyk had been instructed to work from home after he gave his notice to quit.
The application said that as a result, Dr Kolodziejczyk worked on his personal devices and communicated with 
Fortescue colleagues - including sending them documents containing the work he was doing.
"The primary judge erred in exercising a discretion not to set aside the search orders," the application states. 
Element Zero said it was not right to form the view that Fortescue had a strong prima facie case and the material 
non-disclosure would not have changed the court's decision.
Justice Markovic made those observations in her judgment, when she chose to not set aside the search orders.
Justice Markovic also said in her judgment that Element Zero failed to explain why the Fortescue case was 
unwarranted.
Element Zero said Justice Markovic erred in her reasons not to dispel the orders when she found there was a lack 
of utility in doing so, and when Fortescue could apply for the search orders to be made again and independent 
experts had already filed their reports.
Mr Masterman and Dr Kolodziejczyk have asked the court to allow their appeal and an order that the search orders 
be -dismissed.
An Element Zero spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday, but previously said the original search orders 
were carried out "after unprecedented surveillance of Element Zero employees and strangers by private 
investigators". "(This) represented massive overreach by Fortescue," he said.

Fortescue says it will build all of renewable energy assets needed to decarbonise the company's iron ore 
operations in Western Australia on its own tenements over the next five years and is about to start work on a 190 
megawatt solar farm at the Cloudbreak mine.
The Cloudbreak project is almost double the size of the only other solar farm built by Fortescue, with work 
expected to start before the end of March.
It is understood Fortescue has a number of renewables projects in the pipeline awaiting final investment decisions. 
The Andrew Forrest-led Fortescue estimates it will need an additional 2-3GW of renewable energy and battery 
storage under plans to stop using diesel and gas by 2030.
It has been unclear how Fortescue intends to reach the renewable energy target in the timeframe required, given 
land access and permitting issues in WA.
Fortescue applied for miscellaneous tenements covering about 150,000ha near its mining operations last year. 
Those applications remain pending, meaning Fortescue is yet to secure the tenements on a basis that would allow 
it to develop renewables projects under WA's Mining Act.
The tenement applications came hot on the heels of Fortescue quietly scrapping plans for a multibillion-dollar wind 
and solar farm that had been a key plank of the decarbonisation plan.
Fortescue chief operating officer Shelley Robertson said on Tuesday that the company would build all of the 
renewable capacity required under its own steam on its tenements.
"It will all be up and running by 2030," she said. "We're building about 2.5GW in solar and wind in the Pilbara, and 
also having batteries to support the downtime there. And we'll be looking at different ways to operate around that 
new renewable energy system that we're installing." Ms Robertson said expenditure on the wind and solar farms 
would come from the $US6.2bn ($9.6bn) set aside to reach the decarbonisation target.

Big solar farm for Fortescue operation
The project abandoned last year - known as Uaroo Renewable Energy Hub - involved building more than 300 wind 
turbines and a solar farm with a capacity of up to 5.4GW on cattle stations a south of Onslow in the Pilbara. The 
construction work was estimated to take seven years.
Fortescue has built one 100MW solar farm, known as North Star Junction, near its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite 
operations.
The 150,000ha tenement package understood to figure in its broader renewable plans is mostly covered by land-
use agreements with the Nyamal and Pakyka traditional owner groups.
Fortescue intends to use renewable energy to charge its electric mining machinery. The company received $10m 
from the taxpayer-funded Australian Renewable Energy Agency on Tuesday to develop a 6MW fast charger test 
unit for its future mining fleet.
Mr Forrest said at the Fortescue annual general meeting last month that the company wanted help in the form of 
approvals and infrastructure to reach its "real-zero" decarbonisation target. Mr Forrest said substantial land was 
required for solar and wind farms but traditional owners and other stakeholders were keen to become involved.

Body
All right, so the leaders of the Australian Catholic University got what they wanted last week with the reappointment 
of vice-chancellor Zlatko Skrbis to a five-year contract - that's despite the parlous state of the university and the 
battering of its reputation on his watch.
Skrbis, for a prize, will be $5m richer by the end of his term. Meanwhile, ACU's financial fortunes will be lucky to 
scrape into surplus by the time he's gone.
Skrbis arrived in 2021 presiding over a $55.5m pot of gold, which was drained into an $8m deficit by the end of 
2022 and a $35.7m deficit by the close of 2023. The deficit for 2024 is anyone's guess, but it's shaping to be deeper 
than a dwarven mine once the results become available in the coming weeks.
But truth be told, the ACU balance sheet is really not our primary concern here. Instead, our jolly is with a letter 
dispatched by ACU Corporation president (and Brisbane Archbishop) Mark Coleridge in which he hand-wrings 
muchly over the lack of public adulation for the institution's leadership.
For you see, the corporation owns the university, and according to Coleridge it hasn't been cheering loudly enough 
for Skrbis or for chancellor Martin Daubney and pro-chancellor Victoria Bourke, all three of whom, in Coleridge's 
mind, have been subjected to "relentless public attacks â€¦ impugning their integrity, truthfulness and competence".
We can only wonder if Daubney himself had a hand in the construction of this cry from the heart under Coleridge's 
name (and we obviously have no proof of that), because while Skrbis received a vote of confidence with the 
renewal of his contract, Daubney and Bourke haven't benefited from the same "comparable public statement of 
support", as Coleridge put it. As Lenin famously wrote in 1913: "It is not so important who directly advocates 
particular views. What is important is who stands to gain from these views." Thus Coleridge's ham-fisted attempt to 
rustle up the corporation's two dozen members for some spontaneous and uninterrupted clapping of the ACU's 
leadership politburo. He attempted a similar play a few months ago and the response was the loudest silence ever 
known to man.
Page 2 of 3
ACU told to cheer for its leaders
We've obtained Comrade Coleridge's letter and it veers on North Korean in both effort and intent. There's a request 
that his corporation members denounce the press coverage of ACU's horrendous decision-making and proclaim it 
all unfair. He also enjoins them to thank Skrbis "for his service to the university" and "congratulate him on his 
reappointment".
As for Daubney and Bourke, Coleridge's suggestion is that the corporation "state publicly their support for the 
chancellor and pro-chancellor" and thank them "for their service to the university through this turbulent time". No 
mention of what gave rise to this turbulence in the first place. And besides, if you have to ask â€¦ We were 
supposed to see this vigorous statement of support released by Monday night, with Coleridge saying he wanted to 
publish it "if a majority of members consent".
And lo, that deadline has passed. What on earth could that mean?
Spiteful $10m battle What's $10m between billionaires? Plenty, it seems, given the level of spite on evidence in the 
latest legal exchanges between Andrew Forrest's US energy arm and Paul Tudor Jones's private advisory firm.
Tudor Jones's Kid Shelleen is suing Fortescue's US subsidiaries for allegedly ratting on a deal to jointly bid for gas 
and coal-fired power stations in the Americas so they could be turned into hydrogen production centres - back when 
Fortescue still thought that was a good idea, in 2022.
Instead, Kid Shelleen says it was cut loose by Fortescue after a change of US management - with no 
reimbursement for the costs of the work it did, accusing Fortescue of "immoral, unethical and unscrupulous" 
behaviour.
Forrest described the allegations as a "total non-event" at the time. And, legal affairs being the same all over the 
world, the matter has barely gotten to the discovery stage so far.
But it's fair to say that tempers are getting a little short in the United States District Court for the District of 
Connecticut.
Matters started normally enough. Both parties requested a pile of documents, each party handed over a pile of 
documents, and sundry discussions were had about whether either pile of paperwork fit the brief.
And then Fortescue went nuclear, heading to the court with an accusation that Kid Shelleen of having "violated" a 
court order when handing over its latest batch of documents. That's a pretty serious allegation among lawyers.
The problem? Lawyers for Tudor Jones had sent over some 2000 documents - including diary entries for Kid 
Shelleen executive John Vivenzio - without saying who they belonged to. Fortescue's brief sent a complaint about 
this at midnight the same day - suggesting, as an aside, the legal costs are likely to be worth more than the $13m at 
stake.
No problem, says Kid Shelleen the next morning. You didn't ask us who owned them, but here's that information as 
well. In response, Fortescue trots off to the court to complain that its orders had been violated.
Outrage ensues.
"Defendants attempt to manufacture a violation of this court's order where none exists," thundered Kid Shelleen in 
its response. "Defendants have made clear that, rather than litigate the case on the merits, they would prefer to try 
to wear the plaintiff down through a never-ending series of manufactured discovery disputes." Anyway, Fortescue 
did the same thing to us when we forgot to include a request for the owner of documents supplied, the submission 
continues. And they can't complain about the number of documents we gave them, because that's what they asked 
for.
"Defendants' complaint that plaintiff has identified nearly 2000 documents that Mr Vivenzio alone reviewed and/or 
relied upon boils down to the simple fact that Mr Vivenzio reviewed his calendar in creating his declaration, and his 
calendar had a lot of entries on it," says the submission.Page 3 of 3

The Indigenous Business Review KingKira Group is thriving thanks to Fortescue's dedication to support and 
elevate First Nations enterprises, writes Zak Kirkup KingKira Group, a standout in First Nations business, is 
charging forward with a major new contract from Fortescue. The multi-year deal, which covers waste management 
services across Fortescue's Pilbara iron ore operations, represents a new level of growth and autonomy for 
KingKira - a 100 per cent Indigenous-owned enterprise rooted in the leadership of founder Tammy O'Connor.
O'Connor, a proud Palyku woman with deep Nyiyaparli and Kariyarra heritage, founded KingKira in 2014. Back 
then, the company's partnership with Fortescue began through its Billion Opportunities program, which was aimed 
at empowering Indigenous businesses.
Reflecting on this milestone, O'Connor says: "Fortescue, through their Billion Opportunities program, has been 
instrumental in helping us grow as a business. I'm incredibly proud of how much we have grown and can now stand 
on our own with these major contracts." In a decade, KingKira has gone from an ambitious startup to a company 
with more than 119 employees, 103 mobile assets and a client base of 124 across four Pilbara locations. The 
numbers speak to a well-earned reputation for delivering top-tier service. But for O'Connor, they also represent 
much more: a success story that underscores the potential of Indigenous businesses to achieve independence in 
sectors where First Nations representation is still growing.
Fortescue's Warren Fish, director of approvals, communities, and environment, emphasises the wider impact of 
this partnership: "We've always been committed to initiatives that foster genuine economic and employment 
opportunities for First Nations Australians," he notes "Contracts like this not only help businesses like KingKira 
grow, but they also have a ripple effect, delivering long-lasting economic benefits to First Nations communities." 
The $5bn-plus that Fortescue has funnelled into Indigenous businesses through its Billion Opportunities program 
highlights how deliberate, well-structured support can elevate First Nations enterprises into sustainable, impactful 
entities within Australia's economy.
For KingKira, this new contract is a testament to resilience and innovation - a company that's gone beyond simply 
holding its own to thriving alongside global players.
Page 2 of 2
Capitalising on Opportunities
For KingKira, this latest contract isn't just another business win; it's a powerful symbol of Indigenous resilience and 
capability in Australia's economy.
The partnership shows that with the right opportunities, First Nations businesses can evolve from emerging players 
into industry leaders, standing toe-to-toe with some of the world's largest corporations.
Looking ahead, as Fortescue pursues ambitious goals for decarbonisation and sustainability, partnerships like this 
one with KingKira aren't just beneficial - they're essential.
Together, they're setting a new standard for collaboration, where economic growth aligns with community 
empowerment and cultural integrity. This collaboration underscores a vision of the future where Indigenous 
enterprises play a central role in Australia's resources sector, building a legacy that empowers First Nations 
communities for generations to come.

Andrew Forrest uses terms of endearment freely. In interviews and around the office, he often calls people "darl", 
"babe", "digger". Those close to him say that's just how he communicates.
But for members of a small Fortescue chat group, one message that flashed across their phone screens a few 
years ago still came as a surprise.
Some of the group of executives and directors were in the iron ore company's Perth headquarters when they were 
alerted to a new message in their group on the Signal app. The Fortescue chairman was overseas and had clearly 
made a mistake. The message, directed to a female employee, was quickly deleted but not before it rang alarm 
bells, according to four people with knowledge of the incident.
"From what I remember it said 'Jessie [not her real name], love, we need to talk, Jessie where are you? You know I 
need to know where you are'," says a former executive who was part of the Signal group. "It was overly familiar, 
and the wrong tone for the conversation as it was a chat with a handful of senior people about business stuff."
Another person who saw it says: "It was cringeworthy. People were shaking their heads."
It was sent at the tail end of the 2020-21 world tour, which involved a team of enthusiastic Fortescue staffers flying 
around the globe on the hunt for renewable energy projects to power Forrest's dream of building Fortescue into a 
green hydrogen powerhouse.
The Australian Financial Review has interviewed 23 former executives and associates, as well as Fortescue 
analysts, who say Forrest's erratic and at times impulsive leadership style contributed to the company's dramatic 
and costly backdown from its hydrogen ambitions this year.

Body
Top-tier law firm Herbert Smith Freehills has voted to remove one of its longstanding partners, Damien Hazard, 
over what it described as a "deeply offensive" tweet targeting Jeremy Leibler, a prominent partner at Arnold Bloch 
Leibler and president of the Zionist Federation of -Australian.
Thursday's decision ended a week of mortification for Hazard's bosses following numerous complaints about his 
online output directed at Israel and the war in Gaza. Not only was Hazard -ordered to immediately take down the 
offending tweet, but he was placed under investigation and instructed not to show his face in the office.
A raft of Jewish employees at the firm raised a riot with executive partner Kristin Stammer and director of culture 
and inclusion Danielle Kelly alleging Hazard had a "singular and obsessive focus on Israel" and published posts 
that displayed the "classic traits" of anti-Semitism.
Clearly outraged, and moving quickly to draw a line under the scandal, HSF chair and senior partner Rebecca 
Maslen-Stannage said the leadership council had voted to end Hazard's near-three-decade association with the 
firm.
"The council of Herbert Smith Freehills has resolved today that Damien Hazard should be removed as a partner 
from our firm," Ms Maslen-Stannage said. "We have issued him with the relevant notice." Numerous HSF clients 
were privately making their displeasure known to management about the matter, and presumably these hints of 
reputational damage bore no small weight on the council's decision-making. Plus, the timing couldn't have been 
worse: HSF is in the middle of merging with Jewish law firm Kramer Levin, whose bosses in New York wouldn't 
have looked kindly on the tweets either.
Hazard's back catalogue of online posting, according to the complaint letter from his colleagues, included 
expressions that allegedly played on tropes of "Jewish power", "Jews as murderous and blood thirsty" and -invoked 
"holocaust inversion" and "conspiracy theories".
Page 2 of 3
Freehills partner given boot
The tweet that appears to have cost him his partnership took aim at Leibler for linking the arson attack on the Adass 
Israel synagogue with the weekly Jew-hate parades that, as Leibler said, had been "displayed on the streets of 
Melbourne every week for over a year".
Hazard's response, amid the collective rage surrounding the anti-Semitic attack, was to accuse Leibler of "cynically 
politicising" the crime and "inventing a link" with the anti-Israel protests, which, as a set-piece, often loudly and 
proudly call for an "intifada", or violent uprising, against Jews.
So in a sense Hazard was right: the need for invention was wholly unnecessary. The link was evident all along.
Albo's about-face And just on that - it was quite a sight to see Anthony Albanese attempting to warmly embrace the 
nation's Jewish community in the days after the terrorist attack on the Adass Israel synagogue.
The PM started by almost dancing a hora into that barmitzvah in Perth. Three days later he donned a kippah and 
took a tour of the gutted Melbourne synagogue, and by Wednesday he was announcing an $8.5m upgrade to the 
Sydney Jewish Museum.
Such a mensch! You might have almost forgotten that the funding became necessary because the government's 
done such a lousy job of protecting the community.
And yet, as he shook his head and his voice almost caught in his throat, Albanese always knew that Australia was 
about to abandon the Jewish State - again - on two lopsided resolutions being thrown up at the UN - the first 
resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza (no strings attached on the release of hostages), and the second in 
defence of the criminally corrupt relief agency UNRWA.
It's strange how, on the one hand, Albanese insists that Hamas should play "no role" in any "future Palestinian 
state", only to then, on the other hand, barrack for a ceasefire that will entrench the terrorists and grant them space 
to re-arm and resupply - to the detriment of Palestinians.
It's almost as though Albanese and his Foreign Minister, Penny Wong, both suffer from a weird, childish 
misapprehension that the word "ceasefire" somehow equates to "peace". It doesn't, and it might be one reason why 
Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted his contempt for the Albanese government a week ago.
Setback for MinRes A minor setback for Chris Ellison's Mineral Resources in its bitter legal dispute with fellow 
MinRes founder Steve Wyatt - but one that reveals more about Wyatt's viewing habits than the state of the lawsuit.
MinRes has been in the courts for four years with Wyatt's rival mining services business, Destec, complaining that 
Wyatt stole MinRes secrets ahead of setting up the company in 2015.
The latest legal skirmish saw WA Supreme Court judge Jenni Hill knock back a bit of legal overreach from MinRes, 
which claimed a forensic examination of Wyatt's former laptop showed he copied thousands of documents while 
working for the company - some of which contained MinRes trade secrets later used to set up Destec to compete 
with MinRes.
Justice Hill struck out part of MinRes's statement of claim this week because it's not entirely clear what information 
Wyatt is alleged to have stolen.
Problem is the forensic examination doesn't show the contents of the files, just their names. And while some file 
names suggest they probably relate to MinRes technology and pricing information, others clearly don't.
And how do we know this? Well, as Hill pointed out in her decision, it's pretty unlikely that a set of files titled "Game 
of Thrones Season 5" includes any intimate details of the design mining machinery.
Mind you, given recent revelations about the internal workings of MinRes, you could probably mount an argument 
that the bloody fantasy saga is a pretty good guide to the internal workings of the company - though not to the 
standards required in a legal claim.Page 3 of 3
Freehills partner given boot
Still, it wasn't a major setback. The sloppy bit of legal argument only cost MinRes a couple of paragraphs from its 
claims, with liberty to re-plead those aspects of its case.
And it could have been worse. Rather than a fantasy epic, Wyatt could instead have been getting business advice 
from the final season of The Sopranos.
Green dreams Andrew Forrest has always run a pretty shameless line in self justification when things don't work out 
as planned. But this week's effort is pretty close to peak Twiggy.
Asked by the Australian Financial Review whether Fortescue's grand promises on green hydrogen - such as a 
"deal" to deliver 5 million tonnes a year to Germany's E.ON Energy by 2030 - weren't perhaps a touch over-egged, 
Forrest blamed the government for his failure.
"Governments were saying we need all this green hydrogen, [including] the government of Germany," he said. 
"E.ON is a government instrumentality. And so they're telling us what they need, and we're believing them. Now, 
when they suddenly back out, we're high and dry." This from the man who spent years flying around the world 
hectoring governments and industry about the need to replace fossil fuel sources with green hydrogen. And is yet to 
produce a single molecule of commercially viable hydrogen for sale, despite spending more than $2bn in 
shareholder money on the idea.
Since Forrest floated his hydrogen balloon, governments have announced billions of dollars worth of hydrogen 
production credits and subsidies. Germany updated its hydrogen strategy only days after Forrest cut loose 
Fortescue's hydrogen dreams in mid-July, and signed a $660m deal with Australia to encourage hydrogen 
production in September.
Forrest argues that Fortescue was forced to dump hydrogen because governments didn't act fast enough, and 
didn't do enough to drive down energy costs to help make hydrogen viable.
Why would they? If you can get renewable power prices low enough to make hydrogen viable, you're probably 
going to use it to do something more useful - like deliver cheap power to households and businesses, perhaps.
Forrest was told this over and over again by experts, inside and outside of Fortescue, but kept making promises 
that seemingly could never be delivered.
But it's OK, because green iron is now Fortescue's bright and shiny new thing. Rather than produce 15 million 
tonnes of hydrogen by 2030, Fortescue will be shipping 100 million tonnes of carbon-free iron by an unspecified 
date.
Earlier in Fortescue's history, plenty of people said this and were wrong - but we'll believe it when we see the first 
shipment leave Port Hedland.

The stunning 9000-word profile of Andrew Forrest by The Australian Financial Review associate editor Primrose 
Riordan is a portrait of one of our great entrepreneurs in all his glory - passionate, driven, visionary, pugilistic and, 
by his own admission, imperfect.
But alongside the in-depth exploration of Forrest's fascinating character is the story of a great Australian business 
approaching a pivotal moment - maybe the most pivotal since Forrest willed the company into existence through 
sheer force of personality.
In the coming years, Forrest must bring investors along on a great juggling act, as he manages growing pressure 
on his flagship iron ore business, a capital-hungry, but earnings-accretive decarbonisation program, and a new 
push into green iron. It's a puzzle worth tens of billions of dollars.
Fortescue has rightly earned a reputation as a dividend machine in the past five years, but the 31 per cent fall in 
the company's share price this year speaks to the pressure on its revenue and earnings from a sagging iron ore 
price.
The long-term outlook for prices isn't good. Citi, for example, has a long-term target of $US85 for iron ore in 2026; it 
estimates about 200 million tonnes of new supply is scheduled to come into the market and Chinese steel demand 
has peaked and will gently decline, even with the economic stimulus that is widely predicted for next year. 
Fortescue's revenue is expected to fall from $US18.2 billion ($28.6 billion) in the 2024 financial year to $US16.3 
billion in 2025 and $US14.1 billion in 2026 and $US13.9 billion in 2027, according to projections from RBC Capital.
Total annual dividends are tipped to fall from $1.97 in 2024 to 67¢ in 2027, as free cash flow before dividends and 
debt drops from $US5.1 billion to $US2.9 billion.
As a falling iron ore price squeezes the sustainability of the dividend from one end, investors are worried about 
another squeeze coming from Fortescue's capital expenditure bill.

Forrest's grand plan to decarbonise Fortescue's mining operations by retooling its heavy mining equipment by as 
early as 2030 will need at least $US6.2 billion on the company's estimates, although analysts believe the cost is 
more like $US7 billion to $US8 billion.
There is value to be extracted from this decarbonisation push, which Jarden analyst Jon Bishop puts at $1.87 a 
share if Fortescue hits its target of zero carbon emission (without the help of offsets) by a conservative 2040, or 
$2.25 a share if the target is achieved by the company's stated aim of 2030.
But Bishop remains frustrated at the lack of detail from Fortescue about the size of the capex bill over the next five 
years - which he believes the market is underestimating - and the potential savings that could be generated by a 
decarbonised mining operation.
"The capex numbers assumed in our estimates are anchored to guidance that, beyond FY25, lacks significant 
granularity and is therefore prone to significant changes in due course. However, in our view, whatever the final 
numbers are, they are large," he says of the capex task ahead.
There are other questions too. The green hydrogen dream is off the table for now, but the market is still struggling 
to get its head around the cost of Fortescue's green ammonia projects.
Then there's Forrest's nascent plan to value-add to iron ore by turning it into green iron, which is where low-carbon 
solutions such as green hydrogen and solar energy are used to remove waste elements from iron ore (such as 
silica and alumina), leaving behind a product that is almost pure iron. What this project looks like, and what it costs, 
isn't quite clear.
Forrest has plenty of credits in the bank with investors. But they're looking for meat on the bones of his grand 
vision.

It was a meeting whispered about as Fortescue's version of the "red wedding" scene from Game of Thrones, in 
which a slew of characters were killed off in one sitting. Fortescue's executive chairman, Andrew Forrest, refers to 
it as "judgment day", which in the Bible is God's final sorting of people into the saved and the damned.
Appropriately, it took place in the "red cafe" at the company's Perth headquarters, so named for its colour scheme. 
And it was a bloodbath. One person who was there says Fortescue's chief executive at the time, Elizabeth Gaines, 
was in tears, and the rest of the company's C-suite was rattled and emotional.
The catalyst for the meeting was the troubled Iron Bridge magnetite mine. A joint venture between Fortescue and 
Taiwan's Formosa Steel, the mine is about 145 kilometres south of Port Hedland in the Pilbara. In early 2021, it was 
behind schedule and over budget. Forrest was furious.
Gaines and other executives, including former chief financial officer Ian Wells, were forced to apologise and take 
responsibility for the situation. Greg Lilleyman, a well-respected mining executive who was then chief operating 
officer, announced he was leaving the company. Project director Don Hyma and Iron Bridge project director Manie 
McDonald would also depart, the company confirmed later on February 16, and Gaines and Wells would forgo their 
bonuses.
"It was like a public shaming," says one person who was at the meeting. The executives were forced to make "a 
confession, saying they had betrayed the Fortescue values".
These values are clearly laid out on the company's website and referred to repeatedly by management. They 
include family, empowerment, frugality, enthusiasm and "stretch targets". Fortescue sets deliberately ambitious 
goals to ensure employees strive to do tasks faster and with fewer dollars.
But that cost-saving ambition has been put under a spotlight at Iron Bridge. The project has so far increased its 
expected capital expenditure at least five times and has suffered from persistent leaks in the pipelines that deliver 
water to the site and then slurry the ore product to Port Hedland. What's more, dust issues have put the company in 
regulators' sights.

Andrew Forrest's 'lesson in humility'
"It's been a lesson in humility," says Forrest, in an interview with The Australian Financial Review during a visit to 
the mine site. Labelling the project "the company's most difficult" mining venture, he lays the blame for the 
expensive leaks on pipeline contractors.
The company has previously said cost blowouts and delays at Iron Bridge were due to cultural problems and that 
negative news had not reached executives and directors fast enough. But interviews with at least a dozen 
Fortescue insiders reveal Iron Bridge was hamstrung from the start by tough cost-saving targets and because 
planners failed to anticipate the difficulties of piping large amounts of water in high-pressure pipelines across tough 
terrain.
Iron Bridge was much more than just another mine for Forrest. Unlike the more common hematite iron ore mines, it 
is a magnetite mine - which involves turning low-grade ore into a much higher 68 per cent grade ore through 
energy-intensive processing. Its success is key to transforming Fortescue from a low-cost, lower-quality iron ore 
operation to one of the largest iron ore producers in the world. It allows the company to take the fight more directly 
to rivals BHP and Rio Tinto, as mining companies bet air pollution-conscious countries such as China will favour 
higher-grade ore because it produces fewer fumes.
Central to the development of Iron Bridge was one of Forrest's oldest friends, former Fortescue executive Michael 
Masterman. The pair go way back. Masterman was finance director for Forrest's first disastrous business venture, 
Anaconda Nickel, before following him to Fortescue as one of the company's executives. They are also family 
friends; Forrest is the godfather to one of his children. But they have since fallen out. Masterman left Fortescue last 
year to set up a green metal company, Element Zero, triggering a messy legal dispute. Fortescue is now suing the 
firm and Masterman over alleged intellectual property theft.
But in 2013, Masterman was a senior executive at Fortescue and crucial to arranging the finance for Iron Bridge. 
That year, as he jetted between Shanghai and Perth, he organised for Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Group, one of the 
North Asian nation's biggest conglomerates, to invest $1.15 billion for a 31 per cent equity stake. Fortescue had 
already secured an investment from Baosteel, the world's largest steel producer, with the Chinese conglomerate 
throwing in a stake it already had in a magnetite mining lease. And so Fortescue set up FMG Iron Bridge, with the 
aim of developing the Glacier Valley and North Star deposits where the mine now sits.
It is a huge project. Alongside an airstrip, accommodation camp and an ore-processing facility which aims to churn 
out 22 million tonnes of concentrate a year, Iron Bridge also has hundreds of kilometres of pipeline. One, which 
runs for more than 200 km from borefields in the Canning Basin to the mine, has been the most susceptible to 
leaks. "That water pipeline failure, so that was a shock to the organisation," Forrest says. Another 135-km pipeline 
pumps magnetite slurry to Port Hedland and a third returns water to the mine.
"It was absolutely the contractor who gave us the guarantee this solution would work," Forrest says when asked 
who he blames for the pipeline issues. "But going after them is a puerile practice as they are too small. Sending 
people broke is not our speed." He later adds that the company was working with the contractor and manufacturer 
on the issue. The prime pipeline contractor on the project, MPC Kinetic, declined to comment.
The company said at the start of the year that it would need to set aside $US100 million to replace 65 kilometres of 
the pipeline that feeds raw water from the Canning Basin to the plant. But more recently, the on-site project team, 
led by operations director Graham Howard, has been able to sufficiently stem the leaks, and the company has put 
the more expensive fix on the back-burner.
If all goes well this year, Howard, a Fortescue veteran, is confident Iron Bridge will meet its target to produce 
between 5 million and 9 million tonnes of product by the end of the financial year. But that is still less than half the 
mine's ultimate target of 22 million tonnes a year.
It's been a journey. He jokes to the Financial Review on the same visit last week to Iron Bridge that the amount of 
hair on his balding head tells the tale.Page 3 of 4
Andrew Forrest's 'lesson in humility'
But as always with Forrest, there are even more demands. As the bus rolls into the mine site, Forrest asks why the 
plant's lights aren't sensor activated to save energy and instead stay on during the day. Executives have been 
under relentless pressure, with much of it related to cost control - Fortescue is renowned for its focus on costs. 
When Iron Bridge was first proposed, the company estimated capital expenditure would be $US2.6 billion.
On a site visit after the announcement, Forrest warned a crowd of workers including senior engineers that they may 
as well resign if they were not committed to building the mine within budget, people with direct knowledge of the 
event said.
Iron Bridge had been planned for some time and the company had conducted thorough cost estimates for smaller 
mines, including 11 million-tonne and 16 million-tonne versions, bringing in outside consultants and planners to put 
together the expected capex. But in the lead-up to the project getting the green light in 2019, the decision was 
made to expand it to a 22 million-tonne mine.
Instead of getting a new capex estimate, the company "factored" up those previous cost estimates, people with 
knowledge of the process said. Though it did take outside advice, it was not a calculation from scratch, which those 
with knowledge of mine planning said would have been more in line with the industry norm.
The only way the company's internal planners could get closer to the $US2.6 billion figure authorised by the board 
was by not including as much "contingency", an amount typically set aside by miners for additional, unforeseen 
costs, and by including a large cost-reduction target.
Forrest does not deny the project was subject to cost saving targets. "We deliver operations at the lowest cost in 
the world. And it's who we are. We don't pretend to be like others." But he rejects any notion that the company 
underplayed the costs. "We all thought we'd get change out of $US2.6 billion as we have in our other projects, so 
we didn't see this as different," he says.
"That's not how we roll. The board approves projects on exactly the information it has, and it got to $US3.2 billion 
well after it had been approved and it was being built. And that's when you have the come-to-judgment day," he 
says.
Fortescue's upward capex revisions may have cost the company investors. Chinese steel giant Baosteel, formerly 
a shareholder, quit the project in 2021, selling its stake in the holding company for the mine. Though the motivations 
behind the decision are unknown, the company has since participated in other Pilbara mining projects, including 
Mineral Resources' Onslow Iron project and Rio Tinto's new Western Range mine.
Sources say planners underestimated the price of laying the long pipelines needed by the mine, which cost 
hundreds of millions of dollars.
This pressure on costs filtered down to Fortescue's contractors, who were constantly forced to revise plans after 
the company demanded more savings.
In the end, the capital expenditure estimate was revised up five times. In August last year, more than two years 
after the infamous "red wedding" meeting, the company announced the mine's capex at $US4 billion, more than a 
third higher than the initial estimate. Jon Mills, an equity analyst at Morningstar who covers Fortescue, says rising 
inflation hasn't helped and could not have been anticipated.
Fortescue's tight focus on costs has attracted support and has been central to the company's success. "They are 
much leaner, much more focused on lower unit cost of iron ore than their rivals and that makes their business more 
sustainable," says one person intimate with the project's operations.
Delays in the ramp-up have been costly. On May 1 last year, Forrest declared that the mine had produced its first 
ore. But when the mine got going in August that year, it reported a $US726 million pre-tax impairment charge - 
effectively devaluing the mine - because of delays in the project's ramp-up.Page 4 of 4
Andrew Forrest's 'lesson in humility'
After the company announced its latest production report in September, it fielded questions about why it wasn't 
getting premium prices considering the higher grade of iron ore that the mine promised.
"At the moment, they aren't seeing as high a premium as they had hoped," says Morningstar's Mills.
In September, Fortescue Metals chief Dino Otranto blamed the lower prices on "low steel volumes, depressed 
margins" and a "slight oversupply" of the concentrate market in China.
"So long story short, capex has been higher," says Mills. "It's taken longer to ramp up, costs are going up as well for 
similar reasons. And then, you know, on the revenue side, they're not getting the premium they hoped for."
Cost blowouts have not been the only problem at Iron Bridge. In September, mine safety officers from WorkSafe 
WA issued four improvement notices and one prohibition notice "related to dust management".
Workers at the site said they were concerned about their exposure to silica dust, present in the ore mined at the 
site, which can lead to silicosis, a potentially terminal condition. Magnetite needs to be crushed into such fine 
particles, finer than talcum powder, that dust is inevitable. Other Pilbara sites have similar issues.
"People were coughing ... it gets under your mask and in your clothes," says one worker who was not authorised to 
speak publicly. Forrest wore a PAPR dust mask on his visit to the mine last week.
A rope chain separates the area where you are required to wear a dust mask and where you no longer need one, 
and the area was recently expanded. "There has always been a requirement to wear respiratory protective 
equipment in the mandated restricted areas of the dry plant, however in September the senior site executive 
increased the restricted area to include the entirety of the dry plant to ensure compliance," a company 
spokeswoman said.
Two workers told the Financial Review they were concerned some of the staff facilities and offices were too close to 
mine infrastructure, so dust filtered into mask-off areas.
"We categorically dispute this," the spokeswoman said. "Our PAPR and P2 requirements are adequate. Outside of 
the mandatory dry plant area, our sample analysis does not require protection."
One former executive says they decided to leave Fortescue not long after the "red cafe" meeting in 2021. "The 
culture had changed and it felt very deliberate," the person says.
But Forrest does not resile from his actions of that day. He had just returned from overseas, and after Gaines 
alerted him there was an issue he says they decided to change the management team and conduct an audit.
"Here at Fortescue, you get rewarded heavily on doing well, and not if you disappoint. And that was a really deep 
disappointment. They took the information they received and believed it, but below them there were issues, and 
unfortunately, like with me, others in leadership, the buck stops with you."

Postcard from WA After months of reporting, and only carefully worded replies from Fortescue, Primrose Riordan 
was invited to jet around with the iron ore billionaire.
Andrew Forrest hands me a pair of gloves. We're on a mining site in the Pilbara and he explains how the region's 
famous pindan dust seeps into your skin, staining it for days.
A week earlier, after months of reporting on Fortescue, I had sent a list of 50 questions to the company, some of 
them covering uncomfortable territory. These included claims about Forrest's at times aggressive leadership style, 
the company's troubled green hydrogen business and high executive turnover, and concerns about the board-led 
investigation into an alleged relationship with an employee that cleared Forrest of wrongdoing.
At first, the company sent some written responses, but two weeks ago, the call comes. Forrest, returning from 
Shanghai, will handle this himself. Head on. I am summoned to the Pilbara for an interview.
Straight off the plane at Port Hedland last Thursday, and it's straight into hard hats and fluoro. We're directed to a 
ladder leading to a platform that feeds iron ore onto waiting ships. Soon after I put the gloves on, I realise no one 
else is wearing them.
"They're Sydney gloves." Forrest laughs, and the gathered workers join in. We're on his turf.
But there's no time to linger. We're off to speak to "the troops," one of many staff gatherings that Forrest addresses 
with a loosely prepared stump speech. What executive turnover? These staff have been here for years. They love 
it. "Can't you just feel it?"
He motions to his team. "You can talk to anyone. Which other company would do Out on a tour of another site, the 
narrative arcs and the lessons in overcoming adversity are ever-present as I scribble away on bumpy bus rides. 
Forrest reminds us of how BHP tried to stop Fortescue from getting its product to port, pointing out the window to 
infrastructure built by Fortescue workers to get around the blockages.

"I just say gently - it's your article not mine ... I'd be grateful if you could just balance it," Forrest says later. "I mean 
[you] might be assassinating Andrew. He's fair game. But can we at least mention what a fantastic team the other 
twenty-odd-thousand people are?"
Forrest has done many interviews in his three decades in business. He bats off questions: "I just hope you're 
enjoying it, the interview. Oh, please enjoy it. You've come a long way to not have a good time!"
We're on his private jet drifting above Iron Bridge, the company's most difficult mining project. It has been racked by 
delays, cost blowouts and technical challenges. More recently, the company narrowly avoided spending hundreds 
of millions of dollars replacing more than 60 kilometres of leaking water pipelines essential for slurrying the product 
to port.
Unlike the rich maroon of hematite, this magnetite mine is grey, and a much smaller particle, tinier than talcum 
powder. On the ground, it bathes the site monochrome; above, it drifts in unsettling wafts of dust. The company, 
which now insists that things are under control, has recently been rapped on the knuckles by mine inspectors for 
unsafe air quality levels, considering the high silica concentration. Walking through in post-40-degree heat and 
masked up, it's like a dystopian film.
But it's nothing like that, according to Forrest. It's the most successful magnetite project in the region. They're 
shooting the lights out. (Fortescue's also the best-performing company ever on the Australian stock exchange; it's 
probably the most efficient construction company in mining in the world; no company creates bigger crushers; their 
rail cars stack more ore than anyone else; they're going to make green iron metal faster than anyone else; they 
have the best battery technology in the world.)
Fortescue is one of Australia's standout corporate success stories and its rising share price over the years has 
made Forrest and many others rich, but it's a lot of superlatives to take in.
There's a reason he's described as evangelical. He's a long talker and on message. He remembers your name and 
repeats himself often and on purpose. He conducts crowds and urges them to come close. "I need your eyes."
Everyone's his brother, his sister. People are approaching him for selfies. He's embracing people. "Come in for a 
cuddle!" (One flinches as he approaches - "Don't worry I'm not gay!") There's laughter, he has the crowd but it's his 
entourage's turn to flinch.
Forrest travels with a team of former senior political staffers, who also advise him on policy, manage his diary and 
interrupt him to draft email replies to staff on the fly.
People don't need to come to him with problems that often, he says, as they have already solved things 
themselves. At another site, a worker asks how their new Liebherr trucks will handle the wet weather. Forrest 
doesn't dwell. "I'm sure you and the team are going to figure it out."
Beep beep. Beep beep. Forrest's two phones are a constant soundtrack. "Blue phone, Signal!" "Red phone, 
WhatsApp!" The blue one is looking a bit tattered, the other is wrapped in a red flip wallet case.
He doesn't mind. He complains that overseas hotels are too good at laundry, dislodging the Pilbara's dust from 
clothing, and making him look like an interloper on mine trips. There are spells of self-depreciation. "Do your job, 
Forrest, you little prince, get over it," he says. He doesn't like to give speeches on a stage as it makes him feel like 
"a wanker". There's another 15-minute plane trip, during which we try to hold on to bowls of bone broth we've been 
served for lunch, but they are swishing around.
At Christmas Creek, Forrest is asked whether countries will just want to process his iron ore into "green iron metal" 
themselves. After pulling back from his 2030 green hydrogen target earlier this year, he has switched his focus to 
green iron (a precursor to steel made with renewables or hydrogen) and is aiming to eventually make 100 million 
tonnes a year. Later, he admits, some governments are keen to do that themselves, which would cut him out of the 
market. "I'm not talking about China!"Page 3 of 3
A Tour of The Pilbara with Andrew Forrest
"That's not the steel mills, that's the politicians. The steel mills say make it where it's most efficient," he says. 
Somewhere close to vast amounts of sunshine and wind, like his mines.
Lessons follow in Chinese environment policy, carbon emissions and industrial strategy. Forrest gets on his knees 
to draw another chart in the dust, but it's hard to concentrate. A rail car is making a deafening sound as it gets filled 
with iron ore.
There's some static on the microphone during one of his worker stump speeches. "That was just the Chinese 
authorities," he jokes. The room chortles. "Checking I'm saying the same thing here as in Beijing."
For me, it's all over as I walk behind workers to the plane. Stretched across a calf muscle in front is a bulldog with a 
machine gun in its mouth.
Forrest has more site visits. He ends the day in the pit at his Solomon mine. And, no doubt, the team there are 
shooting the lights out. P

Fortescue says it will be producing green iron from a pilot plant in Western Australia before its bigger rivals BHP 
and Rio Tinto have even worked out whether to push ahead with their own version in partnership with BlueScope 
Steel and Woodside.
The Andrew Forrest-led Fortescue took a swipe at the timetable and energy supply plans put forward by the four 
companies after their NeoSmelt project received a $75m leg-up from the WA government.
The NeoSmelt partners expect to a make a final investment call in 2026. They have flagged spending several 
hundred million dollars building a pilot plant capable of producing 40,000 tonnes of molten iron year at a site next 
door to BHP's mothballed nickel refinery at Kwinana, south of Perth.
Fortescue metals chief executive Dino Otranto said establishing a green iron industry in Australia could create 
thousands of jobs and secure a place for WA iron ore in global supply chains for decades to come.
"Getting this new industry off the ground will require wisely invested public and private sector funds," Mr Otranto 
said.
"Australia has a strong history of public investment to create the industries that have kept our economy strong over 
the decades, such as the significant investment by government to kickstart the oil and gas industry in the 70s," Mr 
Otranto said.
"The whole of industry is calling for bold policy to establish a new green iron industry." Mr Otranto said Fortescue 
was more advanced in its plans to produce green iron than BHP and Rio and, unlike the Neo-Smelt partners, would 
not be -relying on gas as a fuel source.
"This week's announcement by the WA government to invest $75m in the NeoSmelt project clearly shows that 
government shares our view of the importance of establishing this new green industry," he said.
"While a final investment decision on the NeoSmelt project is anticipated in 2026, Fortescue will already be 
producing high-purity green iron from our pilot plant at Christmas Creek, using green hydrogen.
Page 2 of 2
Fortescue claims green iron lead over Rio, BHP
"This process differs to the NeoSmelt project, which is expected to initially use gas, and ultimately transition to low-
emissions hydrogen, rather than hydrogen produced using renewable energy." The NeoSmelt project is slated to be 
in production some time in 2028 if all goes to plan for Rio, BHP, BlueScope and Woodside at the Kwinana site and 
with so far unproven technology.
Fortescue is also relying on technology breakthroughs as it contemplates building a commercial scale green iron 
plant in the Pilbara. It has revealed plans for a 1-2 million tonne a year plant, but is exploring opportunities for an 
even bigger plant likely to involve a multibillion-dollar investment.
It is set to begin pre-feasibility studies on the commercial-scale plant early next year.
Fortescue is relying on federal and WA government support to launch the technology-dependent industry.
Dr Forrest has said Fortescue wants help in the form of approvals and infrastructure.
BHP WA iron ore asset president Tim Day said more partners could join the NeoSmelt project over time, and 
defended the decision to use gas supplied by Woodside as a fuel source on the road to reducing carbon emission 
in steelmaking.
"You have to start this with something. For us, a gas supply is required. You need that energy initially and then what 
will happen over time is we'll get to more green energy," he said.
Mr Day said BHP agreed with Rio that technology breakthroughs would be required to advance to commercial scale 
production and that the likely time frame was five to 10 years.
The NeoSmelt pilot plant is intended to test production of iron from an electric smelting furnace (ESF), a type of 
furnace being developed by steel producers and technology companies seeking to lower emissions.
Iron ore is first converted to direct reduced iron (DRI) before being charged into the ESF.
A lot is riding on the technology and a combination of DRI-ESF working effectively for BHP, Rio and Fortescue. 
BlueScope this week said the low and medium grade iron ore produced in the Pilbara did not work well in the DRI 
process gaining favour as a way to cut emissions.
The NeoSmelt partners hope reductions of up to 80 per cent in emission intensity can be achieved in processing 
Pilbara iron ore through a DRI-ESF combination. Other lower emission--intensity production options emerging as 
alternatives to blast furnaces, such as electric arc furnaces, require scrap steel and DRI produced from high grade 
iron ore. Fortescue shares closed up 2 per cent on Friday, at $18.20.

Fortescue has moved to allay fears its iron ore project in Gabon is in trouble despite appearing to have made little 
progress since celebrating a first shipment from the African nation more than a year ago.
Hailed as a project that would "open growth opportunities" for Andrew Forrest-led Fortescue throughout Africa, 
sources close to the project suggest the mine has a strained relationship with Gabon's military rulers and stood 
down contractors and slowed exploration activity in the lead-up to Christmas.
Fortescue said in response that there would be fluctuations in job numbers as it looked to advance the project in 
Gabon, where General Brice Oligui Nguema seized power in August 2023.
General Nguema led a coup against then president Ali Bongo Ondimba, whose family had ruled for 55 years and 
shown a willingness to work with Fortescue.
"Fortescue remains fully committed to the Belinga iron ore project and the long-term benefits a large-scale 
development will bring to Gabon," Fortescue said.
"Our discussions with the Gabon government remain positive and we continue to work together to advance a 
potential large-scale development.
"The project is still in an early stage of development, with an immediate focus on exploration and studies. As a 
result, in the short term there will be an ebb and flow in job numbers as we move through various stages, finish our 
initial main camp construction, and allow time for studies to be completed.
"We remain focused on prioritising the employment of a local workforce and will explore ways to upskill and 
redeploy staff to other areas of the business where possible.
"In line with Fortescue's commitment to create a positive impact in the areas in which we operate, we will continue 
to engage with, and support, local communities." Fortescue did not respond to questions about whether exploration 
work had come to halt, or how many employees it had on the ground in Gabon.

More than 600 Gabonese, including contractors, have been employed on the project at various times, including 200 
from local villages. Fortescue had also purchased more than $US30m ($48m) in goods and services from 
businesses in Gabon.
Fortescue owns a 72 per cent stake in Ivindo Iron, the entity that operates the Belinga project. The remainder of 
Ivindo is held by Abu Dhabi's Africa Transformation and Industrialisation Fund and the Gabon government.
Perth-headquartered Fortescue earmarked $US200m for early-stage mining development at Belinga in 2023-24.
It has not provided guidance on capital expenditure at Belinga in 2024-25 after shifting focus to exploration and 
study work.
Fortescue has flagged expenditure of $US300m-$US400m across the group on various exploration projects and 
studies in 2024-25, with any spending on Belinga likely to come from this pool.
Julie Shuttleworth, one of Dr Forrest's most trusted lieutenants at Fortescue for more than a decade, was running 
the project before she left the company in June 2024.
In an update provided at the end of September, Fortescue said exploration work continued and to that point more 
than 70,000 metres of reverse circulation drilling and 10,000 metres of diamond core drilling had been completed.
Sources said Fortescue was finding the going tougher in Gabon under military rule after making rapid progress 
with Belinga under the former president.
The December 2023 shipment came just 10 months after Fortescue signed a mining convention with the then 
Gabonese government.
The immaterial volume of iron ore on board was sourced from a small operation at Belinga, a potential high-grade 
deposit in Gabon's northeast that has been subject to extensive studies and was once on BHP's radar.
Fortescue metals division chief executive Dino Otranto hailed the shipment as a remarkable achievement at the 
time.
"This project has the potential to revolutionise our portfolio and ultimately create a product that will be the envy of 
our peers," he said. "It will also open growth opportunities for Fortescue throughout Africa." Gabon handed an 
operating permit covering Belinga to the China Machinery Engineering Corporation as far back as 2006, but 
suspended the permit after a falling-out between the parties.

Top lawyers and high-profile identities are set to face off Regulators have come out swinging against alleged 
corporate wrongdoing this year, launching a range of hard-hitting civil and criminal lawsuits against some of the 
nation's biggest companies and individuals.
But Australian Securities & Investments Commission's deputy chair Sarah Court and Australian Competition & 
Consumer Commission chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb aren't the only ones firing off blockbuster court cases.
Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has accused ex-executives of stealing its green steel intellectual property, and 
billionaire Heloise Pratt has accused her billionaire former husband Alex Waislitz of "criminality", which he denies.
Here are some of the biggest court cases in business set to play out in 2025. ASIC v Star directors Former Star 
Entertainment directors are being sued over allegations they failed to stop money-laundering risks and criminal links 
creeping into its operation will face a trial from February 10.
ASIC first launched the civil case in the Federal Court against former CEO Matthias Bekier and ex-chairman John 
O'Neill among other board members in December 2022. It is set to run for about six weeks.
Barrister James Arnott, SC, a silk who regularly advises and -appears in relation to regulatory investigations, 
according to his Sixth Floor Selborne Wentworth Chambers profile, represented ASIC for the past few court dates in 
the matter.
Chinese high-roller junket operator Suncity allegedly pumped billions of dollars into Star casinos, with Star's 
turnover from Suncity reportedly worth $2.1bn, $4bn and $5.9bn for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 financial years.
ASIC has alleged the board continued to allow the junket operator to expand its operations instead of scrutinising its 
potential organised crime links and money laundering risks.
In 2022, a royal commission-style inquiry into Star revealed the casino operator stopped short of issuing Suncity, 
which was owned by Alvin Chau, a third warning letter after it was busted operating a "pseudo cage" where bundles 
of cash from black backpacks were exchanged for casino chips, breaching anti-money-laundering rules.

Legal stoushes set to keep courts busy
Instead, Star allegedly renewed its agreement with the junket operator in 2018. It was claimed that senior Star 
investigator Andrew McGregor wrote to management in May 2018 to alert it that "we have an entity within our four 
walls, which is totally non compliant to reasonable requests for basic -information. I'm going to call it out early. 
Suncity is operating a business model under our noses, which is problematic for Star -Entertainment Group with 
regard to AML CTF (anti-money laundering, counter terrorism financing) laws." Other board members Kathleen 
Lahey, Richard Sheppard, Gerard Bradley, Sally Pitkin, Benjamin Heap, Zlatko Todorcevski, Paula Martin and Greg 
Hawkins have been named in the lawsuit, which will be presided over by Federal Court judge Michael Lee.
All 11 former executives have denied the allegations against them in defence papers. Star Entertainment is not 
named as a party to the proceedings.
Fortescue's Andrew Forrest v Element Zero Mining giant Fortescue managed to keep an explosive lawsuit it 
lodged against some of its ex-senior executives secret for a while.
But in June, a judgment was quietly published that revealed the Andrew Forrest-led company obtained court orders 
to launch raids on the homes and offices that targeted former Fortescue chief scientist Bart Kolodziejczyk, long-
term Forrest lieutenant Michael Masterman and former Fortescue staff member Bjorn Winther-Jensen.
After the Federal Court initially granted Fortescue a suppression order, which kept the proceedings secret from late 
April to early June, it was revealed that Fortescue - a $57bn listed company - accused Element Zero of "industrial-
scale misuse" of confidential information concerning its green (carbon dioxide-free) iron technology.
Element Zero denied the allegations, calling them "spurious". The dispute turned ugly after it was revealed 
Fortescue paid a private investigator, Robert Lancaster, who spied on the wives and children of the former 
Fortescue staff including by following them to Kmart, taking pictures of them leaving school and rummaging 
through their mail.
It is necessary to ensure the parties are aware if there are "vulnerable" people at the properties to be searched, 
such as children, but the Element Zero parties argued the level of surveillance they were subjected to was 
excessive.
The case continues, after -Element Zero failed to appeal against a decision that granted the search orders. It will file 
another appeal to overturn that decision, while Fortescue has applied to change its statement of claim against it.
Element Zero has previously briefed Sydney-based barrister David Studdy, SC, while Fortescue has previously 
briefed Sydney-based Julian Cooke, SC.
Retailers defend 'fake' discount allegations The country's biggest grocery outlets, Coles and Woolworths, are 
denying claims that they mislead consumers by promoting "illusory discounts" on hundreds of common supermarket 
products.
The ACCC's separate proceedings in the Federal Court alleged a breach of Australian Consumer Law by 
"misleading consumers through discount pricing claims" on the products.
ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gott-lieb said in late September that -social media sleuths who were tracking prices online 
tipped off the regulator, which claimed products such as tampons and fly spray were sold at regular long-term 
prices, before they were subject to an increase of at least 15 per cent for a brief period and then "discounted".
When the products were placed in Woolworths' Prices Dropped promotion and Coles's Down Down promotion, the 
ACCC alleged the prices were lower than during the price spike but higher than or the same as the regular price 
that applied before the spike.
Both supermarkets have denied the allegations, and in defence papers said surging supplier commodity prices and 
other cost increases led them to pump up the value of household goods.Page 3 of 4
Legal stoushes set to keep courts busy
The filing of defence papers is likely to mean a drawn-out court fight, unless the parties settle, as both supermarkets 
appear intent on fighting the allegations.
Trial dates have not been set, but Coles, Woolworths and the ACCC could go head to head in the second half of 
next year.
Pratt family in two fights The billionaire Pratt family is now embroiled in two court fights aimed at protecting its 
wealth.
The latest legal saga was launched by one of the Pratt siblings, Heloise, after she accused former husband and 
billionaire investor Alex Waislitz of criminality and acting "dishonestly" by paying himself and his charitable 
foundation $1.147m without her knowledge and approval.
Mr Waislitz responded on Christmas Eve, denying the allegations against him and claiming his former wife failed to 
involve herself in the affairs of their family business.
Ms Pratt and siblings Anthony Pratt and Fiona Geminder are children of the late Richard Pratt and own the Visy 
cardboard box-making and recycling empire.
The court case appears to centre on control of the $1.3bn stock investment empire run by Mr Waislitz but also 
owned by Ms Pratt for more than three decades.
"It appears to be a highly provocative and unbecoming action in response to failed negotiations which had up until 
now been kept private," Mr Waislitz has previously said in response to news about the court case.
Mr Waislitz has briefed Sydney-based barrister Jeremy Stoljar, KC, and Melbourne-based Kane Loxley.
The latest legal saga to ensnare the family came after the late Pratt's love child, Paula Hitchcock, secured a partial 
win in her bid to claim an equitable slice of the family trust in October.
The NSW Supreme Court ruled Ms Hitchcock would be -allowed to argue she is legally -entitled to a slice of the 
family fortune because she is a child not only of the late billionaire but his wife Jeanne.
Sydney-based barrister Christopher Withers, SC, has appeared for Ms Hitchcock in past hearings. Appearing for 
the Pratt family trustee has been Melbourne-based barrister Allan Myers, KC.
The matter has dragged on since 2022, and could continue in 2025 after Ms Hitchcock asked the court to update 
her pleadings again.
Both cases are set to play out in the new year.
ASIC v Cbus After ASIC sued $92bn super fund Cbus over allegations it delayed insurance payments to vulnerable 
families with a bang in November, the matter could slow down in 2025.
ASIC claimed Cbus took more than a year in some cases for the fund - which is chaired by Labor national president 
Wayne Swan - to pay out death and disabilities payments. It prompted the regulator to warn that it would crack 
down on the $4 trillion sector over failures to track end-to-end death benefit claims handling times and "weak" -
practices.
According to the latest court updates, Cbus will not be required to file a defence to the allegations until May 16, after 
ASIC lodges a full statement of claim.
The case is then listed for -mediation on June 23.
Alleged insider trading ASIC has at least two insider trading criminal court cases on foot, including one it lodged 
against Melbourne man Duncan Stewart and another against Perth man Vittorio Letizia.Page 4 of 4
Legal stoushes set to keep courts busy
Mr Stewart is set to face a trial in Melbourne's County Court, after ASIC alleged in a committal hearing at the 
Magistrate's Court that he passed on inside information about possible takeover bids of Kidman Resources by 
Chilean major SQM and separately Wesfarmers in 2019.
ASIC alleged Mr Stewart received information from his brother-in-law and Kidman Resources boss Martin Donohue 
about the possible bids in 2019, which he used to buy shares in the company and urged his brother Ashley to do 
the same. Mr Stewart has denied the allegations.
Mr Stewart's legal team have briefed Melbourne-based barrister Ruth Shann, SC in the matter.
Separately, the regulator revealed Mr Letizia faced Perth Magistrates Court after he was charged with five counts of 
insider trading over purchases in mid-tier miner Genesis Minerals dating back to 2021. ASIC lost an insider trading 
case lodged against ex-Vocus chair Vaughan Bowen in December. Mr Bowen was found not-guilty by a jury.

Business giants Star, Fortescue, Coles, Woolworths and the Pratt family all head to court this year facing 
expensive legal fights Australia's regulators have come out swinging against alleged corporate wrongdoing this 
year, launching a range of hard-hitting civil and criminal lawsuits against some of the country's biggest companies 
and individuals.
Here are some of the biggest court cases in business set to play out in 2025.
FORMER STAR CASINO DIRECTORS FACE TRIAL Former Star Entertainment directors being sued over

News feature The next time a big miner such as BHP, Rio Tinto or Fortescue lobs a takeover bid for a small 
explorer, the target will probably be one of the companies on this list, writes Peter Ker.
When BHP launched a $3.2 billion takeover bid for copper explorer Filo Corporation in July, it was a reminder that 
mergers and acquisitions don't always involve the element of surprise.
Just as South32 had done with Toronto-listed junior Arizona Mining in 2018, BHP had conspicuously sat on Filo's 
share register for more than two years before it pulled the trigger, and the smart money was always expecting the 
Australian company to launch a takeover bid for Filo's Argentinian asset.
When the BHP bid finally came on July 30, Filo shares surged more than 10 per cent, suggesting there was still 
upside for speculators who bet in line with market expectations. Filo shares finished 2024 a solid 41 per cent higher 
than they started the year.
So who's next? Here's a list of junior explorers that have a big miner such as Fortescue, BHP, Rio Tinto or South32 
lurking on their register.
Sovereign Metals
Big suitor: Rio Tinto
Commodities: Rutile, graphite
Country: Malawi
There's an intriguing time limit buried in the commercial arrangement between Sovereign Metals and Rio Tinto 
which could tempt the big miner to move sooner rather than later on the rutile and graphite aspirant.
Page 2 of 9
Where mining giants are ready to pounce
Rio and Sovereign signed an investment agreement in July 2023 which outlined the terms under which they would 
jointly progress the Kasiya deposit that Sovereign found in Malawi. Rio has spent about $60 million so far 
accumulating a 19.9 per cent stake in Sovereign.
One of the clauses provides Rio with a host of exclusivity benefits for a period that expires 180 days after Sovereign 
publishes a definitive feasibility study (DFS) into the construction of a mine at Kasiya.
Those benefits include anti-dilution rights if Sovereign launches a share issuance and matching rights if Sovereign 
tried to sell the asset. Sovereign is due to publish a DFS by October, which means Rio has the inside running on a 
takeover offer until about March or April 2026.
Beyond that time, the exclusivity benefits lapse and Sovereign can sell a stake in the project to help fund itself.
At stake is a rare piece of geology that can support production of rutile without having to go through the carbon- and 
energy-intensive process of extracting it from ilmenite sands.
Rutile contains titanium dioxide, which goes into consumer products such as paint and toothpaste, as well as high-
end steel production. Rio is already one of the world's biggest producers of titanium dioxide from South Africa and 
Madagascar. But Kasiya presents a way of making titanium dioxide with a much lower carbon footprint.
Kasiya will also produce graphite as a byproduct. While weak graphite prices are hurting incumbent producers such 
as Syrah Resources, the graphite made at Kasiya will effectively be a bonus - most of the production costs will be 
covered by the rutile production.
Rio wants exposure to battery minerals such as graphite, and ownership of Kasiya will get it closer to that goal.
Alta Copper
Big suitor: Fortescue
Commodities: Copper and gold
Country: Peru
Fortescue flexed its muscle at the Alta Copper annual meeting in June, voting four of the seven directors off the 
board in a bid to "accelerate" development of the company's Canariaco copper and gold project in Peru.
Alta's founder and former chief executive Joanne Freeze was among those removed and the new board has 
already approved a placement of shares to Fortescue, suggesting the Perth company holds significant sway.
But Fortescue will need to influence the hearts and minds of local communities in Peru if it is to make a success of 
its investment.
Alta's most recent study suggests the Canariaco mine would cost $US2.2 billion ($3.5 billion) to build. It would 
produce an average of 134,000 tonnes of copper per year over its 27-year life.
"All in" costs would be below $US2 per pound of copper, and if the copper price averages $US4 per pound, the 
mine would pay for itself in just over three years.
Despite those robust economics and an obvious suitor such as Fortescue on the register, Alta's market 
capitalisation remains small at just $C37 million ($41.4 million).
That's because many investors believe Alta will struggle to win support from local communities who fear Canariaco 
will damage local forests, watersheds and farmlands. About 400 people blockaded the road into Canariaco 12 years 
ago and the deposit has not been drilled since 2013.Page 3 of 9
Where mining giants are ready to pounce
Alta told investors in October that dialogue with the community was "frequent and continuous, which was not the 
case during the period 2016 to 2022".
If Fortescue and its talismanic leader Andrew Forrest can convince those Peruvian communities to host a copper 
mine, the Perth company might be on to a bargain.
Lifezone Metals
Big suitor: BHP
Commodities: Nickel, cobalt, copper
Country: Tanzania
It would be a bold call for BHP to launch a nickel acquisition barely a year after mothballing its nickel mines in 
Western Australia, but that's the dilemma that could come within months when New York-listed Lifezone Metals is 
due to deliver the contractual trigger that permits BHP to take majority control of Tanzania's Kabanga nickel project.
Kabanga has been on BHP's radar for more than 30 years. The Australian company drilled the high-grade nickel 
sulphide deposit between 1991 and 1995 before deciding to walk away.
It took until December 2021 for BHP to return to a project that is built on a new low-carbon method of processing 
nickel ores.
BHP owns 1.5 per cent of Lifezone's New York-listed shares, but the Australian giant's exposure to Kabanga is 
much bigger at project level.
The asset is owed by a Tanzanian group of companies called Tembo, which is 16 per cent owned by the host 
nation and 84 per cent owned by a privately held British company called Kabanga Nickel (KNL).
BHP owns 17.8 per cent of KNL, with Lifezone owning the rest.
BHP has a deal with Lifezone that, under certain circumstances, would allow BHP to grow its shareholding in KNL 
to about 61 per cent, thereby giving the Australian giant a 51 per cent ownership of Tembo and the Kabanga mine.
The trigger for BHP to take that step to majority control is the delivery by Lifezone of a DFS into the mine and an 
agreed financial model for development.
Lifezone promised to deliver that study in the "second half of 2024" but failed to do so. Delivery is expected soon. 
Lifezone continues to garner support for the project from governments in Japan and the United States, who are 
keen to ensure some of Africa's critical minerals are developed by non-Chinese companies.
At a time when Indonesian miners are flooding nickel markets and BHP is preoccupied with its pursuit of Anglo 
American, it would not be a surprise to see BHP walk away. Watch this space.
Aldebaran Resources
Big suitors: South32, Rio Tinto
Commodities: Copper, gold, silver
Country: Argentina
Could Argentina's Altar copper project be the scene of the first bidding war between 10-year-old South32 and 151-
year-old Rio Tinto?
Rio has a special connection to the project, having discovered Altar's big copper resource between 1995 and 2004. 
But it walked away in 2005 in the belief the copper grades weren't good enough.Page 4 of 9
Where mining giants are ready to pounce
By 2019 the Toronto-listed explorer Aldebaran Resources had stepped into the void, agreeing to gradually buy 80 
per cent of Altar from its former owner Sibanye-Stillwater.
Australia's connection to the asset was revived in 2022 when South32 spent $C11 million buying 9.9 per cent of 
Aldebaran's shares. South32 raised its stake to 14.8 per cent in 2023 with a further $C9 million.
Since then, the pathway for South32 to acquire majority control of Aldebaran has looked achievable; 44 per cent of 
Aldebaran shares are held by San Francisco hedge fund Route One Investment Company.
A further 14.4 per cent are held by Sibanye, which is struggling under big debts and weak earnings at its flagship 
African platinum mines.
Cash-strapped Sibanye would presumably welcome an offer for its Aldebaran shares.
But just when it looked like South32 was in pole position, Rio signalled in November that it still holds a candle for 
the Altar copper mine.
Rio offered to pay Aldebaran $US250 million for a 20 per cent stake in the Altar project - as opposed to buying 
Aldebaran shares.
Rio's money would be provided in increments over two years and Rio has already agreed to pay two increments 
totalling $US30 million.
The Rio deal effectively values the Altar project at $US1.25 billion.
Where does this leave South32? Well, shares in Aldebaran have more than doubled over the past four months, so 
it's not all bad for the Perth company.
South32 is also well aware that Rio is investing in neighbouring copper projects, meaning Aldebaran and Altar 
might be just the start of a broader province play.
McEwen Copper
Big suitor: Rio Tinto
Commodity: Copper
Country: Argentina
The closest copper discovery to Aldebaran's Altar copper project is about 40 kilometres north at Los Azules.
Los Azules is owned by private unlisted company McEwen Copper, which counts Rio Tinto as a 14.2 per cent 
shareholder and Melbourne's Victor Smorgon Group as a 3.2 per cent shareholder.
It is no coincidence that the Rio subsidiary that holds the stake in McEwen also struck the deal with Aldebaran in 
November.
The subsidiary, called Nuton, holds intellectual property specialising in the extraction of copper from mineralisation 
that is relatively low grade. While Nuton will likely want to study the rocks at Los Azules and Altar before Rio does 
anything big, it's hard to resist the conclusion that Rio is building a province play in this part of the Andes.
Magmatic Resources
Big suitor: Fortescue
Commodities: Copper, gold
Country: AustraliaPage 5 of 9
Where mining giants are ready to pounce
A funny thing seems to happen to small companies once Fortescue gets on their share register: the resolutions at 
annual shareholder meetings become far more contested.
So it was for NSW copper explorer Magmatic Resources, which suffered a first strike against its remuneration 
report in November. Almost 36 per cent of votes were cast against the report, up from less than 1 per cent in 2023.
Some Magmatic directors saw opposition to their candidacy rise from less than 1 per cent last year to almost 27 per 
cent in November.
What changed in the intervening 12 months to swing sentiment? We can't be sure, but one thing that did change 
was 19.9 per cent of Magmatic shares falling into the hands of Fortescue in March 2024.
If more than 25 per cent of votes are cast against the remuneration report in November, Magmatic will be forced to 
hold a resolution over a boardroom spill. As discussed in the case of Alta Copper, Fortescue is not shy about 
throwing its weight around in boardrooms of its target companies.
Although in the case of Magmatic, it's not clear that Fortescue needs to play hardball. By simply spending $14 
million on exploration drilling over six years, Fortescue will eventually take 75 per cent ownership of Magmatic's 
Myall exploration project near Narromine in NSW.
Maybe Fortescue chairman Andrew Forrest doesn't want to wait.
Brixton Metals
Big Suitor: BHP
Commodities: Copper, gold
Country: Canada
The world's biggest miner does plenty of exploration partnerships with small companies, but it's not often BHP buys 
listed shares in a small explorer.
Brixton Metals was an exception in November 2022 when BHP paid $C13.6 million for 19.9 per cent of its shares.
The excitement around that transaction took Brixton shares as high as C30¢, but the stock has slipped back to C6¢ 
as the long process of drilling and appraisal has got under way.
BHP's main interest is Brixton's huge land parcel of almost 3000 square kilometres in British Columbia. The land 
parcel is north of the "golden triangle" copper and gold province, which Newmont was keen to consolidate when it 
acquired Newcrest in 2023.
Brixton's latest batch of drilling results from its flagship Thorn project didn't set the world on fire, but it is still early 
days.
BHP's purchase of Brixton shares in 2022 was done at C18¢, well above the C6¢ the stock was fetching this week. 
That means BHP can dramatically lower its average entry price should it choose to double down on Brixton in 2025.
American Eagle Gold
Big suitors: South32, Teck
Commodities: Copper, gold
Country: Canada
South32 joined BHP in British Columbia in November when it paid $32.7 million for a 19.9 per cent stake in 
American Eagle Gold.Page 6 of 9
Where mining giants are ready to pounce
The deal allows South32 to leapfrog Teck Resources, which was sitting on more than 15 per cent of American 
Eagle's shares.
The two big miners are focused on the NAK exploration project in the province, which has delivered impressive hits 
of copper, gold and molybdenum. It's early days, but with two big miners on your register, things can happen fast.
Liontown Resources
Big suitor: Hancock Prospecting
Commodity: Lithium
Country: Australia
If Gina Rinehart liked the look of Liontown shares at $3 a pop barely 15 months ago, then surely she can see merit 
in paying the market price of 52¢ a share now.
Hancock has bided its time while Liontown has valiantly brought Kathleen Valley into production amid very weak 
lithium prices.
Despite the good work of the Liontown team, if prices for spodumene concentrate stay at current levels, the 
company could be broke within a year.
Perhaps Mrs Rinehart thinks she can wait and buy the company cheaper off the liquidators? But that's a risky 
strategy; lenders such as Ford have security over Liontown's Kathleen Valley mine in the event of default, and 
lithium prices have a habit of turning hard and fast when the boom times return.
What Liontown needs is a patient owner who can absorb the near-term pain and take a long-term view of 
development at Kathleen Valley to ensure it is built right to vomit cash when the next lithium boom comes.
In Mrs Rinehart, Liontown has found the perfect owner; just as she did with Atlas Iron, she can wait for the cycle to 
turn and harvest profits.
So what exactly is Australia's richest person waiting for?
Western Copper and Gold
Big suitor: Rio Tinto
Commodities: Copper, gold
Country: Canada
Rio collected a bunch of rights as it was building its 9.7 per cent stake in Western Copper and Gold over five 
transactions in the past four years.
Some of those rights ensure Rio can't be diluted in share issuances, while others give Rio the right to have 
observers sit in on the company's board meetings and technical committee meetings.
But those rights will expire in May 2025, meaning the dual-listed miner has some degree of incentive to move fast if 
it wants to own the Casino copper and gold project that Western has found near the border of Alaska and the 
Canadian Yukon territory.
Casino would cost more than $4 billion to build; a near-impossible task for an explorer with a market capitalisation 
of $337 million.
Rio is not the only cashed-up global player sitting on Western's register; Japanese firm Mitsubishi owns 4.1 per cent 
of the explorer and has similar rights, which will expire in March.Page 7 of 9
Where mining giants are ready to pounce
Rio has spent about $44 million buying shares in the explorer and no one will be surprised if it buys more in 2025.
Trilogy Metals
Big suitor: South32
Commodities: Zinc, copper
Country: USA
One interpretation of the 230 per cent rise in Trilogy Metals shares since Donald Trump won November's US 
presidential election is that South32 missed a chance to acquire the explorer while it was cheap.
South32 owned 11.6 per cent of Trilogy shares and 50 per cent of its flagship Ambler exploration project in Alaska 
during Joe Biden's presidency, meaning the Perth company was close to the action as Biden's blocking of a road to 
the Ambler site triggered a collapse in Trilogy's share price.
A more philosophical way of looking at Trilogy's Trump bump is to say that South32 is historically willing to pay 
more for something that it has greater certainty about.
That was true for Arizona Mining, the copper explorer South32 acquired over two years between 2017 and 2018, 
with little concern about whether it was telegraphing its intentions to the market too clearly.
In the case of Trilogy, South32 wants to see more progress made in Alaska before it considers stepping up its 
investment. It will want to see all the region's First Nations groups express their support for the project.
It will want to see political change in the White House manifest in more permitting access to the Ambler region.
South32 will also want to see further drilling to better understand the geology.
The Trump bump has taken Trilogy's market value to about $300 million - almost three times higher than a year ago 
- but still small enough that South32 can afford to wait for all the Alaskan ducks to be in a row.
Entree Resources
Big suitor: Rio Tinto
Commodities: Copper, gold
Country: Mongolia
Some type of deal will happen between Entree and Rio, the only question is whether Rio buys Entree's stake in 
tenements adjacent to its Oyu Tolgoi copper mine, or whether it buys Entree outright.
Rio has owned 16.1 per cent of Entree shares for more than a decade, but it needs to act soon because the 
tenements that are minority-owned by Entree are scheduled to be mined by Oyu Tolgoi within the next 12 to 18 
months.
Under that schedule, preparatory work should be happening on the Entree tenements right now, but it is being 
frustrated by the need to strike a commercial deal first.
Entree had a win over Rio on December 19 when an independent arbitration tribunal adopted Entree's 
interpretation of how certain transactions between the two companies should be struck.
Entree shares have risen tenfold since March 2020, demonstrating how Rio could have fixed up this mess much 
cheaper had it acted sooner.
Entree shares have more than doubled over the past year and are up 68 per cent in the past six months.Page 8 of 9
Where mining giants are ready to pounce
It's hard to see the value equation getting better for Rio if it holds out long enough to start sabotaging Oyu Tolgoi's 
grades and volumes.
SolGold
Big suitors: BHP, Newmont
Commodities: Copper, gold
Country: Ecuador
It has been eight years since BHP showed its liking for SolGold's Cascabel project, and even though the Big 
Australian still owns 10 per cent of SolGold shares, a takeover bid seems less likely than ever.
Put simply, SolGold's Cascabel project is being developed and funded in a way that is diametrically opposite to how 
BHP would like it developed.
Rather than building the mine to maximise its long-term potential and cashflows, the loose coalition of colourful 
characters that controls SolGold is thinking smaller, cheaper and faster.
An updated plan for the mine published in 2024 slashed close to $1 billion off the construction costs. The new plan 
envisages a smaller mine that will cherry-pick the highest-grade zone of the resource first, meaning Cascabel's 
second and third decades will rely on extracting the lower-grade material.
Rather than fund construction via share issuances, Cascabel is being funded via a series of debt instruments that 
require the mine to provide a "stream" of gold or a royalty to the lender at a future date in exchange for immediate 
cash. This approach is common for small miners without deep pockets; but with every royalty streaming deal that is 
placed on Cascabel, the project becomes a bit less attractive to BHP.
Perhaps that's why SolGold shares slumped 30 per cent over the past year, despite strength in gold and copper 
prices; the "event driven" investors in SolGold are becoming less convinced that a takeover "event" will occur. The 
stock is down 82 per cent since April 2022.
According to RBC numbers, the Filo Del Sol asset that BHP acquired for $3.2 billion in July is a bit better than 
Cascabel in most ways; it contains more copper and is a bit higher grade. BHP certainly likes the Filo project 
partners - the Lundin family - better than the SolGold crew.
Newmont inherited a 10 per cent stake in SolGold from Newcrest, but seems far less interested in SolGold.
SolGold will likely make a final decision to build Cascabel according to the smaller, faster, cheaper strategy within 
the next two years. For BHP, that will be the moment to speak up or forever hold its peace.
Hyterra
Big suitor: Fortescue
Commodities: Hydrogen, helium
Country: USA
Fortescue may have cooled its hydrogen jets in 2024, but in December it showed it was still the world's biggest 
hydrogen bull, buying 39 per cent of natural hydrogen explorer Hyterra for $21.9 million.
Unlike most of Fortescue's hydrogen projects, Hyterra does not plan to manufacture the flammable gas by zapping 
water with electricity. Rather, Hyterra plans to extract naturally occurring hydrogen from underground in Kansas.
It hopes to find some helium down there too.Page 9 of 9
Where mining giants are ready to pounce
Hyterra's work is more akin to oil and gas extraction than hard rock mining, and given the nascent nature of natural 
hydrogen extraction, Fortescue is unlikely to face a bidding war for control of Hyterra any time soon.
But like all things Fortescue, it will be fun to watch.AFR

The US government relaxed some of the strictest criteria for hydrogen producers seeking billions of dollars in tax 
credits, giving Australian green fuel hopefuls a reprieve after a torrid 2024 reduced their ambitions.
The administration of outgoing US president Joe Biden on Friday (Saturday AEDT) finalised the Congress-
approved 45V provisions aimed at reducing the cost for companies to make clean hydrogen.
The US hydrogen scheme endured a complex and long-winded review that concluded with the easing of stringent 
rules on how producers source their energy. Hydrogen producers now have two extra years to find adequate 
renewable power, deferring a problem that proponents had feared would stymie the industry's formative years.
The original proposal required producers to run their electrolyser machines - which split hydrogen from water - 
strictly during the operating hours of wind or solar farms. Producers now have until 2030.
Several Australian companies have hydrogen interests in the US including Woodside Energy's H2OK project in 
Oklahoma and Fortescue's Arizona Hydrogen, both of which stand to potentially benefit from Washington's tax 
credits.
"Will it be a shot in the arm [for the sector]? Yes, overall, it's positive," said Nick O'Loughlin, managing director at 
hydrogen start-up Sparc Technologies, which has a joint venture with Fortescue and the University of Adelaide.
"But unless we can get power prices down, the cost of green hydrogen will remain above the cost at which people 
are willing to purchase it. That is a fundamental barrier that the industry is facing to get these projects up and 
running, with or without credits."
The Albanese government is pouring billions into green hydrogen, which is produced using renewable energy, 
through its $4 billion Hydrogen Headstart Program.
Despite the push headed by Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen, multiple homegrown projects were 
shuttered or downgraded as the sector's economics came into question.

Aussie hydrogen hopes buoyed by US rule change
In July, Fortescue axed 700 jobs and slowed its push into green hydrogen and ammonia by pulling back from its 
large-scale complex at Gibson Island in Queensland.
Other local setbacks included Woodside icing two projects in Australia and New Zealand, Province Resources 
putting its Western Australian facility on hold, while Origin Energy abandoned its hydrogen venture in the NSW 
Hunter Valley.
Woodside said it was reviewing the new US tax credit regime and "how it may impact our project in Oklahoma", but 
declined to comment further yesterday.
The group's flagship green energy project has been repeatedly delayed since it was first earmarked for board 
sanction in 2022 and remains idled. The oil and gas producer hopes to produce up to 60 tonnes a day of liquid 
hydrogen through electrolysis and liquefaction at the US plant.
Fortescue, which has an ambitious strategy to become a major force in hydrogen and renewables, was contacted 
for comment.
Executive chairman Andrew Forrest last year criticised the Biden administration's scheme, specifically the eligibility 
rules that may affect its $US550 million Arizona operations. Fortescue began constructing its Phoenix-based plant 
in 2024, with the goal of producing of liquid green hydrogen by mid-2026.
Sparc Technologies has invested $5 million in their hydrogen joint venture, which uses photocatalysis, rather than 
the more widely adopted technology of using an electrolyser.

Body
The lawsuit, an unusual strategy for the oil giant, comes after California’s attorney general sued Exxon last year 
alleging it misled the public about plastics recycling.
Exxon Mobil sued California’s attorney general, the Sierra Club and other environmental groups on Monday, 
alleging that they conspired to defame the oil giant and kneecap its business prospects amid a debate over whether 
plastics can be recycled effectively.
The claims are an escalation in the legal conflict between oil companies and environmental groups, which have 
spent years fighting over environmental concerns related to fossil fuels, plastics and climate change.
Exxon’s lawsuit singles out language used by Rob Bonta, the California attorney general, who sued Exxon in 
September, alleging that the company carried out a “campaign of deception” that led people to buy more single-use 
plastics by promoting the idea that the products could be recycled. Plastics are made from fossil fuels and are more 
difficult to recycle than other materials like paper and metal. Mr. Bonta’s lawsuit, filed in superior court in San 
Francisco, denounced the company’s “advanced recycling” program, which refers to processes that break down 
plastics to create new materials, including fuel.
“Exxon Mobil has not engaged in a decades-long secret mission to brainwash or deceive the public,” the company 
said in its federal lawsuit, filed Monday in the Eastern District of Texas.
Exxon said Mr. Bonta later made false statements in interviews and other forums about its recycling technology, 
causing prospective business deals to fall apart. “Advanced recycling is not a ‘farce’ or ‘myth,’” the company said in 
its suit.
A spokesperson for the California Department of Justice called the suit “another attempt from Exxon Mobil to deflect 
attention from its own unlawful deception” and said Mr. Bonta was looking forward to “vigorously litigating” the case.

Exxon Sues California Official, Claiming He Defamed the Company
Exxon is seeking monetary damages and retractions from Mr. Bonta and the environmental groups, which include 
the Sierra Club, San Francisco Baykeeper, Heal the Bay and the Surfrider Foundation. These four, all based in 
California, had filed their own lawsuit against Exxon in parallel with Mr. Bonta’s, alleging violations of state nuisance 
and unfair-competition laws.
A spokesman for the Sierra Club, Jonathon Berman, called the suit “a shameless attempt at intimidation” and said 
“Exxon is clearly confused about the difference between defamation and accountability.”
An Australian charity, Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund, was also named in Monday’s lawsuit. That group 
is described in the suit as working on behalf of Andrew Forrest, the founder of an Australian mining company, 
Fortescue Metals Group, that has become a critic of Exxon. Exxon said the charity had retained a law firm, 
Cotchett, Pitre and McCarthy, and recruited the environmental groups that filed the parallel lawsuit as “proxies.”
The charity said in a statement on Tuesday that it was not a subsidiary of, owned or controlled by Fortescue or Mr. 
Forrest’s environmental foundation, Minderoo. A spokeswoman for Mr. Forrest said he had provided funds to the 
charity in his personal capacity. Minderoo said that its work had been described incorrectly in Monday’s lawsuit.
Niall McCarthy, a partner with Cotchett, Pitre &amp; McCarthy, called the case “a P.R. campaign” with no merit and 
said the groups stood by the lawsuits. “Suggesting they are anyone’s ‘proxy’ is baseless, and fails to recognize that 
these nonprofits have been at the forefront of the battle over plastics,” he said.
Fortescue advocates transitioning away from oil, and instead using hydrogen as fuel. Exxon in its lawsuit described 
the company as a competitor in the energy-transition sector. A spokesman for Fortescue said Tuesday that it 
rejected Exxon’s assertions, including that the company had orchestrated the litigation to gain a competitive 
advantage.
Mr. Forrest, in a separate statement, said that “any accusation of commercial benefit” related to the case was false 
and that the fossil fuel industry knows it is “on borrowed time and that technological solutions exist to phase out 
fossil fuels.”
The September lawsuit by Mr. Bonta came after a more than two-year investigation that included subpoenas to 
Exxon and industry groups and sought damages that he said could amount to “multiple billions of dollars.”
Energy companies are facing numerous lawsuits from state and local governments alleging that they misled the 
public about climate change in their quest to keep selling fossil fuels. California’s plastics lawsuit had indicated a 
new tack in that yearslong legal battle and was built on a similar premise over claims of deception.
In a recent report, “The Fraud of Plastic Recycling,” the advocacy group Center for Climate Integrity concluded that 
recycling plastics had largely failed because it was too expensive to do on a large scale. Even when recycling is 
technically possible, virgin plastic is cheaper. But oil companies and the plastics industry continued to promote 
recycling as a solution to plastic waste, the report said.
Less than 10 percent of plastic generated in 2018 was ultimately recycled, according to Environmental Protection 
Agency data, though the rates for some categories of plastic were much higher. The rate of plastics converted into 
energy has grown steadily in recent years, according to the data.
The legal counterattack by Exxon also evoked a lawsuit that Energy Transfer, a pipeline company. brought against 
Greenpeace and other environmental groups accusing them of inciting protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline 
in 2016 and 2017. Energy Transfer said Greenpeace circulated false information to harm its reputation and damage 
its business interests. Greenpeace has denied playing a leading role in the protests. A trial is set to begin in 
February in North Dakota.

Highlight: Andrew Forrest and his charity IEJF have been accused in a defamation lawsuit by Exxon Mobil Corp of 
"a campaign to compete by turning the wheels of American justice to the company's self-interested purposes".
Body
Andrew Forrest and his charity have been accused in a defamation lawsuit by Exxon Mobil Corp of "a campaign to 
compete by turning the wheels of American justice to the company's self-interested purposes".
ExxonMobil also accused California Attorney-General Rob Bonta and several environmental groups of conspiring to 
defame it by making statements about the efficacy of its plastics recycling technology.
Dr Forrest's Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund (IEJF) is named among the defendants, alongside the 
Sierra Club, San Francisco Baykeeper, Heal the Bay, and the Surfrider Foundation, in the lawsuit filed in 
California's Eastern District.
The lawsuit claimed IEJF retained US lawyers Cotchett to engage in "political activities", including filing a lawsuit 
against ExxonMobil.
"Together, Bonta and the US Proxies — the former for political gain and the latter pawns for the Foreign Interests 
— have engaged in a deliberate smear campaign against ExxonMobil, falsely claiming that ExxonMobil's effective 
and innovative advanced recycling technology is a 'false promise' and 'not based on truth,'" the company said in its 
lawsuit.
It seeks unspecified damages and retractions of "defamatory statements" from Mr Bonta and the groups.
Accusations against Forrest
ExxonMobil claims that IEJF is a subsidiary of Minderoo, a philanthropic organisation founded and chaired by Dr 
Forrest, the billionaire founder of Fortescue.
Page 2 of 3

It claims after Dr Forrest allegedly failed to garner interest in the US market for his "levy" on virgin plastics in 2019, 
he, Fortescue, and Minderoo became strident critics of the plastics industry in general, and ExxonMobil in 
particular.
In the first Plastic Waste Makers Index, published in 2021 by Minderoo, it alleged ExxonMobil is the largest 
producer of plastic polymers which are then turned into single-use plastics, the lawsuit says.
ExxonMobil denied this claim and said it does not make single-use plastics.
The lawsuit goes on to claim Minderoo made several false and deceptive statements concerning ExxonMobil, 
plastics waste, and advanced recycling in its reports.
"Why would a philanthropic organization conspire with the US Proxies to defame and interfere with ExxonMobil — 
attacking the same technologies (advanced recycling) that they themselves recognized were essential to solving 
the issue of plastic waste only five years earlier?" the lawsuit read.
A Minderoo spokesperson said Minderoo's reference in the complaint is incorrect in terms of its relationship with 
IEJF, and in connection with the publication of the Plastic Waste Makers Index and its ongoing advocacy.
"Minderoo stands by both Plastic Waste Makers Index reports which were prepared in conjunction with respected 
research and analysis partners, with the application of the research methodology independently reviewed," they 
said. 
ExxonMobil further alleged in the suit, Fortescue, which Minderoo is a substantial shareholder in, hired an 
American law firm to bring claims against ExxonMobil on behalf of the US proxies; which later became funded by 
IEJF.
Fortescue competes with Exxon in low-carbon solutions and the energy transition sector, the lawsuit said.
The suit alleged IEJF paid Cotchett "hundreds of thousands of dollars in consideration for legal services provided in 
connection with the US Proxies' plastics lawsuit".
In a statement Dr Forrest said: "This lawsuit is no surprise and right out of the oil and gas industry playbook.
"I am personally delighted Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-
examination," he said.
"The fossil fuel industry is ­getting increasingly desperate at maintaining its toxic grip on ­society. Their only priority 
is to maximise their profits and ­produce as much oil and gas as possible."
A Fortescue spokesperson made note it was not a named defendant but was mentioned several times in 
the lawsuit. 
"Fortescue rejects the assertions that Exxon Mobil has made against Fortescue in the complaint, including 
the assertions that the Company has orchestrated litigation against Exxon to gain a competitive 
advantage," they said. 
Bonta connection
ExxonMobil also claimed the law firm Cotchett and its members are directly tied to Mr Bonta, having donated tens 
of thousands of dollars to his political campaigns.
A spokesperson for the California Department of Justice called the lawsuit "another attempt from ExxonMobil to 
deflect attention from its own unlawful deception" and said Mr Bonta looks forward to "vigorously litigating" the case.
In its lawsuit filed in September, Mr Bonta's office said that less than 5 per cent of plastic is recycled into another 
plastic product in the US even though the items are labelled as "recyclable".Page 3 of 3

As a result landfills and oceans are filled with plastic waste, creating a global pollution crisis, while consumers 
diligently place plastic water bottles and other containers into recycling bins, the lawsuit alleges.

Mining billionaire Andrew Forrest has come out swinging in defence of his charity, Minderoo, after it became 
embroiled in a defamation suit levelled by ExxonMobil, lambasting the oil and gas giant for a pursuit he deemed to 
be "right out of the industry playbook".
According to court filings, Exxon launched a defamation suit against California Attorney General Rob Bonta and 
several environmental groups in Texas on Monday, demanding damages and a retraction of claims about the oil 
company's advanced plastics recycling initiative.

Exxon has accused Bonta of colluding with US law firm Cotchett, Pitre & McCarthy, LLP and a swath of 
environmental groups, including the Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund.
In the suit, the company claims the defendants made false statements about its recycling technology which have 
since cost it contracts and damaged its future business prospects.
While Forrest, his iron ore miner, Fortescue, and multibillion-dollar charity, Minderoo, are not named as a party to 
the action, Exxon has claimed the Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund is controlled by Minderoo.
Further, the oil and gas company accused Fortescue of orchestrating litigation against Exxon to gain a competitive 
advantage in the energy transition sector, an assertion the miner also flatly rejected.
Minderoo and Fortescue have maintained they operate independently of the fund, something corroborated by the 
IEJF in a statement to this masthead.
Forrest has since launched a defence of himself and his empire, claiming he was "delighted" by news of the lawsuit, 
and branding the pursuit evidence that the industry was desperate to retain its "toxic grip on society".

The WA billionaire reiterated his commitment to spearheading Minderoo, Fortescue and his investment vehicle, 
Tattarang, in a way that would allow it to be rid of fossil fuels by 2030, and insisted any accusation of commercial 
benefit was "completely false".
"This lawsuit is no surprise and right out of the oil and gas industry playbook," he said.
"I am personally delighted Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-
examination.
"[The oil and gas industry's] only priority is to maximise their profits and produce as much oil and gas as possible.
"My conflict is that I am dedicated to steering the world away from a future reliant on fossil fuels.
"The fossil-fuel industry know they are on borrowed time and that technological solutions exist to phase out fossil 
fuels."
Forrest has been vocal in his criticism of oil and gas producers, which included poring over Woodside chief 
executive Meg O'Neill's history as an ExxonMobil executive in an interview on Perth radio and accusing her of 
"peddling poison".
A spokesperson for the California Department of Justice said the defamation action was another attempt by 
ExxonMobil to deflect attention from its "own unlawful deception".
The lawsuit is the latest twist in the ongoing battle between environmental groups and the fossil-fuels industry.
Bonta launched legal action against Exxon in 2024, claiming the company had engaged in deception about the 
limitations of recycling and called on the court to hold Exxon to account for its role in rampant plastic pollution.
Minderoo made national headlines just last month over its backing of a Global Plastics Treaty to curb the production 
and use of polymers, touting the need for a plastics levy.

ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest oil companies, has accused a charity linked to billionaire businessman 
Andrew Forrest of orchestrating a campaign to damage the commercial interests of his rivals.
The New York-listed energy giant is not suing Dr Forrest directly, but accusing several environmental groups, 
including Australia's Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund, of conspiring with officials in the California Justice 
Department to harm the company's prospects.
In filings with a federal court in Texas, Exxon says the IEJF is really a subsidiary of Minderoo, a charitable 
organisation set up by Dr Forrest. Minderoo has campaigned for action to prevent climate change and for a levy on 
using fossil fuels to make plastic.
Exxon's lawsuit accuses Dr Forrest's charities of working to turn "the wheels of American justice to [Fortescue's] 
self-interested purposes".
The Forrest family has a major stake in ASX-listed Fortescue, the West Australian iron ore mining group, which 
has been attempting to expand into clean energy. Although the company has pushed back plans for the large-scale 
manufacture of green hydrogen, it has other projects around the world that it hopes will reduce the demand for 
fossil fuels. Green hydrogen is widely seen as a potential competitor to oil and gas.
"Fortescue appears to have adopted a novel strategy for competing against American oil and gas producers like 
ExxonMobil," the court filings read.
"It is also a case about the corrupting influence of foreign money in the American legal system and about the sordid 
for-profit incentives and outright greed that tries to hide behind so-called public impact litigation."
Exxon claims the IEJF, along with the Sierra Club, San Francisco Baykeeper, Heal the Bay and the Surfrider 
Foundation, have worked together and also with Californian authorities to bring lawsuits against the company. 
California's attorney-general, Rob Bonta, accused Exxon of a "campaign of deception" by suggesting single-use 
plastics made from fossil fuels could be reused through "advanced recycling" when they could not.

The lawsuit is an escalation in a long-running stoush between Dr Forrest - who founded Fortescue and now has a 
fortune of $16.76 billion, according to the Financial Review Rich List - and the oil and gas industry.
In late 2023, Dr Forrest told a Perth radio station that Meg O'Neill, the chief executive of the largest ASX-listed oil 
and gas company, Woodside Energy, had been "hard-edge trained by the biggest liar we've ever seen around 
climate change over the last 40 years, and that's ExxonMobil". "She's been parachuted in here, bringing in all 
ExxonMobil's ways," he said, adding that she was "peddling poison all the time".
In response, Woodside accused Dr Forrest of "personal vitriol" and "using violent imagery", describing it as a 
"terrible example for public debate".
Yesterday, Dr Forrest said the lawsuit against the environmental organisations was "right out of the oil and gas 
industry playbook".
Fortescue and Minderoo have denied that they own or operate the IEJF, and they are not named as defendants in 
the matter.
"I am personally delighted Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-
examination," Dr Forrest said in a statement. "The fossil fuel industry is getting increasingly desperate at 
maintaining its toxic grip on society. My conflict is that I am dedicated to steering the world away from a future 
reliant on fossil fuels."
A Fortescue spokesman said the company rejected assertions that it had orchestrated litigation against Exxon for 
its advantage. "Fortescue remains fully committed to green hydrogen and the establishment of a global green 
hydrogen industry, and rejects any claims to the contrary," he said.
A spokesperson for the California Justice Department said: "This is another attempt from ExxonMobil to deflect 
attention from its own unlawful deception. The attorney-general is proud to advance his lawsuit against 
ExxonMobil."
ExxonMobil claims Dr Forrest visited the company's Texas offices in 2019 as he toured the world promoting the 
idea of a levy on new plastic, which he wanted to put in place to make recycled plastic more attractive. "During that 
visit, representatives of ExxonMobil explained that, while perhaps well intended, a voluntary agreement among 
industry competitors to inflate the price of their goods would be a clear violation of US antitrust law," the company 
said in its filings with the Texas court.
It also alleges that Minderoo has repeatedly made "several false and deceptive statements" about Exxon's plastics 
and recycling processes. It alleges, without providing evidence, that Minderoo founded IEJF in 2022.
"The majority of the wealth used by Minderoo comes directly from its holdings in Fortescue," the filings read. "The 
IEJF and Minderoo share executives with Fortescue. All of which leads to the conclusion that the IEJF's interests 
are directly tied to those of Fortescue."
Accounts for the 12 months to June 30 show the charity received $600,000 in donations, up from $250,000 one 
year earlier.
Minderoo said it had been "incorrectly referred to in the complaint as owning and controlling" the IEJF.

Andrew Forrest has been accused of being a foreign agent who is orchestrating "smear campaigns" against the oil 
and gas sector to further his own commercial ambitions, in a bombshell lawsuit by global giant ExxonMobil.
Dr Forrest, his mining company Fortescue and his philanthropic arm Minderoo have all been mentioned in a 
lawsuit filed in Texas this week by Exxon, in which the oil and gas company accused California Attorney-General 
Rob Bonta, several US environmental groups and Dr Forrest's Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund of 
defamation.
The lawsuit argues that Dr Forrest effectively enlisted US environmental organisations Sierra Club, Surfrider, Heal 
the Bay, and San Francisco Baykeeper as his US proxies to launch lawsuits against ExxonMobil and its advanced 
plastic recycling ambitions.
In a statement, Dr Forrest said the lawsuit was no surprise and was "right out of the oil & gas industry playbook".
"I am personally delighted Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-
examination," Dr Forrest said.
"The fossil fuel industry is -getting increasingly desperate at maintaining its toxic grip on -society. Their only priority 
is to maximise their profits and -produce as much oil and gas as possible." Exxon's complaint said the case was 
about "the corrupting influence of foreign money in the American legal system and â€¦ the sordid for-profit 
incentives and outright greed that tries to hide behind so-called public impact litigation".
The case focuses on the role of IEFJ, a charity established by Dr Forrest and run out of the Mounts Bay Road 
headquarters of Minderoo and his Tattarang -family office.
According to the lawsuit, IEFJ, Exxon says, has directed hundreds of thousands of dollars to US law firm Cotchett, 
Pitre & McCarthy to help "smear campaigns" by Mr Bonta and US not-for-profits against Exxon and its plans to 
expand its plastic recycling operations. Mr Bonta has branded Exxon's recycling ambitions as a "myth" and a 
"sham".

'Foreign agent': Forrest named in Exxon lawsuit
"Why would Mr Bonta or -anyone who claims to be serious about cleaning up the environment and helping solve 
the plastic-waste issue take such extreme measures to shut down the emerging and developing advanced recycling 
industry?" the Exxon complaint said "The answer is foreign influence, personal ambition, and a murky source of 
financing rife with conflicting business interests.
"With apparently no appreciation for the irony of their claim, Mr Bonta and his cohorts are now engaging in reverse 
green-washing; while posing under the banner of environmentalism, they do damage to genuine recycling programs 
and to meaningful innovation." Exxon noted in its complaint that Dr Forrest was the largest shareholder in 
Fortescue, which it said was competing with Exxon in the low-carbon-solutions and energy-transition sector.
The company described efforts by Dr Forrest and Fortescue to transform the miner into a green-energy 
powerhouse, including its ambition to sell green hydrogen to the world in competition with American oil and gas 
producers. Those plans have since been radically scaled back.
"Having failed to successfully compete against ExxonMobil in the marketplace, Fortescue has, on information and 
belief, orchestrated a campaign to compete by turning the wheels of American justice to the company's self-
interested purposes," the Exxon complaint said. "More specifically, Fortescue funds Minderoo, which owns and 
controls the IEJF, which hired an American law firm to bring claims against ExxonMobil on behalf of the US 
Proxies." (Minderoo says Exxon's description of its relationship to IEFJ is incorrect.) Exxon said the scale and 
nature of IEFJ's engagement with US law firm Cotchett was significant enough to require the firm to register itself as 
a foreign agent under the US Foreign Agents Registration Act.
"Together, Bonta and the US Proxies - the former for political gain and the latter pawns for the Foreign Interests - 
have engaged in a deliberate smear campaign against ExxonMobil, falsely claiming that ExxonMobil's effective and 
innovative advanced recycling technology is a 'false promise' and 'not based on truth'," the complaint said.
Mr Bonta has accused Exxon of simply stockpiling, rather than recycling, plastic waste it had collected and has 
labelled Exxon's advanced recycling "a false promise". Those attacks, Exxon said, had had a "chilling effect" on its 
ability to attract third-party customers and secure permits.
Exxon noted in its lawsuit that Dr Forrest himself had in a 2019 TED Talk talked up the merits of advanced plastics 
recycling, when he called for a voluntary levy on virgin plastics to help make the economics of advanced plastics 
recycling more competitive.
Dr Forrest's Fortescue, while named in the complaint, is not a party to the lawsuit.
The accusations of foreign influence driving legal activism against the oil and gas sector echo accusations levelled 
against Australia's Environmental Defenders Office in the wake of its failed legal challenge against Santos and its 
Barossa gas project.
The EDO receives a significant portion of its donations from foreign sources. Opposition resources spokeswoman 
Susan McDonald has repeatedly called for greater transparency over the origins of that offshore funding.
Dr Forrest said he was dedicated to steering the world away from a future reliant on fossil fuels, and said any 
accusation of commercial benefit was completely false. "The fossil-fuel industry know they are on borrowed time 
and that technological solutions exist to phase out fossil fuels," he said. "If the company I founded, Fortescue, one 
of Australia's biggest polluters and most successful companies can profitably cease the use of fossil fuels and go 
'real zero' by 2030 - in just five years - heavy industry will be quick to follow." A Fortescue spokesman said the 
company rejected the assertions made against it in the lawsuit, including that it had orchestrated litigation against 
Exxon to gain a competitive advantage.
"While the world was in turmoil in 2021, Fortescue seized the opportunity to meet with governments around the 
world to begin its green transformation and this has been pivotal to setting the company up for its future success," 
the spokesman said.Page 3 of 3
'Foreign agent': Forrest named in Exxon lawsuit
"Fortescue has an industry-leading plan to stop burning fossil fuels and achieve 'real zero' across its Australian iron 
ore operations by the end of the decade. It is this commitment that continues to set the bar for other companies - 
including those in the oil and gas industry - to follow." A Minderoo spokesman said it was clear that recycling was 
not an effective means to curb the environmental and human health harms of plastics. "Minderoo Foundation is 
committed to reducing the production of plastics which have a devastating impact on human health, with exposure 
to chemicals found in plastics increasing risks throughout the entire human life cycle, including impacting birth 
outcomes, child neurodevelopment, reproductive health, and metabolic, endocrine and nutrition systems," the 
spokesman said.

Australian mining magnate Andrew Forrest is among a group accused of orchestrating “smear campaigns and 
lawfare” against the global oil and gas sector “for politics, publicity, and private gain” in a dramatic defamation  claim 
launched in US courts by fossil fuel company ExxonMobil.
But the iron ore billionaire, who is not himself a defendant in the case, said he is “personally delighted” at the court 
action and that “Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-examination”.
ExxonMobil’s suit accuses the California attorney general, Rob Bonta, and several environmental groups of 
conspiring to defame it by making statements criticising its plastics recycling technology.
Bonta sued ExxonMobil last year, saying the company had engaged in decades-long deception about the 
limitations of its plastics recycling regime.
A Forrest-linked charity, the Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund (IEJF), is a named defendant in the suit, 
alongside US environmental groups the Sierra Club, San Francisco Baykeeper, Heal the Bay, and the Surfrider 
Foundation. The California-based groups have filed a countersuit  against ExxonMobil.
The lawsuit, filed in Texas, claims that IEJF retained US lawyers Cotchett to engage in “political activities”, including 
filing a lawsuit against ExxonMobil. It seeks damages and retractions of “defamatory statements” from Bonta and 
the groups.

“Together, Bonta and the US Proxies – the former for political gain and the latter pawns for the Foreign Interests – 
have engaged in a deliberate smear campaign against ExxonMobil, falsely claiming that ExxonMobil’s effective and 
innovative advanced recycling technology is a ‘false promise’ and ‘not based on truth,’” the company said in its 
lawsuit.
Forrest is not a defendant in the case, but is mentioned by name more than 20 times in the claim filed before the 
court, including allegations he harboured a “dream of upending the American oil-and-gas industry”.
Forrest issued a statement saying he welcomed the lawsuit, which he described as “right out of the oil and gas 
industry playbook”.
“I am personally delighted Exxon has walked themselves into the court and opened themselves up to cross-
examination,” Forrest said. He said the fossil industry was living on “borrowed time”.
“The fossil fuel industry is ­getting increasingly desperate at maintaining its toxic grip on ­society. Their only priority 
is to maximise their profits and ­produce as much oil and gas as possible.”
ExxonMobil claims its case has been brought in response to “the corrupting influence of foreign money in the 
American legal system and … the sordid for-profit incentives and outright greed that tries to hide behind so-called 
public impact litigation”.
The suit alleges the Forrest-linked charity IEFJ has directed thousands of dollars to US law firm Cotchett, Pitre & 
McCarthy to fund “smear campaigns” run by Bonta and US environmental groups condemning Exxon and ridiculing 
its plastics recycling program as a “myth” and a “sham”.
“Why would Mr Bonta or ­anyone who claims to be serious about cleaning up the environment and helping solve the 
plastic-waste issue take such extreme measures to shut down the emerging and developing advanced recycling 
industry?” the ExxonMobil complaint asks.
“The answer is foreign influence, personal ambition, and a murky source of financing rife with conflicting business 
interests.”
ExxonMobil alleges a chain of conspiracy against it.
Its claim, filed in Texas’s eastern district, states that Forrest’s Fortescue competes directly with ExxonMobil in the 
low-carbon-energy sectors.
“Having failed to successfully compete against ExxonMobil in the marketplace, Fortescue has, on information and 
belief, orchestrated a campaign to compete by turning the wheels of American justice to the company’s self-
interested purposes,” the Exxon complaint said.
“More specifically, Fortescue funds Minderoo, which owns and controls the IEJF, which hired an American law firm 
to bring claims against ExxonMobil on behalf of the US Proxies.
“The majority of the wealth used by Minderoo comes directly from its holdings in Fortescue. The IEJF and 
Minderoo share executives with Fortescue. All of which leads to the conclusion that the IEJF’s interests are directly 
tied to those of Fortescue.”
Minderoo, in a statement, rejected Exxon’s characterisation of its relationship with IEFJ: “Minderoo is a philanthropy 
which is independent of the Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund.”
A spokesperson for Minderoo said it was committed to reducing the production of plastics which have a devastating 
impact on human health.Page 3 of 3
Andrew Forrest fires back at ExxonMobil’s claims of ‘smear campaigns and lawfare’
“In 2021, Minderoo published the Plastic Waste Makers index , which revealed the largest contributors to the global 
plastics crisis, finding that just 20 companies … were responsible for producing more than 50% of single use plastic 
worldwide. ExxonMobil topped the list of polymer producers,” the spokesperson said.
Fortescue said in a statement while it was not a named defendant in the proceedings, it is mentioned repeatedly in 
the claim.
“Fortescue rejects the assertions that Exxon Mobil has made against Fortescue in the complaint, including the 
assertions that the Company has orchestrated litigation against Exxon to gain a competitive advantage.”
Responding on behalf of Bonta, a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice said the Texas lawsuit was 
“another attempt from ExxonMobil to deflect attention from its own unlawful deception”.
“The attorney general is proud to advance his lawsuit against ExxonMobil and looks forward to vigorously litigating 
this case in court.”
In a statement, the IEFJ said it was a non-profit “registered with and regulated by the Australian Charities and Not-
For-Profits Commission”.
“Intergenerational Environment Justice Fund is not a subsidiary of, owned, or controlled by Minderoo Foundation or 
Fortescue Metals Group.”

Fortescue has cast more doubt over the future of an almost $900m hydrogen project in the US state of Arizona in 
the wake of Donald Trump's return to the White House.
The Andrew Forrest-led Fortescue on Thursday indicated that the Arizona project was in the balance and that the 
company was assessing the merits of other big-ticket green energy projects in Norway and Brazil.
Fortescue handed down its December quarter results soon after Dr Forrest told a panel at the World Economic 
Forum in Davos, Switzerland there had to be a "hard economic base" for businesses to decarbonise - and criticised 
net-zero emissions -targets.
The mining producer shipped 49.4 million tonnes of iron ore in the December quarter and a record 97.1 million 
tonnes across the first half.
The troubled Iron Bridge magnetite operations, which were supposed to be producing 22 million tonnes of high-
grade iron ore concentrate a year by mid 2023, contributed 3.2 million tonnes to the half-year results.
However, Fortescue metals chief executive Dino Otranto said there were positive signs at Iron Bridge after a major 
shutdown in November.
Mr Otranto said Fortescue was committed to its iron ore project in Gabon despite little progress since the company 
marked its first shipment from the African nation more than a year ago.
Sources close to the project say they believe Fortescue has a strained relationship with Gabon's military rulers and 
that contractors were stood down towards the end of 2024.
Mr Otranto said the Gabon operations were not being wound up. "We got the first shipment out within months after 
signing the mining convention, but it was always our intent not to continue that operation - a high-cost trucking 
operation - to focus on the exploration activities," he said.

Fortescue's US hydrogen project on shaky ground
In the US, the release this month of final rules on hydrogen projects was thought to be a boost to Fortescue's 
$US550m ($878m) plan for so-called green energy production in Arizona.
The rules relaxed conditions around the supply for hydrogen producers seeking to access tax credits under the 
former Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act.
Fortescue said it was assessing the implications of the rules on US hydrogen projects.
The assessment has become more complicated as the new Trump administration makes big policy changes in 
energy.
Fortescue chief financial officer Apple Paget raised the prospect of the company using debt to finance any "green" 
energy that went ahead, as it foreshadowed a more detailed update next month. "Clearly, increasing debt remains 
an option for us, but we do have a very strong capacity in our balance sheet and we're set up that way to take that 
on and look at other options as well," Ms Paget said in response to questions from analysts.
Speaking on climate change at Davos, Dr Forrest said the word "net" gave companies a get-out clause to "do 
nothing" to reduce carbon emissions when they went to banks to raise capital.
"We [Fortescue] raised capital this morning, only this morning, of $US9.2bn," Dr Forrest said. It is unclear what he 
meant by the comments, which came as he reiterated that Fortescue intended to spend "at least $US6.5bn" to 
decarbonise its iron ore operations.
Citi analysts said it had been a strong quarter in the core iron ore business based on output and lower production 
costs, but disappointing in terms of cash generation as there was only a slight reduction in net debt. Fortescue 
shares fell 2.2 per cent on Thursday to $18.62.

Fortescue has kept its annual iron ore shipment target steady following a record-breaking performance in the first 
half, fuelled by strong output from its Pilbara operations and progress at the problematic Iron Bridge project.
The Andrew Forrest-chaired group reported shipments of 49.4 million tonnes of iron ore in the December quarter, 
bringing total exports for the first six months of the financial year to a record 97.1 million tonnes.
The Perth-based miner gained traction at its Iron Bridge operation which was plagued with trouble in ramp-up and 
produced 1.5 million tonnes of the steelmaking ingredient.
Fortescue kept its full-year shipment forecast at 190 million to 200 million tonnes. Its rival iron ore miners - Rio 
Tinto and BHP - also reaffirmed their full-year targets in quarterly filings earlier this month.
Still, shares in Australia's resources giants have fallen since US President Donald Trump threatened to impose 10 
per cent tariffs on China, potentially wrecking steel demand from the world's largest iron ore customer.
Fortescue shares fell 2.2 per cent to $18.62 yesterday, for a decline of 4 per cent since January 21 when Trump 
made the threat.
The benchmark price of iron ore is tipped by analysts to trade at or below $US100 a tonne for most of this year as 
new supply adds to stockpiles at Chinese ports, coupled with the threat of tariffs.
The benchmark spot price for ore containing 62 per cent iron fetched an average $US103 a tonne over the 
December quarter and was at that level yesterday.
Fortescue produces lower-grade ore than the benchmark, meaning it fetches lower prices. Over the December 
quarter, prices received fell shy of broker UBS' expectations; the miner realised an average price of $US87 a dry 
metric tonne.
Higher-grade ore from Iron Bridge fetched a premium to the benchmark of about 113 per cent.

"While we have seen improvements in demand and pricing for concentrates and pellet feed for Iron Bridge in this 
quarter, the market overall remains quite volatile," said Graham Howard, Fortescue's Iron Bridge operations 
director.
Moreover, Morgan Stanley analysts warned earlier this week that proposed new environmental rules in China 
requiring steel mills to switch to a higher-grade ore could pose a threat to Fortescue. Iron Bridge was developed to 
enhance Fortescue's product mix by blending its higher-grade ore with its majority lower-grade output.
However, even with Iron Bridge output in the mix, Fortescue will still be a majority low-grade producer, Morgan 
Stanley analysts concluded in their research. By the 2027 fiscal year, they estimate the group grade with the benefit 
of Iron Bridge will be about 59.1 per cent.
Fortescue's cost of production dropped 10 per cent to $18.24 a tonne. But net debt falling to $US2 billion ($3.2 
billion) was still a higher balance than expected, with market consensus at $US1.4 billion.

The boss of West Australian iron ore developer Red Hawk Mining is urging shareholders to back a $254m takeover 
offer from Fortescue, arguing the mining major is best placed to progress its Blacksmith project in the Pilbara as 
worries over Chinese demand and tariffs in the US escalate.
Fortescue is offering Red Hawk shareholders $1.05 per share as part of its off-market cash bid, increasing to $1.20 
if it secures at least 75 per cent of Red Hawk shares within seven days.
At that price, the transaction values Red Hawk at $254m, representing a 46 per cent premium on its closing price 
on January 24 - the last day of trade before the deal was announced to the market on Tuesday.
Red Hawk managing director Steven Michael told The Australian that the offer represented an "attractive outcome" 
for shareholders, amid an uncertain outlook for Australia's iron ore producers.
"From a Red Hawk shareholder point of view, it's a very clear path to realising their return on their investment in a 
very short period of time," he said.
"I think it is fair to say that the iron ore market, where we sit today at about $US104 a tonne - there is probably more 
risk to the downside than the upside.
"Things like Simandou on the horizon coming out of Guinea sometime this year may have an impact, obviously 
China has slowed down a little bit, and there's always the risk of the new tariffs being imposed out of the US that 
may have an impact as well.
"As a board we definitely looked at the outlook for iron ore, and as a single-asset junior company, overlay that 
outlook for iron ore to our ability to fund and to build and then to provide offtake on this project, it compounds that 
risk for a single-asset junior." As part of a pre-feasibility study released last year, Red Hawk was looking to invest 
close to $250m into the development of Blacksmith - a 243 million tonne resource measured at 59.3 per cent iron 
grade.

The project was designed to ramp up to more than five million tonnes in annual production over its more than 20 
years of life.
However, with the project located just 30km west of Fortescue's Solomon iron ore operations, there is an 
opportunity for Fortescue to integrate a much larger project into its existing operations, which provide a direct rail 
link to Port Hedland.
"For a company of our size, funding a project at $250m, or possibly more, would be a challenge," Mr Michael said.
"In the hands of Fortescue, if they end up with control of this project, they would look to integrate it straight into 
their existing infrastructure.
"They would, I'm assuming, look at the scale of this project very differently to how we were going to look at it based 
on a smaller scale truck-to-port operation." Red Hawk's directors have unanimously endorsed the bid, including 
representatives from the company's two largest shareholders - New Zealand's Todd family through its TIO (NZ) 
subsidiary and OCJ Investment (Australia), who together control more than 80 per cent of the company's shares.
Fortescue said its offer represented a "significant and attractive premium" for Red Hawk shareholders.
"The cash consideration under the offer delivers immediate value to Red Hawk shareholders and provides certainty, 
noting the significant risks to the development of greenfield iron ore projects," Fortescue said.
Previously known as Flinders Mines, Red Hawk was rebadged in 2023 after abandoning plans for a multibillion-
dollar iron ore and infrastructure project in WA, including a new rail corridor and a deepwater port at Balla Balla, 
south of Port Hedland.
Fortescue's offer closes on March 3. Red Hawk shares closed 44.5 per cent higher on Tuesday at $1.19. 
Fortescue closed 0.4 per cent higher at $18.88.

Two more bidders have emerged in the mix for the Ravenswood gold mine up for sale by Golden Energy and EMR 
Capital for about $2bn.
Lining up to bid for the Queensland gold mine are Indonesian suitors Salim and United Tractors.
That's in addition to Regis Resources, Gold Road Resources and Evolution Mining out of Australia taking a look, 
and Chinese suitors Zhaojin and Chifeng, along with some names out of Canada.
The big question is how the suitors price the asset with about 300,000 ounces of gold hedged at a price now lower 
than the gold price. That may shave about $300m off the price but still, there's plenty of competitive tension at a 
time when the gold price is at record prices and few top-quality mines of the commodity are for sale.
And EMR Capital, being a private equity firm looking to return funds to investors, would be a keen seller.
As earlier reported by DataRoom, first-round bids are due in a few weeks for the mine that generates about 200,000 
ounces of gold annually.
Working on the sale are Azure Capital and UBS.
Fortescue Metals A decision by the multibillion-dollar listed iron ore miner Fortescue Metals to launch a takeover 
bid caught the market's attention and there's clear logic to its proposal to buy Red Hawk Mining because its assets 
are right next door.
Fortescue, run by billionaire Andrew Forrest, can extract synergies with Red Hawk Mining's Blacksmith Iron Ore 
project in the Pilbara because of its proximity to the major's Solomon Iron Ore Hub.
It's structured in a way to get a deal done quickly - shareholders get $1.05 or $1.20 a share if its gets to 75 per cent 
in a move to convince major shareholders to divest their position.

Working for the $240m Red Hawk is Barrenjoey, while Fortescue is self-advised. The Todd Corp out of New 
Zealand owns 61 per cent of Red Hawk and OCJ owns 21 per cent.
Previously known as Flinders Mines, Red Hawk was rebadged in 2023 after abandoning plans for a multibillion-
dollar iron ore and infrastructure project in Western Australia, including a new rail corridor and a deepwater port at 
Balla Balla, south of Port Hedland. Fortescue's offer closes on March 3. Red Hawk shares closed 44.5 per cent 
higher on Tuesday at $1.19. Fortescue edged up 0.4 per cent to $18.88.

Andrew Forrest has launched an off-market bid to acquire Red Hawk, the owner of a key iron ore deposit near 
Fortescue's existing Pilbara mines, as part of a strategy to secure longer-term growth on home soil.
The board of Red Hawk has agreed to sell its Blacksmith deposit, located 30 kilometres west of Fortescue's 
Solomon operations in the Pilbara, in a deal valued at up to $254 million. Fortescue requires the support of the 
target's shareholders to secure the deal.
An independent expert evaluating the offer deemed it fair and reasonable, noting that the bid of $1.05 a share will 
increase to $1.20 a share if Fortescue secures 75 per cent or more of the Red Hawk shares by February 4.
"We consider the offer to be fair for shareholders because the value of the offer for consideration under both 
scenarios is greater than the entire assessed valuation range of a Red Hawk share prior to the offer," said advisory 
firm BDO.
The offer is a 28 per cent premium to Red Hawk's closing share price of 82¢ on Friday, the last day it traded before 
the deal was announced yesterday. The higher offer represents a premium of 46 per cent.
Steven Michael, Red Hawk chief executive, said the decision to sell to Fortescue allowed shareholders to accept a 
chunky return on their investment and avoid the risks of developing an iron ore project.
"For a single asset junior, such as Red Hawk, to develop a major project there is a considerable funding burden. 
There are also question marks over the timing of development of the project - to go to first production in the next 12 
to 18 months requires many things outside our control to happen," he said.
"Fortescue has billions of dollars invested in infrastructure only 30 kilometres from our project. For them, this is an 
attractive bolt-on transaction. They can realise value that Red Hawk could never have realised."
Fortescue has the backing of Red Hawk shareholders TIO (NZ) and OCJ Investment (Australia), which own 70 per 
cent of Red Hawk. These agreements grant Fortescue the right to purchase 19.99 per cent of Red Hawk's shares 
Page 2 of 2

at the same price offered in the takeover bid, $1.05 a share. The remaining shares will be priced at $1.20 each if 
Red Hawk shareholders agree to sell 75 per cent of the company's register to Fortescue by next Tuesday.
Red Hawk's Blacksmith iron ore deposit is estimated at 243 million tonnes with an average iron grade of 59.3 per 
cent, slightly below the 62 per cent benchmark typical for Pilbara operations. While the lower grade poses pricing 
challenges, the deposit reinforces Fortescue's iron ore portfolio in the Pilbara and can link with its infrastructure.
RBC analyst Kaan Peker said Fortescue was the natural owner of the Blacksmith plot. "[The deal] consolidates 
some of the last available tenements resources in the region which sits outside the major miners," he told clients.
In last week's quarterly update, Fortescue said it fetched an average price of $US87 per dry metric tonne of iron 
ore, lower than the average benchmark spot price of $US103 a tonne over the December quarter.
Fortescue's troubled Iron Bridge project was developed to enhance the company's product mix by blending its 
higher-grade ore with its lower-grade output. However, even with Iron Bridge in the mix, Fortescue will still be a 
majority low-grade producer, Morgan Stanley analysts concluded. They estimate that by the 2027 fiscal year, the 
group grade with the benefit of Iron Bridge will be about 59.1 per cent, below the 62 per cent benchmark.
Mr Michael, who led Vimy Resources when it was taken over by uranium miner Deep Yellow, said the quality of 
Red Hawk's deposit compared favourably Fortescue's.

Body
We took a pop at Star Entertainment's CEO Steve McCann and its chair Anne Ward for turning up to the tennis 
finals on Sunday, which looked weird because their casinos are on fire and they're begging for money all over town. 
And so on that basis we figured it reasonable to drop a flying elbow on Wesfarmers CEO Rob Scott over his jaunt to 
the Swiss Alps in the midst of an internal crisis of his own.
Not unlike McCann and Ward, their presence at the finals showing much optical imprudence, Scott was at Davos 
last week, the Super Bowl for the rich, just as Wesfarmers was putting his name to a press release announcing that 
its perennial dog-of-a-business, Catch, would be wound down to zero. What better time to sink a cocktail and stuff 
your face with fondue - or shimmy around to a live performance by Duran Duran at the big Salesforce party, which 
Scott, hungry like the wolf, dutifully -attended.
Catch was acquired in 2019 for $230m, but apart from a growth spurt during the Covid-19 pandemic it's done 
nothing but tank hard and fast in the face of Amazon, Shein and Temu, the Chinese purveyor of cheap, breakable 
crap people are buying by the buttload.
Scott's eulogy of Catch to the ASX tried to smear out the bloodbath. Yes, the business sucked, and yes, our pet 
goose got the axe but, hey, Wesfarmers still gained "valuable insights and capabilities that have accelerated the 
group's digital transformation and supported the â€¦" We'll spare you the guff, you get the idea.
According to Wesfarmers' accounts, Catch shed $96m during the last financial year, and Scott told investors that 
winding it down would soak up another $60m in exit costs, bringing total losses for the business, or so we hear, to a 
ballpark figure of about half a billion dollars. Small change for some in Davos, but we doubt Scott was making any 
of this unpleasantness known while hoping to bump into someone high-status around the staircase of the Congress 
Centre.
It's obvious what Scott was hoping to gain from Davos. Doesn't every small pond CEO want to kick back in the end 
zone with Jamie Dimon and Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman? Doesn't everyone want to see Yo-Yo Ma get 
gently dusted with cloud-soft snow while performing Bach on a mountainside?
Page 2 of 3
Scott lives high life as Catch dies
Of course Scott didn't need to be there. Wesfarmers doesn't have a tonne of assets outside of Australia and New 
Zealand, and its forays into offshore markets have been absolute duds. Remember Bunnings UK and Ireland? Yet 
another dog, sold for a British pound by the time the shades were drawn. Woof.
Let's not even mention Wesfarmers' acquisition of a West Australian mining site, a most unprofitable venture given 
the current prices of lithium hydroxide. The commodity has crashed from highs of $US84,000 a tonne, in 2022, to 
as low as $US10,550 in October - and the numbers have barely eked upwards since.
Wesfarmers' response to our questions on this Davos caper was equally puzzling. All we wanted to know was how 
many company representatives attended with Scott and how much it all cost.
"Unfortunately, we are in a full media blackout in the lead-up to our half-year results in Feb, so we can't comment 
on your below request," a Wesfarmers spokesman said.
Sure, because the boss's attendance at the World Economic Forum has such a pivotal bearing on the company's 
earnings. Give us a break.
Game for a laugh A press release landed in our inbox on Thursday announcing the launch of Monopoly: Central 
Coast Edition, named in honour of the retiree haven of NSW nestled between Sydney and Newcastle (also known 
as God's Waiting Room).
This is where Anthony Albanese recently bought a $4.3m house atop a cliff in Copacabana, a suburb whose 
streets, we imagine, are a shot at being located at the Mayfair and Park Lane sector of the board, thanks to their 
glow-up from Albo's arrival. Woy Woy's less-salubrious Railway Street is shaping as a lock for the lesser-loved 
brown tiles of Whitechapel and Old Kent Road. They're the one just after "Go", where even a proud row of hotels 
won't even come close to winning you the game. Only an idiot buys up that real estate.
Besides, everyone knows the smarter money trains its eye on the yellow or green tiles closer to Free Parking, and 
we're guessing they'll be named after streets in Avoca Beach, where Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar bought a 
mansion two years ago, or perhaps Terrigal, where rich-lister Tony Denny listed a penthouse last year.
Of course, there'll still be a square stipulating a payment on Income Tax, with the usual fine of $200 expected. But 
in this edition we imagine the retiree players get a pass; instead they actually get money back from all their franking 
credits.
Hydrogen hope lost Another day, and another one of Andrew Forrest's hydrogen projects bites the dust.
News that Incitec Pivot has officially put the site of its mothballed Gibson Island ammonia plant on the market 
should finally put a tombstone on the project that was for years supposed to be Fortescue's flagship Australian 
green ammonia play.
Not that you'd know it from Fortescue's disclosures. The mining major put Gibson Island on the backburner 15 
months ago citing high electricity costs. Despite missing multiple deadlines for the financial close on the multibillion-
dollar project last year, Fortescue refused to admit that the horse was dead, telling the world it was still working to 
reduce costs.
Even when Incitec flagged plans to sell the Brisbane site in November, Fortescue would only say it remained 
committed to green hydrogen but energy costs in Australia are too high, and it would never commit to a project that 
wasn't commercially viable, etc etc.
And on Thursday the company still wasn't going any further, despite the sight of real estate agents spruiking the 
value of the land.
Pretty much everyone else involved has abandoned ship. Even the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which 
chipped in $13.7m of taxpayer cash into the $55m spent on feasibility studies. ARENA's website, as of this week, 
says the project was completed on December 18.Page 3 of 3
Scott lives high life as Catch dies
No mention of the project's presumed abandonment in Fortescue's most recent quarterly production report, 
although iron ore boss Dino Otranto promised analysts "a more comprehensive view" of the status of its green 
energy projects at Fortescue's half-year financial results in February last year.
Fortescue's own website still lists Gibson Island as a viable project, with commercial production planned for 2026.
Forrest himself was still banging the drum at Davos this month, telling Bloomberg he believes the dream is still 
alive, even after Fortescue sacked 700 people last year as it rationalised its energy and mining divisions.
"There is a new form of hydrogen, which will come onto the marketplace, which will be a lot cheaper," he said. 
"We're not yet in a position where I want to talk about it publicly." We can't wait to hear about it.

Forrest's Minderoo is sitting on billionsAndrew Forrest didn't become one of Australia's richest men, or make 
Fortescue one of its most valuable companies, by spending all his money.
But while he's been happy to enjoy the finer things in life since making his riches - private jets, yachts and luxury 
hotels abound - it seems his charity Minderoo is still taking a spendthrift approach.
The Minderoo Foundation's net assets jumped $500 million last financial year to $8.1 billion, its latest accounts 
show, largely funded by its surprise status as the biggest beneficiary of Twiggy and Nicola Forrest's divorce. 
Despite this, its "impact expenditure" (which is how Minderoo's bean counters phrase what money it hands out to 
the various good causes it supports) fell $20 million to $229 million.
Small change when you consider the 2024 financial year was its first full year of reaping the rewards of the $5 
billion in Fortescue shares it received as part of the former Forrest couple's divorce settlement.
At the time, the donation of shares was touted by this masthead as the biggest philanthropic gift in Australian 
history. But does it count as philanthropy if a charity, especially one owned by the donors - just banks the cash?
The accounts show the trust got a tidy $775 million in Fortescue dividends for the year despite the iron ore price's 
freefall. Add in a surplus of $537 million, and you'd be forgiven for thinking Minderoo might have loosened its purse 
strings a little.
But the charity has been in simplification mode since the split. Its corporate wages bill was down more than $2 
million for the financial year after it cut about a third of its workforce last April. We hear several future projects are 
also n the works. It's trying to do fewer things, but do them better. A familiar mantra for Fortescue's recently 
jobless, too.
Giles adds to her
bulging workload
Page 2 of 3
REAR WINDOW Forrest's Minderoo is sitting on billions
At the apex of the nation's professional fixers is there ever a lack of demand for services rendered by lawyer 
Rebekah Giles? She and a handful of others (including Melbourne's Leon Zwier) are on speed dial from corporates, 
celebs and corporate celebs who need reputation help, or a rapid defamation notice drafted.
Take Taylor Auerbach, the steak-and-cocaine TV producer who went nuclear on the Seven network and rapist 
Bruce Lehrmann at a key moment in the latter's defamation trial last year. Barrister Sue Chrysanthou was already 
representing former Ten presenter Lisa Wilkinson in her defence against Lehrmann, so it fell to Giles to front Justice 
Michael Lee on behalf of Auerbach. Less than 24 hours after the infamous Lehrmann judgment, Giles followed it up 
by negotiating a large defamation settlement for Jewish student Ben Cohen from Seven after the network 
misidentified him as being behind the Bondi Westfield attack.
Point is, she always seems busy, which is why her recent addition to an arcane racing position seems strange. Last 
month, Giles was appointed to the board of Racingcorp Pty Ltd.
Racingcorp was established after the privitisation of Tabcorp in the 1990s, and operates as the gathering place for 
racing bigwigs to negotiate for their slice of gambling revenues. The corporate entity's other directors include 
Racing NSW chief executive Peter V'landys, chairwoman Saranne Cooke, Australian Turf Club chairman Peter 
McGauran and Harness Racing NSW chief executive Peter Buckman.
Giles was added to the Racingcorp board because she's also the deputy chair of Greyhounds NSW. Not for us to 
question whether she has a secret love for the dish lickers, but Giles has been on the sport's board since 2019. The 
peak organisation is mired in a full-scale inquiry into the sport's welfare and integrity. There's no better hired gun 
than Giles at a time like this.
Racingcorp is in effect a holdover corporate entity that we're told rarely meets because the separate racing bodies 
do their own negotiating direct with Tabcorp. So while Giles' addition might be a formality, it does signal her 
importance to Greyhounds NSW in matters like its commercial talks. The organisation collected $31 million in Tab 
revenues in 2024 - its second-largest source of income.
And like a short-priced bolter at Wenty Park, Giles has form. In November, she strode out of the Fair Work 
Commission alongside Adam Rytenskild, the recently ousted CEO of Tabcorp. Rytenskild got a green light to sue 
his former employer, which he argued left him no choice but to resign over a disputed vulgar remark he made 
earlier in the year. It was Rytenskild's swift exit that led to former AFL chief Gil McLachlan's coronation at the ASX-
listed company.
Rytenskild became Tabcorp CEO in 2022 after an audacious (failed) bid from Matthew Tripp's Betmakers to take 
over the company. Around the same time Betmakers added Giles to its board. As we've noted before, Betmakers 
doesn't deal with Tabcorp directly, but it does make betting tech for its online gambling rivals. That is, Giles is 
representing a star client suing Tabcorp, she sits on a board that helps companies take market share from Tabcorp, 
and is now the figurehead of a sport that negotiates revenue from Tabcorp.
NIMBY or YIMBY? Charlton's identity crisis
Whether getting called a NIMBY or a YIMBY is an insult or a badge of pride depends on what circles one moves in. 
How confusing for federal Parramatta MP Andrew Charlton, then, that voters are calling him both.
The former Accenture executive, who is touted as a future Labor leader, is sticking his neck out to oppose 
development plans for 2500 new homes in North Parramatta. He's even launched a petition.
The (Labor) state government thinks the development will help enable a plan for 12,000 more jobs along Sydney's 
favourite new toy, the light rail, and a new Sydney University campus that will support Westmead Hospital. All good 
things, you'd think.
Not to Charlton and others. He's worried it will jeopardise a world heritage application - it's already got a national 
one - for the Female Factory, an 1818 prison, workhouse and hospital for unmarried female convicts in Sydney.Page 3 of 3
REAR WINDOW Forrest's Minderoo is sitting on billions
Cue the YIMBY frenzy online. It's whiplash for Charlton, who is usually painted as positively socialist in terms of 
housing development plans by the Liberal Party and its supporters.
No wonder, amid a flurry of social media posts on the issue in recent weeks, he declared on LinkedIn: "I'm no 
YIMBY or NIMBY".
We aren't arguing against the worthiness of heritage listings - as Charlton says, you can "build Parramatta's future 
while preserving its past". He also has a fairly strong track record on housing - his seat boasts the No.1 local 
council in NSW for new housing approvals, and he's backed projects to build around 20,000 new homes. Just 
somewhere else.
After all, he knows better than most the perks of cracking the property market. He moved from a $16 million 
Bellevue Hill house to a four-bedder in North Parramatta when he dropped into the seat, then added an apartment 
(just the sub-penthouse - he's a man of the people) to his $4 million western Sydney property portfolio when he 
couldn't renovate as planned. He also dropped a cool $12 million on a Palm Beach home last March.
But opposing more housing is an interesting move from an MP who was accused of not understanding western 
Sydney when he was parachuted from the eastern suburbs into his safe Labor seat. Some locals are keen for the 
heritage application to be prioritised, but for many, the housing and cost of living are most in front of mind.
The powers that be in Canberra know this. Last week, Albo swung by Parramatta with Charlton to spruik new 
transport infrastructure funding. The goal? More housing in the west!
Charlton is happy to compromise. He says he will be satisfied with just "pressing pause" on the rezoning until 
UNESCO makes its decision on the heritage application.
Or he's happy for it to go ahead now, just 200 metres down the road - but the bureaucrats at Macquarie Street don't 
like that.
That deadline is in 2029. There are two federal and one state election before then.

Industrial relations Changes to laws have revived the prospect of unions in 'the engine room' of the economy, write 
Mark Wembridge and Tom Rabe.
The blazing January sun is still below the yardarm as a lingerie-clad barmaid serves $11.50 pints of icy Great 
Northern lager to three fly in, fly out workers at the Redcliffe Tavern, a nondescript bar near Perth airport.
Shifting their gaze from the $20 notes tucked into various lacy straps, the FIFO workers turn to another burning 
issue that has been out of mind for more than three decades: unions in Western Australia's Pilbara.
Eager to down a few beers after their eight day "swing" at BHP's iron ore operations in Newman, Charlie, Jack and 
Cody say they have been "watching and waiting" to see how Pilbara negotiations between unions and the big 
miners unfold.
"A union will mean there's a standard for everyone. No differences between what is happening on one site 
compared to another," says Cody, an Indigenous man who has worked as a FIFO mine operator of excavators, 
loaders and bulldozers for more than a dozen years. "I've got mates at FMG, at Rio [Tinto], and they're all thinking 
the same."
Jack, a 25-year mining veteran with tattoos up to his chin who says FIFO work has cost him three long-term 
relationships, nods in agreement. "An EBA [enterprise bargaining agreement] is the big one," he says. "Because 
that's the one at the moment where a lot of companies are just walking over people. They've got no representation."
Changes to industrial relations laws have revived the prospect of re-unionisation in a region dubbed "the engine 
room" of Australia's economy, nearly four decades after the infamous Robe River brawl in effect eliminated 
organised labour in the Pilbara.
Mining companies, conservative politicians and corporate lobbyists say unionisation will return the Pilbara to its 
unproductive and strike-prone past, undermining tax revenue and driving investment abroad.

FIFO workers mull unions' return in Pilbara
Unions want to represent staff who work long hours on variable rosters, face workplace safety concerns and 
incidents of sexual harassment, lack widespread enterprise bargaining agreements and endure long periods away 
from their families.
But unionisation in mining is thin. Union members comprised 10 per cent of Australia's mining workforce in 2022, 
down from 16.5 per cent in 2016, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Union membership on Australian 
mine sites was 44 per cent in 1994.
"In the mining industry in Australia over the past 25 years, productivity has moved sideways as wages have 
doubled," says Mike Henry, chief executive of BHP, one of the Pilbara's biggest employers. "That is not a route to 
remain competitive, and this industry has to remain competitive globally under the 'same job, same pay' policies."
The Pilbara's wealth has supercharged the fortunes of billionaires such as Gina Rinehart and Andrew Forrest, as 
well as feathered the superannuation nests of millions of Australians.
"At a time when everyone recognises that we've got a cost-of-living crisis, who is making the most noise [about 
industrial relations changes]? Companies earning $20 billion a year," says Paul Farrow, national secretary of the 
Australian Workers' Union.
The dispute was sparked by the Albanese government's laws, part of the "secure jobs, better pay" workplace 
reforms introduced in 2022, that have eased union access to mine worksites.
The laws mean unions must no longer demonstrate that the majority of the workforce supports collective 
bargaining, as long as an existing agreement is within five years of expiration. Before those changes, unions had to 
establish that they represented most workers before employers were obliged to negotiate.
This change enabled the AWU to drag BHP to the bargaining table to negotiate wages and conditions.
"In the Pilbara, we've got a bizarre situation whereby we're being compelled by law to bargain with the union when 
neither the company nor employees have sought that. That's the bizarreness of it," says Geraldine Slattery, BHP's 
country boss in Australia.
The Western Mine Workers Alliance wishlist presented to BHP includes a $10,000 annual bonus per employee, 
annual pay rises of 5 per cent or WA's consumer price index plus 1 per cent, and uniform conditions and 
entitlements across all BHP iron ore mine sites. Based on the company's 14,000-strong iron ore workforce, the 
retention bonus alone could cost BHP $140 million a year.
The Mining Council of Australia, the industry's peak lobbying body, says the laws "open the door to industry-wide 
'bargaining' and industry-wide strikes - and a return to 1970s-style industrial confrontation and disruption".
"There is not a single element of these measures that will either enhance productivity or co-operation in workplaces. 
They are all doing the opposite."
The industry group says the laws give unions "more coercive powers, including the increased right of entry powers, 
with deliberate loopholes that facilitate their abuse; the ability to force businesses and workers into bargaining with 
no worker support; vastly expanded powers for union delegates, even in non-union workplaces.
"This scenario is only the beginning. Hundreds of companies, in a broad range of sectors, could soon be hit with 
similar claims in this race to control workforces."
Unions dismiss criticism of the laws as fearmongering and cite the need to more fairly distribute the immense 
wealth generated from one of the country's most profitable industries.
"We've heard [miners] saying the sky is going to fall in with these laws. They have been in place for quite some time 
now ... and nothing's changed," says Farrow. "[Mining companies] are still making billions of dollars of profit, and 
workers are still in the same situation."Page 3 of 5

One big miner says it has been forced to hire staff to chauffeur union officials between mine sites to facilitate their 
membership drive.
Michaelia Cash, federal opposition leader in the Senate and opposition spokeswoman on workplace relations, says 
the Albanese government has betrayed the mining sector, after initially promising that its IR reforms would not 
extend into the Pilbara.
"In all the conversations I have had with miners over here, they've been clear that the industrial relations legislation 
has been set up to lower productivity and efficiency," she says, adding that a union push into the region will damage 
the economy.
The foundations of Australia's prosperity can arguably be traced to the 1986-87 Robe River industrial brawl. Former 
WA premier Brian Burke had a front-row seat to the now infamous row, a conflict he says escalated almost 
overnight and was inflamed by obstinacy on both sides.
"Robe River, that was the start, the origin, the foundation of everything," he says. "It was high noon with people 10 
paces apart wearing guns."
Reflecting on what some describe as the Pilbara's "reformation", Burke says the conduct and approach of Robe 
River boss Charles Copeman and the unionists opposing him meant sensible negotiations were never an option.
"Copeman was like Tony Abbott on steroids, not just a conservative, but someone who was almost physically wired 
that way," he says. "He was completely intractable, and so the unions adopted an equal and opposite force. They 
became completely intractable."
Burke, who fell from grace after being jailed for fraud, said Copeman's approach was "detached from reality", but 
his elimination of unions from the Pilbara occurred because "the conditions for working people in the Pilbara were 
so good that the need for unions ceased to be in the front of their mind".
The bulk of iron ore royalties are generated from the largely union-free mines in the Pilbara of Rio Tinto and BHP. 
Fortescue, Roy Hill and Mineral Resources also mine the steel-making ingredient in the region.
The industry creates enormous personal fortunes:the Forrests last year took home $2.2 billion in dividends from 
Fortescue, while Rinehart pocketed $2.8 billion largely through her company Hancock Prospecting's stake in Roy 
Hill.
However, the industry is slowing. WA has forecast iron ore royalties to shrink by one-third, or $3.5 billion, in 2024-
25, as prices wobble.
Westpac warned that iron ore prices could collapse 30 per cent this year to about $US70 a tonne when Rio floods 
the market with supply from its burgeoning Simandou mine in Guinea. Recent monsoon-like rains have also 
inundated the region and flooded infrastructure, slowing exports.
Simon Trott, Rio Tinto's iron ore boss, says "productivity should be the central theme of any reform" of IR laws. 
"Productivity drives jobs and wage growth, it encourages new investment and boosts the Australian economy. 
These reforms will become a handbrake on the economy over the long term and put Australia on a path to lower 
living standards and lower wage growth," he adds.
The warning of lower productivity comes as Treasurer Jim Chalmers singled out the private sector to pull Australia 
out of a tailspin, after the economy eked out a weaker-than-expected gain of 0.3 per cent last quarter.
The battle between the federal Labor government and industry echoes the fight over the Minerals Resource Rent 
Tax imposed in 2010 and revoked three years later following a bitter campaign.
Labor may have lost that fight, but it is digging its heels in on this battle, despite the potential for alienating voters 
ahead of state and federal elections, where WA seats will play a pivotal role.Page 4 of 5
FIFO workers mull unions' return in Pilbara
Federal Resources Minister Madeleine King dismisses criticisms of the government's IR reforms from miners as 
"hysteria".
While opponents to enterprise bargaining point to the high wages and low union density as a sign of a content 
Pilbara workforce, FIFO workers have told The Australian Financial Review that their wish to see unions in the 
Pilbara was mostly due to the desire to see equal conditions across the industry.
Unfriendly rostering, unpaid travel time at some mines, workplace safety concerns, and variable pay and conditions 
among colleagues are all sources of contention. "If we are talking sacrifice in mining ... I have missed a total of five 
Christmases with my family, it's just how my roster has been rolled out," says FIFO worker Cheryl.
She predicts membership will swell if unions prove they can negotiate a deal with a major miner.
"People fear the ramifications. There is not much fight in the mining workers lately because of the cost-of-living 
crisis. Men and women go to work to make ends meet," Cheryl says.
After six years working FIFO in Pilbara mines, Ryan has seen his salary grow from $80,000 as a graduate engineer 
to more than $250,000 as a construction manager. However, his hefty pay does not erase his feelings of isolation 
nor compensate for spending long periods away from his young family.
"People [in Perth] start to forget about you. You stop getting included in plans - not on purpose, but just because 
you're not around. It's taxing and can be quite isolating. When I started six years ago, I was doing four weeks on, 
one week off," he says.
Cheryl and Ryan say unions have a role to play in the Pilbara by advocating for better conditions.
Ryan agrees that organised labour could find fertile ground in the Pilbara.
"Unions have their place. It would be better for workers as a whole to have them [in the Pilbara], but it certainly 
would probably make work harder for me [as a manager]," he says. "Unionisation is common in metro construction 
sites, but not in mining. People float between those industries all the time. I can see people definitely thinking that it 
would be a good thing to join [a union]."
Cheryl agrees that some FIFO colleagues struggle with the isolation. "Where I work there is no such support for 
getting women back into a flexible roster after she has come off maternity leave. I have seen women struggle and 
relationships deteriorate because of it."
Although some miners have extolled their efforts to increase female staff numbers, the likes of Macmahon - an 
ASX-listed mining contractor that has nearly 10,000 staff - does not offer any paid parental leave.
The pressure to increase wages, conditions and benefits comes at a time of heightened global competition for iron 
ore producers, with the likes of Rio's Simandou poised to take market share and siphon away investment.
"Our engine room, the huge contributor to our country, Australia's mining industry, faces higher regulatory burdens 
and bureaucratic risk and expense," says Australia's richest person, Rinehart, whose $40 billion fortune was built on 
the Pilbara's iron ore.
"Australia's increasing government intervention combined with ideological and expensive or impractical policies is 
negatively effecting new mining investment. Reduced investment will lead to lower living standards."
Employment and Workplace Relations Minister Murray Watt downplays miners' concerns about the laws, saying 
"the facts just don't back them up".
"On every measure, the WA economy is performing strongly, so I find it difficult to see how our industrial relations 
changes have been hurting the mining industry or the WA economy," Watt says. "We want mining companies to do 
well, but we also want mining workers to do well. It's their hard work that delivers the profits for these companies."Page 5 of 5
FIFO workers mull unions' return in Pilbara
While the five-year expiration requirement has forced BHP to negotiate with unions, other miners have - at least so 
far - avoided talks.
Unlike BHP, Rio is not compelled to negotiate with unions because its enterprise agreements expired before 2019. 
Fortescue has not struck a collective agreement in more than a decade. MinRes declined to comment.
Forrest says Fortescue has a "freedom culture" whereby staff can come directly to management to raise their 
concerns, and that employees admire him too much to unionise.
Bran Black, Business Council of Australia chief executive, describes the Pilbara as "the engine room of our 
economy" and says unionisation of the region "will hurt all Australians".
"The region's contribution is immense, providing economic prosperity and higher living standards for every 
Australian, and we cannot allow unions to override this for their own selfish purposes," he adds.
However, the AWU's Brad Gandy, who is WA state secretary, says the pace at which an industrial wave is 
sweeping across the Pilbara has surprised many.
Re-unionisation of the Pilbara will not mean a return to the 1980s, he adds. "If you look back at the tactics that the 
companies used in the 1980s, that wouldn't work again. I think both parties have a responsibility in either going 
back to the '80s or staying in 2024 and saying, 'How can we work together?"'
However, Burke says the high salaries, paired with a fragmented and dispersed FIFO workforce, will prove too 
much of a challenge for unions to overcome in the Pilbara.
"When people in the Pilbara are earning $190,000 a year for sitting on their backside in an airconditioned truck and 
driving 200 metres there, then 200 metres back, they don't see the need for a union, do they?"
"I think it's akin to throwing seed on stones. It won't grow."AFR

Fortescue executive chairman Andrew Forrest says a culture of freedom and camaraderie at the iron ore miner 
means staff are unlikely to unionise, as the Albanese government's workplace reforms deal unions back into the 
nation's most lucrative export industry for the first time in decades.
Big miners such as BHP and Rio Tinto are concerned the reforms, which allow unions to lead wage negotiations 
even if they cannot prove their members represent the majority of the workforce, will stoke industrial action in the 
Pilbara iron ore region and threaten an industry that is forecast to ship $107 billion worth of ore this year.
But the nation's third-biggest iron ore exporter, Perth-based Fortescue, struck a confident tone.
Dr Forrest said Fortescue's structure allowed staff direct access to him or senior managers, eliminating the need 
for union advocates. "The troops know they can come to me directly. They do, and I love it," he said, when asked 
by The Australian Financial Review whether it would welcome unions onto its Pilbara mine sites.
"If unions want to come in, they are completely welcome. [But] is there a job for unions to come and speak to me 
about the troops? No, they can come and speak to me directly. We stay really close because we love our people.
"You don't get workers running up to leaders wanting selfies and heart-to-hearts [at other mining companies], but 
that's stock-standard here."
Most Pilbara worksites became largely union-free in the 1980s, after years of militant industrial action and rolling 
strikes provoked a stand-off with intransigent management that in effect eliminated collective bargaining.
Union members comprised 10 per cent of the mining workforce in 2022, down from 16.5 per cent in 2016, according 
to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Three decades ago, union membership on mine sites was 44 per cent.
While union membership remains strong at mines where the workforce lives nearby, such as Queensland's 
coalfields, unions have struggled to get a foothold in the Pilbara, where the vast majority of workers fly in and out. 
Under the Albanese government's "Secure Jobs, Better Pay" workplace reforms, unions are not required to

Fortescue heart-to-hearts make unionisation redundant: Forrest
demonstrate that the majority of the workforce supports collective bargaining, as long as an agreement is within five 
years of expiration.
This has enabled unions to bring BHP to the bargaining table to negotiate wages and conditions.
The Western Mine Workers Alliance has presented BHP with a list of demands that include a $10,000 annual 
retention bonus per employee, annual pay rises and uniform conditions and entitlements across sites.
Other producers in the region - Rio Tinto, Fortescue, Roy Hill and Mineral Resources - fear that unionisation will 
spread to their mines and eat into their margins.
Iron ore mining in the Pilbara has fuelled the wealth of billionaires such as Dr Forrest and Gina Rinehart, the 
country's richest person. Unlike BHP, Rio is not compelled to negotiate with unions because its enterprise 
agreements expired before 2019, while Fortescue has not struck a collective agreement in more than a decade.
The Minerals Council of Australia has warned that the laws could "open the door to industry-wide 'bargaining' and 
industry-wide strikes - and a return to 1970s-style industrial confrontation and disruption".
Dr Forrest said unions were vital to some workplaces, but their services were redundant at Fortescue.
"Unions have a serious role when there is a breakdown between troops and managers, but there is strong 
camaraderie here. The troops come straight to people like me. We have no issue with unions, but the troops decide 
for themselves," he said.

Business figures and lobbyists filed down Melbourne's Bourke Street last week for a closed-door fundraiser with Jim 
Chalmers. It was at SEC Newgate's office and billed as a private dinner with the federal treasurer, with proceeds 
flowing to Victorian Labor.
Before the event, Responsible Wagering Australia's Kai Cantwell got a call telling him he wouldn't be allowed in the 
room despite paying for a ticket.
Sure, Cantwell is a former Nationals adviser (and his boss is Liberal greybeard Nick Minchin) but lobbyists across 
the party divide attend these cash-for-access do's. That's what the money is for.
Could it be because the RWA's key client is Sportsbet, the foreign-owned bookmaking giant sweating the most on 
mooted changes to gambling advertising laws?
To be blackballed from one event might be seen as unlucky. But word's gotten out among gossip-hungry lobbyists 
the RWA has been shut out of several Federal Labor Business Forum events. One featuring Prime Minister 
Anthony Albanese, another starring Communications Minister Michelle Rowland.
How both parties run their business forums is a galling exercise in regulatory runaround. Annual disclosures 
released this week plainly show the individuals like billionaire Anthony Pratt who stump up large party donations.
But business donations through annual subscriptions to the forums are kept fuzzy. Millions of dollars in cash 
dumped into a washing machine. It's up to journalists to piece together exactly who is forking over the suitcases 
that give them privileged access to the country's elected officials.
RWA is a paid subscriber of Labor's forum. Those subscribers usually pay something like $60,000 annually, and in 
return get a wad of tickets to budget night and passes to other talkfests. That's a fair wedge, to not be getting 
anything for it.
One possible reason for its exclusion is that, given the government is apparently at the pointy end of developing its 
bookmaker ad ban policy, it would be inappropriate for RWA to be in the room.
Page 2 of 3
REAR WINDOW Chalmers, Labor leave bookmaking giant in cold
And that sounds well and nice, but what of all the other blue-chip companies whose commercial futures are 
influenced by any pending government policy? Do you reckon Resources Minister Madeleine King is being shielded 
from BHP and Rio's lobbyist operations? Does Chalmers have the discipline to screen late-night calls from CBA's 
Matt Comyn? Of course not.
Perhaps they have wised up to the not-a-good-look factor of going off-record with bookmakers.
In 2023, this masthead revealed the RWA (then on behalf of Sportsbet and Entain) picked up the tab for a private 
steak dinner for Rowland the year prior. This was later excused as a "policy briefing", which coincidentally fell on 
her birthday. She faced calls to resign.
In 2022, Sportsbet also footed a $8960 bill for a dinner to support Rowland's election campaign at Rockpool. She 
was then the shadow minister in charge of online betting. The Minister for Sportsbet tag has stuck.
Any wonder Labor is running around blacklisting the bookmakers. If it is serious, it can give the subscription money 
back.
Tech visa lobby foots bill for Bragg's bash
Liberal senator Andrew Bragg's 2023 Christmas party was a glitzy affair, sponsored by Sydney's billionaire party 
king Justin Hemmes. It had the venue (not disclosed), drinks and canapes you'd expect of a Merivale shindig.
His 2024 Christmas bash was a less glamorous affair, according to Bragg. The venue (not disclosed, again) was 
somewhere in Barangaroo and the senator's parliamentary disclosures show the sponsor was the Australian 
Computer Society.
Who doesn't want to talk about IT over an eggnog margarita?
Given the ACS's financial stake in several policies that could become key election issues, footing the bill for a 
Christmas party for Liberal Party operatives may prove a smart investment.
The organisation pitches itself as a "leading professional association representing Australia's technology 
community, across industry, government and education". It has nearly 50,000 members and releases reports on 
professional skills and trends.
But it is also an accredited provider of skilled migrant assessments for IT professionals hoping to move to Australia.
Another revenue stream is its "ACS Professional Year", which it pitches as "a job-readiness program that bridges 
the gap between full-time study and employment in Australia's tech sector". Graduates can claim an additional five 
points towards visa applications.
If only there was an event where the ACS could speak to politicians about the important issues of skilled migration 
and international student caps in the lead-up to Christmas ...
On the ACS front, a spokesman says the party was "part of our regular government relations outreach program". It 
spreads its Christmas cheer without partisanship too: "We do it with politicians from all parties and the 
independents as well," he says.
From Bragg's end, he says he was just keen to celebrate Christmas in Sydney as, in his view, the city's Lord Mayor 
Clover Moore had tried to shut it down. "Clover Moore hates Christmas, I love Christmas," he says. "I think it's good 
to celebrate, and I'm grateful to the ACS for putting on a nice event where I can thank my long-suffering 
supporters."
At Fortescue, you really can ask anythingPage 3 of 3
REAR WINDOW Chalmers, Labor leave bookmaking giant in cold
All-staff meetings are fertile ground for workplace drama, especially when the floor is opened for questions to 
management. Never one to back down from a fight, Andrew Forrest's Fortescue has instituted a permanent "Ask 
Us Anything" portal.
Rank-and-file staff post anonymous questions to management, which are then posted in a public forum. They can 
be "liked", with the most popular then answered in a weekly meeting. It also includes any written responses from 
the bosses.
Unsurprisingly, some silliness has ensued. In one post, an employee asks for an in-house lottery; 81 staffers back 
the request, which bears a striking resemblance to Gina Rinehart's in-house loyalty program. "For each year with 
FMG, can we be given a token that is placed into a barrel and have ten tokens drawn out yearly with the winners 
get [sic] 100k prize," the Fortescue workers asked.
Given Twiggy is convinced Rinehart has spent her life copying his ideas, we don't reckon there is much chance he 
will return the favour by replicating her annual Christmas cash giveaway, in which random staff members are gifted 
$100,000.
Other requests included table tennis and a pool for FMG's new corporate digs on St Georges Terrace in Perth. 
"Would be lovely to have a quick dip during breaks or after a hard day's work," one staffer said.
"Can males wear formal shorts to the office on hot summer days please?" was another plea. Some decorum, 
please!
The raffle may not be flying, but other FMG "troops", as Twiggy calls them, have had more luck in getting action 
from managers. Some correspondents used it to complain that FMG's recent austerity drive had robbed them of 
biscuits and fruit in staff kitchenettes, and tampons in the toilets. The tampon question was especially popular, with 
184 likes.
A Fortescue spokesman assured us that those essentials were on the way back, with an alternating roster between 
fruit and biscuits. Tampon dispensers are also in the works.
Some of the questions have a lot more edge. A common theme in many submissions has been frustration at 
Fortescue's diversity policies. The company has been an industry leader in improving diversity within its workforce 
and is one of the few ASX20 companies to publicly stand by its approach since Donald Trump's anti-inclusion push.
Yet many of the questions posed on the Ask Us Anything portal suggested that women and ethnic minorities were 
winning promotions undeservedly. Those questions have upset some staff.

Fortescue asked, and boy did its executives receive.
The mining group led by Andrew Forrest has engaged in a cute little exercise with its workforce that it's calling "Ask 
Us Anything", in which employees can post anonymous questions to the leadership while even more employees - 
or even leaders themselves - can submit nameless replies. Well, actually, not all of them are nameless; the bland 
responses, the most banal and corporate, come with a name. But rest assured, this lark is completely consuming 
everyone at the organisation.
It's Frank Costanza's airing of grievances but on an enormous scale, a Festivus ritual open to more than 20,000 
participants across the Forrest empire.
There's snark, there's banter. There's outrage over a tampon and sanitary pad dispenser that's gone missing from a 
bathroom.
There's righteous indignation over women who can swish around the office in skirts during the summer while poor, 
suffering dudes have to wilt in their neckties and suit jackets.
"Biscuits â€¦.. We want biscuits in all kitchens â€¦. Nothing better than a cuppa and a biccy," said one employee, 
receiving 37 upvotes from their peers. Meanwhile, someone's idea for a masala chai machine in the kitchenette 
received only four upvotes. Philistines.
What better window into a company's culture?
Fortescue CEO Dino Otranto addressed the most pressing questions at a recent "team huddle", although it's hard 
to tell whether he took this all seriously. Otranto prefaced one response by saying, "this is probably the politically 
correct answer I need to give", and then he told everyone that he likes to sit back and brace himself for the 
questions "with a nice bottle of scotch".
No shade on knocking back a dram of whisky, which Dino can happily afford with his $1.75m salary (not including 
performance rights, themselves worth a few dinero) but what of the Fortescue underclass? They're getting punted

because of Forrest's failing green energy vision. Remember the secret membrane, or the magic beans of green 
hydrogen? So much heat, yet so little light. Pretty soon we'll get an announcement of major advancements out of 
Fortescue HQ. Their newest secret weapon? Eye of newt.
Some 700 employees were let go in July, supposedly to lean up the business and not at all because of this flunking, 
expensive project that's subsidised by the long-suffering shareholders of Fortescue's actual rainmaking business: 
mining. "Most of us can't afford a nice bottle of scotch," one staffer said.
Otranto's "huddle" mustn't have gone down a treat, which explains why chief operating officer Shelley Robertson, 
poached from the dum-dums at MinRes, fronted the second town hall instead to answer questions, one of which 
concerned Fortescue's very cluttered organisational chart.
"Can someone explain the org structure? We have CEOs reporting to CEOs, directors to directors, and varying 
titles, despite being told it would be 'flattened'." Now who might have asked that except for someone clearly trying to 
Marie Kondo the place? Looking at you, Otranto.
Some insight, as well, into the workforce hardships that have followed the screw-tightening of July.
"Why is the budget so tight at the minute? Are we expected to deliver world class service on a shoestring budget? 
Recruitment restrictions are leaving departments short and the people picking up the slack are getting burned out," 
said one aggrieved Fortescue worker. Another sarcastically wrote: "Is there an opportunity in the future to expand 
on the CEO for a day initiative and participate if you are not a First Nations -employee?" And then this from a 
person who clearly hasn't kept an eye on iron ore prices: "Instead of a Christmas party, can you give each 
department $150 per person to hold their own team party?" A popular idea with 211 upvotes, but hopelessly 
unrealistic, to be sure. Reminder: it's Fortescue, people, not Hancock. Don't hold your breath for a cash giveaway.
A spokeswoman said the whole point of the exercise was to promote transparent communication within the 
organisation.
"This is just one avenue we are using to ensure our staff can continue to engage and interact with the leadership 
team, getting answers to the topics that matter the most to our people," which apparently doesn't go much higher 
than biscuits and air conditioning.
Donations dry up Good retail politics, or a fundraising own goal?
The outrage over PwC's tax leaks scandal generated plenty of headlines for both major parties but their backroom 
operators might be ruing the point scoring as they tally up their respective election war chests. Not that many 
people outside of the party backrooms will be crying, but those inside the tent might be another victim of the PwC 
scandal.
The Australian Electoral Commission's annual release of political donation data suggests the major parties' coffers 
have been left with a $700,000 black hole after the "big four" firms - PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY - dramatically 
pulled back their support last financial year.
They collectively donated almost $1m to both major parties in 2022-23 before revelations emerged that PwC used 
its position inside the tax office tent to enrich itself and its clients, at the (probable) expense of taxpayers.
However, after politicians turned the screws on the bastardry, most of the firms shied away from making political 
donations.
PwC coughed up $369,973 to the major political parties in 2022-23, but didn't make any political donations in 2023-
24 after banning them entirely. KPMG donated just $22,631, which was down 83 per cent on the previous year, 
while Deloitte donated $47,497 - down 73 per cent.
Only EY is an outlier, seemingly unaffected by the scandal. EY donated $180,172 in 2023-24, which was slightly 
down on the $227,853 it donated the previous year.Page 3 of 3
Some home truths for Fortescue
All up, donations to the major parties from the big four in 2023-24 were down more than 73 per cent, which was a 
bit of a blow to the coffers of the major parties.
Another oddity stands out among the financial services sector, after banking major ANZ pulled its donations to the 
major parties. The bank kicked in $90,000 to the major parties in 2022-23 but made only a single donation of $5500 
this current disclosure round.
Curiously enough, that was to the Nationals, traditionally the party of bashing the banks.
The donation appears to have been made just a few months after the bank appeared at a hearing as part of 
Nationals senator Matt Canavan's inquiry into branch closures in regional Australia. Purely a coincidence, no doubt.
Of course, the AEC disclosures don't tell the whole story; notoriously so. Only direct donations are recorded under 
the giver's name. Left off the disclosures are the names behind the millions of dollars raked in through business 
forums run by the major parties, which have annual membership rates of $30,000 to $120,000 and run dozens and 
dozens of breakfasts, lunches, dinners (and even the odd afternoon tea) to give access to ministers and their 
shadow counterparts for those able and prepared to pay. Margin Call would be shocked if the big four (banks or 
accounting firms) weren't booking in for the odd spot of lunch with a minister or three during the year, but you won't 
know it from the AEC disclosure list.

Fortescue's billionaire chairman Andrew Forrest blasted his executives about their plans to acquire a coal-to-
hydrogen project, describing it as "the most stupid" deal he had seen in a long time in private messages that have 
come to light through litigation in the United States.
In 2022, Fortescue worked with Kid Shelleen, billionaire Paul Tudor Jones' flagship investment vehicle, on a joint 
bid for gas-fired power stations in Texas and coal plants in Ohio and West Virginia. The companies wanted to 
convert the plans to produce clean-burning hydrogen fuel. The relationship soured late in the year, with Fortescue 
lodging an unsuccessful unilateral takeover bid for the assets, refusing to pay due diligence costs accrued by Kid 
Shelleen and its advisors.
Mr Tudor Jones' company is now suing Fortescue for $US6.25 million ($9.95 million) compensation. Fortescue, 
which has dramatically scaled back its intentions to become a hydrogen giant, has been forced to hand over 
internal documents, emails and messages during the litigation process.
Among those messages is a July 2022 missive from Dr Forrest to Fortescue executives in which he describes the 
plans to buy the assets in Ohio and West Virginia as "at least the most stupid deal I have seen for a long while."
The bid with Kid Shelleen had been devised and led by Fortescue's then-chief commercial officer David Hunt, and 
the then-president of Fortescue's North American clean energy unit, Paul Browning. In another message sent on 
WhatsApp, Dr Forrest said the proposal "in itself makes me wonder deeply about the commercial nous of Paul 
Browning".
The comments were made near the peak of Fortescue's interest in green hydrogen, when the company was 
promising to produce 15 million tonnes of the commodity by 2030. Fortescue has since acknowledged it will not 
achieve that goal given the slow adoption of hydrogen around the world, but continues to develop a hydrogen 
project in Arizona and much smaller trial-scale hydrogen projects in Western Australia and Queensland. Kid 
Shelleen told the court that Fortescue's attitude towards the bid appeared to change around July 2022, the same 
month as Dr Forrest's messages.

Forrest blasts executives over 'most stupid' deal
Mr Browning and Mr Hunt exited Fortescue in August 2022.
Kid Shelleen claims it was told by Mr Hunt in late August that Fortescue would make a solo bid for the assets, 
rather than continue with the joint bid.
Kid Shelleen claims that Mr Hunt offered to pay for the due diligence costs. Fortescue disputes that such a verbal 
promise was made, and says it would not be legally binding even if it were made.
Mr Browning was replaced as Fortescue's top clean energy executive in North America by former AGL Energy 
chief executive Andy Vesey, who also gave testimony to the court shortly before Christmas.
Most of Mr Vesey's testimony is inaccessible to the public. However, a snippet made available by the Connecticut 
court shows Mr Vesey carried a second phone with him in case he lost his primary device.
Fortescue has declined to submit messages from that second phone to the court, arguing instead that they are 
identical to those on his primary device.
Kid Shelleen has disputed that claim, saying that while messages may be mirrored, the two phones have different 
WhatsApp messaging accounts.
Kid Shelleen has asked for Dr Forrest and Fortescue energy boss Mark Hutchinson to also give testimony, 
although this has not yet occurred.

The miner and the bank are helping First Nations companies to thrive
Fortescue has partnered with NAB to unlock capital for First Nations businesses in Western Australia, reinforcing 
what the company describes as its "strong commitment to driving sustainable communities".
Under the partnership, eligible First Nations businesses will be able to access the necessary capital to fulfil 
contracts with Fortescue, building on the success of Fortescue's existing collaboration with ANZ which provides 
similar financial support.
The first company to benefit from the loan guarantee NAB initiative is KingKira Group, a 100 per cent First Nations-
owned business that provides vital services to the mining industry in Western Australia, including Fortescue. King 
Kira Group founder and managing director Tammy O'Connor says the loans are a "game-changer" for Indigenous 
businesses.
"With the support of NAB and Fortescue, we can secure more contracts, ensure sustainable growth and ultimately 
empower our community," she says. "This is a significant move toward a more inclusive industry, and we are thrilled 
to be part of this transformative initiative." Fortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto says the company 
believes "procurement is a powerful lever for social and economic change, and this partnership with NAB will 
ensure we are able to continue providing First Nations businesses with the tools to help create value and 
sustainability".
"Our Buriya Capital Funding program with ANZ has already provided support to hundreds of First Nations 
businesses, with Fortescue guaranteeing over $56 million last financial year," he says.
"Together with NAB, we will be able to take this support to the next level, allowing even more First Nations 
businesses to grow. These partnerships build on our pioneering Billion Opportunities program, which has awarded 
over $5bn in contracts and subcontracts to First Nations businesses since 2011." NAB, which is committed to more 
than doubling its lending to First Nations businesses over the next three years, has expressed enthusiasm about 
the potential impact of this partnership in fostering long-term economic growth and stability within Indigenous 
communities.

Fortescue, NAB unlock access to crucial capital
NAB associate director Indigenous business Annie Ashworth says: "We know it can be particularly difficult for First 
Nations businesses to access capital and this partnership with Fortescue is a powerful example of how we can 
work together to unlock new opportunities. When First Nations businesses thrive, the entire community thrives and 
we are proud to be a part of this journey." This report was produced with the support of Fortescue Metals.

Australians are being misled into believing that low-quality carbon offset schemes will lead to a net zero future, 
despite evidence that only reducing fossil fuels will work, iron ore mining giant Fortescue says.
The federal government's Safeguard Mechanism forces companies to either begin decarbonising or buy carbon 
offsets to meet legislated net zero goals.

But Fortescue's chief climate scientist, Dr Shanta Barley, said in a speech in Canberra on Wednesday that many of 
the offsets they were forced to buy were "dodgy", which had led to a lack of trust in the system. Their use in the 
Safeguard Mechanism must be capped, she said.
Barley's comments, the strongest ones yet from Fortescue on carbon offsets and climate change, come as serious 
questions are being raised by scientists about whether schemes such as Human Induced Regeneration (HIR) 
achieve any real carbon reduction in the atmosphere.
They also coincide with the publication of two major studies that say a record-hot 2024 suggests the globe has 
already exceeded the 1.5 degree temperature increase limit laid out in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. 
Meanwhile, Australia's emissions continue to rise.
Fortescue has a policy of reaching "real zero" by building renewable energy and battery and storage schemes to 
power its multi-billion dollar Pilbara iron ore operations.
Barley told the Climate Integrity summit, organised by the Australia Institute, that "multiple, independent and peer-
reviewed lines of evidence have now come to the same conclusion" about carbon sequestration schemes in 
Australia and around the world.
Page 2 of 3
Australians are being misled by 'dodgy' offsets, say Fortescue
"Many offset projects are now known to be low quality and failing to deliver the emissions reductions they promised 
... We are, in other words, largely being duped."
Under the Safeguard Mechanism, companies that cannot meet legislated emissions reduction targets - by actually 
reducing their emissions or shutting down - are legally required to buy Australian offsets, including those generated 
by farmers allegedly growing forests on Australia's dry rangeland farms.
These HIR credits now make up about a third of the total Australian Carbon Credit Units available on the market 
and will grow to be around half in future years.
As a result of the Safeguard Mechanism policy, big mining companies such as Fortescue are required to spend 
millions of dollars a year buying these offsets. Fortescue says this is a bridging issue until it can reach "real zero" in 
2030.
Barley hinted in her speech that this might, in future, prompt legal action, as companies could explore the legal 
implications of being required to buy products that "aren't doing what they say on the tin".
A community group recently launched legal action in the Federal Court, alleging misleading and deceptive conduct 
against Energy Australia over its claim its power - generated largely by coal and gas - was carbon-neutral because 
it had bought offsets on the voluntary market.
No company has yet sued over the offsets they are forced to buy on the compulsory or "compliance" market.
In her speech, Barley drew particular attention to HIR offsets - including questions raised in a series of articles in 
this masthead over recent days. She also said there were integrity concerns over other government-approved offset 
methods, including landfill gas, carbon capture and storage and herd management.
Barley said the answer was for the government to cap the number of offsets that companies could use in pursuit of 
reducing emissions. In Australia, there is no cap on the use of offsets, but in other territories' carbon reduction 
schemes, including in California and the European Union, the use of offsets is limited.
"If 90 per cent of our decarbonisation had to be real, a few dodgy offsets wouldn't matter. We would laugh them off," 
Barley said. "The problem lies in the fact that there are currently no limits to using them."
In answer to questions from this masthead recently, a spokesperson for Environment Minister Chris Bowen said 
carbon credits such as those derived from HIR - one-third of the total in Australia - were "a critical part of the 'net' in 
net zero".
According to Barley, with a profit of $9 billion per year, Fortescue could easily afford a few million for offsets to 
allow it to claim it has decarbonised.
"At the end of the day, the financial impost placed by offsets on big companies is water off a duck's back. To force 
companies to do the right thing, many countries have had to set strict limits on offset use. Australia should consider 
doing the same."
Fortescue this week organised an open letter, signed by multiple companies, which now includes $49 billion 
technology company Canva, calling for "real zero" policy that would "mandate clear phase-out timelines for fossil 
fuel use".

For the past 15 years, my community in the resource-rich Pilbara region has been engaged in a David and Goliath 
battle against Fortescue, which has mined without our free, prior and informed consent and without a native title 
land use agreement, despite having our rights affirmed by the High Court of Australia.
We are often asked why the Yindjibarndi are so determined to battle a mining giant that can engage in limitless 
lawfare against Aboriginal people with meagre resources.
We fight because we owe it to our ancestors and future generations to ensure that Yindjibarndi people's long, hard 
journey to prove our legal rights under the Native Title Act is seen and respected, and because the law must lead to 
consequences if a proponent chooses to disrespect First Australians.
We are proud of what we have accomplished over the past 10 years without having an agreement with Fortescue. 
Any visitor to the bustling mining town of Karratha can't help but notice the dozens of vehicles owned by our 
contracting business, Yurra. This business, founded in 2013, has grown to employ more than 430 people working in 
diversified sectors, including contracts with Rio Tinto, Woodside and the City of Karratha. We have also established 
cultural organisations that promote and preserve our traditions for the benefit of our young and to share with non-
Indigenous Australians.
The Yindjibarndi have achieved all this despite the absence of a native title agreement with Fortescue for its 
Solomon Hub mine - which operates on our land and has generated more than $80 billion in revenue since 2013.
Our main source of income is a rail tariff paid by Rio Tinto from a modernised agreement signed in 2022. This is the 
result of a positive relationship with Rio Tinto Iron Ore on an Indigenous Land Use Agreement that was executed in 
good faith.
Our renewable energy business, Yindjibarndi Energy Corporation, has breathtaking plans to drive the 
decarbonisation of the Pilbara through projects that could generate up to three gigawatts of green energy in coming 
decades. YEC's projects are some of the most advanced Indigenous-led developments in Australia.
Page 2 of 2
Why we're still fighting Goliath Talking point
YEC is the result of a joint venture with the global green energy player ACEN, and our agreement allows the 
Yindjibarndi people to take an equity share of up to 50 per cent in projects. Our people have already benefited 
directly by taking part in heritage and environmental surveys that are required for all government approvals.
We also want to invest in our majority-owned Yindjibarndi Water, which is looking at alternative groundwater 
supplies to the Millstream aquifer, water treatment initiatives for YEC and support for carbon farming and 
agricultural pursuits.
With fair compensation for the impact of mining on our Ngurra (country), the Yindjibarndi people will be in a strong 
position to achieve even greater results in the decades to come.
Next week, the Federal Court will hear final submissions in a case that the Yindjibarndi people initiated. This flowed 
on from our 2020 win in the High Court, which affirmed our exclusive native title possession over the land where 
Solomon Hub operates.
The respondents in this case, the state of Western Australia and Fortescue, both agree that we are entitled to 
compensation, though we disagree on how much.
At the heart of the case is whether the courts should take a real-world view and award compensation based on the 
types of agreements that fair-minded corporations have reached with traditional owners. We certainly think this 
should be the case.
Economic compensation based on this approach, plus reparations for the damage to heritage, spiritual values, 
environment and social disruption, are before the courts and perhaps that will set the bar on native title agreements. 
This is why our legal team believes our Federal Court case is arguably the most significant litigation brought by an 
Indigenous community since Eddie Mabo's case in 1993.
Michael Woodley is the CEO of the Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation, the plaintiff in the Federal Court 
case.

Iron ore miner Fortescue has added a second British establishment figure to its board by hiring former HSBC boss 
Noel Quinn as a non-executive director.
The Perth-based miner said Sir Noel, who retired as chief executive of the British bank in September after five 
years at the helm, would bring almost four decades of experience to the role.
The Andrew Forrest-chaired group, whose board includes fellow Briton Lord Sebastian Coe, highlighted Sir Noel's 
"industry-wide initiatives to facilitate public sector and private sector financing solutions for large infrastructure 
projects, particularly sustainable infrastructure".
"Noel is a highly respected leader who brings a wealth of international expertise and experience in finance and 
capital markets," Dr Forrest said in a statement. "His deep understanding of the complexities of the global financial 
landscape will be invaluable as Fortescue continues to diversify into new markets and grow as a green technology, 
energy and metals group."
Sir Noel, 63, switched HSBC's focus towards Asia during his leadership, selling parts of its operations to 
concentrate on its most profitable region.
He first joined HSBC in 1987 and worked in various roles in the UK, the US, and Asia. During his time at the helm, 
Sir Noel restructured the London-headquartered lender, axing 35,000 jobs and cutting costs.
He surprised investors a year ago with his abrupt retirement from HSBC, sparking a frantic search for a new leader. 
He was knighted in the New Year's honours list for his services to financial services and net zero.
Sir Noel said he was pleased to join the board "at a time when the company is pursuing its ambitious real zero 
journey, leading the way for industry to decarbonise and transition to a fossil fuel-free future".
"I look forward to bringing my experience in global banking to assist the company in achieving its long-term growth 
objectives and continuing to deliver on shareholder value."

It is the second high-profile HSBC recruit to an ASX company board this year after Nuno Matos was appointed 
Shayne Elliott's successor as chief executive of ANZ Bank. Mr Matos ran HSBC's global wealth and personal 
banking division.
He was a potential successor to Sir Noel but was passed over in favour of Georges Elhedery, who was promoted 
from chief financial officer and has announced a sweeping restructure of the international banking giant.
Fortescue bolstered its board last year with the addition of Indigenous leader Noel Pearson. Other members 
include ex-CSIRO boss Larry Marshall and former chief executive officer Elizabeth Gaines.
Fortescue has endured a series of leadership changes over the past year after the miner abandoned its 2030 
green hydrogen target. These include the departure of Julie Shuttleworth, who headed Fortescue's fledgling iron 
ore operations in Gabon, and green energy division chief financial officer Deborah Caudle.

  The Country where Fortescue Metals Group has dug up tonnes of iron ore will be returned to Traditional Owners 
as "large pits in the land", once mining operations have ceased, a court has been told.
   The federal court is considering how much compensation Yindjibarndi native title holders could receive from 
Fortescue Metals Group, as closing submissions begin in the long-running legal dispute.
   Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation are seeking compensation from Fortescue over "economic and 
cultural loss" due to mining operations.
   Fortescue began mining at the Solomon hub in the Pilbara in 2013 without agreement from the Aboriginal 
corporation, instead dealing with a breakaway group.
   During his submission, barrister for Yindjibarndi, Vance Hughston told the federal court the devastation to Country 
had been enormous, as had the wealth generated for Fortescue and the state of Western Australia.
   "The only party missing out in all of this is the Yindjibarndi people," he said.
   "Country, physically and culturally is being destroyed, they're locked out of that Country and they are not receiving 
a dollar's compensation from the wealth that is being generated from their Country."
   Mr Hughston said the Solomon mine hub is in an area of Country that was "effectively pristine", but cultural and 
physical aspects of the land had been destroyed.
   He said mining would continue until at least 2045, and then undergo several years of rehabilitation.
   Mr Hughston said rehabilitation works "will never restore the land to its original quality" and the "cultural 
landscape will remain obliterated".
   "What will be returned will be large pits in the land," Mr Hughston said.
"Effectively, we say in our submissions, that native title has really been extinguished ... this Country has been lost to 
them, they won't be going back to this Country when the miners finally leave."   Lawyers for Yindjibarndi argue 
compensation should take into account the amount the native title holders would have been able to negotiate with

Fortescue, while the miner has said the amount should be calculated without reference to the value of any minerals 
on or in the ground.
   "That's what miners pay us for and how they pay us," Mr Hughston said on Monday.
   "They want that access to the land to get the minerals and they will pay a percentage royalty on the minerals that 
are mined and sold."
   Closing submissions are expected to continue on Tuesday.

Rio Tinto will be playing catch-up with its struggling iron ore operations for the rest of this year but has come 
through the latest cyclone to hit the WA coast in better shape than first feared.
Iron ore heavyweights Rio, BHP and Fortescue and other big miners are counting the cost of Cyclone Zelia but 
appear to have escaped major damage over the weekend. However, many roads remain closed and remote 
communities and cattle stations have been hard hit by flooding.
Rio was able to get iron ore carriers back into the ports of Cape Lambert and Dampier late on Saturday and there 
are no indications of damage to its 2000km-long rail network.
However, the latest disruption means Rio's port operations have been out of action for almost two weeks since late 
January.
Rio shipped 328.6 million -tonnes of iron ore from its Pilbara ports in 2024, in line with production guidance, which 
remains unchanged for 2025 despite its recent setbacks.
Cyclone Zelia crossed the Pilbara coast northeast of Port Hedland on Friday and weakened into a tropical low that 
dumped heavy rain on the minerals-rich but sparsely populated Pilbara region.
The cyclone's eventual path took it away from a direct hit on Port Hedland or Rio's ports, and also spared the LNG 
industry from major damage.
BHP said it mines, rail and infrastructure at Port Hedland had fared better than expected as it hunkered down for 
Cyclone Zelia.
"The experience of our teams in managing cyclones in the Pilbara meant we were well prepared," a spokesperson 
said. "Our teams are now progressively returning to site, with recovery and ramp-up operations underway." 
Fortescue said all non-essential travel to its mines remained suspended and that all its workers on the ground were 
safe.

Pilbara miners dodge worst of cyclone
"While some of our operations have experienced temporary disruptions, we are working to resume normal activities 
as quickly and safely as possible," a Fortescue spokesperson said.
BHP is due to hand down its first half results on Tuesday, followed by Rio's full-year results on Wednesday and 
Fortescue's first- half numbers on Thursday.
Lithium miner Pilbara Minerals, which reports first-half results on Thursday, appears to have dodged a bullet after 
early modelling showed Cyclone Zelia tracking straight at its Pilgangoora mine. "Initial assessments indicate no 
material damage to our operation, and our on-site team continue to conduct infrastructure checks," a spokesman 
said.
Pilbara Minerals has offered support to surrounding communities, including Strelley and Warralong, caught up in 
flooding and other fallout from the cyclone.
Mineral Resources shut down operations at it Wodgina lithium mine and flew non-essential staff to Perth in advance 
of the cyclone.
It said initial assessments indicated minimal impact at Wodgina with workers returning to site.
Cyclone Zelia hit the Pilbara with Rio still carrying out repair work in the wake of Cyclone Sean, which flooded key 
parts of its operations in January and also hit BHP, Fortescue and MinRes.
Even before the latest storm, Rio admitted first-quarter shipments would be affected by the impact of Cyclone Sean, 
and subsequent closures from Cyclone Taliah and Cyclone Vince.
The most northern of Rio's 17 mines in the Pilbara, including Gudai-Darri, appear to have copped the brunt of the 
latest downpour and may still have water sitting in the bottom of pits.
The mines would normally be better prepared to cope with cyclone disruption but they were soaked by heavy 
rainfall in the December quarter, forcing Rio to draw down on stockpiles. Rio's export terminal at East Intercourse 
Island remains out of action after flooding caused by Cyclone Sean, which dumped a record 274mm of rain on parts 
of the Pilbara in a 24-hour period. The operations are scheduled to come back online this week.

For the first time ever we find ourselves in furious agreement with Sarah Hanson-Young. On Monday the Greens 
senator called for a "full and frank inquiry" into Creative Australia's decision to withdraw its selection of Khaled 
Sabsabi as Australia's artist representative to the Venice Biennale 2026.
Many of you will never have heard of Sabsabi, or the Venice Biennale, or Creative Australia, an agency rat-holed in 
the nether reaches of government and armed with wheelbarrows of taxpayer slush. Yes, some of you might even 
have thrown your iPads across the room at the temerity of our suggestion that a Greens senator might actually be 
right about something. Because they never are.
But it's true, there really should be an inquiry into Sabsabi's humiliating board retraction and it should also probe the 
ideological capture that's hijacked decision-making at Creative Australia.
The agency's CEO, Adrian Collette, will appear before a Senate Estimates hearing next week to talk more about 
that.
In the meantime, the fallout from this affair keeps expanding. Staff have walked out of Creative Australia offices. 
Artists have huffed and torn their smocks and signed petitions in protest (which never, ever happens). Lindy Lee 
resigned from the Creative Australia board despite reiterating her support for Sabsabi to be nixxed in her exit letter - 
a decision in which she participated, after all.
And then there's Simon Mordant, co-chairman of Luminis Partners, who resigned as a biennale ambassador and 
told The Guardian that he'd pulled a "significant" funding pledge for the project. We hear it was $40,000, roughly 
what Simon spends on Cohiba's and Brunello each month at his villa in Italy. His business partner Ron Malek spent 
the weekend shaking his head in embarrassment at Mordant's unalloyed sanctimony.
"It's outrageous," Mordant wrote of the Sabsabi decision on Instagram. "I have resigned as an Ambassador to the 
now cancelled project and withdrawn my financial support - this situation is unacceptable. Maybe the Pavilion 
should remain empty in solidarity with Khaled. A very dark day for Australia and the Arts." Mordant, who is Jewish, 
hasn't posted any messages of solidarity for Jewish artists who've been doxxed, abandoned and relentlessly 
Page 2 of 3
Fallout over CA decision continues
excluded since the October 7 massacres. Not a word from Mordant until Monday when he suddenly sought to 
clarify his support for Sabsabi - an artist who boycotted the 2022 Sydney Festival because the organisers received 
$20,000 of Israeli funding to stage an Israeli choreography display - and posted a whimpering statement saying he 
would never support an artist "that glorifies terrorism, racism or antisemitism".
"I think everybody has to be very careful about the insidious rise of racism and anti-Semitism which has become 
particularly prevalent in Australia," Mordant said. Well Simon, when even Sophie McNeill is lavishing you with 
praise and thanking you for your "leadership", as she did online, it might be time for a walk through the hall of 
mirrors.
Mikala Tai was the other prominent figure to walk out of Creative Australia "in support of Sabsabi and curator 
Michael Dagostino", as she wrote on Instagram.
Sabsabi is friendly with Tai. When Creative Australia announced his selection as the Venice Biennale 
representative, Tai posted a video of them celebrating.
Joining them in that video was Creative Australia program manager Tahmina Maskinyar, who resigned alongside 
Tai, and whose posts online have included calls for the eradication of Israel ("From the river to the sea ...") and 
"intifada until victory", which Liberal senator Sarah Henderson called "grossly offensive anti-Semitic content".
Creative Australia said these sentiments didn't breach the agency's code of conduct.
Nothing wrong with a bit of dancing, and nothing wrong with members of Sabsabi's artist group, Eleven Collective, 
being friendly with Tai. It is a fact, however, that some of these people have sat on Creative Australia panels that 
adjudicated the provision of taxpayer-funded grants, or been grant recipients themselves.
Like Shireen Taweel, who we mentioned last week - she's affiliated with Tai and received Creative Australia grants 
of $45,200 in 2023 and $32,500 in 2022; Anna Louise Richardson, the wife of artist Abdul-Rahman Abdullah, a 
panel assessor, received $31,729 in March 2021; Amrita Hepi received $35,715 in 2023; and Sabsabi was awarded 
three grants of $8500, $5000 and $7680 between March 2022 and October 2023 (he also received much larger 
grants in 2018, 2019 and 2020, prior to Tai taking up work at Creative Australia).
We're not suggesting any of this is evidence of a conflict, nor that Tai had any involvement in furnishing these 
grants; plus, within Australia's shallow artist pool, decision-making will inevitably involve people who wind up 
knowing each other.
But wrinkles remain. In the video of Sabsabi dancing, Abdullah left behind a comment that drew our attention: "I 
love everything about today's announcement. Thank you MT!!!!" It would be telling to discover what role, if any, Tai 
might have played in the backing of Sabsabi during discussions of the Biennale. One for next week's senate 
estimates hearing to tease out.
Ongoing process It's been six months since Andrew Forrest's Fortescue bowed to the inevitable and wound back 
the exponential growth of its green energy hiring, sacking as many as 700 staff in the process. But Margin Call 
hears Fortescue staff have been attending a fresh round of leaving parties, as the company again hacks away at 
its management ranks.
The latest to go is general manager of community and government engagement, Sasha Pendal - a well known 
figure in Perth business circles, not least for her role on the board of the hapless Fremantle Dockers football club.
Pendal's departure is said to be amicable, but appears part of another round of redundancies among senior 
managers.
Under the turmoil caused by Fortescue's pivot to green energy, the company somehow managed to insert an 
entire new level of management - the number of general managers at Fortescue blew out from 30-odd a few years 
ago to as many as 130 in 2024.Page 3 of 3
Fallout over CA decision continues
The massive cull last year, when Fortescue announced it would lay off 700 staff, was supposed to reduce that total 
to around 40. The process is clearly still ongoing, with a few more departing in recent months, Pendal among them. 
(Not that all of last year's round of 700 came from Fortescue Energy, of course, as the company has been at pains 
to tell anyone that dares suggest it.) Also departing Fortescue this year is the former commercial manager for 
Fortescue's hydrogen systems unit, Samantha Buchanan, who took a promotion to become a Shell Australia vice-
president in January.
Fortescue will deliver its first-half financial results on Thursday, and the company is (again) on a promise to update 
shareholders on the progress of its energy projects - primarily its Holmaneset green ammonia project in Norway 
and the Pecem green hydrogen development in Brazil.
Fair to say the going has been getting tougher in Europe, where Fortescue's plans are facing growing public 
opposition - not least because Holmaneset will draw down about 2 per cent of the total power produced in the 
country, at a promise of only a small number of jobs.
And as for Fortescue's plans in the US, where it wants to build a hydrogen production plant to fuel trucks? That, 
like every other renewable energy project in the country, is now prisoner to the new priorities of Donald Trump's 
"drill, baby drill" administration.
But also in need of a market update is the progress of Forrest's green fundraising arm, Fortescue Capital, which, 
since its 2023 launch under the guidance of Robert Tichio, has built up a leadership group of no less than eight 
managing directors - all lured away from well-paid gigs at investment banks.
Fortescue Capital was launched with a mandate to attract external investment into the company's green energy 
arm.
Only Fortescue's board really knows what the gang has been up to since, but Margin Call's quick math suggests 
Fortescue is currently paying 2.7 managing directors for each green energy project that it still hasn't decided to 
build.

  Traditional Owners are seeking $1.8 billion in compensation from iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group over 
economic and cultural loss.
   Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation wants $1 billion for cultural damage, while $678 million is being sought 
for economic loss, according to documents filed to the Federal Court.
   In their closing submission, lawyers for the Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation said the loss of Country as a 
consequence of Fortescue's Solomon Mine Hub in the Pilbara "is equated to a suffocation affecting country and 
individuals as hollowness and emptiness".
   "The fact that the Yindjibarndi are getting nothing for their Ngurra (Country) from this manjangu (stranger) is a 
cause of deep spiritual loss," Yindjibarndi lawyer Justin Edwards told the court on Wednesday.
   The total number of sites that have been damaged or destroyed is in excess of 285, according to Yindjibarndi's 
closing submissions.
   On Monday, Yindjibarndi lawyer Vance Hughston said cultural sites must have an economic value, asking how 
much it was worth for a nation to have sites dating back tens of thousand of years.
   "They're the sort of things that people say are priceless," Mr Hughston said.
   The Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation is also seeking compensation for specific destruction of sites and for the 
cost of healing the trauma caused by social disruption.
   Fortescue began mining at the Solomon hub in the Pilbara in 2013 without agreement from the Aboriginal 
corporation, instead dealing with a breakaway group.
   Fortescue and the Yindjibarndi attempted to negotiate a Land Use Agreement for the Solomon Mine Hub, but no 
agreement was ever reached.
   Division arose among Yindjibarndi people, including in relationship to the negotiations with Fortescue, the 
submission said, resulting in the formation of Wirlu-Murra Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation.

WA:Community, Country 'ruptured' over iron ore mine damage
   "Yindjibarndi people divided publicly in August 2010 over a Land Access Agreement. They have remained divided 
since then," Yindjibarndi's submissions says.
   On Wednesday, Mr Edwards described the division as a "rupture" in the community, which had impacted the 
practice of cultural ceremony.
   "They haven't been done for years now, or been done for years as a group of Yindjibarndi people, as a 
community," he said.
   "The significance of those ceremonies is not just a personal significance, it's a significance, Your Honour, for the 
Country."
   "The rupture in this community can be properly understood as a rupture in Country when that spiritual relationship 
is fully understood."

The Yindjibarndi people have claimed $1.82bn in compensation in a Federal Court dispute over mining without 
agreement on its traditional lands.
The Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation says the Cook Labor government is liable because the West 
Australian government issued the mining licences to Fortescue at Solomon Hub in the Pilbara more than a decade 
ago, under Liberal premier Colin Barnett.
Fortescue, also known as FMG, is the second respondent in the landmark Federal Court case because under the 
WA's mining laws, the state can seek to recover any payout from the company.
This is the first time a native title group has sued over mining that proceeded without an agreement.
And while disputes among traditional owners over who belongs to a particular group are not rare, Yindjibarndi 
claims that FMG stoked division and bankrolled a splinter group in order to smooth its own path.
Until Wednesday, the Yindjibarndi had not spelled out precisely how much compensation it -believed it was owed.
The Aboriginal corporation, which is trustee for the Yindjibarndi people, says in the document made public on 
Wednesday that the total figure is $1.82bn. This comprises $1bn for cultural loss, $678.1m for economic loss, 
$34.8m for the specific destruction of sites and $112.1m for healing the trauma of social disruption it says FMG 
caused.
The Yindjibarndi claim to have new evidence in the form of "a remarkable document" showing FMG was supporting 
the splinter group, known as WYAC, as early as 2011.
It says the document was discovered last August.
"It is an invoice and corresponding purchase order from (law firm) Corser & Corser to FMG for $107,000. The 
invoice is dated 4 March, 2011," Yindjibarndi says in its submission filed to the Federal Court on Wednesday.
Page 2 of 2
Yindjibarndi want $1.8bn in mining compo
"It refers to a meeting to be held on 16 March and is for anticipated expenses for 214 WYAC members to be paid 
$500 expenses each.
"This is a clear and significant measure of support for one side of what was already a serious division in the 
community.
"There should be no difficulty in inferring that FMG gave the support to further its own commercial interests." 
Yindjibarndi's submission, made public by the Federal Court on Wednesday, says there are several such invoices 
for Corser & Corser's representation of WYAC totalling $590,000.
FMG released a short statement on Wednesday as hearings in the case continued in the Federal Court.
"Fortescue accepts that the Yindjibarndi People are entitled to compensation. However, the parties disagree on the 
amount of that compensation," the company statement said.
"It is noteworthy that Fortescue has agreed and pays financial compensation under all of its other seven native title 
agreements." The Federal Court hearings are being live-streamed to the Pilbara town of Roebourne, where 
Yindjibarndi people gathered to watch at the community centre called Ganalili. The centre was once the notorious 
Victoria Hotel, the scene of a violent clash between off duty police and Aboriginal males that ended in the death in 
custody of 16-year-old John Pat in 1983.
The Yindjibarndi bought the building in 2014 and turned it into a community hub with cafe, accommodation, general 
store and offices.
FMG is yet to make its own closing submissions in court. That is when the company is expected to address in detail 
all the claims made by the Yindjibarndi throughout the hearings and in the document published by the court on 
Wednesday.

Fortescue and the state of Western Australia have been hit with a $1.8 billion native title claim in an extraordinary 
escalation of a long-running battle over the Yindjibarndi lands on which the company built its Solomon iron ore 
mining hub.
The miner is expected to report a $2.6 billion half-year profit today, but now must factor in the risk of a dramatically 
higher than expected claim by the Yindjibarndi people.
The Yindjibarndi people have sued Fortescue and the state to compensate for lost economic benefits and cultural 
and spiritual damage caused by the Solomon project, three-quarters of which sits in Yindjibarndi land that also 
takes in the gorges and rock pools of Millstream Chichester National Park. The Federal Court will decide whether 
WA or Fortescue, which has mined the Yindjibarndi land for iron ore without permission nor agreement with the 
Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation for 10 years, will pay the compensation bill.
The Yindjibarndi were found to be native titleholders of the land in 2017.
Western Australia is a co-defendant alongside Fortescue in the lawsuit, filed by the Yindjibarndi in March 2023, 
because it issued Fortescue's mining licence and collects royalties from its iron ore shipments. Under the state's 
mining code, the government has the authority to compel Fortescue to cover any compensation claims. However, 
Fortescue will likely challenge this.
Court documents released yesterday show the compensation claim, initially estimated at around $1 billion, has 
nearly doubled to $1.8 billion.
The lion's share of the bill is linked to the mine destroying culture through loss of connection to the land. For this the 
group, led by Michael Woodley, is claiming compensation of $1.1 billion. "On the assumption that there are 1000 
people in the Yindjibarndi community, this amount would compensate each Yindjibarndi person $1 million," 
according to the court filing.
Economic loss - due to a failure to receive royalties - is claimed to be $678 million.
Page 2 of 2
Fortescue faces $1.8b native title compensation claim
Another of the traditional owners' claims for compensation, previously untested under Australian law, is around 
social disharmony caused by Fortescue opting to throw its support behind a breakaway group, Wirlu-murra 
Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation, which has separately struck deals with the miner. The court filing points to 
$880,000 in receipts paid by Fortescue to the breakaway group.
To compensate for this, the Yindjibarndi are asking for $112 million.
During the hearings, Fortescue denied it stoked community tension and rejects claims it is liable for "cultural loss" 
in relation to community division. The Yindjibarndi are also seeking recompense of $34 million for specific 
destruction of sites that formed a core spiritual connection to the land.
Fortescue says it recognises the group's right to compensation, but disputes the amount. Fortescue will submit its 
written closing arguments by the end of the month.

  Fortescue has posted a weaker first-half profit despite record-high shipments, as softer demand from China 
weighs on iron ore prices.
   The mining giant posted a net profit after tax (NPAT) of US$1.6 billion ($A2.5 billion) for the six months to 
December 31, down more than 50 per cent from US$3.3 billion in 2023.
   Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation was US$3.6 billion, down from US$5.9 billion.
   "It's been an outstanding operational performance for the first half of FY25 with the team achieving our highest 
ever half-year shipments while keeping costs low," Fortescue Metals chief executive Dino Otranto said.
   Iron ore prices have been languishing on the back of weak demand from China and its struggling property sector.
   Fortescue's decarbonisation plan and green energy pivot continued to progress, but some project timelines 
would have to be extended, energy division chief executive Mark Hutchinson said.
   "We have continued to advance and commercialise our portfolio of green technologies to assist Fortescue's own 
decarbonisation goals and help other companies in their transition to Real Zero," he said.
   "Our global team is also continuing to progress and refine our green energy projects in a disciplined manner, amid 
challenging global market conditions."
   Total capital expenditure for the period was US$1.8 billion, $300 million higher than in 1H24.
   Guidance for FY25 shipments and costs remained unchanged, while the guidance range for Metals capital 
expenditure narrowed to US$3.5 - US$3.8 billion and guidance for Energy capital expenditure fell to US$400 
million.
   The group posted net cash flow from operating activities of US$2.4 billion and free cash flow of US$0.7 billion 
after capital expenditure of US$1.8 billion.
   The board declared a fully franked interim dividend of $A0.50 per share, a 65 per cent payout of first-half profit, 
but down from $A1.08 a year earlier.

Investors are preparing for a new era of slumping profits and hefty dividend cuts by the world's largest miners as 
iron ore markets brace for a flood of supply to trigger a collapse in prices.
Fortescue and Rio Tinto became the latest mining giants yesterday to reveal the full effect from China's property 
crisis, which caused iron ore prices to plunge nearly 30 per cent last year, forcing boards to slash shareholder 
payouts.
Rio will pay its lowest dividend in seven years while Fortescue sliced its payout by more than 50 per cent after its 
first-half profit slid 53 per cent.
Earlier in the week BHP said it would pay its lowest interim dividend in eights years after a 23 per cent profit slump.
The results triggered a sell-off in the sharemarket with Fortescue diving 6.2 per cent to $18, Rio Tinto 1.5 per cent 
to $120.09 and BHP 2 per cent to $40.15. That extended last year's rout which saw the S&P/ASX 200 Resources 
Index plunging nearly 20 per cent.
Fund managers are expecting further pain for the heavyweight mining sector, which could accelerate the local 
sharemarket's retreat this week from record levels.
"We're not even close to the end of these sorts of results," warned Perennial fund manager and resources analyst 
Sam Berridge.
"The slump in iron ore prices over the past 12 months is largely a result of weak demand from China ... we haven't 
even had a meaningful increase in supply yet."
Berridge, who runs Perennial's Natural Resources Fund, believes iron ore prices will average $US80 a tonne next 
year - compared with current levels of around $US106 a tonne in Singapore - and is happy to not own any iron ore 
miners despite analysts declaring they are too cheap to ignore.

Westpac is even more bearish, warning that prices could collapse to $US70 a tonne this year as Rio Tinto's 
massive Simandou project in Guinea adds a fresh wave of supply to the physical market.
"There's high-cost production still online today which needs to get bumped off the end of the cost curve by that 
incoming supply from Guinea," added Berridge. "That suggests prices are going to tick down further."
Supply disruptions at Australia's biggest iron ore port caused by Tropical Cyclone Zelia have helped keep prices 
well north of $US100 a tonne.
"It's clear that exports from Australia will definitely have been impacted at the same time as heavy rainfall in Brazil 
has added to concerns about supply," said Westpac head of commodity strategy Robert Rennie.
That has coincided with hopes that Beijing will announce further stimulus at next month's Two Sessions - an annual 
meeting of China's top legislative and advisory bodies - which Rennie believes will keep iron ore trading in the 
$US105 to $US110 range before crashing later this year.
Indeed, BHP has noted that supply is already outpacing demand - it expects the combined annual shipments from 
leading producers to have hit record levels in 2024, which has only added to the huge stockpiles sitting at Chinese 
ports.
Even so, BHP is studying options to raise its Australian iron ore output higher still in the long term and Fortescue is 
ramping up production at its Iron Bridge project. Rio Tinto said it was on track to deliver first production at Simandou 
later this year.
"Supply growth from major producers is anticipated to continue in the coming years," Rio Tinto warned. "New iron 
ore projects in Africa and potentially some mine restarts are expected to bring further supply pressures from 2026."
However, BHP chief executive Mike Henry said he was seeing "early signs of recovery" in the Chinese economy. 
Indeed, data this week showed the decline in new home sales ease for a fifth month in January, suggesting values 
were beginning to stabilise.
While the figures offer a glimmer of hope for the beleaguered property sector, a pick-up in sales and new 
construction will be needed to support demand for the steel-making ingredient, according to ANZ.

Fortescue has signalled more delays and cost blowouts around its troubled Iron Bridge magnetite project as it 
continues to pull back from green energy projects.
The Andrew Forrest-led Fortescue blamed US President Donald Trump, European policy uncertainty and the 
looming federal election in Australia for its latest second thoughts on green hydrogen projects.
The company said it was reconsidering the development time-frames for its green hydrogen project in Arizona and 
for a green hydrogen project in Gladstone in Queensland linked to its electrolyser manufacturing facility.
Fortescue Energy boss Mark Hutchinson also tempered expectations for the Holmaneset green ammonia project in 
the Norwegian fjords and the Pecem ammonia project in Brazil.
"We're not going to bring them to the board until we really believe we've locked in the buyers as well," he said.
"We're having discussions with off-takers. There's uncertainty globally for them too and until we have a project 
which is economically viable, we won't take those to the board." Fortescue announced last July that it was 
shedding 700 jobs and pulling back on green hydrogen. The company has never disclosed how many of the job 
losses were in green energy and Mr Hutchinson again refused to discuss staff numbers when questioned on the 
issue on Thursday.
Mr Hutchinson said the Trump administration was instructing federal agencies to pause grant payments under the 
Inflation Reduction Act and that had implications for its $US550m Arizona project.
"While we do remain confident in the long-term viability of green energy, we must be realistic about the current 
challenges the industry faces. Right now the world is in an uncertain place," he said.
"This does include looking at timelines on the FID (final investment decision) projects we have previously 
announced. These changes are what happens when you have an unstable government policy which creates 
uncertainty for investors." The Fortescue share price plunged more than 6.2 per cent to $18.24 on Thursday on the 
back of weaker than expected results and dividends.

Fortescue raises doubts over ambitious green energy projects
Although the interim dividend of 50c is down from $1.08 last year and lower than forecasts, Andrew and Nicola 
Forrest will still share in about $558.4m.
The separated couple control about 36.7 per cent of Fortescue stock. The dividend dip came as Fortescue 
foreshadowed more delays to the $US3.9bn Iron Bridge mine in the Pilbara reaching nameplate capacity of 22 
million tonnes a year.
Iron Bridge had been scheduled to hit that milestone in September, but Fortescue said that timetable was under 
review as it looked to make changes to the processing plant.
It is now almost two years since Dr Forrest, Fortescue's executive chairman, declared first production at Iron 
Bridge and described it as the biggest relief of his career.
Perth-headquartered Fortescue's first half profit fell 53 per cent to $US1.55bn, below consensus estimates of a 
$US1.8bn. Revenue fell 20 per cent to $US7.64bn and underlying earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortisation tumbled from $5.9bn to $3.64bn. Fortescue shipped a company record of 97.1 million tonnes of iron 
ore in the first half, but the average price for its hematite product fell 21 per cent year-on-year to $US85 a tonne and 
production costs increased slightly.
The company maintained full-year shipment guidance of 190-200 million tonnes, including 5-9 million tonnes from 
Iron Bridge, despite recent cyclone activity in the Pilbara that has also hit bigger rivals BHP and Rio Tinto.
Fortescue metals chief executive Dino Otranto backed Iron Bridge to eventually hit its straps after various setbacks 
in the past two years, including WorkSafe issuing improvement notices related to the management of dust with high 
levels of crystalline -silica. Analysts at Jarden highlighted possible "dividend stream pressures", including costs 
around replacement of heavy mining equipment, decarbonisation and an increasing need to step up resource and 
reserve replacement drilling against the backdrop of the weak outlook on iron ore prices. Guidance for FY25 energy 
capital expenditure was revised to $US400m (previously $US500m) reflecting reduced spend.

Fortescue is considering pausing almost $1 billion of approved hydrogen projects in Australia and the United 
States as it assesses the second Donald Trump administration's attitude to clean energy.
The mining group, controlled by Andrew Forrest, cut its full-year capital expenditure forecast by one-fifth to $US400 
million ($630 million) at its energy division, reflecting reduced spending on green fuel projects and their slow 
adoption.
Fortescue warned that Trump's return as US president has called into question the development timeline for its 
$US550 million green hydrogen project in Arizona, after grants promised under the Biden administration had been 
threatened.
The miner is also considering the time frame for its $150 million electrolyser manufacturing facility in the 
Queensland city of Gladstone.
"For the Arizona project, the Trump administration has been a flurry of executive action around some sections of 
the [Inflation Reduction Act] from the grants that come into question and including hydrogen production tax credits," 
said Fortescue Energy chief executive Mark Hutchinson.
"Until we have a much clearer view on that, we are being quite cautious about what we're doing. We've spent about 
one-fifth of the capex on Arizona, so we're being very cautious, very disciplined about the money we spend. We're 
waiting on the outcome of several elections globally."
He said Fortescue remained "fully committed to hydrogen", and that more clarity on the projects would be 
announced at the financial year-end.
Last July, Fortescue cut 700 jobs and slowed its push into green hydrogen and ammonia by pulling back from its 
complex at Gibson Island in Queensland. The miner declined to confirm how many of those job cuts were specific 
to its energy division.
Page 2 of 2
Hydrogen rethink for Fortescue
Fortescue hopes its Arizona Hydrogen plant, scheduled to begin production in 2026, will spur the decarbonisation 
of heavy transport in southwestern US. Low-carbon "green" hydrogen is made by using renewable energy to split 
water into its constituent parts.
However, Fortescue and rival Woodside Energy have had their commitment to US hydrogen projects questioned 
after new rules that made it tougher to access government tax credits.
Hutchinson also poured cold water on the outlook for Fortescue's green ammonia projects in Norway and Brazil, 
which may not be progressed unless customers are found. "We're not going to bring [the projects] to the board until 
we've locked in the buyers," he said.
Meanwhile, South Australia has scrapped its plans to build a green hydrogen plant at Whyalla, marking a blow to 
the Albanese government's vision for the energy source.
Yesterday's hydrogen setback came as Fortescue's interim profit fell by more than half, prompting the miner to 
slash its dividend. Its shares, which have lost more than one-third of their value over the past 12 months, ended 
6.22 per cent lower at $18.24.
The Perth-based Fortescue increased iron ore production to a record high during the December half, shipping 97.1 
million tonnes, as commodity prices sagged.
The wobbling Chinese property sector has weighed on prices of the key steel-making ingredient, forcing Australian 
iron ore miners to increase production to underpin revenues.
Fortescue posted net profit after tax of $US1.55 billion - less than half the $US3.3 billion reported a year ago and 
12 per cent lower than what analysts expected. Revenue during the final six months of 2024 was down by one-fifth 
at $US7.6 billion.
Investors will receive less than half the $1.08 payout they pocketed a year ago. Fortescue proposes to pay a fully 
franked interim dividend of 50¢ a share. The payout ratio of 65 per cent of Fortescue's net profit was unchanged.
The dividend is worth about $560 million to Andrew and Nicola Forrest, who separated in 2023 and collectively 
control 36.7 per cent of the miner.
Fortescue reported higher costs at its troubled $US3.9 billion Iron Bridge project, which the miner warned was 
unlikely to reach its production capacity of 22 million tonnes by its September deadline. Guidance for Fortescue's 
full-year iron ore shipments remained unchanged, despite disruptions from cyclones in the Pilbara region.
Jarden analyst Jon Bishop said the results undershot consensus expectations, and warned that the falling iron ore 
price could place future dividends under pressure.
The miner did not offer an update on a native title claim that was filed against it and the state of Western Australia. 
The claim has almost doubled to $1.8 billion.
The Yindjibarndi people have sued Fortescue and the state of WA to compensate for lost economic benefits and 
cultural and spiritual damage caused by its Solomon project in the Pilbara.
Fortescue mining boss Dino Otranto declined to discuss the claim, but said the miner had "never shied away from 
the right compensation outcome".

Body
What is it with billionaires accusing their staff of stealing precious corporate secrets?
First it was Andrew Forrest suing three of his top men to try prove they'd lifted the IP to make "green iron" 
technology, which is just iron without the carbon, or like coffee without the caffeine - it's not as fun. The case 
against the trio is still grinding its way through the Federal Court.
Now we hear of an even bigger billionaire, Atlassian's Mike Cannon-Brookes, who's suing the absolute pants off of 
a once-trusted family office executive, Kevin Chiu, claiming corporate skulduggery has been afoot.
Chiu worked for years alongside Cannon-Brookes and his ex-wife Annie but left the business suddenly, and 
recently, over accusations that he downloaded sensitive documents to a personal storage account.
What documents? We don't know, and Cannon-Brookes' people wouldn't tell us. What we've confirmed is that this 
was all allegedly uncovered a few weeks ago and everyone then rushed off to the NSW Supreme Court to climb all 
over Chiu and stop the alleged spread of these files. The matter was briefly mentioned on Thursday.
But while Chiu may be technically out the door his name is still listed on a raft of corporate documents for Cannon-
Brookes entities. By that we mean the fashion business - Playdate Studios - run by Annie, and the insect one - 
Kangaloon Crickets - which has a defunct website and was supposed to sell bugs dipped in secret herbs and spices 
to very credulous people. Stick to software, dude.
Chiu's name is also still on the papers for the Sun Cable project, for Dunk Island Philanthropy - named after the 
Queensland isle where Annie bought a $24m resort in 2022 - and for Boundless Earth, a not-for-profit that donated 
to the political campaign of former Liberal National Party minister Jack Dempsey. Are charities allowed to do that?
So the court's ordered Chiu to hand over his phones and iPads and computers and every username and password 
he's ever had created to FTI Consulting for forensic analysis. As far as humiliations go, you'd rather be forced to eat 
a toenail.
Page 2 of 3
Atlassian boss sues employee
But bear in mind this is all playing out amid Mike and Annie's ongoing break-up - they split in 2023 - and the carve-
up of their $23bn in assets, all quietly being nutted out by lawyers on both sides. And it's not exactly all copacetic.
Not only have the two billionaires split their family office but factions are forming among the staff - Team Mike and 
Team Annie. Might Chiu be caught in the middle of this? He's not the only senior family office official to leave the 
billionaire's realm of late. Catherine Manuel is the other major casualty of the marriage split, coming off the board of 
Cannon-Brookes Services Pty Ltd in November, and seemingly pushed out by Mike as he cleans house and tests 
everyone's fealty.
Hydrogen hype It's the end of an inevitable decline for would-be hydrogen truck maker Nikola, which filed for 
bankruptcy protection in the US on Wednesday night.
Hardly a surprise, and arguably a bit overdue given founder Trevor Milton got banged-up after being convicted of 
securities and wire fraud by a New York City jury four months ago.
That was because Nikola's early promotional videos featured - among other lies - a truck the company claimed was 
running on hydrogen, but was actually just rolling down a hill.
Nikola actually went on to produce hydrogen-powered trucks - 83 in the September quarter last year. Not nothing, 
but still not enough to stem losses of around $US200m in three months.
Still, the hydrogen subsidies on offer from the administration of then US president Joe Biden are likely to disappear 
now Donald Trump has taken charge, snuffing out Nikola's last hope.
But for Australian investors it's also a timely reminder of the rapid retreat of the hydrogen hype championed by 
Andrew Forrest's Fortescue.
There's a direct link here. Fortescue bought its hydrogen project in Phoenix, Arizona from Nikola in 2023, and 
Fortescue's US energy boss Andrew Vesey was on the Nikola board when the company collapsed this week.
No suggestion of any wrongdoing by Vesey. He only joined the Niloka board last year - long after concerns about 
the company's business practices had been well ventilated.
It also extends the run of senior US Fortescue executives that have been in proximity to green energy collapses. 
Fortescue Capital boss Robert Tichio was also the chairman of collapsed battery charging company Tritium, and 
key figure behind the float of collapsed hydrogen vehicle company Hyzon.
Again, no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Tichio. Surely it's time that Fortescue conceded its hydrogen foray is 
over?
Despite edging ever-closer, Fortescue still can't admit it.
Fortescue's half-year results say that two of the four remaining hydrogen projects in its portfolio are being 
"reconsidered" - the one it bought from Nikola in the US, and a small-time production centre in Queensland, both 
under threat from changes in government.
But Tichio's Fortescue Capital team is still being paid to raise capital for projects that no longer exist, and 
Fortescue Energy boss Mark Hutchinson is still dodging questions about how many of his team remain after last 
year's cull of 700 Fortescue staff.
Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose, we suppose.
INSIDE MARGIN CALL Fortescue should call time on its hydrogen hype

The big result | There's a little bit of Commonwealth Bank in the strategic shift announced by Telstra yesterday, 
which will have the telco prioritise capital investment in its mobile business by pumping another $800 million into the 
latest hardware and software under a new deal with Ericsson.
Like CBA, Telstra is a dominant player in the Australian telecom market, and in the December half, it increased its 
mobile handset customers by 2.45 per cent to 14.6 million. But like CBA boss Matt Comyn, Telstra chief Vicki Brady 
wants to hammer home her leadership through investment in technology. The new Ericsson kit will increase the 
speed, efficiency and reliability of Telstra's 5G network.
Combining increased investment in the company's profit engine is what investors want to see. But doing this while 
lifting the interim dividend by 5.6 per cent and announcing a $750 million share buyback suggests Brady is handling 
Telstra's eternal juggling act - between customers, shareholders, regulators, staff and the broader community - 
pretty well. The stock surged 5.3 per cent, the best jump on reporting day in almost seven years.
Telstra was arguably the bluest of the cavalcade of blue chips reporting yesterday, including Wesfarmers, 
Transurban, Fortescue and Rio Tinto. Overall, Super Thursday continued the broad theme of reporting season: 
resilient but unspectacular earnings, cautiously optimistic guidance statements and mixed performance on 
dividends - Telstra's capital management clearly pleased the market, but lower commodity prices are weighing on 
capital returns at Fortescue and Rio.
The next question for investors is where Brady will go next. When she was appointed in September 2022, she 
inherited the T25 strategy set out by her predecessor Andy Penn; in the next few months, Brady will get the chance 
to lay out her own big, five-year strategy.
Expect evolution rather than revolution. And if you think about how much the world of technology has changed in 
the past five years, Telstra will need to remain agile.
Chart of the day:

Whitehaven Coal
It can be easy to overlook Australia's second-biggest export, coal. The big coal miners don't get the attention they 
used to, even though they've printed big profits in recent years.
Part of that is ESG-related - investing in coal isn't for everyone, particularly thermal coal used in power stations.
Big thermal coal miner Whitehaven Coal, which owns mines in NSW and Queensland, went in to bat for itself at its 
results yesterday. It pointed out how much more energy-rich its coal was compared with other Australian miners 
and other parts of the world. If you're going to burn coal - and the world needs to for power - then you may as well 
burn the good stuff.
Sell-side surprise
Tabcorp shares have quietly gained 80 per cent since last September, and rose another 4 per cent yesterday after 
chief executive Gillon McLachlan delivered a result that showed he could swing the axe; earnings came in just 
ahead of market expectations, thanks to aggressive cost-cutting McLachlan also unveiled his long-awaited strategic 
refresh yesterday, but there wasn't exactly a lot of meat on the bones, and UBS analyst Bradley Beckett quite 
rightly put him on the spot by asking which of Tabcorp's assets would be the big profit driver in the next two years.
McLachlan hedged his bets, declaring that all the group's assets held promise, with the near-term growth likely to 
arise from new omnichannel offerings and "structural change" in the retail business, which is likely to materialise in 
the coming months. The market will wait for more detail, but Tabcorp's share price suggests investors are expecting 
some corporate action in the not-too-distant future.
What caught our eye
Wesfarmers: You'd be hard-pressed to find a more passionate advocate in Australian business for reform, 
deregulation and productivity growth than Wesfarmers chief executive Rob Scott. But while he continues to push for 
change at a national level, he's using these same big themes to make the group more efficient and profitable.
In its all-conquering Bunnings division, it is pouring investment into technology, rostering and supply chain initiatives 
to reduce costs.
In the Kmart Group, the systems and processes of the Kmart and Target chains have been integrated and digitised 
to lower costs. In the chemicals division, work goes on to de-bottleneck the group's nitric acid plant to lift ammonia 
nitrate production. And across the business, Scott is hunting for improvements for what he calls decision forums, so 
Wesfarmers can move faster. "I'd say that's a form of deregulation - we're letting people just get on and do the job," 
he said, before politely deflecting our suggestion that he could become Australia's answer to Elon Musk. Scott's 
work on productivity improvements was well received by investors and the stock was back near its record levels.
But with Wesfarmers trading on an eye-watering multiple of 89 times forward earnings, it's the group's growth 
prospects over the next five years that matter. Scott says the conglomerate's health business, its budding retail 
media business and the nascent (and currently loss-making) lithium business can provide the next phase of growth.
Transurban: CEO Michelle Jablko is trying to turn the notion that Transurban is "ex-growth" on its head. Just 
because it's 3 years between big road acquisitions, and just because Transurban is under political pressure in its 
three Australian markets, that doesn't have to mean Transurban's earnings and distributions will stop growing. Her 
tool - and it was laid out neatly in one slide in yesterday's half-yearly result - is population growth.
She says the population within 15 minutes of Transurban's Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane roads will increase by 
16 per cent to 17 per cent in the coming decade. If that brings more congestion to roads, and it's not a stretch to 
imagine it will, Transurban should be able to increase traffic by at least that much. Meanwhile, she's on a mission to 
drive home to customers how much time they save by paying Transurban $6/$7/$8 or more to use the roads.Page 3 of 3
Dominant Telstra's investment strategy lifts investor spirits CLOSING BELL
Jablko's been working this population growth/value angle for 12 months now - it's not step-change growth in the 
way that buying WestConnex/Queensland Motorways was in the past, but can still be solid. The actual half-year 
result was strong - costs fell 3 per cent versus expectations of a 5 per cent increase.
Fortescue: Australia's third force in iron ore bit the bullet at its new Iron Bridge project in the Pilbara, confirming it 
wold not hit full nameplate capacity production by September. Fortescue Metals boss Dino Otranto told investors 
the nameplate capacity (22 million tonnes) wasn't under review, just when it would get there. He said the problem 
was with the air classification circuit and downstream aerobelt conveyor - "a key part of the process plant" 
containing a dozen separate units.
"It has taken a bit longer to get up to where we want," he said on the investor call. Fortescue shipped 97.1 million 
tonnes of iron ore in the six months to December - whether it gets to nameplate at Iron Bridge this year or next, it 
will be OK. However, there was a fair bit of analyst interest in it on the call - this hasn't been an easy project for 
Fortescue to get up and running. Fortescue shares sold off heavily (more than 5 per cent), as the result missed 
profit and EBITDA expectations for the first half. The 50¢ a share dividend was also less than the 54¢ analysts 
expected.
Magellan Financial Group: Losing a big-name fund manager is never good for business - Magellan knows that 
better than anyone. So watch what happens to its listed infrastructure strategy, which will lose long-time boss 
Gerald Slack in July. You'd have to think some money follows him out the door. Is there any sign of it yet?
At the half-year results yesterday, Magellan boss Sophia Rahmani told investors that was not the case, although 
her team was aware of the risks and had been talking to clients and consultants to keep them invested. It's 
important because the well-regarded Slack and his team have gone from being a nice little money-spinner to an 
important contributor to Magellan's bottom line in the past three years. They now account for more than 40 per cent 
of its assets under management - more through the global equities strategy shrinking than their own growth.

  An iron ore miner accused of stoking division in a Western Australian community says it is not to blame for the 
"internal disharmony" among Traditional Owners.
   Fortescue Metals Group argued the granting of its mining tenements did not cause community disharmony, as it 
began closing submissions in the long-running legal battle in the Federal Court on Monday.
   Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation is seeking $1.8 billion compensation from Fortescue over cultural and 
economic loss at the Solomon Mine Hub.
   The Aboriginal corporation is also seeking compensation for specific destruction of sites and for the cost of 
healing the trauma caused by social disruption.
   Fortescue began mining at the hub in the Pilbara in 2013 without agreement from the Yindjibarndi Aboriginal 
Corporation, instead dealing with a breakaway group.
   In its closing submissions, Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation said a "remarkable document" had been 
discovered in August, in the form of an invoice and corresponding purchase order from law firm Corser & Corser to 
FMG for $107,000.
   The invoice refers to a meeting to be held on March 16, 2011, for more than 200 members of the breakaway 
group to be paid $500 expenses each, said the document, filed in the Federal Court.
   "This is a clear and significant measure of support for one side of what was already a serious division in the 
community," the submission reads.
   "There should be no difficultly in inferring that FMG gave the support to further its own commercial interests."
   Yindjibarndi lawyers said the community division had prevented the practice of cultural ceremony, and therefore 
had impacts on Country.
   But Fortescue barrister Brahma Dharmananda told the court on Monday the miner was not the cause of internal 
disharmony, nor was the granting of its tenements.

   "The in-fighting arose because of difference of view about doing a deal with FMG," he said.
   "Any inability to regenerate the land was not caused by FMG. It arose because the Yindjibarndi were and 
continue to be in internal conflict about how to deal with FMG."
   The court is considering how much compensation the Yindjibarndi native title holders should receive from 
Fortescue.
   Lawyers for Yindjibarndi argue compensation should take into account the amount the native title holders would 
have been able to negotiate with Fortescue.
   More than 200 sites have been damaged or destroyed, according to Yindjibarndi's closing submissions.
   Yindjibarndi lawyer Vance Hughston previously told the court Yindjibarndi Country was being physically and 
culturally destroyed.
   Fortescue is arguing compensation should be calculated without reference to the value of any minerals on or in 
the ground.
   "Valuing spiritual or cultural loss by reference to the value of minerals never owned by the Yindjibarndi is not 
correct," Mr Dharmananda told the court on Monday.

The West Australian government has sent shockwaves through the resources industry by claiming the destruction 
of more than 200 significant Aboriginal heritage sites in the construction of a major iron ore mine warrants a 
damages payment of only $5m-$10m.
WA's Labor government has put forward the view in a landmark legal dispute involving the Andrew Forrest-led 
Fortescue and its Solomon mine in the -Pilbara.
The Yindjibarndi people are fighting a landmark $1.8bn compensation case in the Federal Court that comes on the 
back of a string of previous legal victories over Fortescue, with lawyers for the WA government claiming any 
payout should a fraction of what the indigenous group is seeking.
Lawyers specialising in native title said the price tag WA had put on heritage destruction raised questions about the 
whole Indigenous agreement system underpinning mining in Australia and whether companies should be paying out 
royalties which routinely amount to more than $50m a year to individual traditional owner groups.
Gilbert + Tobin partner and native title expert Marshall McKenna the Federal Court case was being watched closely 
across the resources industry, with the outcome likely to shape future compensation deals between companies and 
traditional owners.
"If you're wanting project certainty, if you're wanting to make final investment decisions, there's a lot of value in 
having an agreement (with traditional owners)," he said.
"It's a multi-factor play but when it comes down to just being economically rational, there is no reason for paying the 
kind of money that a number of mining and oil and gas companies have paid. It's just a number that they can afford 
to get their ESG (environment, social and governance) approval under their belt.
"Pretty much anybody who has done a compensation deal is paying more than the Federal Court will award (in the 
Yindjibarndi case).

"There is a lot of water to go under this particular bridge, but if the court lands on a figure of $5m to $10m, then a lot 
of people are going to be needing to look very carefully at what they're offering moving forward.
"Because it's great to be a nice guy but if you're a director of a company, you've actually got to look after your 
shareholders as well." Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation boss Michael Woodley said the government's 
assessment was shameful and hypocritical.
The Yindjibarndi allege Fortescue destroyed more than 240 culturally significant sites - including rock shelters 
similar to those at the centre of Juukan Gorge debacle involving Rio Tinto - in building and operating the Solomon 
mine. The group's total claim, including factors like economic loss and community division, is $1.8bn.
Mr Woodley said that by devaluing Aboriginal heritage the WA government risked a backlash that could see 
traditional owner groups withdraw from other negotiations with miners.
National Native Title Council president Kado Muir condemned the WA government and accused it of "low balling" 
the deep pain and suffering caused by the destruction of important heritage and spiritual sites.
The WA government did not respond to questions from The Australian on the issue, including whether its position in 
the Yindjibarndi case delegitimised the much larger sums of money it had paid out in striking far-reaching native title 
settlements in the South West, Mid West and Goldfields regions of WA.
Fortescue and the WA government were left exposed to the Yindjibarndi compensation claim in 2020 when the 
High Court denied the Forrest-controlled mining company special leave to appeal earlier Federal Court rulings that 
in effect meant a large part of Solomon was built without the permission of the traditional owners.
The Federal Court had granted the Yindjibarndi exclusive native title over 2700sq km in the iron ore-rich Pilbara, 
which in effect recognises them as private owners of the highest legal standing with a spiritual connection that 
allows them to decide who mines the land.
Mr Woodley, who has been leading the Yindjibarndi battle with Fortescue for about 18 years, said he was appalled 
the WA government could argue the destruction of hundreds of heritage sites amounted to such a small financial 
penalty in terms of compensation.
"This position of the state government takes us back 50 years to that colonial mentality and attitudes that they can 
come in and take what they want," Mr Woodley said.
Fortescue has exported more than $50bn of iron ore from Solomon since 2013 and the mine is expected to 
continue operating for decades. The WA government has pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties from 
the mine.
Fortescue was granted approval to damage or destroy 249 sites across the area under section 18 of WA's 
Aboriginal Heritage Act, the same legislation that gave Rio the legal authority to destroy the Juukan Gorge rock 
shelters in 2019.
Archaeologists have told the court there were five rock-shelter sites within Solomon "which by virtue of their great 
age and repeated occupation through time are, in our opinion, based on our study, training and experience as 
archaeologists, of national significance".
Mr Woodley said: "This is a big area of land that has been cleared for mining. There's been interference with river 
systems and the environment, not to mention our heritage sites, some dating back 50,000 years, and that's worth 
$5m-$10m? Come on. The state government may as well say in its argument that we don't exist or shouldn't exist.
"There are implications on both sides. There is the miner who might think that he's paying too much now that the 
state government has set a bar this low. Then there are implications for First Nations groups." Mr Woodley said 
traditional owners might question their involvement in discussions and approval processes.Page 3 of 3
Native title surprise for WA miners
"We might even use this as a gathering of First Nations to stand up now for our rights and say we're going to put a 
stop to all mining activities on our land and not partake in any form of approval process," he said.
Mr Muir accused the WA government of trying to cover its backside in terms of compensation, despite the royalty 
riches it reaped from mining on land covered by native title.
"It is just a poor reflection on their thinking and where they're at," he said. "Low-balling the deep pain and suffering 
of spiritual value is poor form but not unexpected given the atrocious track record of this WA government approval 
(of) wanton section 18 destruction and desecration of sites, compounded by their ridiculous backflip in heritage 
protection reform." The WA government spent five years working on new Aboriginal heritage laws that scrapped 
section 18 powers to damage heritage sites without consent, but scrapped the legislation just five weeks after it was 
rolled out. Fortescue has argued any compensation due to the Yindjibarndi should be funded by the state because 
it granted the mining tenements covering the traditional lands of the Yindji-barndi. The WA government maintains 
Fortescue should pay.
The Yindjibarndi rejected a Fortescue's offer of a $4m annual payment over the anticipated life of the Solomon 
project, worth around $120m at one point in the long-running dispute. It is understood BHP and Rio pay royalties of 
about 0.5 per cent of mining revenue to traditional owner groups in the Pilbara.
The WA government is liable to pay compensation to the Yindjibarndi under the terms of the Native Title Act but 
claims any liability shifts to Fortescue under a provision in the WA Mining Act. Fortescue has said the relevant 
section of the Mining Act is unconstitutional. Gilbert + Tobin's Mr McKenna said there were valid reason why 
resource companies would reach agreements with traditional owner groups that took into account more than just 
exposure to compensation claims, including the importance of social licence to operate and a desire to avoid 
lengthy delays.

A bet on Fortescue when the iron ore miner was in deep trouble is one of the proudest moments of fund manager 
Sean Sequeira's career.
It was early 2016 and Fortescue had just posted its earnings result.
"Everyone thought it was going bankrupt," says the Australian Eagle Asset Management chief investment officer 
and portfolio manager. But Sequeira saw something that many of his peers had missed: strong cash flow and 
consistent progress in debt reduction. And all that was happening in spite of low iron ore prices, which were 
hovering at about $US39 a tonne.
"We thought the risks were overblown, and the opportunity was presenting itself for the potential upside on a world-
class asset that the market was overlooking," he says.
Iron ore is now trading at $US106 a tonne.
Just as importantly, Sequeira, then deputy to chief investment officer Albert Hung, also noted the dramatic 
improvement in Fortescue's so-called C1 unit costs, the primary measure of expenses for an iron ore producer. 
They had fallen below that of mining giant BHP. For the investment team, this was the development they had been 
looking for. The fund scooped up the stock at $1.60 a share and the bet paid off.
Six years later, Fortescue stock climbed to $25. That's when Australian Eagle started to reduce its stake, and 
again in 2023, arguably too early, as Fortescue's share price hit $29.30 a year later.
Takeover target Altium was also a big moment in Sequeira's 30-year career. The fund had built a stake of more 
than 5 per cent in the company, which designs printed circuit boards used in electronics. The investment manager 
first bought the stock in 2017 at $11, emboldened by the "superb" 10-year track record of Altium's management 
team. Their new five-year business plan looked just as promising, with ambitious expansion into new markets 
planned.
Page 2 of 3
It's all about change - the good and the bad; Monday Fundie
Happily, a bigger player recognised that potential and took Altium out. Japanese semiconductor company Renesas 
Electronics offered $9.1 billion for Altium at $68.50 a share. The stock was delisted last year.
"Even in our best scenarios, we didn't come out with that type of price," recalls Sequeira.
Australian Eagle, which used to be Alleron, is a boutique investment manager focused on large-cap Australian 
equities. Its team of seven oversees $1.1 billion across a long-only fund and a long-short fund, meaning it can bet 
on share prices going down.
The fund's signature strategy is to identify signs of change in a business - good and bad - and anticipate what this 
means for earnings growth or quality.
"We want that improvement to be the thing that drives our investment returns and what will affect the company over 
the next three or five years," explains Sequeira. This means Australian Eagle typically holds a stock longer than its 
peers (it has owned hearing implant company Cochlear for more than 20 years). Investments typically start as a 
small position - 1 per cent - and build over time.
Likewise, when things look bad it's time to exit or even short the stock.
Australian Eagle will cut its losses and move fast when companies don't meet its expectations. "We get out 
relatively quickly because that means we don't know what's going on," Sequeira says.
The long-only strategy has a 20-year track record and returned 12 per cent before fees since inception, compared 
with the S&P/ASX 100 Accumulation Index's 8.4 per cent. The fund is only available to wholesale investors.
The long-short strategy, after fees, has returned 14.6 per cent a year on average, or 4.1 percentage points above 
the benchmark. As well as Cochlear, it owns QBE Insurance and Telix Pharmaceuticals.
A short bet on Paladin Energy and a long position in infrastructure investment company Infratil were among the 
biggest detractors in January.
In 2022, Australian Eagle partnered with Montgomery Investment Management to manage its Australian large-cap 
portfolios and distribute the Australian Eagle long-short fund to a broader set of investors.
Sequeira is bullish on property developer Dexus, and nuclear and silicon enrichment technology company Silex 
Systems. The stocks are among the portfolio's most undervalued companies, in his opinion, and a reason the fund 
increased its stake in both last month.
Sequeira expects big returns from Dexus should management execute its strategy of growing funds under 
management.
As for Silex, in which the fund holds a tiny position, Sequeira anticipates significant benefits should its laser 
technology be proven or adopted by the United States to counter Russian dominance in the sector.
In September last year, Sequeira sold Ramsay Healthcare shares after realising the company would not succeed 
as quickly as the fund hoped in a strategic turnaround. Australian Eagle had bought Ramsay shares on the belief 
that the private hospital operator would rationalise its asset base by selling assets in Europe. But when Ramsay's 
management team decided to keep them, the fund manager exited at $43.
"We started a small position that didn't work out according to our plan, and we got out at a small loss," says 
Sequeira, who bought in at $54 in 2023.
As chief investment officer, he has final say in all portfolio decisions.
Growing up in the western Sydney suburb of Pendle Hill, Sequeira wanted to be a petroleum engineer until he got a 
taste for financial markets working at Citibank after his year 12 exams.Page 3 of 3
It's all about change - the good and the bad; Monday Fundie
Crossing over into investment management he was mentored by Hung, one of the founders of Australian Eagle and 
still a sounding board as chairman of the investment firm. Sequeira was part of the team that started out in 2005 
with $15 million in seed money from St George Bank. This month, the fund celebrated its 20-year anniversary.
One of his biggest regrets is having sold out of software company Technology One too soon. He first bought the 
stock in 2006 at 70¢ and sold it at $1 in 2010, only to watch Technology One transform into a $10 billion company. 
Last year, Australian Eagle decided to buy back in at $16.50.
The team is still reviewing what it missed in the first run.
For Sequeira, selling too early is more painful than getting a stock wrong because the missed opportunity is more 
costly to portfolio performance than divesting at a small loss. "That's something you learn from," he says.

Traditional owners in Western Australia are seeking more than $1bn in compensation for the Solomon Hub iron ore 
mine, but mining giant Fortescue Metals Group and the WA government say their claim is worth less than $10m.
The federal court justice Stephen Burley is hearing final submissions this week in the long-running legal dispute  
between the Western Australian government, Fortescue (FMG) and the Yindjibarndi people over the multibillion-
dollar iron ore mine in the Pilbara region.
Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation is seeking a collective $1.8bn in compensation for economic, cultural, 
spiritual and social losses and harm since mining operations began almost a decade ago with state government 
approval, which it argues was given without its consent.
In its most recent budget, the WA government estimates it will garner more than $9bn in royalties  from mining with 
about a quarter of that coming from iron ore.
It has been reported that the Solomon Hub iron ore mine has generated an estimated $80bn in revenue for 
Fortescue since 2013.
Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation alleged that Fortescue began mining in 2013 without any permissions 
or discussions with native title holders but with state government approvals under the then Barnett government.

Lawyers acting for the Yindjibarndi applicants told the court last week that complex relationships nurtured from birth 
until death, through marriages, funerals, lore and oral traditions, had been severely impacted through Fortescue’s 
mining operations.

“This has made very strong emotions and created much, effectively, bereavement in the community, because it was 
so, so important,” Tina Jowett SC, said, referring to a detailed anthropological report conducted by Kingsley Palmer 
on behalf of the claimants.
“Relationships that should have been there very strong and enforced through birth, death, marriage, men making 
ceremonies have collapsed since 2007.”
Fortescue argued in its submission  filed last week that traditional owners are not entitled to compensation for any 
alleged discord, saying that disagreements and disputes arose from different views among Yindjibarndi and the 
mining company’s activities on the land.
“Part of that dispute was about whether (and on what terms) the YP should agree with FMG to land access. 
Because different YP [Yindjibarndi people] members within the YP had different views about whether an agreement 
should be made, it cannot be said that FMG caused the alleged disharmony.”
Fortescue claimed any acrimony within community was not within the purview of current legislation, with the mining 
company writing in court documents published last week: “Such ‘social division’ or ‘disharmony’ is not compensable 
under the [Native Title Act].
“A sum of no more than $8 million for the YP’s non-economic loss would reflect Australian standards that are 
appropriate, fair and just. Such a sum involves a very generous assessment.”
On Tuesday, Brahma Dharmananda SC, acting for Fortescue, argued that cultural and spiritual loss must be 
considered appropriately and in line with public sentiment in society.
“Value judgment, in our submission, should not be coloured by false questions about the preparedness of mining 
companies in other cases, to share a royalty percentage of their gains from minerals.
“Our submission, properly focused on the impact of the attachment to the land and or connection to Country, 
cultural loss cannot include a claimed loss if it does not show an impact on the Native Title holders spiritual 
connection to the land.”
In its final submission to the federal court earlier this month, the WA government argued compensation for cultural 
losses under current legislation was not a “mathematic equation” but should be in line with community expectations 
with the compensation valued at between “$5-10 million”.
Compensation for economic loss of the land loss “amounts to $92,957.31,” it said.
The WA government, in its statement also argued that the arguments for compensation were “fundamentally 
flawed”, with compensation being sought under grounds that were not covered by native title legislation.
The Yindjibarndi Ngurra Aboriginal Corporation chair and lead applicant, Michael Woodley, told Guardian Australia 
that he believed the case was a landmark in that it had the power to reshape how mining’s cultural, social and 
economic impacts on First Nations people are understood.
Woodley said that mining companies could pay a far greater share of their profits to traditional owners if they were 
successful in their claim: “If resource developments are coming on to our land, then they’ll have to acknowledge 
that now the courts have established there is a certain percentage of royalties or resource benefit [to traditional 
owners].”Page 3 of 3

But he said that as outlined in court, the impact on the once pristine lands, waters and hundreds of important 
cultural sites had taken a psychological toll on him and the Yindjibarndi people: “The emotion of the land being 
picked up, blown up and exploited, impacted on … That’s a heavy burden for us to carry, both in a physical and a 
spiritual sense.”
The Yindjibarndi people were awarded exclusive native title rights to their land, including where Solomon Hub sits, 
in 2017.
The final submissions were continuing this week with a judgment expected later this year.

Andrew "Twiggy" Forrest beams out from the cover of the latest edition of TIME magazine. Hand on hip, Canadian 
tuxedo, he is shown emerging from the dust at Fortescue's Christmas Creek mine site in Western Australia: "The 
planet's unlikely ally".
TIME's slow descent from the world's most influential magazine to Boomers' outdated bathroom read is complete.
As TIME was pitching Twiggy for leading the global green revolution, the hydrogen bubble he has invested billions 
in is suffering. Last week, Fortescue announced it was considering halting its commissioned hydrogen projects. 
This included its only significant project in the space: a green hydrogen refuelling plant in Arizona it has sunk 
$US550 million of capex into.
By sheer coincidence, last week was also when Nikola Motors filed for bankruptcy in the US.
Nikola had promised to be the Tesla of hydrogen-powered vehicles. At its peak in 2020, the car start-up was worth 
$US13 billion. It was pitching carbon-free trucks, and soon had a partnership with General Motors. Reservations 
were coming out of its ears.
Nikola's hydrogen trucks (which are still relatively rare at a commercial scale) gained unwanted notoriety because 
of a 2018 video promo, showing one of them gliding through the desert. See it was true Nikola trucks were running 
without carbon-spewing engines, as the promo promised, but they weren't doing so on hydrogen. Instead, the 
company would admit in 2020, they were just rolling down gradual inclines.
Then-CEO Trevor Milton was jailed for fraud. Nikola tried to push on with the hydrogen dream. It found a willing 
buyer for its Arizona hydrogen refuelling plant in Fortescue, which paid $US24 million for the facility in 2023.
But any hope their trucks would one day exist at-scale was buried when the bankruptcy notice was signed by the 
hand of Nikola's former director Andy Vesey last week.
Vesey's a former CEO of AGL Energy. His current role is as the top clean energy executive in North America for 
Fortescue.
Page 2 of 4
REAR WINDOW Twiggy's hydrogen bets might be nothing but 'philanthropy'
To complete the hat trick of hot air howlers, European hydrogen-powered truck outfit Hyvia also went into liquidation 
last week. Hyvia was a joint venture by French carmaker Renault and US power company Plug Power - where 
Twiggy's interests make an appearance.
Fortescue had a memorandum of understanding to buy a stake in Plug's Texas green hydrogen project as part of 
its now-defunct expansion plans. They also planned to be partners for Fortescue's Gladstone hydrogen 
electrolyser factory in Queensland. Neither deal eventuated.
You wouldn't know from the TIME article that Forrest's hydrogen plans have all the appeal of an inert gas. Instead, 
readers bathe in marvelling at the "climate activist-meets-zealous prosecutor" who has "rugged features". It's funny 
how these big features about Forrest are usually in northern hemisphere media. Local journos take his claims with a 
bigger grain of salt.
Twiggy's "crown jewel", the TIME piece continues, is a $4 billion deal with German company Liebherr to turn 
Fortescue's mining fleet green with battery and hydrogen-powered trucks. The first prototype of the latter arrived, 
naturally, at TIME's photoshoot location in the Pilbara last year. Testing is still under way. Hopefully, there are a few 
hills around Christmas Creek he can push them down.
But if it doesn't work out? There is one telling concession in the TIME piece that Twiggy may be concerned that 
hydrogen is not the green money dream he envisaged. Dismissing quarterly returns as a "lazy" corporate fixation, 
he tells TIME that people need to look to the medium or long term in their bets on decarbonisation. The company 
has separately reiterated that while the timelines of its hydrogen projects have changed, the overall ambition has 
not.
"And if we lose money on this in the long term, people say, well, that's philanthropy."
That is not a word you hear used to describe billions of dollars of shareholder investment for a listed company.
Nikola and Hyvia must be kicking themselves they didn't shrug off their bankruptcies to investors: Well, that's 
philanthropy!
Ambulance chasers circle Slater and Gordon over email leak
It's the circle of life, or at least of plaintiff law. The ambulance chasers at Slater and Gordon have become the 
chasees as rival compensation firms pitch for victims of the firm's mass data leak to become their clients.
Personal injury firm AC Lawyers, a boutique outfit on the New South Wales South Coast, posted a callout on 
Facebook. "Impacted by the Slater & Gordon email leak? You may be able to make a claim for compensation. 
Contact us for a confidential discussion," it shared with a link to its site.
Rivals were more subtle. Two Slaters employees affected by the leak told us they have been privately contacted by 
different law firms inquiring whether staff were considering taking action.
It could even turn into a class action. More than 900 staff members were included in the privacy breach, which 
involved a "fraudulent" all-staff email.
The scandalous email, sent on Friday purportedly by the outgoing head of human resources Mari Ruiz-Matthyssen 
(which she denies sending), contained a spreadsheet detailing the salaries, bonuses, performance ratings and 
tenures of 906 staff members.
Though Slaters has dismissed the email as full of inaccuracies, more than a dozen staffers confirmed the 
information it contained about their pay was correct.
It also contained serious allegations of misconduct by staff members within the human resources division, scathing 
assessments of their competency, and personal details. If they're true, it's a privacy complaint waiting to happen.Page 3 of 4
REAR WINDOW Twiggy's hydrogen bets might be nothing but 'philanthropy'
Maurice Blackburn, Slaters' main competitor, is already acting for the firm's former HR boss Alicia Gleeson in an 
employment claim. It also took on former Slaters payroll manager Bridget Maddox's similar claim this week. Both 
matters are unrelated to the email.
Slaters has fought a few data breach court cases for victims before. It's even got one on foot with a massive class 
action on behalf of victims of the Optus hack. It was running one on the Medicare breach too, before it was wrapped 
into Baker McKenzie's.
Slaters has built its reputation on protecting employees who have been harmed in the course of their employment. 
There must be a few corporates on the receiving end of the firm's class action tactics who are ready to watch this 
unfold with some healthy schadenfreude.
Perhaps Slaters has picked up a few tricks on how to handle these matters if they're on the other side.
Barrenjoey star's home sale after domestic fight
Barrenjoey's co-head of equity markets, Dyson Bowditch, and his TV presenter wife, Jessica Bowditch, have hung 
the "for sale" sign on their Victorian terrace home on Sydney Harbour.
The four-bedroom, four-bathroom house at Darling Point was recently listed by Sotheby's.
Bought by the pair for $7.9 million in 2021, it is listed for auction in a month's time. Considering its prime location, 
there's talk that the agents and vendors are eyeing eight figures.
Dyson is one of the most high-profile bankers in Barrenjoey's stable, one level below founders Guy Fowler and 
Matthew Grounds. Jessica is a former TV presenter on Channel Seven and Ten. A night at their home has been the 
talk of the finance community.
In November last year, police were called by Jessica to the home to respond to a domestic incident. A statement 
from police said the officers were told Jessica had allegedly assaulted Dyson. She was then charged with assault.
There were media reports the argument started over a watch bought overseas. There's not much more to say 
because Jessica is facing court in a few weeks, where it is understood she will deny the charge.
"The allegation is extremely minor and involves Ms Bowditch picking up a pillow and hitting Mr Bowditch with it," 
Jessica's lawyer Paul McGirr said in a statement. "Certainly this is not the crime of the century."
Dyson runs Barrenjoey's ECM unit with Jabe Jerram, with the two forming an inseparable double act in some of the 
largest recent equity raises.
Dyson and Jabe co-ran the book on Barrenjoey's successful IPO of Guzman y Gomez last year. The duo were 
working the room on the ASX floor in June.
Some deals have been more successful than others. The ECM twins were behind the scenes for Star 
Entertainment's more than $1.5 billion of new equity in 2023. The first, in February, raised $800 million at $1.20 a 
share; the second, in November, was priced at 60¢ a share for $750 million. The casino group is close to 
bankruptcy, and shares are now trading at 13¢. They don't all soar like the burrito rocket!
Dyson and Jabe's appetite to take on deals others won't touch means they're in the orbit of the city's largest fund 
managers. Dyson has been spotted a few times grabbing coffee with Regal's Phil King down by Circular Quay.
Jessica has been keeping a low profile, raising the pair's two children. Both declined to comment. Friends say 
they're now going through a divorce, and selling the house at the centre of last year's fight is part of that.

Australia's biggest promoter of green hydrogen, Andrew Forrest, has axed an investment pact with US hydrogen 
giant Plug Power in the latest blow for the hyped clean energy power source, as developers pull back from projects 
following the election of Donald Trump.
The billionaire's Fortescue has been a major cheerleader for the nascent technology, signing a multi-pronged deal 
in 2022 to partner with Plug Power both as a potential supplier of electrolysers for the company's projects, and as a 
joint venture partner with Fortescue in the US hydrogen market.
The pair inked a deal for the Australian resources major to take up to a 40 per cent stake in Plug's Texas hydrogen 
plant and for Plug to take up to a 25 per cent stake in a plant Fortescue wants to build in -Arizona.
However, Fortescue told The Australian the partnership has now been dissolved as it more broadly reconsiders its 
own development timelines for pushing ahead with projects.
It signals an ongoing retreat by the nation's most prominent cheerleader for green hydrogen, with Dr Forrest only a 
few years ago boasting that the company's green-energy ambitions would one day make it -bigger than the world's 
biggest oil producer, Saudi Aramco.
The Australian revealed this week that more than 60 projects have been paused or shut down due to high 
production costs, infrastructure bottlenecks and soft -demand from would-be inter-national buyers.
When Fortescue and Plug signed the investment accord in 2023, a joint statement spoke of a common mission to 
build out and scale up a global green hydrogen ecosystem.
"We believe there is strong demand globally for the green hydrogen we will produce and we must move quickly to 
meet that demand," Fortescue said in October 2023.
However, last year Dr Forrest launched a sweeping restructure at For-tescue in the face of the -company's failure to 
deliver on its green-energy -promises.

Fortescue said in February this year it was reconsidering the development time frames for its green hydrogen 
project in Arizona and for a green hydrogen project in Gladstone in Queensland linked to its electrolyser 
manufacturing facility.
Plug Power said on Wednesday its Texas plant had now been delayed due to Mr Trump's anti-green energy focus, 
a fresh setback after it had already announced $US971m in writedowns earlier this week and looming job cuts.
Fortescue and Plug in Australia had previously teamed up for the Gibson Island ammonia plant in Queensland but 
the project has -effectively been shelved amid concerns over high power prices.
One of Australia's biggest renewable energy investors, the AustralianSuper-backed Quinbrook Infrastructure 
Partners, said green hydrogen had been hit by a reality check.
"The hope around green hydrogen is getting a dose of the fundamental cost challenges that appear unlikely to be 
overcome by any of the production tax credits that might be on offer," Quinbrook co-founder David Scaysbrook 
said.
"Some of the projects were overly ambitious in expecting a market to develop and I think ultimately there's been a 
lack of customer demand at the price points. Everyone's hopes around market development and customers 
committing just haven't materialised." As part of its flagship Future Made in Australia plan, the -Albanese 
government in 2024 provided a budget allocation of $6.7bn to provide a $2 incentive for every kilogram of green 
hydrogen produced from 2027-28. It also committed $2bn for new projects under the Hydrogen Headstart program.
"That $2 per kilogram hasn't been enough to make a difference," Mr Scaysbrook said. "It certainly doesn't appear to 
be making enough difference for the projects that are now falling over." In the US, green hydrogen producers were 
expecting to tap into a $US3/kg tax incentive. But Mr Trump has indicated the Inflation Reduction Act which 
contained the subsidy is likely to be wound back.
"Probably under this administration no one will be developing green hydrogen projects in the US even with the 
$US3 /kg leg-up - even if it remained," Mr Scaysbrook said.
Green hydrogen - produced by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen through zero-emissions technologies - has 
so far proven to be more hype than a major new energy source, its critics maintain.
The battle to build a hydrogen export industry from scratch also looms as a major political divide ahead of the 
federal election. Labor has included green hydrogen as a central plank in its plan for Australia to become a 
renewable energy superpower. Energy Minister Chris Bowen said in September it was "no exaggeration" to say 
green hydrogen would be on the ballot paper.

Fortescue pursued a $200 million deal to buy West Virginia coal assets in 2022 because chairman Andrew Forrest 
wanted to cultivate a relationship with a key Democratic senator who was playing kingmaker to the Biden 
administration's flagship climate and energy legislation at the time.
Internal documents provided to a Connecticut court as part of a dispute between the mining giant and its one-time 
US partner show Democrat senator Joe Manchin was personally trying to broker a deal between Fortescue and the 
American company that owned the coal-fired generators in the same week he cast the deciding vote on the 
passage of the $US369 billion Inflation Reduction Act.
Known as the IRA, the scheme had the potential to unlock billions of dollars worth of taxpayer support for the sort of 
green hydrogen projects that Forrest wanted Fortescue to build. The documents show Forrest lost interest in plans 
to buy the West Virginia assets from Energy Harbor as soon as Manchin used his vote to secure the passage of the 
green subsidy scheme.
Evidence of a close relationship between Forrest and Manchin has emerged from the lawsuit filed by Fortescue's 
former partner in the bid for the assets, the family office of US billionaire Paul Tudor Jones.
The Tudor Jones camp is seeking compensation from Fortescue for costs incurred during their short partnership, 
and has argued that the ASX-listed company was interested in buying the coal-fired power stations as a way of 
winning influence over Manchin and, by extension, the IRA.
As evidence, Tudor Jones' flagship company Kid Shelleen presented an email sent by Fortescue's then-North 
American energy president, Paul Browning, to Forrest and other company executives on July 27, 2022.
"We pursued Energy Harbor at AF's [Andrew Forrest's] request based on his Manchin relationship, but there are 
plenty of other retiring coal assets we can pursue in areas with better renewable resource," Browning said in the 
email to executives Julie Shuttleworth and David Hunt.

Browning informed them that Fortescue leaders - including energy boss Mark Hutchinson, energy executive Andy 
Vesey and finance boss Guy Debelle - had decided to walk away from the deal "unless AF wants us to proceed 
based on Manchin relationship".
The email about Fortescue "walking away" from the deal was sent on the same day that Manchin agreed to join his 
fellow Democratic Party representatives in supporting passage of the IRA through the US Senate.
Manchin's support was critical, and could not be taken for granted because he had defied his Democrat colleagues 
by blocking earlier versions of the IRA - formerly known as the Build Back Better Act - on three occasions.
Three days after voting for the IRA, Manchin wrote to Forrest asking why Energy Harbor had not heard from 
Fortescue to finalise the transaction.
"[Energy Harbor executive] Jay Bellingham with Pleasants Power Station says he hasn't heard anything from your 
team in two weeks concerning the sales agreement with you, please reach out and let me know, thank you, Joe 
Manchin," said a copy of Manchin's message to Forrest on July 30, 2022.
The original $US135 million offer lobbed by Fortescue in May 2022 was downgraded to about $US50 million in July 
2022, much to the displeasure of Bellingham.
Vesey told the court in December that he was involved in a call with Forrest, Manchin and Bellingham as they 
attempted to solve disagreements over the deal. At the time, Vesey said Forrest was reluctant to take on the cost of 
rehabilitating land at the coal assets.
"Andrew [Forrest] said, 'we're not cleaning up their mess and that's their responsibility', and Joe Manchin talked to 
Jay Bellingham and agreed with Andrew and said 'it's not their [Fortescue's] responsibility to clean it up, it's yours', 
and that was fundamentally the end of the call," Vesey said.
Fortescue planned to buy the plants and convert them to produce clean hydrogen, which can be burned as a fuel 
or used as a chemical catalyst.
Negotiations with Energy Harbor came amid a frenetic three-year period when Fortescue was striking scores of 
preliminary agreements for clean energy projects around the world.
Vesey told the court that Forrest had targeted West Virginia - a big coal-producing state - so he could demonstrate 
to the world how carbon-intensive economies could be retrofitted to thrive on cleaner industries.
"The opportunity in West Virginia was important to demonstrate we could go into a heavily [coal] dependent state, 
take a ... coal asset that was operating, close it down, turn it into a green hydrogen facility, continue to provide the 
economic benefits to those employees in that community and to have the political support of the two senators and 
the governor at that time," he said.
"The fact that Joe Manchin supported and took a high-risk political position of supporting a conversion of a coal 
plant ... we thought we should participate in making this a reality."
In May 2022, Forrest's close relationship with Manchin was cited by Browning as one of the reasons Energy Harbor 
had selected Fortescue as its preferred bidder, despite the company not being the highest bidder.
"We will now move into exclusive negotiations. I'm sure your visit and Senator Manchin's support were important to 
their decision," Browning wrote in an email sent to Forrest and other executives on May 17, 2022.
Fortescue's $US135 million preliminary offer to Energy Harbor had not been disclosed to any sharemarkets at the 
time of the May 2022 email, but regardless, Browning suggested to Forrest that he should let Manchin know that 
preferred bidder status had been secured.Page 3 of 3

"You might want to drop a note to the senator. Something like 'Joe, in confidence I want to let you know that we 
recently submitted our bid for Pleasants and Sammis power plants and Energy Harbor has accepted it and informed 
us that we will now move into exclusive negotiations. Your interest and support made all the difference and I thank 
you.'," Browning said in the same May email to Forrest and other Fortescue executives.
On July 10, 2022, Hunt, who at the time was Fortescue's chief commercial officer for the North American energy 
division, wrote to Vesey, Browning and former Fortescue executive Felicity Gooding about the fact Fortescue had 
lowered its offer to Energy Harbor from $US135 million to about $US50 million.
Hunt implied that Fortescue would have driven a harder bargain were it not for its desire to foster a relationship 
with Manchin. "If it were not for the Manchin angle, I'd be advocating for taking an aggressive stance, but I think that 
we need a wider view on the decision," Hunt wrote.
Fortescue declined to comment.
Manchin announced in November 2023 that he would not seek re-election, and is now an adviser at Bondi Partners, 
a lobbying firm run by former federal treasurer Joe Hockey, and Apollo Global Management.
"Connecting businesses to West Virginia has been a top priority because our state has always been, and must 
continue to be, a powerhouse for America's future," Manchin said when asked about the transaction.
"I am proud of the work we did in passing the IRA to strengthen America's energy independence. Today, we are 
producing more fossil and renewable energy than at any point in our history. I have remained steadfast in my 
commitment to an all-of-the-above energy strategy - one that embraces every resource at our disposal while 
ensuring economic growth and national security.
"I have always believed that hydrogen is one of the most promising clean fuels for the future, and as we continue to 
advance and mature the technology, it has the potential to play a major role in our energy landscape."
Manchin and Forrest eventually dropped their support for the IRA.
Fortescue said in February that it was considering pausing its hydrogen projects, including a $US550 million 
hydrogen refuelling station it was building in Arizona.
