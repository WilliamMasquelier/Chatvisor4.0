As the experts and soothsayers look at the tea leaves and entrails for another guess at what might happen in the 
New Year, 2023's erratic market movements showed how predicting the mood and the intent of the market gods 
should be left to the Chatbot.
Soaring interest rates meant the sharemarket was supposed to slump as we plunged into recession, but neither 
happened. The oil price was meant to soar after the Middle East hostilities erupted, but the rally quickly fizzled 
before a late rally.
The bitcoin price was meant to either collapse or hit $US100,000, but did neither.
Lithium was mean to soar on the "stronger for longer" battery hype, but went flat as a nightman's hat in the last 
months of the year.
More predictably, the Ukraine war grinds on - and so does Vladimir Putin, who was meant to have been poisoned or 
have succumbed to cancer or Parkinson's disease. (Alternatively, he has been dead for some time and his role as 
global villain has been fulfilled by a body -double.) The hazards of predicting the unpredictable were reflected in 
your columnist's forgettable small-cap share tips for 2023, which resulted in some steep losses among industrial 
picks such as small retailers and even some sexy battery metal plays.
But we did find a winner in Vysarn (ASX:VYS), which provides pumping and aquifer management systems for the 
mining sector (the stock almost -doubled).
Uranium stock 92 Energy(92E) made a late play to lift our averages by agreeing to merge with Canada's Atha Corp, 
a deal that sent 92E shares up 24 per cent. We also lucked it with Breaker Resources, taken over by Ramelius 
Resources (RMS) at a 40 per cent premium.
Following hours of due diligence with shady broker types at Melbourne's legendary Mitre Tavern, here are our wild 
stabs at glory for 2024.
Acusensus (ACE) The camera road enforcement mob won't win any plaudits from libertarian motorists, but if they 
can catch more mobile phone-using idiots then good on 'em, we say. Acusensus operates transportable mobile

phone and seat belt detection cameras, based on its tech that enables the cameras to peep through tinted 
windows.
The company has contracts with NSW, Queensland and ACT road authorities and recently won its first US phone-
seatbelt contract in North Carolina. Acusensus cites $154m of contracted revenue since being founded in 2018, 
with $40m of new and varied deals over the last year.
Management is vague about the outlook but promises increased revenue this year based on existing contracts. In 
2022-23 Acusensus posted revenue of $42m, up 46 per cent and a slender $400,000 net profit. The past year has 
gone relatively well, with September quarter revenue of $12.1m (up 22 per cent) and $2.9m of operating cash flow. 
Acusensus shares have lost 80 per cent of their value since listing last January. But they've gained about 16 per 
cent in the December half. The company's $100m market cap is supported by cash of $25m.
Camplify (CHL) Does this sound familiar? Spend $100,000 on a recreational vehicle (RV) for the road trip of a 
lifetime, only for the jalopy to rust in the driveway.
The Airbnb of the campervan world, Camplify intermediates renting deals between van owners and users. Its 
premise is that 800,000 privately owned RVs in Australia and most of them sit in the driveway for 46 weeks of the 
year. A year ago, Camplify acquired the Berlin-based equivalent PaulCamper, adding Germany, Austria and The 
Netherlands to its operations, which already covered the Britain, Spain and New Zealand. The $47m purchase 
doubled the size of Camplify's business overnight and bolstered its position in specialist insurance products.
Camplify recorded total transaction value (TTV) of $146m in the year to June 2023, up 172 per cent. Revenue 
climbed 133 per cent to $38m, with turnover in NZ surging 1100 per cent. Camplify facilitates 81,933 bookings at an 
average fee of $1733. Camplify's clip of the ticket last year declined to 26 per cent because of the PaulCamper 
purchase but management hopes to get it back over 30 per cent.
The site lists 15,000 RVs here and 18,000 in Europe, a fraction of the market relative to van ownership of 790,000 
here and 5.6 million on the continent.
Reckon (RKN) Shareholders in the accounting software veteran thought they had their payday when the company 
sold its accountant practice management arm for $100m in mid-2022 - more than the company's market cap at the 
time.
In recent years Reckon has been overshadowed by the likes of "cloud" accounting innovator Xero in its traditional 
SME domain. But the company is migrating customers to its own cloud Reckon One platform, which could enhance 
Reckon's value as a takeover target. In the meantime, Reckon has expanded into practice management systems 
for law firms in the US and Britain, which broker Taylor Collison dubs a "gem in the making".
Reckon turned over $28m in the first (June) half, for a $4m net profit and a 2.5c per share dividend. The stock 
trades on a current year multiple of 11 times and a 4.5 per cent yield, fully franked.
Highcom (HCL) Formerly known as Xtek, ballistics maker Highcom should be shooting the lights out, but its shares 
have lost more than a third of their value this year.
Highcom also produces unmanned drones and body armour and helmets, based on its proprietary tech. It has an 
Ohio-based ballistics division and the company is in the throes of moving its Adelaide-based R&D division to the 
US. Highcom generated a record $98m of revenue and made a record $5.7m profit in the 2022-23 year. The recent 
AGM was replete with talk of new contracts - notably with the local Department of Defence - and an overall $375m 
pipeline of opportunities "at various stages".
As with the company's ballistic vests, why have the shares copped such flak? The answer appears to be that 
cracking the US military establishment is a hard grind and sales have not been as good as expected. Inventories 
crept up to $25.7m from $16.4m previously. By moving to the US, the company hopes to be seen as an apple-pie 
US supplier. In fact, it must because by law all kit for the US military must be made there.Page 3 of 3

Dimerix (DXB) Having toiled away at a kidney drug for years, in October the drug developer hit the jackpot with a 
partnering deal for its yet-to-be-approved treatment for the rare disease focal segmental glomerulo-sclerosis 
(FSGS). Dimerix shares popped more than threefold after the news of the deal with Advanz Pharma Corp. The deal 
only pertains to European and local regions and does not cover the US, so a follow-up deal is expected. And interim 
results from the key two-year supporting Phase 3 study are slated for March 2024. The outcome, admittedly, is 
binary: the drug will either be approved or it won't.
4D Medical (4DX) The lung imaging house had a bonza end to 2023 on the back of contract wins, approvals and 
reimbursement deals in the US.
The final stanza was last month's $38.5m purchase of US med tech outfit Imbio, funded by a $35m placement. A 
leader in lung and heart artificial intelligence, Imbio is generating revenue and will expand 4D's product reach 
beyond its four approved products. 4D's AI and cloud-based tech enables clinicians to detect fine particles in the 
lungs, especially for the millions of US veterans suffering the effects of toxic open-air "burn pits" in combat zones 
such as Iraq.
Kogan (KGN) The pure-play online retailer's shares have lost about 80 per cent of their value since peaking at 
around $25 in the peak pandemic times of October 2020. The return to normality left Kogan with excess inventory 
and a suspicion the best times were behind Ruslan Kogan's creation, which includes brands such as Kogan Mobile, 
Kogan Travel, Kogan Money and Dick Smith.
But Kogan's 2022-23 results showed a decent sixfold bounce in underlying earnings, with the inventory position 
"rightsized" to $68m. The company also has no debt and cash of $65m to support its $540m valuation.
Analysts are tracking the rollout of the Kogan First loyalty program, which has attracted 401,000 subscribers in its 
early days.
Dicker Data (DDR) Most tech companies pride themselves on cutting-edge innovation and start-ups wear persistent 
losses as a badge of pride.
But for Dicker Data it's a case of sticking with the simple business of selling other parties' hardware and software 
and making money from it. Over 45 years, founder David Dicker has seen all the momentous advances - such as 
the advent of the PC and the internet - as well as the IT fads. Over that time, the business has rarely failed to 
increase year-to-year revenue and profitability.
Aumake (AUK) With China-Australia trade relations recovering from a dismal low, some investors are pondering 
how to ride the theme beyond going long on Treasury Wine Estates (a key beneficiary of a soon-to-be abolished 
wine tariff).
The low-key, Parramatta-based Aumake sells products such as health supplements and wool and skincare items 
into China, through both online and via physical stores. Having closed its 15 Australian stores during the pandemic, 
Aumake is seeking to re-establish its local presence.
Aumake posted perkily higher September quarter receipts of $6.4m with cash outflows of $630,000. The company's 
sub $10m market cap reflects plenty of upside - and oodles of risk.

Here are three beneficiaries of a new lower-rates environment Cash is king, right?
According to Davide Bosio, director of corporate finance and West Australian state manager at Shaw and Partners, 
it's certainly had a good run in the sun. Inflation, recessions and stifled economic growth have dominated 
investment fundamentals, but given the swift increase of interest rates last year, Bosio reckons investors have been 
able to take advantage of cash as a genuine, no-risk investment class paying more than 5 per cent in some 
instances.
But now there's a whiff of lower rates in the air, we may see investors adjust their asset allocation into higher 
risk/return sectors.
Beneficiaries? Bosio likes real estate investment trust funds (REITs) and listed investment companies (LICs) that 
may have a funding cost (debt profile) that will improve in an environment where rates decline.
And because he's dedicated gold bull, Bosio says the gold sector looks perfectly positioned for strength.
Here are his three picks for the great unwind: Ramelius Resources: "Strong balance sheet, new projects being 
developed to drive production and acquisitive team/management who have executed a consistent strategy to 
acquire targets whereby they can leverage discovery success and production ounces." WAM Capital: WAM is a 
listed investment company with a focus on small to medium-sized businesses and a large, diversified portfolio.
"Weak performance in the current environment has resulted in a lower share price. However, the yield has been 
historically high and a significant attraction to income-focused investors," Bosio says.
Centuria Capital: An REIT with various listed alternatives including office and industrial companies. For Bosio, 
Centuria is a quality small-cap property company with a strong track record of acquiring and managing assets.
Broker upgrades Ord Minnett likes the look of Dropsuite. Founded in Singapore in 2011, Dropsuite is a cloud-based 
software platform offering back-up, archiving and recovery solutions for businesses.

How to cash in as risk returns
The company specialises in protecting critical data used by Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, QuickBooks and 
others. Its products are distributed via a network of about 4000 IT reseller partners globally.
At the Inspire Conference 2023 in August, it copped a bit of a hit when Microsoft provided a first look at its 365 
Backup and Archive solution. Dropsuite's price fell 22 per cent on the day and has not recovered since.
Ord Minnett was not convinced. "Based on our work and discussions with industry participants, we conclude that 
fears of any existential risk to DSE's business are overblown. Accordingly, we believe the market's scepticism is 
providing an opportunity." Ords has initiated a buy rating on the stock with a price target of 33c, against about 28c 
at present.
Ord Minnett believes DSE operates at the intersection of three mega-trends - the rise of cybercrime, the migration 
of on-premise hosting to the cloud, and managed service provider industry growth.
It is also impressed with the fact DSE management has built a $150m business on just $43m of outside capital (of 
which only about $18m has been spent), and delivered positive free cash flow in each of the past six quarters.
Over at Taylor Collison, IPD Groupis on the radar.A distributor of electrical infrastructure products to major 
construction and renewables projects nationwide, IPD offers a "picks and shovel" exposure to the booming 
electrical sector without taking on individual project or contract risks common to contractors and other listed players.
This is an industry that's booming, and Taylor Collison reckons there's a strong argument we are still in the early 
stages of a major infrastructure project upswing.
It's put a 12-month price target of $4.80 on IPD, versus a price of about $4.69 this week. "Their capital allocation 
record is excellent, and there's a long runway to deploy capital to match the market leader's offering," it says.

Ramelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript
I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Mark Zeptner, Managing Director. Please go ahead.
Mark Zeptner
Thank you, Travis. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to dial into Ramelius' December 2023 
quarterly conference call. I'm joined this morning for the first time in a speaking role that is by acting CFO, Ben 
Ringrose, who will provide some detail on the quarterly financials after I've run through the highlights.
As usual, there will be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions before we finish up the call. As you will have 
seen this morning we reported quarterly gold reduction of 68,524 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of AUD1,837 
per ounce which is towards the upper end of our quarterly guidance of 60,000 to 70,000 ounces, and also in line 
with internal forecasts that has production increasing over the course of the financial year. The increase in the 
December quarter was primarily attributable to a greater contribution from Penny underground and also mining at 
the Symes' open-pit operation ramping up.
As I said, Ben will delve into the financials further, but I wanted to highlight upfront that the increase in production, 
we saw a similar trend with cash generation. Operating cash flow was 68 million with underlying free cash flow 
totaling 45.7 million, our best performance on that front for several years. Further, we anticipate strong cash flows 
will continue over the rest of the financial year and beyond. Including the December quarter contribution, first half 
production totaled 12447 ounces, at an all-in sustaining cost of just under $1,900 an ounce, again ahead of our 
internal budgets and at the upper end of guidance.
You may have noticed we have upgraded second half guidance to 140,000 to 155,000 ounces and consequently 
full year guidance for this financial year has also increased to 265,000 to 280,000 ounces. By way of reminder, 
original guidance was 250,000 to 275,000 ounces. In terms of all-in sustaining costs, the guidance range in the 
second half is AUD1700 to AUD1800, which demonstrates a continuing downward trend and results in full year all-
in sustaining costs for FY24 of AUD1750 to AUD1850. This compared to our original all-in sustaining cost guidance 
of AUD1550 to AUD 1750 with the higher costs attributable to CV01 conveyor appears carried out at Mt Magnet in 
the quarter, which I'll expand on shortly and also an increased production contribution from Edna May, which is the 
higher cost production hub of the two.
The split in production from our two houses were relatively even this quarter with Mt Magnet producing just over 
35,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of AUD1,668 and Edna May also producing just over 33,000 ounces as 
an all-in sustaining cost up to over AUD2,000 per ounce. That breakdown gives an insight into the real impact of 
Penny on costs at Mt Magnet. Although it should be noted that the Edna May all-in sustaining figure does include a 
reasonably significant non-cash component, which relates to the drawdown of existing stockpiles. I'll let Ben to 
explain the actual unit cost detail later.
During the quarter, a total of 36,829 tonnes at 12.39 grams per tonne for 14,296 recoverable ounces was hauled 
from Penny to Mt Magnet. At Penny with multiple stoping areas becoming available, production is expected to 
increase significantly in the second half. On the CV01, mill throughput at Mt Magnet was impacted by repairs to the 
main conveyor structure, which goes from the crusher to the course or stockpile referred to as CV01. They put it out 
of action for approximately nine weeks. We were however able to maintain plant feed, albeit at a slightly lower rate 
through the use of a mobile crushing solution. Thankfully, the conveyer outage didn't prevent us from meeting 
production targets, as the site team and external contractors managed the situation very well, but we did incur some 
extra costs, both sustaining capital for the repairs and operating costs associated with the mobile crushing and 
haulage operation, which added almost AUD180 per ounce to Mt Magnet's quarterly all-in sustaining costs. The 
repairs were completed by mid-December and we have reviewed our structural integrity regime, and have taken 
steps to reduce the likelihood of similar unplanned repairs being required elsewhere in the plant in the future.
The quarter saw completion of mining operations in Marda, with rehab activities now being carried out while 
remaining stockpiles have been hauled to Edna May. At the end of the period, there was almost 450,000 tonnes 
grading 1.71 grams per tonne in stockpiles at Marda. A similar situation is playing out at Tampia where mining 
operations ceased in the middle of last year, and there we have just over 635,000 tonnes at a grade near to 1.5 
grams per tonne in stockpiles at the end of the quarter.Page 3 of 8

On to exploration; highlights in the quarter include results from resource definition work undertaken at Eridanus 
targeting high-grade mineralization for potential underground mining below and outside their plant of a current open 
pit. Among the better intercepts from the [Indiscernible] RC program with 13 meters at 10.4, 12 meters at 12.8, and 
10 meters at 18.1. Important to note, all significantly better grades than what we're seeing at depths previously at 
Eridanus.

At Galaxy underground diamond drilling targeting the Mars ore body produced results including two meters at 28.9 
and four meters at 17.8, whilst diamond drilling at the Bombora deposit, part of the Roe Project acquired from 
Breaker Resources produced first results, which included 4.5 meters at 18.7 and 4.2 meters at 11.1, which were 
from the Tura underground Lode.
Lastly, in terms of the highlights, we wrapped up the acquisition of Musgrave Minerals in October having reached 
the compulsory acquisition threshold of 90% acceptances. Infill and extensional diamond and RC drilling is 
underway at the key project targeting the high-grade Break of Day resource, but also the nearby Waratah 
Prospect. We've only received limited results at this stage. Further information on the expiration program, there's 
plenty of detail in the quarterly itself.
Now that covers the highlights for me. So I'll now hand over to Ben.
Ben Ringrose
Thank you, Mark, and it's a pleasure to be here with you all today. December quarter was indeed a very strong one 
financially for Ramelius with sales revenue of 194.5 million and an associated underlying free cash flow of 47.5 
million, which is after growth and exploration investment. On both metrics, the December quarter was our best since 
June 2020. During the quarter we sold just over 68,000 ounces at an average realized gold price of AUD2,855 an 
ounce, which includes a mix of spot and committed forward sales.
As Mark mentioned, the all-in sustaining costs for the December quarter was AUD1,837 per ounce. Pleasingly both 
production centers reported a low all-in sustaining cost than the prior quarter. At Mt Magnet, 8% reduction in all-in 
sustaining costs was achieved despite the increased costs associated with the one-off CV01 repairs, which, as a 
reminder, added AUD179 per announced to the Mt Magnet all-in sustaining costs for the quarter. Impact of Penny is 
evident here along with the increased tonnages and grades from Mt Magnet's own open pit operations.
Moving on to Edna May, the improved all-in sustaining costs was the result of increased throughput and grades, 
most notably the introduction of the high-grade ore from Symes'. Whilst Edna May is reporting a higher all-in 
sustaining costs than Mt Magnet, it is important to note that this includes a AUD227 per ounce non-cash charge for 
the drawdown of existing Tampia stockpiles. This non-cash component of the Edna May all-in sustaining costs will 
increase over the second half of FY24, as the existing Tampia, Marda and Symes' stockpiles continue to be drilling 
down and monetized.
The resulting operating cash flow from the business was AUD68 million, from which AUD20.9 million was invested 
in growth capital exploration and resource definition. The quarter also saw Ramelius return AUD17.3 million in 
cash to shareholders by our via FY23 dividend paid in October 2023, as well as complete the Musgrave Minerals 
acquisition with a final consideration payment of AUD2.1 million. AUD10.5 million investment in growth capital for 
the quarter mainly related to the Galaxy underground mine and the AUD10.4 million spent on exploration and 
resource definition in the quarter focused on the Rebecca and Roe Gold Project and the recently acquired Cue 
Gold Project. Both capital and exploration spent is in line with our forecast and we have maintained our full-year 
guidance on capital and project development expenditure of AUD50 million to AUD60 million and exploration and 
resource definition expenditure of AUD30 [Phonetic] million.
The closing cash and gold position of AUD281.8 million was our best on record leaving Ramelius in a very healthy 
financial position. Further to this, a total of AUD9.2 million was received from the -- was due from the ATO in 
December. However, the late payment of this by the ATO meant these funds were only received by Ramelius in Page 4 of 8

the first week of January. Notionally, including this, the reported cash and gold at 31 December would have been 
AUD291 million. In addition to the strong cash and gold position is our AUD100 million debt facility, which remains 
in place and undrawn.
The Aussie dollar spot price increased 5% over the December quarter, finishing at just under AUD3,030 an ounce. 
In fact, the Aussie dollar gold price has had a daily closing price above AUD3,000 every day since the 12th of 
October 2023, a trend that is continuing into the March 2024 quarter. What is even more encouraging about this is 
that this AUD3,000 plus gold price was maintained despite the strengthening Aussie dollar pointing to a 
fundamental increase in the US dollar gold value.
During the quarter, we continued to gradually rundown our fixed price contracts delivering 30,000 ounces into 
maturing contracts and replacing 24,000 of these at an average price of AUD3,259 an ounce. At the end of the 
quarter, forward gold sales consisted of 192,000 ounces at an average price of AUD2,918 an ounce over the period 
January 2024 to June 2026. As you will note, our committed ounces have decreased over the financial year and we 
expect this trend to continue for the remainder of FY24. A disciplined hedge book maintenance over the past 12 
months leaves the book in a very healthy position.
Lastly to note on gold sales is that with the increased production forecasted for H2, our exposure to the spot price 
will increase in the second half of FY24.

With that I'll now hand back to Mark.
Mark Zeptner
Thanks Ben. Travis, if we could please open the line up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Hayden Bairstow from Argonaut. Please go 
ahead.
Hayden Bairstow
Hi, good morning guys. Pretty impressive results at Magnet mining wise. I mean just get a field of view to the 
second half and obviously you push guidance a bit higher about Edna May, I mean despite that mill shut down, and 
what -- how are we looking second half on ounces into Magnet, looks like it's going to be a pretty sizable increase.
Mark Zeptner
Yeah. Good morning, Hayden. It's Mark. I don't have the numbers off top my head but it's driven obviously by 
increases at Penny combined with the gradual ramp up at Galaxy but probably more importantly at Magnet is 
reducing strip ratio at Eridanus and improving grades at depth. We're saying that back into it as there was a bit of a 
lower grade section that we mined through for 12 months, but we're back into much better grades at Eridanus. So 
the combination of those three things leads to a very strong second half at Magnet. I'm not sure if you've got the 
numbers Ben but I won't put you on the spot with that. But yeah, we can provide some numbers Hayden.
Hayden Bairstow
Yeah, okay. And just on -- I guess more beyond 2025, just given you locking in hedging, almost 3300 an ounce and 
then does that start to make the stage very cut back at Magnet look like a more attractive option for you guys to sort 
of deliver to production decline there?
Mark ZeptnerPage 5 of 8
Ramelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript
Potentially, you're a little bit ahead of where we're focused on right at the moment. We will be putting out this 
quarter a new Mt Magnet mine plan and then probably turning our attention to see sort of 12 months on from when 
we made the decision to defer stage three where we stand. We're obviously seeing some things in the market labor 
wise that are starting to ease. Unfortunately, that's brought about by some closures of operations, but we think, in a 
couple of months time, we will dust that off and see where we're at, Hayden.
Hayden Bairstow
And the Magnet mine plan, that obviously incorporates all the key stuff, I presume, is that going to come with an 
upgrade to that -- or an update to that three year guidance?
Mark Zeptner
Yeah, the idea with the Mt Magnet mine plan is obviously, including any Penny extensions, which we've already 
flagged, the Q project in its entirety and then obviously, the portfolio of projects at Mt Magnet itself, including 
[Indiscernible] et cetera. There's a whole list of names there, so everything that goes into Mt Magnet out for the 
foreseeable future.
Hayden Bairstow
Alright. Perfectly alluded. Thanks, guys.
Mark Zeptner
Thanks, Hayden.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Barkley from RBC. Please go ahead.
Alex Barkley
Thanks. Good morning Mark and Ben. Question on that strong Edna May production this year. Is that mostly 
around accelerated mining and haulage? Does that mean, it might get pulled forward from FY25 or is there some 
other component to the strong result this year? Thanks.
Mark Zeptner
It is Mark again. Alex, good morning. Stronger performance out of the underground definitely. Since we've 
addressed the water issues, which were prominent mid-to-late last year, the team out there has really hit some 
decent production numbers. It's a small underground, but they are pushing towards 30,000 ton a month there. So 
that may bring forward some production there into 2024. The haulage, I think, has been pretty consistent. The 
ramping up and the inclusion of Symes' sort of has added to that. And I think some of the Symes' grades are 
probably a little better than we might have expected in certain areas of the pit as well. So I don't think we're robbing 
Peter to pay Paul at the Edna May. I think it's better performance, the underground with better grades, and sort of 
consistent haulage like in summer.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Dr. Richard Hatch from Topwheel [Phonetic]. 
Please go ahead.
Richard Hatch
Hello, Mark, and Ben. Happy New Year to you and thanks for another great performance. I thought a brilliant 
performance, particularly with the conveyor belt problems. Obviously, I had a question about it, and may everybody 
does about what happens next, but I'll leave that one alone. One thing I remember talking about, I think last time 
was your hedging of oil and I see you have hedged 5 million liters. I just wondered, how does that 0.991 price 
hedge diesel compare -- beware, I won't judge you because I'm all for hedging for insurance, but how does it 
compare with current price?
Ben Ringrose
Hi, Richard, and thanks for the question. It's Ben here. We put that diesel hedging program in place probably 12 
months ago, and it's served us quite well, I guess over the last 12 months and continue to do so and we have had 
some cash returned on those hedges, which is good. That 91 cents, the price we're paying today is 98 cents, so it's 
marginally in the money. It has been more in the money over the past 12 months but, yeah, it is getting closer.
Mark Zeptner
It's the rebated figure to have [Multiple Speakers].
Ben Ringrose
That's right, yeah.
Mark Zeptner
Yeah, it is not the price you see at the service station.
Ben Ringrose
Yeah.
Richard Hatch
Now I understand that. Well, again, congratulations. That's an interesting area for you to go into but well done being 
winners again. Anyway, thanks for all you've done.
Mark Zeptner
Thanks, Richard.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Ashley Chen from shareholder. Please go ahead.
Ashley Chen
Hi, Mark. Hi, Ben. Thanks again for a nice quarter and your hard work for it. I just have a question on the -- also on 
the diesel hedging strategy. Can you give some more details on your thinking now for the next two, three, four years 
in regards to hedging? I can see production -- if production were to be 550,000 over two years, your current hedge 
book is about 33% hedged? Are you expecting to reduce that to 25%, 20%? That is my first question. And second 
question are something completely different. As you probably know, the government has put a positive duty on 
employers to prevent harassment, sexual harassment, at work and the Australian Human Rights Commission Page 7 of 8
Ramelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript
probably spot the iron ore industry, Rio Tinto, BHP, and its sights at the moment, but eventually you'll come around 
to the gold industry. What programs or what anti-harassment programs Ramelius Resources is planning to 
implementing or planning to implement over the next couple of years?
Ben Ringrose
Thanks, Ashley. I will take those ones. It's Ben. In terms of hedging policy, I think Tim Manners late last year 
reported that the Board is in the process of reviewing our policy and if there are any changes -- obviously, there's 
not a lot of Board meetings through December, January, but if there is any change, then we'll obviously inform the 
market on that one. In the meantime, we are gradually running off our book, as we have been for some time. In 
terms of our duty to prevent harassment, it's not something that we've waited to be told that we should look at it or 
are we planning to. We've been reasonably proactive in that area. When people start with the company, they run 
through workplace behavior training, we have a whistleblower line. I think a lot of the goldies have a lot of these 
things in place, we've assessed our sites for the safety and security, and we're basically taking a no tolerance 
approach to those who crossed the line. Unfortunately, there've been a few cases and those people are no longer 
working for us or the contractors associated with that. So we've done a lot in that area and we continue to try to 
improve.
Ashley Chen
Thank you.
Ben Ringrose
Thanks, Ashley.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for a moment to allow parties to enter the queue. The next question 
comes from Steven Goranson [Phonetic] from RE Funds Management. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Participant
Hi, guys. Just a quick question around Musgrave. What have you seen to date since the acquisition and when do 
you expect to -- for us to start thinking about when we should be seeing Musgrave coming through the mill?
Mark Zeptner
Thanks for the question, Steve. I will answer that. It's Mark. Look, what we're saying is that the team at Musgrave 
did an excellent job in terms of drilling the ore body out and preparing resources and mine plans that are pretty 
close to production ready. Our optimizations and reruns of [Indiscernible] are very similar and very close, which is 
always company. It's not what you'll always find, I have to add. In terms of production, we hope to be developing in 
the second half of this calendar year with -- I'd say, or first or sort of September, August, September, obviously 
ramping up through that period. So perhaps, I sent it earlier than some expect. We've already submitted our mining 
proposal and we're on like the third back and forwards with the department on that. So assuming we get approvals 
prior to June, then we should be ready to go from July onwards.

Andrew Bowler
Hello, gents. Quick one from me. Obviously, handy tax refund post quarter end. Just wondering if you're expecting 
any more over the remainder of the financial year or is that what you're expecting to say?
Ben Ringrose
Hi, Andrew. It's Ben here, I'll take that one. No, that tax refund related to the 2023 tax term, it is a one-off, I guess, 
and we don't expect that to be a recurring throughout the financial year.
Andrew Bowler

Thank you, Travis. I'd just like to make two points to wrap up. Ramelius is one of the few Aussie gold producers 
actually upgrading guidance and therefore we are expecting to deliver a very strong cash flows in the second half of 
FY24. I mean, as already mentioned, we are on track to deliver our new Mt Magnet mine plan this current quarter, 
which promises to include Penny, Cue, as well as all the portfolio of projects at Mt Magnet itself. Thank you for

The sharemarket flirted with record highs on Tuesday as it notched its seventh consecutive day of gains, marking 
its longest winning streak in 10 months.
The S&P/ASX 200 Index rose as much as 0.7 per cent to be just 2.3 points shy of its August 2021 intraday record 
of 7632.8 points, before paring its gains after weaker-than-expected retail sales data.
The benchmark index closed 0.3 per cent higher at 7600.2, still short of its August 2021 record close of 7628.9 
points.
The broader All Ordinaries Index rose 0.3 per cent to 7835 points. Josh Gilbert, markets analyst at eToro, said the 
ASX 200 fell away from record levels but "stayed within touching distance".
Retail sales fell by 2.7 per cent in December, more than reversing the Black Friday-driven bump in November and 
the weakest monthly result since the height of Covid-19 lockdowns in August 2020.
Mr Gilbert said the data backed up the view that rate cuts by the Reserve Bank were on the horizon in the middle of 
the year. "This is what the RBA wanted to see; sales weakening, and we're likely to see further signs of weakening 
in the months ahead," he said.
Investors were focusing on Wednesday's consumer price index data, expected to show that inflation had eased to 
0.8 per cent in the December quarter, with the annual rate falling to a two-year low of 4.3 per cent.
"A reading under expectations, after (Tuesday's) dismal retail print, will see the rate cut expectations brought 
forward, which could be the catalyst the local market needs to take out that record-high close," Mr Gilbert said.
The dollar ignored the retail data and was trading near US66.15c at 5pm AEDT. The tech sector was the strongest 
ASX performer, with Megaport rocketing almost 28 per cent to $12.48 after a stronger-than--expected trading 
update.

Healthcare stocks also gained as biotech giant CSL rose 1.2 per cent to $296.74 and ResMed lifted 1.8 per cent to 
$28.95.
Market and mining heavyweight BHP was up 0.4 per cent at $47.05, while Fortescue hit a record high, closing with 
a 1.5 per cent gain at $29.70.
Nickel Industries jumped almost 21 per cent to 72.5c on the back of record quarterly earnings and production, a 
higher dividend and a $US100m share buyback.
Gold miner Northern Star Resources rose 2.9 per cent to $13.33, and Ramelius advanced 2.9 per cent to $1.58 
after raising its production guidance.
Energy stocks declined after oil prices fell, having reached their highest level since November on Monday amid an 
escalation in Middle East tensions.
Woodside Energy dipped 0.1 per cent to $31.87 and Santos lost 0.5 per cent to $7.76.
Australia's biggest bank, Commonwealth Bank, reached a record high before ending with a 0.1 per cent lift at 
$116.05.
Westpac fell 0.5 per cent to $23.82, ANZ dropped 0.2 per cent to $26.79 and NAB was flat, dipping 0.03 per cent to 
$32.13.
Clothing retailer City Chic soared 26.4 per cent to 55c as it flagged a better-than-expected interim earnings loss and 
the potential sale of its North American business. The local sharemarket's rise followed gains on Wall Street as the 
S&P 500, up 0.8 per cent, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, up 0.6 per cent, both hit fresh records.

Cyprium Metals Ltd (ASX:CYM, OTC:CYPMF) has made a shallow high-grade copper discovery near Cue at the 
Heeler prospect, around 10 kilometres southwest of its Hollandaire copper-gold deposit in Western Australia's 
Murchison Province.
Sitting within Cyprium's portfolio of exploration assets, the Heeler prospect is on tenements at the Cue joint venture 
with Ramelius Resources Ltd (ASX:RMS). The JV is operated by Cyprium, who owns 80% of the rights to base 
metals with 20% owned by Ramelius.
Cyprium is encouraged by a drill intercept of 15 metres at 3.26% copper, 0.70 g/t gold, 7.4 g/t silver and 151ppm 
cobalt from 70 metres downhole in drill hole 24CURC004.
This included a 7-metre intercept at 5.04% copper, 0.81 g/t gold, 11.4 g/t silver, 197ppm cobalt and 0.11% nickel 
from a depth of 71 metres.  
A second intercept in that drill hole returned 3 metres at 1.09% copper and 0.44 g/t gold from 108 metres, including 
1 metre at 2.54% copper and 1.19 g/t gold from 109 metres. 
Cyprium notes that the mineralisation remains open at depth and along strike in both directions within a lightly 
tested copper soil anomaly that extends for 2.5 kilometres along strike.
"Potential for economic orebody"
Page 2 of 3
Cyprium Metals makes shallow high-grade copper discovery at Cue JV's Heeler prospect
Cyprium executive chairman Matt Fifield said: "While the company remains focused on delivering a robust plan for 
Nifty [copper project], we continue to maintain our outstanding portfolio of exploration assets.
"This new Heeler discovery is a great reminder of the prospective value within the company's earlier-stage assets in 
the Paterson and Murchison provinces.
"Our exploration team targeted our limited drilling budget in the Murchison around the most prospective areas and 
hit outstanding grade that shows potential for an economic orebody. It's exciting to have an unexpected shallow 
high-grade hit show up like this.
"With Nifty, Maroochydore, our Murchison portfolio and our Paterson JV with IGO, Cyprium has some of the best 
assets and exploration ground in Australia to deliver into the growing global requirements for copper."
Underexplored base metals potential
"With Heeler, Cyprium continues to build on its copper-gold resource inventory in the Murchison," said Cyprium 
COO Milan Jerkovic.
"We have 203,000 tonnes of copper resource and 153,0000 ounces of gold (100% basis) at the nearby Hollandaire 
and Nanadie Well deposits and follow-up work around Heeler may well bring additional grade and scale into our 
portfolio.
"There are assays from this program outstanding, but we're pleased to have hit shallow high-grade mineralisation."
Cyprium geologist Mark Styles added: "The Cue region is an area that's known for its gold deposits but hasn't been 
well explored for its base metals potential.
"At Heeler, for example, we were attracted by the large, lightly tested +100ppm copper soil anomaly up to 400 
metres wide and 2.5 kilometres long, historic shallow drill results with 0.3% copper in the core of the soil anomaly 
and a coincident geophysical magnetic high. 
"These features are suggestive of a mafic-ultramafic association with base metal mineralisation in a style distinct 
from the felsic-hosted Hollandaire copper-gold deposit located 10 kilometres northeast of Heeler."
"We drilled four holes in our program focusing on Heeler, following up on work in 2022. So far we have assays back 
from a single drillhole completed in our January 2024 program. 
"The 24CURC004 intercept showed stacked shallow sulphide mineralisation that was visible in the drill chips. We 
also hit sulphides in the three other holes but we're expecting lower tenor assay results, <1% copper." 
Cyprium geologist Peter van Luyt said: "As we've looked harder at the mineralisation and the assays, this hole 
suggests a mafic-ultramafic orthomagmatic nickel-copper-cobalt type that would be similar to a Nova-Bollinger style 
deposit. When we have the additional assays, we will be in a position to plan follow-up work." 
2024 drill holes
The following images show the location of the four 2024 drill holes and a preliminary conceptual cross-section 
based on assays and visual interpretation. Drill hole 24CURC003 intersected lithologies and mineralisation similar 
to 24CURC004 but with lower levels of visible chalcopyrite (copper iron sulphide). 
Drill holes 24CURC001 and 24CURC002 were drilled towards the southern end of the Heeler anomaly and 
intersected traces of chalcopyrite over wide intervals beneath the weathered carapace in lithologies similar to the 
Heeler host rocks. 
Assay results for these three drill holes are pending.Page 3 of 3

  The local share market has been consolidating in early trade, taking a breather after finishing last week at its 
highest level ever.
   At noon AEDT on Monday the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was down 2.4 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 7,743.2, 
after being up by as much as 0.3 per cent earlier in the morning.
   The broader All Ordinaries at midday was up by less than a point, at 8,007.7
   Seven of the ASX's 11 sectors were down and four were up. Property was the biggest mover, climbing 1.8 per 
cent as Goodman Group added 2.6 per cent.
   In the heavyweight mining sector, goldminers were shining as the precious metal changed hands at a two-month 
high of US$2,080 an ounce.
   Northern Star was up 5.8 per cent, Evolution had climbed 6.1 per cent and Ramelius Resources had risen 5.7 
per cent.
   Capital.com analyst Kyle Rodda said gold surged on Friday thanks to a slip in the US dollar as markets 
anticipated a slightly slower US economy.
   Elsewhere in the sector, BHP was down 1.1 per cent, Fortescue had dropped 1.7 per cent and Rio Tinto was 
down 0.6 per cent.
   All of the Big Four banks were higher, with ANZ up 0.2 per cent, Westpac adding 0.7 per cent, CBA rising 0.5 per 
cent and NAB growing 0.3 per cent.
   Life360 was the biggest gainer in the ASX200 at midday, rising another 9.2 per cent after the family tracking 
company's 38.5 per cent jump on Friday following its earning report.
   Pro Medicus was the biggest loser, slipping 2.7 per cent.
   Given the ASX200 finished at an all-time high on Friday, any gain would be a fresh record close for the bourse.
   The Australian dollar was buying 65.21 US cents, from 65.12 US cents at Friday's ASX close.

Australian shares slipped for a second straight session yesterday. Gains in healthcare and gold stocks helped cap 
broad losses, and investors awaited key economic reports for clues on the path for interest rates.
Gold prices and bitcoin also pushed higher to trade near record highs.
The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 closed down 11.6 points, or 0.2 per cent, at 7724.2, having touched an intraday 
record high on Monday. The All Ordinaries dipped 0.1 per cent.
Seven of the index's 11 sectors flashed red, with consumer stocks leading losses as supermarket giant Coles and 
jeweller retailer Lovisa traded ex-dividend.
Health stocks had a good day after the government allowed insurance premiums to rise from April. The 
announcement sent Medibank 1.6 per cent higher to $3.75 and NIB up 3.4 per cent to $7.85.
Healius was the star performer of the index, firming 14.7 per cent to $1.29, the biggest daily gain since 2020 after 
the pathology group appointed Paul Anderson as its new chief executive in charge of a strategic review. 
Pharmaceutical group Telix rallied 1.2 per cent to $12 on plans to buy Canadian tech ARTMS in a $126 million deal.
Gold miners outperformed as prices of the precious metal rose to a three-month high and were in sight of a record 
high. St Barbara jumped 12.5 per cent to 18¢, Regis Resources firmed 5.5 per cent to $2.03, and Ramelius 
Resources gained 4.3 per cent to $1.575. Northern Star Resources rose 3 per cent to $14.13 - its highest close 
since April last year.
In contrast, lithium explorers struggled. Pilbara Minerals was the index's biggest laggard, falling 7 per cent to $4.10. 
IGO dropped 5.3 per cent to $7.73, Sayona fell 6.7 per cent to 4.2¢, and Liontown tumbled 4.1 per cent to $1.275.
"A promising rebound in lithium stocks has been cut short after US lithium heavyweight Albermarle announced 
overnight it was looking to raise more than $US2.1 billion to replenish its coffers against the downturn in lithium 
prices," said Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG.

Elsewhere, heavyweights BHP rose 0.9 per cent to $44.63, and Rio Tinto advanced 1.1 per cent to $124.77. 
Fortescue was up 1.9 per cent at $25.84. The big banks, however, were on the back foot with National Australia 
Bank and Commonwealth Bank both down about 1 per cent.
Australia's current account returned to surplus in the December quarter as iron ore and coal exports soared giving a 
much needed boost to the economy.
There are some fears that the fourth-quarter gross domestic product to be released today at 11.30am AEDT would 
show an economic contraction.
"The risk of a negative quarterly GDP has been pared back by today's upside surprise, but it remains 
mathematically possible," said RBC rates strategist Robert Thompson.

The Australian sharemarket finished higher yesterday when a late rally in financial stocks helped reverse the trading 
session's earlier losses.
The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index swung between gains and losses to finish up 0.1 per cent, or 9.3 points, to 
7733.5 after six out of the 11 sectors finished in the green. The All Ordinaries were flat, while the Australian dollar 
held just below US65¢.
Financial markets largely shrugged off the December-quarter GDP report that showed Australia's economy had 
barely expanded in the final three months of the year as consumers refrained from spending amid higher borrowing 
costs.
Real gross domestic product increased by 0.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, just under forecasts of 0.3 per cent. 
Annual growth was a touch firmer than expected at 1.5 per cent, against forecasts of 1.4 per cent, but in line with 
the Reserve Bank of Australia's projections.
"For the RBA, we expect today's figures will be seen as suggesting that the economy continues to move slowly in 
the right direction for achieving its inflation target," said HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham.
The bond market is now fully priced for the first RBA rate cut in September. It is nearly fully positioned for a follow-
up move by Christmas.
The financial sector was the best performing on the ASX 200 as all the major banks recorded gains. Index 
heavyweight Commonwealth Bank climbed 1.2 per cent to $118.31, National Australia Bank rose 1 per cent to 
$34.10, and Westpac gained 1.1 per cent to $26.94.
ANZ finished up 1 per cent to $29.02. In separate news, the bank agreed to sell a 16.5 per cent of a stake in AMMB 
Holdings via a block trade at a price of 3.85 Malaysian ringgit ($1.25) apiece. The sale reduces ANZ's shareholding 
in the banking group from 21.7 per cent to 5.2 per cent.

The tech sector, meanwhile, was the worst performing, finishing down 1.4 per cent. WiseTech dropped 2.6 per cent 
to $93.16 and Xero lost 0.9 per cent to $133.30. That's after the Nasdaq Composite overnight dropped 1.7 per cent 
as investors took profits in the mega cap tech stocks.
In commodities, gold rose as much as 1.3 per cent to $US2141.79 an ounce, before losing its gains. Gold 
producers were paced by Ramelius Resources, which climbed 1 per cent to $1.59. Perseus rose by 1.8 per cent 
to $1.955.
Magellan Financial Group rallied by 7.9 per cent to $9.21 after total funds management increased to $37.2 billion 
last month, up from the $36.3 billion booked in January.
Online luxury retailer Cettire tumbled 14.4 per cent to $3.99. The shares plunged more than 20 per cent at the start 
of trade after an investigation by The Australian Financial Review that examined the company's handling of duties 
payable to the federal government.

Ramelius Resources is in exclusive due diligence to acquire Toronto-listed West Australian gold miner Karora 
Resources, which it hopes will add a new production centre to replace its ageing Edna May asset.
Street Talk can reveal Ramelius boss Mark Zeptner will spend $700 million to $1 billion for the acquisition. Karora 
will bring new production hubs with mills, and could help the company consolidate its position in the region. A 
Ramelius spokesperson declined to comment.
Karora's portfolio, located 60 kilometres from Kalgoorlie, includes 100 per cent ownership of the Beta Hunt mine, 
Higginsville gold operations and Spargos gold mine. It is expected to produce 170,000 to 195,000 ounces gold in 
2024. By contrast, Ramelius has told shareholders it would hit 272,500 ounces production this financial year.
Zeptner and his team are chasing the acquisition after a period of solid performance and perky gold prices. 
Ramelius shares have risen nearly 48 per cent in the past year, giving it a $1.8 billion market capitalisation and a 
strong balance sheet.
In particular, it has benefited from high-grade Penny ore being fed into the Mt Magnet Mill. Cash and gold reserves 
are expected to hit $400 million by year-end, while about $100 million in undrawn debt would further boost its 
liquidity profile.
Ramelius reported a 14 per cent increase in revenue to $348.5 million at its half-year results on February 20. 
EBITDA shot up 39 per cent to $140.2 million, thanks to a 12 per cent jump in realised gold price.
Ramelius' biggest asset is the Mt Magnet production centre, which it started building via a $40 million acquisition in 
2010. Now, 14 years on, Mt Magnet speaks for 62 per cent of the group's gold reserves.
When combined with the Vivien gold deposit and Penny gold mine, it is 53 per cent of the total net present value, 
according to Macquarie Capital analysts. Production is expected to reduce significantly by the 2029 financial year.

But the more pressing matter for Zeptner has been finding a replacement for Edna May, which it bought from 
Evolution Mining in 2017. It is now just 2 per cent of the reserves, with a significant production slump ahead in the 
2025 financial year.
Other bets like the Rebecca project are still a long way from spitting out cash.
Put that all together, and it's not surprising management has been on the prowl for acquisitions.
Sources told this column logical targets had included Spartan Resources as well as Northern Star's Carosue Dam 
gold mine. However, the former isn't operational, while the latter may have been hard to prise from its current 
owner.
The mooted acquisition at Karora comes after Ramelius acquired ASX-listed gold junior Musgrave Minerals in 
September.

  The Australian share market has closed above 7,800 points for the first time, on signals rate cuts in Europe and 
the US could come sooner rather than later.
   The S&P/ASX200 on Friday finished at 7,847.0, up 83.3 points, or 1.1 per cent for the day and up 1.3 per cent for 
the week.
   The broader All Ordinaries climbed 80.8 points, or 1.01 per cent, to 8,107.5.
   The gains came after European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde and US Federal Reserve chairman 
Jerome Powell struck a more dovish stance.
   Ms Lagarde told reporters in Frankfurt that while the ECB couldn't cut rates before receiving more data on wages, 
it would receive that information in the next few months.
   "We will know a little more in April, but we will know a lot more in June," she said.
   "That was a tacit nod to a June easing, providing there are no nasty surprises in between," NAB senior market 
strategist Gavin Friend wrote in a client note.
   Mr Powell was more definitive about monetary easing in his appearance before the US Senate on Thursday than 
he had been in his comments to the House on Wednesday.
   The powerful central banker told the Senate Banking Committee the Fed was "not far" from being able to cut rates 
and if trends continued the Fed "can and will" begin cutting them this year.
   The S&P500 rallied one per cent on the news and that enthusiasm carried over domestically, with the Australian 
market steadily rising much of Friday to close near the highs of the day.
   Every sector finished in the green except for industrials, which were basically flat.
   The heavyweight financial sector was the biggest gainer, rising 2.0 per cent and the Big Four banks hit their 
highest levels in years.
   Westpac rose 2.6 per cent to a four-year high of $27.70, NAB advanced 2.3 per cent to a nine-year high of 
$35.11, CBA climbed 1.8 per cent to an all-time high of $121.45 and ANZ added 1.7 per cent to a near-seven year 
high of $29.81.

   Virgin Money UK also soared 32.9 per cent to a five-year high of $4.08 after the UK's sixth-largest bank - a 2016 
spinoff from NAB - tentatively agreed to be taken over by Nationwide building society for 2.9 billion British pounds 
($A5.6 billion) in a tie-up that would remove it from the ASX.
   Australian shareholders would receive 2.20 pence ($4.26) per Chess Depository Interest.
   The mining sector had a quieter day, rising 0.1 per cent, with BHP adding 0.2 per cent to $43.95 while Rio Tinto 
dropped 0.6 per cent to $119.89 and Fortescue dipped 0.3 per cent to $25.96.
   Ramelius Resources rose 1.0 per cent to $1.56 after the mid-tier gold producer confirmed it was in exclusive 
talks to acquire Toronto Stock Exchange-listed, WA-focused goldminer Karora Resources.
   Ramelius has a market cap of $1.8 billion while Karora is worth $C841 million ($A943 million).
   The discussions remain incomplete and uncertain, Ramelius said.
   The Australian dollar jumped above 66 US cents for the first time since mid-January, buying 66.33 US cents, from 
65.78 cents at Wednesday's ASX close.
   ON THE ASX:
   * The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index finished Friday up 83.3 points, or 1.07 per cent, to 7,847.0
   * The broader All Ordinaries rose 80.8 points, or 1.01 per cent, to 8,107.5.

The $C840m Canadian listed gold miner Karora Resources has tapped Haywood Securities for a mergers and 
acquisition deal with the $1.8bn Australian listed gold miner Ramelius Resources, say sources.
It is understood Karora has been on offer for about two years, with talks held with various miners around the 
Australian market, including the $1.8bn Bellevue Gold.
Ramelius is also understood to have held talks with Karora before, but the pair could not agree on price.
While listed in Canada, it is understood that Karora has aspirations to be listed in Australia, where its portfolio of 
assets is located.
Expectations are that should a deal be agreed, it will likely be a scrip transaction, valued at somewhere between 
$700m and $1bn.
Ramelius Resources remained in a trading halt on Thursday, pending an announcement, which is expected to 
either relate to a transaction involving Karora or a statement saying talks between the pair have ended.
As previously reported by DataRoom, Ramelius has the shortest mine life of all of the major Australian gold 
producers.
Its market value has held up because it has a reasonable track record with mergers and acquisitions, where it 
acquires mines and extends their life.
Karora has the Beta Hunt Mine, with the underground operation 600km from Perth in Kambalda, the Higginsville 
Gold operations in Higginsville, Western Australia, and the Lakewood Mill, located outside Kalgoorlie and about 
60km from the Beta Hunt Mine.
It comes as M&A activity ramps up in Western Australia among gold and lithium miners at the smaller end.

Gold miners are cashed up on the back of the buoyant gold price, although there is said to be a gap between gold 
producers and developers, which remain in search of capital, with De Grey being the exception. Among the 
Ramelius Resources assets are its Mt Magnet Gold and Edna May production hubs, and its plan has been to add 
100,000 ounces of gold a year.

Commonwealth Bank shares hit a record price of $119.37 yesterday, helping send the sharemarket higher for a 
second day.
Investors also sent National Australia Bank to a post-GFC high and Westpac to its highest level since 2015. The 
record-breaking banks helped lift the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 up 0.4 per cent to 7763.7 points. Nine of the 11 
industry groups finished higher.
The financials sector climbed 0.6 per cent as CBA pared earlier gains to finish up 0.8 per cent at $119.25. The 
advance means Australia's largest bank has now climbed around 22 times in value (excluding dividends) since its 
initial public offer at $5.40 per share in 1991.
"Investors think interest rates have peaked, and the outlook is for lower rates, so people seem happy to buy at a 4 
per cent yield for premium banks," said Sean Sequeira, the chief investment officer of Australian Eagle Asset 
Management.
NAB climbed 0.7 per cent to $34.32 with Westpac up 0.2 per cent to $27.
Technology stocks got a lift from Wall Street overnight, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Index added 0.6 per cent and 
semiconductor giant Nvidia rose to a new all-time high of $US887 ($1348) per share and $US2.2 trillion valuation.
On the local sharemarket, WiseTech added 1.1 per cent to $1.06 and NextDC rose 2.5 per cent to $17.37.
In the mining sector, market heavyweights BHP, Rio Tinto and South32 all traded ex-dividend and lost value, 
keeping a lid on the market's gains. Woodside Energy was also ex-dividend, sending the energy sector down 1.2 
per cent.
Gold miners, meanwhile, extended a week-long rally as the precious metal hit a new record high of $US2168.10 an 
ounce. Perseus Mining jumped 5.9 per cent to $2.07, Newmont added 0.6 per cent to $51.32 and Evolution Mining 
climbed 2.8 per cent to $3.29.

"Gold has flirted with record highs for a while, there's demand coming out of China and Russia as a store of 
wealth," said Mr Sequeira.
"The local gold stocks have lagged significantly though as a result of a few mishaps from the miners, and we've had 
large increases to cost bases which has really hurt earnings."
In other company news, gold miner Ramelius Resources entered a trading halt at $1.545 per share after The 
Australian Financial Review's Street Talk column reported it would bid $700 million to $1 billion for Toronto-listed 
West Australian gold miner Karora Resources. The best performer on the S&P/ASX 200 was nickel miner Chalice 
Mining. It jumped 9.9 per cent to $1.33 on the hope the nickel price rout may have bottomed.
Elsewhere, bitcoin fetched $US66,230 at the closing bell and the Australian dollar climbed 0.3 per cent to buy 
US65.9¢ as the US dollar retreated across a basket of major currencies, after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome 
Powell said he still expected to cut borrowing rates in 2024.

Ramelius Resources has entered into exclusive discussions regarding a potential deal with Toronto Stock 
Exchange-listed Karora Resources, as flagged in The Australian's DataRoom column.
Ramelius shares on the ASX entered a trading halt on Thursday following market speculation about a potential 
transaction.
Shares rose 1.5c to $1.56 on Friday, giving Ramelius a market value of almost $1.8bn.
The West Australian-focused gold miner wants to expand its footprint via Karora's WA assets that include the Beta 
Hunt Mine, the Higginsville Gold operations and the Lakewood Mill. Ramelius owns the Mt Magnet Gold and Edna 
May production hubs.
"Discussions between the parties, including in relation to value, remain incomplete," Ramelius's board told the ASX 
in a statement. "There is no certainty that the discussions will lead to a transaction and if so at what price.
"Ramelius continually assesses strategic options and holds discussions with various industry participants as part of 
its growth strategy." Ramelius said in reference to market estimates of a transaction value of $700m-$1bn that 
"discussions concerning valuation are ongoing and no final agreement has been reached in this -regard". The miner 
said: "The company notes Karora's market capitalisation of approximately $C841m ($944m)." Karora's market 
capitalisation lifted to $C863m on the -Toronto Stock Exchange following its statement about the "business 
combination" deal.
"Discussions remain confidential and incomplete," Karora told its investors. "Even if a final transaction is agreed 
upon, there can be no assurances as to its terms, structure or timing." DataRoom reported on Thursday that Karora 
had been on offer for about two years, with talks held with various miners around the Australian market, including 
Bellevue Gold. Karora has tapped Haywood Securities for a mergers and acquisition deal

EQUITIES Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 finished the week at a record high as traders bolstered their bets 
for rate cuts later in the year and bank stocks surged.
The S&P/ASX200 rallied to an all-time intraday peak of 7853.1 points before retreating to end the session at a 
record closing high of 7847, up 1.1 per cent for the day and 1.3 per cent over the week.
Meanwhile, the broader All Ordinaries also reset its record, closing up 1 per cent to 8107.5 points. The Australian 
dollar also moved higher against the greenback to buy US66.31c.
Betashares chief economist David Bassanese said the benchmark index was now on track to hit 8000 points earlier 
than expected. "The last few weeks has been a classic case of investors taking bad news on the economy as good 
news for shares," he said.
"With GDP numbers this week confirming a soft economic outlook, rate cuts seem firmly on the horizon.
"Along with strength on Wall Street, we expect the records to keep tumbling for Australian shares with our year-end 
target of 8000 points likely to be met well ahead of schedule." KCM Trade chief market analyst Tim Waterer said 
equities had been supported by a risk-on sentiment as investors were beginning to see a "light at the end of the 
tunnel" regarding looser monetary conditions this year.
"It's been an encouraging week for investors regarding the interest rate outlook," he said.
However, a positive surprise on US jobs numbers scheduled for release overnight on Friday could put a dampener 
on sentiment, he added.
Investors have been coming increasingly confidence that the US Federal Reserve will begin slashing interest rates 
later this year. In testimony to US politicians, Fed chair Jerome Power said the central bank was "not far" from 
being able to ease interest rates as it awaited greater confidence that inflation was returning to its 2 per cent target.

Stocks on a high as rates peak
On the local bourse, all 11 industry sectors, bar industrials, finished in the green, led by financials which rallied 2 
per cent after sector-heavyweight Commonwealth Bank surged 1.8 per cent to $121.45 - a record high.
Westpac surged 2.6 per cent to $27.70, a level not reached since November 2019, while ANZ added 1.7 per cent to 
$29.81, its highest since August 2018, and NAB rose 2.3 per cent to $35.11 - a nine-year high.
In corporate news, Virgin Money vaulted 32.9 per cent to $4.08, its biggest intraday gain since the stock was listed 
in 2016, after it received a Ã‚Â£2.9bn ($5.6bn) takeover bid from Britain's Nationwide Building Society.
Ramelius Resources added 1 per cent to $1.56 as it confirmed it was undertaking due diligence to acquire 
Canadian-listed gold miner Karora Resources in a deal worth a reported $700m to $1bn. GQG Partners shed 1.8 
per cent to $2.20 after a large block trade was revealed.

Highlight: This week, gold crashed through a historic high, leaving many analysts and other market watchers 
looking for explanations.

Security is tight. "No hoodies!," proclaims a sign to customers as they are buzzed by intercom through locked 
reinforced doors in a nondescript downtown city building.
A steady stream of unpretentious city types, migrant workers, high-viz tradies, delivery drivers and well-dressed 
travellers file through the foyer.

They are here primarily to buy and sell gold, the precious metal whose allure in the 1850s gold rush reputedly made 
Melbourne the richest city on earth.
The Collins Street building in the city is gold central: at least 15 bullion traders are scattered across 16 levels 
among multiple jewellers, gemstone and diamond merchants. An odd assortment of legal offices, pawnbrokers and 
immigration agents fill in the gaps.
"There's probably more value in this building than any other in Australia," a casual conversation with a gold seller 
behind the counter at Bullion Now, on the sixth floor, reveals. "It's staggering."
The precious metal he is selling, bullion, is on a record run. This week, it crashed through a historic high of 
$US2200 ($3325) an ounce. Bullion is pure gold, different from 24-carat or 18-carat gold which has other alloys 
added to strengthen if for jewellery making, diminishing its value.
Gold's almost daily ascent since mid-February has left many analysts and other market watchers looking for 
explanations, as there is no clear catalyst for the rally.
Gold tends to spike in response to globe-shaking geopolitical or economic events, but nothing earth-shattering has 
happened in the past few months to justify the latest surge.
But people are cashing in, says Michael Pepper, Bullion Now's owner. He, and other traders in the city's golden 
tower, say record high prices are prompting customers to sell rather than buy.

"We're seeing a large number of sell backs coming through the doors at the moment. People are diversifying into 
property and cryptocurrencies," Pepper says.
The peaking prices are also weighing on purchasers. Custom has fallen 10 per cent to 20 per cent. "I would also 
argue that the size of purchases has shrunk a little bit as well," he says.
In a small two-person partitioned booth on the floor above, Michael Kay, from Melbourne Gold Company, is also 
buying more than he is selling.
"There wasn't much selling during COVID, although people were cashed up," Kay says. "People were concerned, 
scared and had the money to buy gold." Now they want to exit and get Bitcoin instead. "People like to speculate in 
Bitcoin and hoard their wealth in gold."
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency's volatility far outpaces gold's movements.
Bitcoin plunged from a peak of about $87,000 in November 2021 to below $24,500 two years later, before soaring 
to its current record high near $103,000. Gold, by contrast, moved from $US1500 to $US2200 over the same 
timeframe.
The gold traders' clientele range from self-managed super funds owners, they often buy the largest sums, to people 
selling homes who want to transfer their equity into gold.
Farmers, who understand of commodity markets, are also frequent buyers, as are migrants from Asia, India and 
East Europe, the traders say.
"Most people do keep it under the bed, so to speak, or leave it here," Kay says, noting that many dealers provide 
secure storage for a fee. "People are maybe questioning the high price. Is it going to remain here? Will it keep 
going? I'm pretty bullish. Gold always shines with inflation," he says.
Prices didn't have to move far before they hit record territory.
Gold has been trading for months at around the $US2000 mark. That level was viewed by many as stratospheric 
just a few years ago, but the metal pushed through the barrier in 2020 as the pandemic stormed across the globe.
Unusually, prices are trading at elevated levels despite sky-high interest rates that are typically bad for gold, which 
doesn't pay interest, and in defiance of a strong US dollar, which tends to keep the price of gold lower and more 
controlled.
However, big geopolitical factors are underpinning the precious metal's stellar performance: Speculation over the 
US Federal Reserve's pivot to looser monetary policy, Israel's unravelling Gaza crisis, the disastrous Russia and 
Ukraine war, and buying by central banks, led by China, are helping spur momentum.

Gold is frequently viewed as an inflationary hedge.
"The reality is gold is a hedge against uncertainty. Over the last few years, that uncertainty is creeping in across a 
myriad of factors," says Cameron Alexander, general manager of commercial development at The Perth Mint, one 
of the world's biggest gold refineries and mints.
"A combination of banking crisis, economic concerns, and geopolitical factors are driving investors to gold," 
Cameron maintains.
Former US President Donald Trump's trade war with China, and the weaponizations of the US dollar following the 
West's freeze of Russia's offshore assets, incentivised some wary central banks to buy heavily.Page 3 of 4

"China, over the last couple of years, has been very aggressive in building their own reserve, diversifying and 
moving away from the US dollar," Cameron said. They are not alone. Other South East Asian bankers are doing the 
same, albeit on a much smaller scale.
The World Gold Council's Gold Demand Trends January report shows the central bank buying streak continues at a 
"blistering" rate. Demand reached 1037 tonnes last year - the second-highest on record and down just 45 tonnes on 
the previous year, it said.
Michael Scantlebury, a resource analyst at Perth-based ASX listed broker and investment bank Euroz Hartleys, 
says the share price of Australia's gold producing miners and ASX-listed gold-focused exchange traded funds are 
lagging gold's soaring price.
"It doesn't make any sense, right? We aren't too surprised, given the lack of interest over the last three years in the 
gold equities," he says.
'We're very confident that this gold price increase will convert to proper margin and proper cash flow.'
Michael Scantlebury, from investment bank Euroz Hartleys
Gold's last big run started after the pandemic's mayhem primed the world's latest inflationary surge, but investors 
who expected gold miners' profit margins to follow the gold price upwards were disappointed.
"Cost inflation for gold producers basically squeezed that margin to the point where gold producers were breaking 
even, essentially, despite the gold price increases," Scantlebury says.
Gold equities in Australia underperformed as a result, and investors still remain sceptical. However, Scantlebury 
says discussions with mining contractors and industry suppliers shows pressures are easing, be it wage rises or 
fuel prices.
"The rate of cost inflation has definitely come off, so we're very confident that this gold price increase will convert to 
proper margin and proper cash flow," he says.
That's a shift Euroz Hartleys expects to show up in the March quarterly reports of miners like Northern Star 
Resources, Evolution, Ramelius, Perseus, West African and Gold Road Resources. Euroz Hartleys would expect 
investors to then focus on smaller producers and explorers after a re-rate in these larger miners occurs.
"Assuming the gold price stays equal, gold producers in Australia should definitely re-rate," Scantlebury says.
ANZ commodity strategists Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari said gold's latest rally isn't being derailed by the 
market's expectation that the Fed may push back expected cuts in interest rates, delaying a move that would signal 
it has US inflation under control.
"While speculators have increased their bullish bets recently, positions are not matching the intensity of the latest 
price rally. Moreover, disinvestment in gold-backed exchange-traded funds has been continuing," they said in a 
research note last week.
"A pull-back in gold prices is likely in the short term, as [the] recent rally has surpassed macroeconomic and 
geopolitical developments," they maintain.
At Bullion Now, Pepper also anticipates things to calm down. "We're expecting a pullback in the shorter-term," he 
says. But there will always be people buying gold as a value store, and for its portability, he says.
A kilo gold bar about the size of a mobile phone is now worth about $116,000, Pepper says. "I can put that in my 
pocket, travel to London and get for the same for it in the UK as what I paid in Australia. It's a worldwide 
transferable asset," he said.Page 4 of 4

The fundamentals are in place for further gold price gains this year, according to pundits, with family office The 
Victor Smorgon Group particularly bullish on three Australian producers.
And their tips were well timed, with one of their favourites, Ramelius Resources, talking up its acquisition 
credentials at the Ord Minnett Small and Mid Cap Mining Conference on Tuesday, as its market value nudged past 
$2bn.
The Victor Smorgon Group's gold portfolio manager, Cameron Judd, tapped Ramelius, Northern Star Resources 
and Red 5 as his top picks in the Australian gold sector, saying that despite the strength in the gold price, the 
tailwinds were still lined up nicely.
Mr Judd said there was strong potential demand that could be realised "if central banks show conclusive evidence 
that they will ease monetary tightening, which could also prompt more retail investors to buy gold ETFs".
"Historically, there is a strong correlation between the gold price and physically backed gold ETF demand, which 
represents mostly Western investor appetite for physical gold," Mr Judd said.
"However, the relationship disconnected at the start of 2023, with gold ETF demand declining 12 per cent while the 
gold price gained 18 per cent. So, gold is very much a contrarian investment in the current market." Mr Judd said 
asset allocation to gold was currently running at les than half its historical long-term average.
"This shows there is significant gold demand potential which could manifest into real demand should the sentiment 
of Western investors towards gold turn positive," Mr Judd said.
"In our view, this is likely to occur when there is more conviction that central banks will ease monetary policy." Citi 
has also rerated its short and midterm gold price forecasts to $US2200 an ounce and $US2300 an ounce 
respectively, against $US2165 an ounce currently.
"We would favour owning gold - both outright and against silver - heading into a sluggish GDP and rate cut 
environment," Citi said in a note to clients.

"Gold prices should also be supported by US dollar weakness on the eventual Fed pivot and strong physical 
demand." Ramelius on Tuesday said it was "well-placed to execute quickly on transactions" should they present 
themselves, "utilising reliable due diligence methodology with a match-fit team".
It pointed to seven assets it has bought and integrated over the past six years as proof of this. Red 5 is the largest 
holding in The Victor Smorgon Partners Resources Gold Fund, and Mr Judd said its recent merger with Silverlake 
Resources and entry into the ASX 200 was likely to underpin a rerating in the stock.

  The local share market has fallen as rising geopolitical tensions rattle nerves around the globe.
   At noon AEDT on Wednesday, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was down 98.6 points, or 1.25 per cent, to 
7,789.3. The broader All Ordinaries was down 105.7 points, or 1.3 per cent, to 8,041.1.
   Oil prices have jumped to a five-month high following Israel's assassination of Iranian military leaders in Syria and 
Ukraine's attack on a Russian oil refinery and a munitions factory deep in Russian territory.
   The rise in cost of oil is typically signals a risk of rising inflation rates.
   Of the ASX's 11 sectors, energy and utilities were the only ones showing growth at midday, with the two up at 
0.43 and 0.41 per cent, respectively.
   Australian uranium miners have continued to do well with Paladin up 1.57 per cent and Boss Energy up 1.31 per 
cent. Major energy companies Woodside and Santos were each up 0.10 and 0.45 per cent.
   The major miners saw slow growth. BHP was flat, Rio Tinto was up 0.43 per cent and Fortescue was down 0.51 
per cent.
   The biggest movers in materials were Ramelius Resources which was up 9.67 per cent after breaking their 
record for gold production, and Westgold Resources, which was down 11.91 per cent after downgrading their 
production guidance due to flooding and inclement weather.
   The Big Four banks were all down, with Westpac dropping 0.98 per cent, ANZ falling 1.33 per cent, CBA 
retreating 1.74 per cent and NAB subtracting 1.92 per cent.
   The Australian dollar had risen back above 65 US cents, buying 65.11 US cents, from 64.90 US cents at 
Thursday's ASX close.

EQUITIES Australian shares plunged on Wednesday, led by a sharp sell-off in interest rate-sensitive tech and real 
estate stocks, as traders wound back their bets for rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve.
At the close, the benchmark the S&P/ASX 200 index had fallen 105.4 points, or 1.3 per cent, to 7782.5 points.
All 13 industry sectors, bar utilities and energy, finished in the red. The broader All Ordinaries index fared slightly 
worse, shedding 1.4 per cent to close at 8033.6 points.
The dollar was flat against the greenback, buying US65.19c.
Overnight on Tuesday, Wall Street stocks slipped amid growing doubts that Federal Reserve chairman Jerome 
Powell has done enough to tame inflation following hotter than expect job vacancies and factory output data.
While Fed policymakers reaffirmed their view that it would cut rates three times this year, bond traders trimmed their 
rate bet on rate cuts to only two, while yields on US 10-year treasuries rose five basis points to 4.36 per cent.
NabTrade director of investor behaviour Gemma Dale said the recent pullback in the expected timing and speed of 
rate cuts by the US central bank was helping to cement the view that the Reserve Bank would keep interest rates 
higher for longer.
"We tend to adopt a similar mentality here, particularly because our rates are still currently lower," Ms Dale said.
"There's no reason for the RBA to rush." After the benchmark had hit record highs at the end of the March quarter, 
Wednesday's sell-off had also been motivated by profit-taking, Ms Dale added.
"Cash is looking extremely healthy at the moment â€¦ that's a clear sign for investors that they're going to put a little 
bit aside at this point in time," she said.

Faltering US rate hopes hit ASX
Locally, technology stocks were the biggest laggards on the benchmark index, diving 3.9 per cent, as sector 
heavyweights Wise-Tech tumbled 5 per cent to $90.20, and Xero dropped 5.7 per cent to $125.01, while 
TechnologyOne shed 2.6 per cent to $16.32.
The real estate sector also finished sharply lower, falling 3.2 per cent, with losses led by Charter Hall, which fell 4.6 
per cent to $13.01, Vicinity Centres, down 4.8 per cent at $2, and Scentre off 3.6 per cent at $3.26.
Investors flocked to gold miners, as the safe haven commodity traded at a record high above $US2288 an ounce, 
while oil stocks also benefited as Brent crude prices neared just shy of $US89 a barrel amid escalating conflict in 
the Middle East.
In corporate news, shares in Ramelius Resources added 5.3 per cent to $1.905 after the gold miner posted 
quarterly production of 86,928 ounces, eclipsing its previously issued guidance of up to 77,500 ounces.
Rival gold miner Westgold plunged 14.8 per cent to $2.36 after it revised its production guidance for the 2023-24 
financial year to between 220,000 and 230,000 tonnes.
Karoon Energy was flat at $2.18 after it bolstered its forecast capital expenditure to $117m-$134m, up from $50m-
$57m.
Santos fell 0.13 per cent to $7.83, while fellow energy major Woodside gained 0.03 per cent to $30.51. Among the 
resource giants, BHP shed 0.6 per cent to $44.86, and Fortescue lost 0.9 per cent to $25.19, but Rio Tinto gained 
0.38 per cent to $123.06.

EQUITIES Australian shares rebounded on Thursday after comments from Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell 
allayed investors' concerns over the path of interest rates.
Snapping a two-day losing streak, the S&P/ASX200 added 0.5 per cent, or 34.8 points, to 7817.3 as all 11 industry 
sectors finished the day in the green. The broader All Ordinaries also added 0.5 per cent.
The Australian dollar pushed higher against the greenback, up 0.4 per cent to US65.88c at the closing bell.
Wall Street finished higher overnight on Wednesday after Mr Powell said that firmer than expected economic data 
hadn't changed the central bank's view that it would cut interest rates this year.
He told a conference in California that rates, which are at a two-decade high, were doing their job but moving too 
soon could be "quite disruptive" for the world's top economy.
Perpetual head of investment strategy Matt Sherwood, who has been sceptical about the extent of rate cuts that 
central banks will deliver this year, said core services inflation was proving more resilient than expected.
"Outside of recession, I'd be shocked if the RBA cut rates this year - the Fed may be doing one or two," Mr 
Sherwood said.
"The market is starting to wake up to the fact that inflation isn't beaten; it has been temporary goods disinflation, 
which has come to an end.
"At the moment, the labour market remains incredibly resilient and that's going to limit how fast central banks can 
cut rates." On the local benchmark, interest rate-sensitive tech stocks were the top performers, rallying 1.2 per cent 
and clawing back some of the heavy losses after yesterday's sell-off.
Sector heavyweights rose, with WiseTech adding 2.5 per cent to $92.43, while NextDC climbed 2.2 per cent to 
$17.17, while Xero firmed just 0.07 per cent to $125.10.

Oil prices also rose to five-month highs after OPEC+ members reaffirmed they would push ahead with planned 
supply cuts. With the global benchmark Brent crude nearing $US90 a barrel, Santos added 0.6 per cent to $7.88 
while Viva Energy climbed 1.4 per cent to $3.75.

Simon Brown is co-portfolio manager of Tribeca's Smaller Companies Strategy in Sydney. The firm oversees 
around $3.3 billion in assets.
Which company disappointed you the most in the latest reporting season, and why do you still own it?
Land and marine transport operator Kelsian was punished during results season on the back of a material bottom-
line earnings miss versus market expectations, while reported cashflow was low and debt higher. The dreaded 
trifecta!
At its essence, the company's earnings should have infrastructure-like qualities, with the majority of earnings from 
operating public and private sector transportation services which are contracted and relatively stable, while having 
inflation protection on costs.
It is yet to hit full operating cadence post the disruptions from the pandemic and workforce shortages, resulting in a 
shortage of drivers and uncontracted overtime payments that aren't covered by pass-through mechanisms.
An improvement in labour availability, as is being reported, should flow through the better margins. It would mean 
Kelsian is a bargain buy at current levels in our view.
Which stock in the portfolio do you think is the most undervalued?
Management at gold producer Ramelius Resources have done a great job curating a strategy that leverages their 
existing mill infrastructure by adding nearby deposits through bolt-on mergers and acquisitions.
The stock is cheap on traditional miner metrics. It has a price to net present value of 0.75 times and, with the recent 
multi-year breakout in gold prices, it provides further tailwinds to valuation. We see material upside from current 
share price levels.
What is your take on small-cap investing in the current economic environment?
Page 2 of 2
Breakout in gold is making Ramelius cheap: Tribeca Fundie Q&A
After two years of underperformance versus the broader S&P/ASX 200 Index, small caps have begun to outperform 
in 2024. Margins have been impacted by higher operating costs, with small companies generally less well-equipped 
to pass these through, affecting earnings.
Furthermore, small caps have greater exposure to the cyclicality of the domestic economy, with less offshore 
earnings that benefit from currency translation.
With inflation moderating and the local interest-rate cycle having peaked, we feel small-cap growth should once 
again shine, which is one of the main attractions of the asset class.
What's a stock you like that (most) people haven't heard of?
Eureka Group operates a pure play, specialist strategy of providing affordable seniors rental accommodation across 
Australia.
Eureka services the growing ageing population who are under-funded for retirement and highly reliant on the 
government pension assistance that underpins their revenue.
This is an important segment, with 57 per cent of Australia's 4.7 million 65-plus year olds relying on the pension as 
their primary source of income. The opportunity for sector consolidation in this area is large, with Eureka the scaled 
player in a highly fragmented market and the company currently pursuing avenues to unlock ways to speed up 
mergers and acquisitions. While it trades at a 16 per cent premium to net tangible assets, our view is that the NTA 
is potentially conservative with cap rates of around 8.3 per cent moving lower over time as investors grow more 
comfortable with the model.
Also of note is the recently received scrip-based takeover proposal from ASX-listed Aspen Group and the 
subsequent acquisition of just under 20 per cent of shares by a third-party corporate entity.
What piece of advice/or anecdote influenced your investing approach?
David Aylward, who started the small-cap fund that I co-manage, has been a mentor and imparted to me early on 
not to overestimate the level of analysis done by the market.
It is so true, particularly once you come down in size from the top 20 or 30 largest stocks.
For those willing to put in the time to do the meetings, collate the insights and crunch the numbers, I've found there 
are always opportunities out there to make money.
What's your favourite local bar or restaurant?
North Bondi RSL belies its cheap and cheerful nature with one of the best views in the world. I go for the chicken 
parmigiana.
Any podcasts or shows you'd recommend?
I'm a college sports fan. Swamp Kings on Netflix is a great insight into the college football fanaticism in the US.

Wayne Bramwell's grand plans for Westgold Resources look to be finally coming to fruition with his $2.2bn merger 
with Karora, but some believe it's come at a cost.
One of the conditions of the transaction that the seasoned mining executive probably agreed to begrudgingly was 
creating a dual listing on both the Australian Securities Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange.
Karora is TSX-listed and is likely to have insisted on this condition to appease its own shareholders, which would 
not want to own stock in an exchange that does not trade in the same time zone.
Companies don't like such arrangements, because shareholders either flock to one exchange or the other, causing 
the stock on one of the markets to struggle.
It's seen as the most likely reason why exclusive talks between Ramelius Resources and Karora ended.
African gold miner Perseus and Patriot Battery Metals are listed both here and in Canada.
Westgold has been talking to Karora for over a year.
The view around the market is that Westgold has agreed to a big price. It now has to prove itself with its ambitious 
plan to take its production level to 500,000 ounces of gold annually.
But if it pulls it off, it will become the third-largest gold miner in Australia.
So far it has impressed, with the once embattled Westgold Resources soaring in value from $300m to over $1bn 
under Mr Bramwell's leadership.
And one of the reasons it is interested is it believes Karora had been producing 170,000 ounces of gold, when it 
should have been producing about 200,000, as it had earlier forecast.
Page 2 of 2
Dual listing the price Westgold has to pay for deal - DATA ROOM
Gold miners are currently cashed-up on the back of the buoyant gold price. Now the question is whether Ramelius 
Resources pounces on Spartan Resources (formerly Gascoyne), which is said to be on its radar given the close 
proximity of its assets to Spartan's.
Yet the speculation has been around for a while and it is still to move, leaving some to think Ramelius sees 
Spartan as over-priced for now.
As gold mining consolidation continues apace, the other deal some believe will play out over the medium term is an 
acquisition by Northern Star of the $2.5bn De Grey Mining.
Northern Star's first priority is rebuilding the processing plant of the Super Pit gold mining asset that it owns, but 
after that attention will likely turn to De Grey.
This is why many found its presence at Newcrest's Telfer mine and Havieron processing facility on a site visit in 
recent weeks curious.
Northern Star sources say it has no interest in Telfer, but it's very close to De Grey's assets, so perhaps it was there 
while on a De Grey site visit, determining whether gold could be processed there.
Meanwhile, the terms of Westgold's deal will see Karora shareholders receiving 2.524 Westgold shares and 68c 
cash a.
The offer represents about $6.60 per Karora share based on Westgold's closing share price on the ASX of $2.28 on 
April 5.
It represents a 10.1 per cent premium to Karora's closing share price on the TSX of $5.99 ($C5.36) on April 5.
Westgold shareholders will own 50.1 per cent of the combined company. Westgold, advised by Argonaut and 
currently producing about 220,000 ounces of gold from its underground and open pit mines in Western Australia, 
says the business is capable of producing 400,000 ounces of gold per annum from Western Australia assets and 
estimates operating synergies of $209m and estimated corporate savings of $281m. The Beta Hunt underground 
mine, 600km from Perth, is the jewel in Karora's crown with its gold potential.

Body
In the eight years since Collins St Asset Management was founded, chief investment officer Vasilios Piperoglou can 
recall only two occasions when a thematic has presented itself with enough "significant asymmetry" to justify a 
major investment.
Collins St's value fund was an early backer of uranium, and its holdings in the sector jumped between 400 per cent 
and 500 per cent over four years. The second was offshore oil services stocks, which surged between 300 per cent 
and 350 per cent in two-and-a-half years. But Piperoglou is confident that Collins St's latest bet will produce even 
better returns than both those opportunities.
"With gold stocks, the way the asymmetry is playing out currently, I think there is a greater potential in this than the 
other two ... we're seeing the very early signs of the start of a gold bull market," Piperoglou says.
"At some stage, investors are going to get smacked in the face ... there will be a moment within months, not years, 
where people wake up and these quality small caps will multibag."
A multibagger is every investor's dream - a stock that at least doubles in value. And while the best chance of finding 
one is at the smaller end of the market, those companies also present the highest risk. But Piperoglou believes the 
local gold sector is filled with potential multibaggers, and it's only a matter of time before the record gold price flows 
through to miners.
That is why Collins St has spent the past 12 months undertaking its own due diligence by speaking to management 
and visiting operations to construct what Piperoglou describes as a portfolio of "some of the best, well-run, well-
capitalised, pre-production plays on the ASX".
Among gold sector small caps, the value fund holds Barton Gold, Brightstar Resources, Tesoro Gold, Great 
Boulder Resources, Meeka Metals and Odyssey Gold. At the larger end of the market, it holds Ramelius 
Resources and West Gold Resources.
Page 2 of 3
Taking a shine to the gold diggers; MONDAY FUNDIE
Indeed, Collins St's $200 million value fund has a long track record of spotting winners, and regularly appears 
among the best performers in Mercer's investment survey. It was the top-ranked Australian long-only strategy in the 
five years to December, returning 24 per cent per annum, and also boasted a podium finish on a three-year time 
horizon. Its strong run of form has continued over the past nine months, with the fund returning 18.6 per cent, net of 
fees, in the financial year to date, beating the S&P/ASX 200's 7.6 per cent gain over the same period.
Collins St has also reopened its special situation fund, which is targeting the local and international small-cap gold 
sector following strong demand from clients. The firm believes that miners in North America are also looking cheap, 
particularly small- and mid-cap companies in Canada and the US.
Much of the value fund's recent performance has been fuelled by an 11 per cent return in December when two of its 
key holdings - Carnarvon Energy and Link Administration - rallied sharply. While Collins St doesn't typically engage 
in shareholder activism, the firm played a key role in rolling the board at Carnarvon in December amid frustrations 
over its handling of its major offshore gas project majority-owned by Santos.
Collins St teamed up with Nero Resources Fund to raid Carnarvon's share register and force the company to 
pledge it would not acquire new assets, would cut administrative costs and work with Santos to speed up drilling at 
the Dorado field in which Carnarvon is a minority owner. The stock rallied nearly 44 per cent in December.
"Usually when we buy a new position, we have no intention of being activist because it's a lot easier to make money 
being passive," Piperoglou says.
"We were willing on that occasion to throw down the gauntlet of having a pretty public fight, but thankfully it was the 
quickest coup - within 24 hours they basically resigned."
The value fund also benefited from a 60 per cent surge in Link shares in December following a $1.2 billion buyout 
offer from Japanese financial services company Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. The bid ended a rollercoaster ride 
for shareholders over the past three years, when four other suitors attempted takeovers.
The disastrous acquisition of a British company in 2017 also dragged Link into the messy collapse of the $7 billion 
Woodford investment fund, which triggered heavy losses and a complex exit involving the financial regulator. "At 
times when we do have a significant amount of cash because we don't see much opportunity on the long end, we 
played what we thought at the time was a low-risk takeover arbitrage," Piperoglou says, referring to its initial 
investment in Link.
"But that literally blew up in our face, and we were holding a position that halved in value, so we would argue that 
we got Link's takeover wrong."
Piperoglou admits that Collins St has still lost money on that investment, adding that if the fund hadn't bought 
shares in Link, its two-year return would be at least 5 per cent higher.
Collins St is also bullish on energy, particularly oil and gas, and believes they will be crucial for decades to come as 
the world transitions towards renewable energy.
While financial institutions and governments have increasingly shied away from investing in the sector, Piperoglou 
says that demand for oil and gas remains robust while there is little incentive for new supply.
"It's one of those weird disconnects, with underlying demand still going up every year, but you're not seeing enough 
capital expenditure on the supply side," he says. "Those that are willing to participate and just be passive should 
earn some pretty good double-digit returns."
The value fund holds Beach Energy, but last month trimmed its position in the stock and reallocated that capital to 
its investment in Carnarvon.
Piperoglou's first exposure to the sharemarket was at the ripe age of 12 years old when his father, a psychiatrist, 
raided his piggy bank and bought him about $1200 of CSR shares due to its high dividend yield.Page 3 of 3
Taking a shine to the gold diggers; MONDAY FUNDIE
Every six months, Piperoglou would study the company's dividend statement while also reading everything he could 
about Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway, which cemented in his mind that he wanted to run an investment 
fund.
Piperoglou started investing in year 12, mainly in resources stocks, but admits he had no idea what he was doing 
and made plenty of mistakes. His biggest winner was copper and gold miner Oxiana Resources, which he bought 
at 8¢ and sold at $3.50.
From there, Piperoglou continued to follow financial markets and completed commerce and law degrees at Monash 
University. With few contacts in the financial services industry, he joined boutique firm Leyland Private Asset 
Management.
It was there he met Michael Goldberg, a like-minded value investor who also believed in fundamental stock 
analysis. Over many lunches, the two came to the conclusion that the most efficient way to run a value-style 
investment house was through a fund structure that was a standalone entity.
After five years at Leyland for Piperoglou and seven years for Goldberg, they established Collins St Asset 
Management in 2015 and have put their own money into the value fund.
"We live and die by our stock picking ability," Piperoglou says.

Shares advanced on Tuesday as investors anticipated the release of key inflation data that could keep a Reserve 
Bank rate cut off the table anytime soon.
The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index rose 34.3 points, or 0.45 per cent, to 7683.5 points, while the broader All 
Ordinaries rose a similar amount to 7937.9 points.
Of the 11 industry sectors, all finished in the green bar energy, materials and industrials.
Ahead of the release of the inflation figures on Wednesday, EightCap market analyst Zoran Kresovic said traders 
would be closely watching for indications on the path of rate cuts.
"The concern for the market is because inflation is running so high locally, unemployment is very low and wages 
growth is substantial, we might not get interest rate cuts in Australia at all this year," Mr Kresovic said. "If that is the 
case, then obviously the market will need to reprice itself." According to consensus forecasts, the consumer price 
index is expected to accelerate to 0.8 per cent in the March quarter, up from 0.6 per cent in December.
This would take the headline inflation rate to 3.5 per cent in the year to March, down from an annual reading of 4.1 
per cent recorded in December. Traders have priced out the chance of a rate cut by the RBA this year, with 
investors instead expecting a 25-basis-point cut early next year.
Amid a recent run of stronger than expected job numbers, HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham also cautioned that 
the -labour market would probably have to loosen before the RBA would be confident it could move to cut interest 
rates. "We've had a pick-up in wages growth, at the same time that we've had quite a weak productivity 
performance," Mr Bloxham said On the local bourse, tech stocks were the top performers, rising 1.7 per cent, 
following a rally on the Nasdaq. WiseTech jumped 2.7 per cent to $91.60 and Xero climbed 1.6 per cent to $121.57.
Resources stocks were mixed. Fortescue fell 0.8 per cent to $24.60 and Rio Tinto fell 0.2 per cent to $129.57, 
while BHP advanced 0.2 per cent to $45.50.

Gold miners continued their sell-off as the appeal of the safe haven asset faded due to dissipating tensions 
between Israel and Iran. While still near their record highs, spot gold prices dipped 0.9 per cent to $US2305.99.
Miners for the precious metal fell, with Northern Star off 3.5 per cent at $14.74, Ramelius Resources down 4.4 per 
cent at $1.97 and Regis Resources sliding 4.6 per cent to $2.10.
The big four banks finished higher, up 1.1 per cent, with CBA leading with a gain of 1.5 per cent to $114.58. 
Westpac rose 0.9 per cent to $25.97 even as it flagged the scrapping of the sale of its RAMS Home Loans 
business. NAB rose 1.3 per cent to $33.84 and ANZ added 0.9 per cent to $28.47.
EML Payments added 4.4 per cent to $1.07 after Wilson Asset Management's 6.1 per cent stake in the firm was 
announced. Brambles shed 6.3 per cent to $14.67, its worst intraday loss in more than two years, after its latest 
quarterly update showed the company was no longer on track to hit the top-range of its guidance.
LifeStyle Communities dived 13.5 per cent to $12.32, to be the worst index performer, after it said it expected a 
large reduction in the number of new home settlements this financial year. The dollar was trading near US64.44c.at 
the market close.

Commentary3
Having lagged the move in gold and silver prices thus far in 2024, sentiment to miners showed a marked 
improvement with the Fund NAV rising over 16%. The Fund performance compared to a 21% sterling return 
registered by the Gold Bugs Index and the GDXJ equity ETF. However, we anticipate that the lag in performance of 
the smaller equities held in the Fund will catch-up with larger peers given their relatively attractive valuations.
Gold was one of the stronger commodities with the price rising over 9% during March to new all-time highs. Silver is 
latterly starting to catch-up, registering a 10% price increase over the month. Prices held despite a more hawkish 
move in US FED rate expectations after FOMC minutes indicated broader US labour markets were stubbornly 
resilient despite relatively tepid economic growth. Increasingly there appears to be a focus on ever growing 
government debt levels which have shown little sign of reversing, as evidence by the latest US congression Budget 
Office projections.
Recent physical gold buying has been led by China, with a pick-up in retail demand showing in import data. This 
has been potentially driven by broader concerns on the economy, particularly the weak regional property sector. 
Alongside this is the healthy net central bank demand: People's Bank of China (PBoC) data showed China's gold 
reserves continued to rise with the addition of 0.39 Moz in February taking official reserves to 72.6Moz (+10% year-
on-year). Physical gold ETF's showed a pick-up in buying but aggregate holdings nevertheless ended 246k ounces 
lower over the month. We believe gold hitting all-time highs despite steady ETF selling is a positive, as would also 
be the case should ETF's turn steady buyers, further tightening the market.Page 3 of 4
Monthly Investor Report - March 2024
West African Resources and Fortuna Gold and Silver were strong contributors to performance. This was closely 
followed by Australian gold producer Karora which received bid interest from ASX-listed Ramelius, as well as 
reports of a further interested party also in discussion with the company. While we do not focus our stock selection 
specifically on M&A targets, we believe quality undervalued assets should result in a higher probability of them 
becoming targets. The sector remains short of growth projects, and so we would anticipate a pick-up in M&A activity 
going forward. This should help close the discounts of junior miners to the larger. Calidus was the primary detractor 
to performance with the group undertaking an equity funding, in which the Fund participated, as part of a broader 
restructuring of its debt and gold hedging.

  The local share market has suffered its biggest drop in more than a month after official statistics showed inflation 
has picked up, raising doubts about whether domestic rate cuts will occur at all this year.
   The S&P/ASX200 index on Wednesday dropped 101.1 points, or 1.3 per cent, to a nearly four-week closing low 
of 7,665.6.
   The broader All Ordinaries dropped 99.2 points, or 1.23 per cent, to 7,935.7.
   The ASX200 was already well in the red but fell another 22 points in the space of two minutes after the Australian 
Bureau of Statistics reported consumer prices rose 3.6 per cent in the 12 months to April, the second straight-month 
inflation has shown a small increase.
   Inflation had been 3.5 per cent in the year to March and consensus expectations among economists were for it to 
cool to 3.4 per cent in the April report.
   Betashares chief economist David Bassanese said the sticky inflation readout would test the Reserve Bank's 
patience and made a rate cut before Christmas unlikely.
   "Indeed, there's a simmering risk that the RBA may feel obligated to raise rates further to reduce inflation in those 
demand-sensitive areas it can influence," he wrote, putting the odds of such a hike at around 30 to 40 per cent.
   Saxo head of FX strategy Charu Chanana said the readout could give RBA reason to postpone rates cuts, but 
was unlikely to bring rate hikes back on the table given the loosening of the Australian labour market and stretched 
consumers.
   Still, the money market's implied odds of an RBA rate hike in September rose from 12 per cent to 20 per cent 
following the report, according to CommSec economist Ryan Felsman.
   "Traders now think that rate cuts are off the table until at least the middle of 2025," Mr Felsman wrote.
   All of the ASX's 11 sectors finished lower, with eight of them dropping more than one per cent.
   Consumer staples were the biggest loser, falling 2.1 per cent as Coles dropped 2.0 per cent and Treasury Wine 
Estates shed 4.5 per cent.

   All four of the big retail banks finished lower, with ANZ dropping 2.5 per cent to $27.87, NAB falling 1.8 per cent to 
$33.65, Westpac retreating 2.4 per cent to $26.01 and CBA slipping 1.6 per cent to $118.34.
   In the heavyweight mining sector, Fortescue dropped 3.6 per cent to $25.57 and Rio Tinto subtracted 1.5 per cent 
to $129.66, while BHP was flat at $45.08.
   After the market closed, BHP announced it was asking for more time to negotiate with Anglo American over its 
$74 billion tentative takeover offer and emphasised its willingness to maintain and build on Anglo American's legacy 
of social investment in South Africa.
   In the gold sub-sector, Westgold rose 6.5 per cent to $2.29 and Ramelius dropped 7.3 per cent to $1.91 after a 
Takeovers Panel application revealed the two mid-tier miners had been in merger talks, which apparently soured 
after Westgold agreed to acquire Toronto-listed Karora Resources.
   In health care, Fisher & Paykel rose 3.7 per cent to a nearly two-week high of $26.39 after the Auckland-based 
respiratory products company said it had grown revenue by 10 per cent to $NZ1.74 billion ($1.6 billion) in the 12 
months to March 31.
   "After several years of changing demand patterns, we are pleased to have returned to a trajectory of growth," 
managing director and chief executive Lewis Gradon said.
   The Australian dollar was buying 66.58 US cents, from 66.61 US cents at Tuesday's ASX close.

   * The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index on Wednesday dropped 101.1 points, or 1.3 per cent, to 7,665.6

BHP shareholders on Wednesday night were taking the view that the negotiations with its takeover target Anglo 
American would probably result in a compromise.
The miner's announcement on Wednesday showed that it was moving to allay concerns around risks in South 
Africa related to its deal, and expectations are that there will be a coming together in the middle from both sides.
The fact that BHP had asked for an extension for negotiations showed that it remained a keen buyer of Anglo 
American and, as it was made clear last week, the discussion had gone beyond value and moved to deal structure.
Another week would allow Anglo American to work through the issues further, and some believe it should have 
even gone as far as underwriting the transaction.
By taking the South African Kumba iron ore operation from Anglo American shareholders as part of the deal, rather 
than returning it to them as planned, BHP could combine it with some coal mines in a sale process down the track 
and potentially achieve a better price for the assets.
On Wednesday, there was divided opinion as to whether BHP was making progress with Anglo American in the 
negotiations, with some suggesting the lack of an announcement that an extension had been agreed meant it was 
not gaining the co-operation from Anglo American it may have been hoping for.
As reported by The Australian on Wednesday, among BHP's efforts to allay fears surrounding structure was the 
offer of a "reverse break fee", and it had offered direct responses to Anglo's concerns, including offering the South 
African government a three-year guarantee to maintain staffing levels in the country, sharing any costs of employee 
share schemes, and establishing a mining centre of excellence in the country to train mine workers and conduct 
research and development for BHP's global mining operations.

ROOM
Elsewhere, an odd application to the Takeovers Panel revealed to the market on Wednesday shows that mergers 
and acquisitions remain on the agenda for Ramelius Resources.
The gold miner led by Mark Zeptner is seen as a sophisticated operator that will soon be more cashed-up than it 
already is and has executed well on mergers and acquisitions in the past, so the market would probably support 
any deal it puts forward.
It walked away from a deal to buy Canadian gold miner Karora, with which Westgold Resources has agreed to 
embark on a $2.2bn merger transaction.
But judging by the Takeovers Panel application, it appears that Ramelius is keen to take part in some sort of two-
way of three-way tie-up with Westgold and/or Karora.
It's objecting to the cost of the break fee on Westgold's deal with Karora, which is standard for deals in Canada, and 
a one-year standstill agreement Ramelius and Westgold had in place from November. Expectations are that once 
the panel examines the application, it will be thrown out. Ramelius closed down 7 per cent on Wednesday and 
Westgold up 6.5 per cent.

The fact that BHP had asked for an extension for negotiations with Anglo American on Wednesday showed that it 
remained a keen buyer of the London-listed miner.
And, as it was made clear last week, the discussion has gone beyond value and moved to deal structure.
But clearly, it's not been enough to appease Anglo American. BHP shareholders on Wednesday night were taking 
the view that the negotiations with its takeover target Anglo American would probably result in a compromise. But 
Anglo American has slammed the door shut on further talks by failing to extend the deadline for BHP to make a firm 
bid in an announcement that followed its earlier increased bid.
BHP had tried to show that it was moving to allay concerns around risks in South Africa related to its deal.
Another week would have allowed Anglo American time to work through the issues further.
But some believe BHP should have even gone as far as underwriting the transaction by taking the South African 
Kumba iron ore operation from Anglo American shareholders as part of the deal, rather than returning it to them as 
planned, BHP could combine it with some coal mines in a sale process down the track and potentially achieve a

Peter Edwards is chairman of Victor Smorgon Group and co-chief investment officer of the Global Multi-Strategy 
Fund, which has returned 40.6 per cent annually since its 2019 inception. The Melbourne-based firm oversees 
more than $1 billion in assets.
The global fund has returned 22.6 per cent so far this financial year. What has driven that performance? | The fund 
invests in several themes including gold, automation, decarbonisation, and emerging markets. Over the past three 
months, performance has been led by investments in gold and decarbonisation.
The largest contributor has been Australian gold miner Red 5, which has moved from developing an asset into 
commercial production. We've been a substantial shareholder since March 2021, and we have supported it through 
the development financing phase to its profitable production today.
Japanese company Hitachi has also added significant returns over the past two years. It's divested its legacy 
construction machinery, chemicals, and metals businesses to focus on producing higher margin products with 
greater returns on capital, and with a higher propensity for cash flow generation. It has also sharpened its focus on 
returning cash to shareholders and growing dividends per share at a compound annual growth rate of 13.6 per cent 
over the past five years.
How much further do you expect the copper price to run and which stocks do you own? | We expect that copper 
demand will remain strong, with price upside driven by structural supply constraints.
We like miners with strong leadership and proven records in creating shareholder returns and value low 
jurisdictional risk and higher-grade orebodies with expansion potential.
For producing companies, we like Canadian miners Lundin Group and Capstone Copper.
Another company we support is US-based mineral exploration company Ivanhoe Electric, which is developing the 
Santa Cruz project and exploring for new major copper deposits in North America.
Page 2 of 2
The stocks fuelling Victor Smorgon's 40pc returns Fundie Q&A
We are also involved in BMC Minerals, which is developing one of the most exciting volcanogenic massive sulphide 
(sources of copper, zinc, gold, silver) districts globally.
Do you expect the disconnect between gold prices and mining stocks to abate? Which stocks are best positioned? | 
We have noticed that a large majority of recent gold demand has come from BRICS nations, which are increasingly 
transacting with each other in their local currencies and settling the surplus with physical gold. This demand from 
non-Western buyers will continue to support the gold price.
Western gold investors are preferring to invest in gold mining equities, and are less enthused by the gold bull 
market, which has created this disconnect. If this trend continues, we believe it's more likely that gold equities will 
reflect the gold price.
Historically, the bottom of the cycle typically sees gold mining equities trade at a discount to the spot gold price and 
historic average multiples. As the cycle peaks, analysts start to imply a forward price greater than spot, and a 
market multiple above average.
Assuming the future rhymes with history, the greatest gains will be with smaller, higher-cost gold producers and 
explorers. For this reason, we like Ramelius Resources and Canada's Agnico Eagle.
What's a stock you're bullish on that investors might not have heard of? | Copper miner Metals Acquisition listed on 
the ASX this year after acquiring the NSW CSA copper mine in 2023. It's run by Mick McMullen, who has a track 
record of turning around major mining companies globally.
We believe the company's inception as a US-listed special purpose acquisition company and the capital structure 
tied to its initial acquisition has turned many potential investors away. Additionally, CSA was previously owned by 
Glencore, whose exit likely led people to perceive that the asset is of low quality.
However, we view Glencore's retained equity in Metals Acquisition as an endorsement of the asset and 
acknowledgement that the business will improve under a focused management team. The company has recently 
taken several steps to simplify and improve its balance sheet which we also see as accretive.
What's a stock you'd like to own but can't (for whatever reason)? | Semiconductors are a critical resource of the 
modern world. With this view, ASML is a company that if it traded back to our target buy level, it would be added to 
the portfolio.
The company has a dominant position in the semiconductor lithography market, benefiting from pricing power and 
strong customer relationships, and is poised to continue benefiting from the increased demand for computing 
power.
What is your favourite local restaurant and your go-to order? | A local favourite restaurant is Terrace cafe, inside the 
Botanic Gardens. Great place to be on a beautiful day, and the chicken avocado salad is delicious.
Are there any podcasts that you'd recommend? | I spend a bit of time in the car, so love a good podcast. Currently, 
I'm listening to Pivot by Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway, The Grant Williams Podcast, and the Australian Strategic 
Policy Institute have recently launched a weekly show called Stop the World.

Highlight: Auric Mining has unveiled gold hits up to 1m at 6.08g/t from 82m at its Spargoville project in WA - at a 
target wedged between two known high-grade deposits.
Body
Auric Mining has uncovered an intriguing geological opportunity at its Spargoville project in Western Australia's 
Goldfields region after unveiling gold hits up to 1m at 6.08 grams per tonne from 82m at a target wedged between 
two known high-grade deposits.
The company has today revealed results from a six-hole drill campaign at its Fugitive prospect that sits between the 
significant Wattle Dam and Spargos Reward gold operations run respectively by Maximus Resources and Karora 
Resources.
The reverse-circulation (RC) program also delivered a 3m hit going 1.18g/t gold from 69m from the same hole as its 
peak result, while additional highlights show a 2m intercept grading 3.82g/t gold from 96m and 2m at 2.78g/t from 
11m in a third hole.
Management says historic drilling by Ramelius Resources and Tychean Resources at Fugitive outlined a 
significant gold mineralisation zone with about 700m of strike length. Auric's latest 822m campaign followed up on a 
significant historic drillhole by Tychean that returned 25m grading 1.67g/t gold from just 44m.
'The Fugitive Prospect is midway between two prominent, high-grade gold deposits; Wattle Dam and Spargos 
Reward at Spargoville.'
Auric Mining managing director Mark English
The prospect sits in a good neighbourhood with the 185,000-ounce Spargos Reward gold deposit just 8km to the 
north and the 266,000-ounce Wattle Dam gold deposit only 8km to the south-east.
Auric Mining managing director Mark English said: "The Fugitive Prospect is midway between two prominent, high-
grade gold deposits; Wattle Dam and Spargos Reward at Spargoville. Our first-pass drilling has highlighted 
similarities with both deposits. We're looking forward to the next phase when we will get the opportunity to test that 
model."
The company already has plans for air-core (AC) drilling towards the centre of the Fugitive target to infill the current 
100m spacing in the area. A follow-up RC campaign is also being planned beneath the historic and latest drillholes

to target the mineralised zone in fresh rock at about 75m to 100m below surface - similar to where high grades 
occur at the nearby Wattle Dam deposit.
Just last week, Auric netted nearly $4.46 million in gross revenue from its first mining campaign of the year at its 
Jeffreys Find project in the Goldfields after selling 1256 gold ounces to the Perth Mint. As part of its latest mining 
program, more than 30,000 dry metric tonnes were processed for its joint venture (JV) partner BML Ventures at a 
reconciled head grade of 1.44g/t at the Greenfields Mill in Coolgardie.
The partnership produced more than 9740 ounces during two mining campaigns last year, returning a total gold 
revenue of $29.28 million.
Auric plans to put its surplus cash to work by continuing with the development of its nearby Munda gold deposit, 
alongside broader exploration. That now appears likely to include follow-up drilling at Spargoville, with results from 
the company's latest campaign at the Fugitive prospect delivering several promising new targets.

It has been a while since the IPO window cracked open for junior exploration companies, but with gold sitting firmly 
above $3500 an ounce in local currency terms, there's a sense the precious metal is coming back into fashion.
Argonaut Securities thinks so, at any rate, opening the books on a 20c initial public offering for Ordell Minerals this 
week in the hope that the heady gold price - and a bit of lithium nearology in the south of Western Australia - will 
help to get a $5m float away.
Ordell is run by former Genesis Minerals boss Michael Fowler, who left the company in 2022 to make way for 
Raleigh Finlayson and his grand ambitions of dominating the Leonora gold district. Ordell is chaired by Tommy 
McKeith, who stepped down as Genesis chair in 2022.
And Ordell's main exploration project, Barimaia, also comes from Genesis, which will emerge with a 9 per cent 
stake in the explorer after the float as part of an agreement to sell the tenements.
Barimaia sits a stone's throw from Ramelius Resources' Mt Magnet operations, and in a district that's seen a fair 
bit of corporate interest in recent times as Ramelius and Westgold jostle for position.
The project was previously drilled by both IGO and Genesis, and Ordell's prospectus shows pretty solid historical 
intercepts, including 15m at 11.4 grams a tonne gold, 17m at 3.4 grams a tonne, and 70m at 0.68 grams a tonne.
But the company now reckons the work conducted by Ramelius at its nearby deposit offers a better geological 
interpretation for Barimaia and hopes to have better luck hanging a resource off previous drilling by targeting the 
next round a bit better.
Ordell also plans to spend a bit of its exploration cash at its Goodia Project, 15km southwest of Norseman - an area 
once best known for gold, but now the subject of lithium interest. The Goodia tenements were previously held by 
Galileo Mining, last seen selling 30 per cent of the lithium rights at its own Norseman tenements to Mineral 
Resources for $7.5m.

Perth-headquartered corporate advisory firm Azure Capital has hired KPMG's national co-lead of private equity, as 
it seeks to drop a pin on Melbourne.
Nick Combes, a dealmaker with 17 years of experience, has joined Azure Capital's partnership ranks. His credits 
include selling Waste Services Group to Livingbridge for about $500 million in 2021, and Fermentum Group to 
Japanese giant Kirin's Lion business.
At Azure, Combes will focus on hunting down private equity gigs for the firm across red-hot sectors of advanced 
manufacturing, waste and defence, in addition to food and beverage. Azure is also shipping off its Sydney-based 
partner and ex-Goldman Sachs infrastructure banker Phil Prenc - having just divested a slice of Linx on behalf of 
Canadian giant Brookfield - to co-lead the newly created Melbourne office with Combes.
Combes joins Azure's senior leadership across industrials and private equity that includes Adrian Arundell, Grant 
Mansell and Ben Sloman in Sydney, and Olivia Boyne, David Flynn, Daniel Della Vedova and Michael Campion in 
Perth. "Having started my career in Perth, I have always admired what the Azure team have achieved over many 
years; so I am thrilled to reunite with Adrian and help expand their market-leading business on the East Coast," 
Combes said.
Although best recognised for advising mining companies, Azure has been winning a steady stream of work in 
industrials and sponsors, including overseeing 7-Eleven Australia's $1.7 billion sale to Japan's Seven & I.
The firm's other roles have included advising Morgan Stanley Infrastructure Partners on its $1 billion acquisition of 
MinRes' pit-to-port road in Onslow, Westfarmers on the sale of its Evol LNG business, and gold miner Ramelius on 
its attempts to buy Canada's Karora and then local peer Westgold.
"Nick has developed a strong reputation as a leading M&A adviser. The appointment of someone of his calibre 
deepens our private sponsors focus and builds on the momentum generated by Adrian Arundell's relocation to 
Sydney earlier this year," Azure managing partner Richie Baston said.

Azure Capital, which sold a 50 per cent stake to Natixis in July 2019, has about 45 dealmakers - from analysts to 
partners - and is frequently spotted in resources, energy and industrials deals.
Its last partner addition was Olivia Boyne, who led 7-Eleven's sale with David Flynn and has been advising financial 
sponsors and industrials clients at the firm since 2015.

An unnamed buyer was seeking to acquire at least 10 per cent of West Australian gold explorer Spartan 
Resources (n&#xE9;e Gascoyne Resources) after yesterday's closing bell, sending out Citi's equities desk to 
round up the shares.
Potential sellers were told to bid in 1¢ increments from an 82¢ floor to a maximum of 89¢ per Spartan share. That 
represented a nil to 8.5 per cent premium to the last close.
A term sheet seen by Street Talk said the "industry participant" already owned 4.75 per cent of the register and 
wanted to inch up to at least 10 per cent. "The Acquirer has no current intention to acquire control or make a 
takeover offer for SPR," it added.
Fund managers know it's only would-be-bidders or strategics that lap up shares at a premium to the last close.
But in Spartan's case, they might have to wait for a while before the buyer is ready to make a move.
In 2021, when it was still called Gascoyne, the company fielded a scrip bid from the now $1.2 billion Westgold 
Resources. Nothing came of the talks, and Westgold has since moved on its scrip-and-cash bid for Canada-listed 
Karora Resources.
Interestingly, another listed gold player, Ramelius Resources, has sniffed around Spartan in the past. Ramelius 
boss Mark Zeptner's made no secret he's on the M&A trail as the company stares down a big production slump in 
FY25, thanks to its ageing Edna May mine.
So far this year, Zeptner's had to walk away from Karora - the same company being bought by Westgold. To make 
matters worse, Ramelius also approached Westgold to explore a $3 billion-plus merger, but was turned back. The 
company is now at the Takeovers Panel, nit-picking its rival's Canadian acquisition.
Given the recent events, it wouldn't be surprising if Ramelius pops up with a substantial shareholding notice at 
Spartan Resources come this morning. However, fund managers who asked Citi to name last night's buyer were 
met with silence.

Spartan had a $916.8 million market capitalisation and has run up a whopping 382 per cent in the past 12 months. 
In April, the company raised $80 million via Canaccord Genuity, Euroz Hartleys and Sternship Advisers. Its share 
price has been a rollercoaster ride for investors, who have had to sit through a few recaps as its Dalgaranga mine 
stuttered through exploration.
The book was to shut at 7pm for Asia Pacific investors.

African gold miner Perseus is out of the contest for Newmont's Akyem gold mine in Ghana, with Chinese parties 
said to be strongly placed to bid top dollar for the asset that was earlier estimated at about $1bn.
The sale process run by investment bank Citi is understood to be in the late stages, with global groups competing 
for the mine that is capable of producing 422,000 ounces of gold annually.
The understanding is that Perseus looked at Akyem, although the company has never publicly confirmed this, with 
chief executive Jeff Quartermaine saying only "it is in our back yard" when asked.
Perseus in April purchased the listed OreCorp for $270m, or 57.5c per share, and is now focused on developing its 
Nyanzaga Project in Tanzania, capable of producing 295,000 ounces of gold per annum.
It adds to its three operating gold mines in West Africa, including two in the Cote d'Ivoire and one in Ghana.
Perseus reported a 21 per cent increase in its net profit for the six months to December on the previous 
corresponding period to $US164.7m and expects to generate more than 491,000 ounces of gold for the year to 
June. Another key area of focus has been the development of its CMA mine pit underground extension to the 
Yaoure Gold Mine.
Meanwhile, Chinese groups may be in the strongest contention for Akyem when it comes to price, but Newmont will 
take into consideration whether the buyer is a responsible owner of the asset, so it may not get sold to the highest 
bidder.
Newmont is offloading mines globally following its $24bn purchase of Australia's largest gold mining company 
Newcrest.
It is also working with advisory firm BMO to sell mines in Canada and North America, including the Musselwhite, 
Cripple Creek (US) and Eleonore (Canada) projects, potentially worth a combined $1.5bn.
The contest is expected to attract North American miners.

Last on the block will be Newmont's Telfer gold mine in Western Australia, which Macquarie Capital is mandated to 
sell. Greatland Gold has first right to buy the asset and there's been some market chatter that perhaps the 
negotiations are already afoot, despite floating at Telfer's tailings dam causing production delays.
There was also a suggestion that Ramelius Resources could be interested. However, judging by the trading in 
Spartan Resources, it appears Ramelius's interest lies elsewhere.
The Australian listed gold miner that last year held merger talks with near-by rival Westgold Resources told the 
market on Thursday it had purchased 8.9 per cent of the $994m listed gold miner Spartan after a major holding 
from Tembo Capital was on offer through Citi.
However, it added that it had no current intention to acquire control or make a takeover of the business that owns 
the Dalgaranga Gold Project, 65km northwest of Mt Magnet in Murchison, Western Australia, where Ramelius 
owns a gold processing hub.
Still, it gives Ramelius deal certainty should it be keen to move in on the target in the future.
DataRoom reported in April that Spartan was on the radar of Ramelius. Spartan was previously called Gascoyne 
and had to undergo a string of emergency equity raisings since 2019 following losses, with a mill far bigger than its 
production capacity being its downfall.
The strategic move by Ramelius resembles Silver Lake's with Red 5, buying 11 per cent last year ahead of a scrip 
merger deal later with the $1.2bn company.
The share price of Red 5 post the merger has been lagging, down about 20 per cent in the past month and taking 
its market value to $2.5bn. Some Silver Lake assets now part of Red 5 are also close to Spartan's. Australian listed 
gold mining companies are under pressure to consolidate to attract global institutional investors that want gold 
mining investment opportunities of scale.

BHP's failed bid for Anglo American dominated attention in the second half of the 2024 financial year, but the 
search for value in the mid-tier mining sector was dominated by the resurgence of gold and the fall from grace of 
the critical minerals sector.
With one exception at the top of the list, gold companies delivered the best returns for the full -financial year within 
the mid-cap resources sector, with seven of the top 10 total returns - including share price movements and 
dividends - on the S&P/ASX 300 Metals and Mining index coming from gold miners.
The copper price recovery helped Sandfire Resources return to grace, as the last major pure play miner of the 
commodity on the Australian bourse.
Sandfire shares ended the year on a slide though, alongside the copper price, closing on Friday at $8.73, 14 per 
cent below its annual high of $10.16 in May, when the copper price was also riding high at close to $US11,000 a 
tonne.
But, despite the late slip, Sandfire shares still delivered a total annual return of close to 48 per cent for the financial 
year.
Stanmore Resources' acquisition of BHP's unwanted BMC coal assets in Queensland helped the company to 
become one of the other exceptions, with the transformation of the scale of the miner's business putting it in eighth 
spot for the fiscal year, with dividend payments helping it to a 46 per cent total return.
But, despite dire circumstances elsewhere in the sector, junior lithium play Wildcat Resources topped the best 10 
performers, with a 162.5 per cent total return.
Even so, with a 31.5c close on Friday, Wildcat is a long way off its $1.01 peak in November at the height of the 
lithium land grab that saw Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting, Chris Ellison's Mineral Resources and global 
majors SQM and Albemarle put billions of dollars on the table for lithium explorers as the price of the battery metal 
plunged.

Wild ride as investors tally mining's FY24 winners and losers
But it was gold that delivered the best returns for mid-tier mining investors for the financial year, as soaring global 
inflation rates and geopolitical uncertainty helped the price of the precious metal surge.
The S&P All Ordinaries gold index hit a low of 6023.1 in early October 2023, and a high of 8153.4 in late May - an 
extraordinary 33 per cent gap - before softening late in the financial year to close at 7357.
The best returns of the year on the S&P/ASX 300 Metals and Mining index came from West Australian miner Red 5, 
which delivered an 89.5 per cent total return for the financial year despite a sharp fall in its share price from highs of 
49.5c in mid-May to a 36c close on Friday.
West African Resources was in second spot, with an 86.1 per cent return as the Burkina Faso gold miner closes in 
on the start of production from its second gold mine in the country.
And Morgan Hart's Emerald Resources continued its strong run after turning its Okvau gold mine in Cambodia into 
a reliable production hub, worth about 100,000 ounces a year, and finally completed a long-running takeover of WA 
explorer Bullseye Mining, adding a high-grade Australian project to its development options.
Emerald delivered a total return of 86 per cent for the financial year, followed by the two companies competing to 
emerge as WA's next major mid-tier gold play - Westgold Resources and Ramelius Resources, which delivered 
68.7 per cent and 54.7 per cent returns respectively.
And Africa-focused Perseus Mining added to its reputation as one of the Australian gold sector's most reliable 
producers, gaining 45.3 per cent on a total return basis.
But while the political hype around critical minerals shows now sign of diminishing, the shine has long gone from 
commodity prices and the ASX-listed stocks that jumped on board the green metal wagon. Any Core Lithium 
shareholders looking to indulge in a little tax-loss selling to offset taxable gains elsewhere in their portfolio will have 
been well-placed last week, with the company - the first major Australian victim of the lithium price plunge - finishing 
the year down 89.7 per cent, the biggest loss on the S&P/ASX 300 Metals and Mining index.
Investors who jumped on the Canadian lithium bandwagon have also had a torrid time, with Sayona Mining and 
Patriot Battery Metals down 79 per cent and 67.5 per cent respectively.
Chalice Mining was the third biggest loser on the list, with a 77.3 per cent plunge for the fiscal year after delivering 
an underwhelming scoping study on its Gonneville project in WA in August last year.
IGO was hit by falling lithium and nickel prices - while still feeling the hangover from its disastrous takeover of 
Western Areas - and suffered a 60.6 per cent value loss for the year.
Graphite plays Talga Group, Syrah Resources and Renascor Resources all made the top 10 loser list.
The list is rounded out by -Liontown Resources, which was the hottest lithium play on the market when Albemarle 
lobbed a $2.50-a-share bid in March 2023. Hancock Prospecting spoiled that takeover, however, and the falling 
lithium price - as well as cost blowouts at its Kathleen Valley project in WA - did the rest, with Liontown stock 
closing off 68 per cent for the financial year at 90.5c.

Another Monday, another move on Spartan Resources' register.
Street Talk spotted three trades in the West Australian gold explorer after yesterday's closing bell.
Around 100 million shares swapped hands at 92¢ per share - a slim discount to the close price of 93.5¢.
Ramelius Resources is the obvious party people are pointing to.
The $2.3 billion listed gold miner was outed as Spartan Resources mystery raider on Thursday, picking up 8.9 per 
cent of the company via Citi's equities desk in an after-market raid.
However, with Spartan now in play, it's difficult to rule out another party seeking to hoover up stock.
Major Spartan shareholder Tembo Capital reduced its holding by 5 per cent as revealed in a substantial holding 
announcement last week.
Spartan had a $1.1 billion market capitalisation and has run up a whopping 392 per cent in the past 12 months. In 
April, the company raised $80 million via Canaccord Genuity, Euroz Hartleys and Sternship Advisers.
Its share price has been a rollercoaster ride for investors, who have had to sit through a few recaps as its 
Dalgaranga mine stuttered through exploration.
The gold space has seen a flurry of activity in recent months, most recently Westgold Resources taking an 18.70 
per cent stake in Ora Gold in early June. Meanwhile, Street Talk reported that Ramelius Resources had 
approached $1 billion Westgold Resources to discuss a merger proposal, in a deal that could be the sector's 
biggest amid a recent wave of consolidation.

Falls in commodity prices over the weekend sent the Australian sharemarket lower in its opening session of the 
week.
The S&P/ASX 200 fell 59.1 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 7763.2 yesterday, while the All Ordinaries slid 0.7 per cent. 
Miners were the worst performing, falling 1.8 per cent, after a slump in iron ore.
Iron ore futures in Singapore fell a further 2.2 per cent to $107.90 per tonne yesterday after falling 3 per cent at the 
end of last week amid growing concerns about Chinese demand and signs of oversupply.
The ASX's largest stock, mining giant BHP, fell 2.1 per cent to $43.48, mirroring similar falls in other iron ore majors 
Fortescue and Rio Tinto. Energy stocks fell 1.7 per cent, with Woodside slipping 1.8 per cent to $28.74 and Santos 
edging 2.1 per cent lower to $7.82.
Brent crude slipped 1 per cent in its final session of last week after rallying in previous sessions amid concerns 
surrounding Hurricane Beryl in the Gulf of Mexico. The oil price drifted another 0.4 per cent lower yesterday to 
$US86.18 a barrel. A shift in the direction of the storm towards Texas had traders continuing to sell during trading 
yesterday.
"While this puts some offshore oil and gas production at risk, the concern when the storm makes landfall is the 
potential impact it could have on refinery infrastructure," said Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at 
ING.
"Any prolonged refinery outages would be bearish for crude oil and bullish for refined products."
Lithium miners also suffered as traders continue to weigh the outlook for the battery metal. Arcadium Lithium fell 4.5 
per cent to $4.93 and IGO dropped 3.9 per cent to $5.70.
Gold miners, meanwhile, were buoyed by a 1 per cent boost in the gold price over the weekend, following data in 
the US that showed slowing wage growth and a rising unemployment rate in the job market.

Ramelius Resources was 1.8 per cent higher at $1.87 after the gold miner revealed it had produced just over 
293,000 ounces of gold in the 2024 financial year, topping the company's recently upgraded guidance.
Fellow gold miner Red 5 announced it had restructured its existing hedging agreement following its merger with 
Silver Lake Resources earlier this year. The shares gained 5.3 per cent to 39.5¢.
South Australian copper and gold developer Rex Minerals soared 56.4 per cent to 43¢, following news of a high-
profile buyout deal by MACH Metals Australia, owned by Indonesia's wealthy Salim family. Core Lithium jumped 
17.6 per cent to 10¢ after overshooting its production guidance.
GQG Partners' funds under management have jumped above $US155 billion ($229.8 billion) after pulling in a 
further $US6.5 billion in June. The shares slipped 3.4 per cent to $2.85, having rallied more than 70 per cent since 
the start of the year.
And Bowen Coking Coal fell 8.9 per cent to 5.1¢ after selling a stake in the Broadmeadow East Mine to Formosa 
Plastics Group.

Green shoots and blue skies.
Could it be that a difficult couple of years for small-cap companies are now starting to make their way - finally - into 
the rear-vision mirror? Well, the signs are good, at least, after stock exchange highs emerged this week.
The ASX 200, for example, hit an all-time record of 8083.7 points during the week, largely on a growing expectation 
that interest rate cuts are coming in the United States on the back of the Federal Reserve's optimism that inflation is 
returning to target levels.
The big companies - such as the Commonwealth Bank, which hit a record share price high of $134.25 this week - 
have been surfing the crest of the bull wave. Major banks, tech stocks and health care companies have also been 
donning their boardies and bikinis for their time in the sun.
So, is it also now time for the small-caps to start lathering up with the Reef Oil? Many would be hoping that the 
more-than-solid ASX runs for the four companies appearing in this edition of Bulls N' Bears Runners of the Week is 
a sign of better times to come for those in the shallower end of the pool.
This week's Runners all centre around the red and yellow metals - for the uninitiated, that means copper and gold - 
which, like the ASX this week, are testing all-time highs. Traders cashing in on the pending US interest rate cuts 
pumped the gold price to dizzying record levels of more than US$2480 (AU$3700) an ounce, while the global glut 
for quality copper and copper assets continues as the red metal's price also remains near all-time highs.
So, to our Runners and taking out top spot this week is DGR Global, which enjoyed a sharp price hike of 290 per 
cent from a previous close of 1c, launching to a 3.9c high. The company surged in valuation on the strength of its 
6.6 per cent shareholding in TSX-listed copper-gold developer SolGold.
Late Monday night, SolGold confirmed it had secured a US$750 million (AU$1120 million) funding package to 
progress its tier-one Cascabel copper-gold project in northern Ecuador. The company claims the project is the 
biggest undeveloped Latin American copper asset that is not in the hands of a major.
The operation has a mammoth measured and indicated resource of more than 19.1 million tonnes of copper 
equivalent.

The funding package from North American syndicate Franco Nevada and Osisko Royalties validates an estimated 
US$3.2 billion (AU$4.78 billion) net present value (NPV) at an after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 24 per cent as 
outlined in SolGold's prefeasibility study (PFS) in March. Interestingly, the study is comprised of some conservative 
metals prices for copper at US$3.85 (AU$5.75) per pound and gold at US$1750 (AU$2611) per ounce.
The syndicate has no doubt run some back-of-the-envelope calculations in its valuations, perhaps using the recent 
all-time price highs for copper and gold, which are more than 25 per cent and 40 per cent higher than those used in 
the PFS, respectively.A close second placing this week goes to Labyrinth Resources, which jumped 280 per cent 
after revealing its plan to acquire 100 per cent of two gold projects in Western Australia's Goldfields region. The 
well-timed announcement, which saw the company's stock rise from a 0.5c close last week to 1.9c, coincided with 
gold hitting its record high.
The deal will see Labyrinth acquire Ramelius Resources' Vivien gold project and also affords it the option to 
acquire the remaining 49 per cent of its Comet Vale gold project.
Comet Vale, just 32km south of Menzies next to the Goldfields Highway, features a recently-updated mineral 
resource of 96,000 ounces at 4.8 grams per tonne gold. Labyrinth is aiming to bolster the high-grade resource 
inventory and capitalise on its new underexplored, high-grade mines.
A 4.8g/t gold resource is nothing to poke a stick at by WA standards. Just last month, emerging Murchison major 
Westgold Resources penned a"strategic alliance" agreement with junior explorer Ora Gold to gain access to its 
240,000-ounce Crown Prince deposit that runs at an impressive 4.1g/t.
Labyrinth has also raised $2 million through a placement and will present existing shareholders with an additional 
$2 million entitlement offer to support its endeavours to expand its high-grade resources and hopefully follow in 
Ora's footsteps.
Taking out bronze, a fitting alloy for a story with a majority copper flavour, is Miramar Resources. The company's 
share price jumped almost 188 per cent - from 0.8c to 2.3c - after revelations of promising high-grade copper, lead 
and silver samples from its Joy Helen prospect within its new Chain Pool project in WA's Gascoyne region.
The project, while still not granted, shows plenty of potential after returning rock chip assays going up to 5.49 per 
cent copper, 42 per cent lead and 73.48g/t silver. Despite the impressive at-surface numbers, management says 
the Joy Helen prospect has seen no modern and systematic exploration, nor drilling.
The mineralisation style is interpreted to be "Mississippi Valley-type" and shows some intriguing similarities to its 
neighbouring Abra lead-zinc-silver deposit that is also hosted in the Irregully rock formation.
But Miramar will be hoping this story doesn't turn out like that of Abra owner Galena Mining, which ran aground 
earlier this year with debts totalling some $160 million to international lenders because of a poor lead-zinc 
environment. Fortunately for Miramar, copper seems to be the ticket this week and maybe that's what Galena's 
deposit was missing.
Our final Runner for the week is Stelar Metals, which shot up more than 101 per cent this week on ... yep, you 
guessed it, copper rock chip samples.
High-grade copper findings were sampled along a 3km strike at its Baratta project in South Australia, returning 
grades of up to 28.7 per cent. It is a region Stelar says shows similarities to the prolific Central African Copper Belt 
(CACB) - the biggest and most prolific mineralised sediment-hosted copper province known on Earth.
The company reported 21 of the 72 samples exceeding grades of 10 per cent copper, underscoring the potential of 
the historically-productive Baratta site featuring a mine that produced copper ore between 1896 and 1904.
Rather unfortunately for Stelar, the traditional owners in the Adnyamathanha native title organisation remains in 
administration. The company says it will continue to monitor the native title situation and will lodge applications for 
drilling at Baratta when the traditional owner organisation comes out of administration.Page 3 of 3
ASX leads way to better market times ahead
If copper is the flavour of the month, then it seems rock chip samples were this week's tipple of the week. Now, we'll 
just have to wait and see if the all-time highs for the index will overlap with a return of interest to the small end of 
town.

There's never a dull moment in Australia's listed gold sector.
Street Talk understands the $71 million Brightstar Resources and the $24 million Alto Metals are set to merge in an 
all-scrip deal. The shares will be exchanged on a one-for-four basis, giving Brightstar a circa 66.6 per cent 
ownership of the combined entity.
As part of the deal, Canaccord Genuity and Argonaut will seek to raise about $20 million from investors, sources 
said.
Alto's Sandstone project in Western Australia has been producing gold since the 19th century and has a 17.6 
million tonne mineral resource estimate at 1.5 grams per tonne. It is next door to Westgold's Big Bell mine and 
Ramelius' Mount Magnet. The small-cap had long been seen as a takeover target - the now $1.2 billion Westgold 
Resources held a 14 per cent stake in 2022, while China's Shandong Goldsea Group Co tabled a bid in 2020.
Merger partner Brightstar is led by Alex Rovira, who was previously a banker at Canaccord. It is drilling at the Cork 
Tree Well deposit in WA's Laverton. Sources said the company has been hunting for acquisitions.
The tie-up comes as ASX-listed gold stocks remain a reliable source of M&A activity for bankers and investors, at a 
time when deals have dried up in lithium and nickel amid a slump in commodity prices. Established gold players are 
being driven by a need to replace ageing mines, while juniors are exploring combinations to secure their future.
At the bigger end of the town, Westgold has acquired Toronto-listed Karora Resources - despite attempts from 
Ramelius Resources to kibosh the deal. Earlier in the year, Red5 and Silver Lake agreed to a $2.2 billion merger.
Ramelius, for its part, has been scoping out targets. Recently it raided WA explorer Spartan Resources' register 
for a 17.94 per cent stake after an unsuccessful tilt at Karora.

West Australian gold producers are poised to capitalise on their riches by turning to mergers and acquisitions 
according to Deloitte, whose annual stocktake of WA-based companies found gold a rare bright spot in a year of 
value destruction for critical minerals.
Companies exposed to green metals and headquartered in the west lost an aggregate $23 billion in market 
capitalisation in 2023-24, the professional services firm found.
The winners were gold miner Red 5, up by 273 per cent as of June 30, Emerald Resources (up 90 per cent) and 
Ramelius Resources (up 76 per cent).
Broadening the field to the top 100 WA companies captures gold play Spartan Resources, which jumped 626 per 
cent, and copper and gold explorer FireFly Metals (up 545 per cent).
Ruling off a year to forget were Hancock-backed lithium producer Liontown Resources down 65 per cent, Delta 
Lithium (down 57 per cent), Lynas Rare Earths (down 13 per cent), Iluka Resources (down 41 per cent) and nickel 
and lithium producer IGO (down 63 per cent).
Deloitte audit and assurance partner Dave Andrews said commodity price volatility made WA mining ripe for deals.
"There is a clear linkage between M&A priorities and the energy transition. We can expect it to continue to dominate 
the M&A landscape, but not in isolation, with the gold industry bringing together regional asset portfolios and 
building operational scale," he said.
The string of gold deals in the past 12 months has spanned Red 5 and Silverlake, Ramelius and Musgrave, 
Emerald and Bullseye, and Genesis and Dacian.
Westgold completed its $2.5 billion merger with Toronto-listed Karora last week to create a mid-tier gold producer.
Mr Andrews said Ramelius, which has done seven deals in six years, was "at it again" grabbing a near 18 per cent 
stake in Spartan.

Big gains turn miners' eyes to M&A Returns
Speaking after Ramelius released June quarter results last week, chief executive Mark Zeptner said his company 
would take a wait and see approach on Spartan and its Never Never discovery.
"Whilst we'd like to have Never Never in our portfolio, we actually look at it as a nice to have, rather than a need to 
have," he said at the time.
Ramelius' $87 million spending spree on Spartan stock came after revelations Ramelius had been in takeover 
talks with Westgold late last year and that the two gold producers had agreed to a 12-month "mutual standstill".
Westgold moved on through the Karora merger. The sector is aiming to fill the void left by Newmont's acquisition of 
Newcrest Mining.

Australia's lithium mining industry may have had its chance to shine last year, but it is those digging gold out of the 
ground that are back in favour among resources investors.
As the Diggers & Dealers Conference gets under way in Kalgoorlie this week, investors have once again made gold 
a key focus.
But while gold producers are in favour, it's a different story for developers, who face a tough journey getting projects 
into production.
"Exploration is hard," Westgold Resources managing director Wayne Bramwell says. "Being a single mine project 
developer is really hard and it is a massive leap to get to that point where you can become a portfolio company, 
where your risk is mitigated by having multiple production outlets." In the past month, Calidus Resources collapsed 
after lender Macquarie called in its loans.
Meanwhile, Bellevue Gold's recent $150m-plus raising proved that gaining investor backing and moving to 
production can be a bumpy path, when it surprised investors with the raise and lower production forecasts.
"Bellevue has done a good job to get into production, but it is proving more difficult than they promised the market 
and there are growing pains that come with that," Barrenjoey mining analyst Daniel Morgan says.
Diggers and Dealers will feature 66 corporate presentations from listed miners, explorers and other exhibitors from 
the resources sector.
Many investors made their way to Western Australia ahead of the conference, with Bellevue Gold holding a site visit 
last Wednesday and Gold Road Resources the previous Thursday, along with Northern Star's Super Pit gold mine 
on the outskirts of Kalgoorlie.

Accommodation is tight for delegates at the conference. Some sidestep the event, instead using the build-up as an 
opportunity to schedule meetings in Perth, but it still attracts over 2000 delegates.
Lithium miners stole the show last year. Producers of the battery material were in favour because of the expected 
ramp-up in electric vehicle manufacturing. But the lithium price has come off the boil while gold is striking record 
highs.
"If you went back last year or the year before, what was remarkable was lithium, which had been a small 
commodity, had really come to dominate the proceedings at Diggers and Dealers," Morgan says.
"The Australian-dollar gold price is high, and lithium and nickel are having a tough time of it and not likely to be as 
focused on growth. Nickel and lithium are battening down the hatches." Domestic gold production growth has 
slowed over the past decade as mines approach the end of their productive lives, says IBISWorld, but it's set to 
return to growth as project expansions come online, capitalising on the weaker Australian dollar.
The industry's annual revenue is about $27.9bn and growing at a rate of 4.4 per cent as the metal continues to act 
as an inflation hedge and benefits from central bank purchases.
Australia is the third-largest producer globally with 293.8 tonnes in 2023, behind China and Russia, according to the 
World Gold Council.
Lithium miners dominated the mergers and acquisitions landscape in the resources industry last year, with 
Albemarle bidding for Liontown Resources (it later abandoned the deal), SQM acquiring Azure Minerals, Chalice 
Mining looking for a backer and speculation about a move on Patriot Battery Metals by Pilbara Minerals, which was 
sitting on a $3bn cash pile. But investment bankers have turned their attention to gold.
Heading into Diggers and Dealers, there has been talk Regis and Gold Road Resources might merge. Ramelius 
Resources is also in focus with an 8.9 per cent stake in Spartan Resources, West Gold and Ramelius have held 
takeover talks and there's the perennial takeover target De Grey Mining.
Genesis Minerals boss Raleigh Finlayson has emphasised his focus is on operations rather than deals, but the 
company is surrounded by consolidation opportunities in Western Australia's Leonora gold district, while it's 
expected Northern Star will return to deal making to gain further scale after the country's largest gold miner 
Newcrest was taken over by Newmont.
Driving M&A, Bramwell says, will be producers with cash. "This is a time when the producers are cashed-up and 
the explorers and the people in the middle are cash-strapped." Also of interest this year will be uranium miners like 
Boss Energy and Paladin, as the fuel remains at the centre of the energy debate and demand grows, with a lack of 
supply to the West from Russia. "There's a lot of enthusiasm towards the sector. Its prospects are still high and 
have not dimmed as much as lithium or nickel or rare earths have," Morgan says. Another positive for gold could be 
nickel producers such as BHP mothballing projects, making workers available.

Groups that mine more than 400,000 ounces of gold annually are more likely to get attention from investors 
allocating a shrinking pool of funds to listed Australian stocks in the sector, says Westgold Resources boss Wayne 
Bramwell.
The managing director of the $1.3bn Westgold said the concept of remaining relevant was top of mind for chief 
executives of mid-tier gold miners on the Australian Securities Exchange, and it would likely drive mergers and 
acquisitions in the space.
"Capital markets are shrinking in certain areas, so it is not just about being profitable but relevant," he said.
Mr Bramwell said being relevant meant mining at least 400,000 ounces of gold a year.
"Under that space, you may be interesting, but less relevant to a broader audience," he said.
His comments at the Diggers and Dealers conference in Kalgoorlie come after Mr Bramwell struck a $2.2bn deal to 
merge with the Canadian-listed Karora.
"Now we have moved above that space, we are more relevant to a broader audience," he said.
Rival ASX miner Ramelius Resources, which was also in earlier talks to buy Karora, lobbed an objection to the 
Takeovers Panel about the deal.
The process exposed mergers and acquisition talks between the Mark Zeptner-led Ramelius and Westgold late 
last year that involved standstill terms between the pair.
Ramelius owns two production and processing hubs at Mt Magnet and Edna May, both in Western Australia, and is 
developing its Rebecca and Cue Gold Projects.
Mr Bramwell confirmed there were talks late last year with Ramelius, which were likely to be similar to what the 
company had with Karora. However, he ruled out any further M&A with Ramelius or any other player.

"We have to just focus on what we have now," he said.
"This is a big jump for us, and we have doubled the size of the business overnight and so the expectation on the 
business is very high." Westgold mines in the Murchison and Southern Goldfields regions of WA has a tenure of 
more than 3200sq km, operating six underground mines and five processing plants.

Ramelius Resources boss Mark Zeptner says his company's acquisition of an 8.9 per cent stake in Spartan 
Resources in June provided a "seat at the table" and he would continue to assess the gold miner as a potential 
target.
However, he said the company had moved on from Westgold Resources after holding takeover talks with its fellow 
gold miner last year.
On the sidelines of the Diggers and Dealers conference in Kalgoorlie, Zeptner said that Ramelius moved on 
Spartan when "an opportunity presented itself" and the company would continue to assess the target.
"We did some work â€¦ and thought that is an opportunity we would like to capitalise on." He said he knew 
Spartan's managing director Simon Lawson, and the pair had a coffee, "and that's as far as it has gone,".
"Ultimately, as the project grows, it becomes more and more attractive to others, but it is in our backyard." 
Ramelius owns and operates two production and processing hubs at Mt Magnet and Edna May, in Western 
Australia.
It is also developing its Rebecca-Roe project and Cue Gold Project, 35km south of Mt Magnet, after buying Apollo 
Consolidated in 2022 and Musgrave Minerals the following year.
It purchased Spartan shares at 92c in June, and they are currently trading at about $1.08.
Spartan, with a $1.3bn market value, owns the Dalgaranga Gold Project, 65km northwest of Mt Magnet in 
Murchison, where Ramelius owns a processing hub.
Part of that is its Never Never high-grade gold deposit on which the company is pinning its hopes for growth.
It was previously called Gascoyne Resources and collapsed after gold production levels being processed through 
its mill were not profitable, and it was later recapitalised after its market value fell beneath $100m.

Ramelius boss keeps watching brief on Spartan Resources - DATA ROOM
"Everyone would like a Never Never in their portfolio - for us, it is a nice to have, but not a must-have." Speculation 
has existed about a move by Ramelius on Spartan since at least 2021 as the gold industry looks to consolidate.
Zeptner said Ramelius saw "some real synergies" with Westgold, but the opportunity had "been and gone".
He said discussions with the Canada listed gold miner Karora, which has operations in WA, ended in February after 
a deal could not be reached on value.
Karora went on to merge with Westgold.
Zeptner addressed his move to object to the merger between Westgold and Karora by taking the matter to the 
Takeovers Panel, with Ramelius accusing Westgold of breaching standstill conditions relating to its takeover talks.
He said that the panel took too long to rule on the matter that was raised in April and not finalised until July, so he 
would not have taken that path if the company had its time again. "The panel response wasn't timely so it wasn't 
effective," he said.
Late last year, it was known around the market that Ramelius was in search of an opportunity where it could add 
100,000 ounces of gold per annum and wanted to add a third production hub to put its cash pile to work. Zeptner 
said he was focused on good margins and cashflow.

Kalgoorlie postcard The high hopes of last year have faded.
Darren Stralow and Simon Lawson shook hands and said their goodbyes. The young gold bulls had just met and 
thought they were about to die together in a plane crash.
It was 2011, the gold price was about $1300 an ounce and Northern Star Resources was starting its rise from the 
ranks of penny dreadful to where it sits today, the biggest ASX-listed producer.
The plane, its engines dead after sucking in dirty fuel, eventually glided to an emergency landing in Paraburdoo, 
Western Australia.
"Everyone was looking out of the window, you could see the fire engines rushing to the side of the runway for the 
landing to make sure that we weren't going to burst into flames," recalls Stralow.
Lawson and Stralow, working for Northern Star at the time, bonded over the near-death experience and shared a 
few cold beers that night in town.
These days, Stralow is chief executive of Bellevue Gold. Lawson is the managing director of Spartan Resources.
Spartan shares soared from 22¢ to as high as $1.33 in the past 12 months on the back of the Never Never 
discovery about 800 kilometres south of their emergency landing. Bellevue has been as high as $2.10, although it 
now hovers near a 12-month low of $1.25.
Lawson and Stralow were two of the star attractions at the Diggers & Dealers mining conference in Kalgoorlie, 
where gold was centre stage. The critical minerals presenters did their best to sound upbeat but were a reminder of 
fickle commodity markets and how quickly high-flyers can crash.
Kalgoorlie is relying on gold as it deals with the fallout from the collapse of the nickel industry and failures to launch 
in lithium in the wider Goldfields region.

Gold saves the day as Diggers deals with the rout
Smoke still pours from the 150-metre-high main chimney stack at the BHP nickel smelter outside the town, but it will 
stop soon after 51 years.
About 10 kilometres away, on the edge of town, Northern Star is investing $1.5 billion on a giant crusher to boost 
output from the fabled Superpit and underground mines. Those operations cover ground that has already produced 
about 65 million ounces of gold worth about $222 billion at today's spot price of $US2398 ($3700) an ounce.
Stralow reminds everyone of how tough it can be to get new mines into production and running, even with price 
tailwinds.
He needed to do so as an explanation of Bellevue's decision to raise $150 million last month, a move that caught 
the market by surprise. At least Bellevue could raise money. Commodity analysts Citi and others have predicted the 
gold price could reach $US3000 an ounce by this time next year under a bullish scenario.
Raising money appears a forlorn hope for lithium projects, with benchmark prices for the concentrate produced in 
WA slumping to $US870 a tonne this week. Liontown Resources managing director Tony Ottaviano, who has just 
defied the odds to bring the Kathleen Valley mine to life, told the conference it was now impossible to fund a lithium 
project with equity alone.
Lithium veteran Ken Brinsden, who piloted Pilbara Minerals through near ruin, suggested the federal government 
create something akin to the former Australian Wheat Board to help fund strategically important rare earths 
projects.
While the Kalgoorlie pubs did a roaring trade, the BHP stand inside the conference's main marquee stood almost 
empty. All it had to offer was advice on where there might be other jobs after the mothballing of the nickel smelter 
and mines that were the lifeblood of towns such as Leinster and Kambalda.
Lawson brought his gold company back to life after a triple bypass. It failed twice when known as Gascoyne 
Resources. He was sacking workers two years ago but has had remarkable success with the drill bit since then 
under the Spartan moniker.
Spartan's most exciting discovery is Never Never, part of the Dalgaranga project. And it is one reason that mid-tier 
miner Ramelius Resources has grabbed a near 18 per cent stake in the company amid a flurry of M&A in the WA 
gold sector. The Diggers organisers showed a sense of theatre when Spartan boss Lawson and Ramelius boss 
Mark Zeptner spoke back-to-back on Wednesday. Lawson has stirred the pot by suggesting that with a market 
capitalisation of $1.2 billion, Spartan might now be too much to bite off for $2.16 billion Ramelius.
Less than a year ago, he was hoping Ramelius, Westgold or Silver Lake would come knocking about a deal and 
bemoaning a timid approach to M&A in the gold sector.
"I stand by that," Lawson said this week. "There was a little confusion about why no one had moved on me earlier. 
Why did [Ramelius] wait until it cost them $185 million to get less than 20 per cent of my company? I'm still 
confused as to why cashed-up gold producers, who are actually running at a pretty good premium and with 
premium gold prices, are not more active in that M&A space."
Northern Star, valued at $16.3 billion, made many of its acquisitions at times when the gold price was in the 
doldrums.
Both Northern Star boss Stuart Tonkin and Evolution Mining executive chairman Jake Klein said this week that they 
were less inclined to make acquisitions at a high gold price.
Despite the impressive size and grade of Never Never, one hurdle for Lawson has been the stigma associated with 
Gascoyne. "One particular fund manager said he hated Gascoyne, it had torched $35 million of his fund and that it 
really left a bad taste in his mouth," Lawson says. "He said he wasn't interested in hearing our story, but he turned 
up, sat in a corner and pretended not to listen. Eight minutes later he wanted 5 per cent."Page 3 of 3
Gold saves the day as Diggers deals with the rout
Lawson is also backing his mate Stralow to deliver with Bellevue despite some grumblings about the capital raising 
at a big discount. "There's more money in the tank now [at Bellevue], and he's running the highest-grade gold mine 
in Australia. It's going to be very profitable," he adds.
Last year at Diggers, lithium was all the rage, with Albemarle about to up its bid for Liontown to $6.6 billion and Gina 
Rinehart and Chile's SQM working up to a joint $1.7 billion takeover offer for explorer Azure Minerals.
Andrew Forrest-backed Wyloo had just completed its $760 million acquisition of nickel miner Mincor. BHP was 
planning to build a 1000-bed village at Kalgoorlie to accommodate the workforce needed for a major overhaul and 
update of its nickel smelter.
A year later, the Wyloo mines are mothballed and BHP has written down the value of its nickel business by $5.4 
billion. Glencore and IGO Limited have the only nickel mines still standing in WA - and they are just hanging on.
IGO sold its 30 per cent stake in Tropicana, one of WA's biggest gold mines, to Regis Resources in 2021 as part of 
a big punt on battery minerals that involved acquiring stakes in the Greenbushes lithium mine and a still mis-firing 
lithium hydroxide refinery.
The same green metals strategy led to the disastrous acquisition of nickel miner Western Areas.
Those deals were done before Ivan Vella arrived as chief executive. He remains optimistic on lithium but isn't so 
sure about a nickel revival in the face of growing supply from Chinese-backed producers in Indonesia.
"What we do know is a lot of WA nickel mines are actually quite old. As you get further into the mine life, it does get 
harder and more costly," he says.
Glenn Wilson, the mayor of Kalgoorlie, says the town is feeling the impact of the nickel collapse and BHP workers 
leaving.
"We're starting to see houses hit the market. We're starting to see some of the effect of people moving on to 
different roles with BHP [BHP has offered workers redundancies or jobs in its iron ore and copper mines elsewhere 
in Australia]," he says.
But Wilson, who is chairman of the Australian Mining Cities Alliance that includes places like Broken Hill, Mount Isa 
and Karratha, says the strong gold sector was a saving grace for Kalgoorlie.
"There is a silver lining to nickel ... the gold sector now can have a workforce ready to go in some instances," he 
said.

  The Australian share market has edged higher in morning trade, with goldminers doing particularly well as the 
precious metal hit an all-time high amid fears of war between Iran and Israel.
   At noon AEST on Tuesday, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was up 7.2 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 7,820.2, 
while the broader All Ordinaries had gained 6.6 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 8,035.1.
   Overnight the US ordered a guided missile submarine to the Middle East and accelerated the USS Abraham 
Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group's deployment to the region to deter a possible retaliatory strike by Iran against 
Israel.
   Gold had hit an all-time high of $US2,472 an ounce, while Brent crude was trading at a three-week high of 
$US81.80 a barrel on the geopolitical risk.
   Closer to home, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported wages rose an average of 0.8 per cent in the June 
quarter, taking the annual rate of increase to 4.1 per cent.
   Sean Langcake, head of macroeconomic forecasting for Oxford Economics Australia, said the Reserve Bank 
would be somewhat relieved to see wage pressures subsiding, but the figures were still a bit too strong to return 
inflation to target quickly.
   Also on Tuesday morning, the monthly Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey of 1,200 Australian adults found 
consumer sentiment rose this month, especially around family finances.
   Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan said consumers were relieved the Reserve Bank hadn't cut rates and 
were seeing relief from tax cuts and other fiscal measures, but sentiment remained weak by historical standards.
   At midday, six of the ASX's 11 sectors were higher and five were lower.
   Health care was the biggest mover, dropping 3.5 per cent on a big fall by its largest component, CSL.
   CSL shares at midday were on track for their worst performance since a 6.3 per cent drop on October 12, down 
5.5 per cent to a six-week low of $292.04 after the blood products giant announced its 2023/24 operating 
expenditures had been higher than expected.

   CSL overall reported a full-year net profit of $US2.6 billion ($A3.95 billion), up 20 per cent from a year ago, with 
revenue rising 11 per cent to $US14.8 billion ($A22.5 billion).
   Chief executive Dr Paul McKenzie called it a strong result, but traders had a different opinion.
   Seek was down 9.2 per cent to a one-month low of $20.10 after the job-search board reported its full-year profit 
had dropped 26 per cent to $179 million as help-wanted ad volumes fell across the APAC region.
   "This is a weaker than expected result and guidance will disappoint," said E&P Capital analyst Entcho Raykovski.
   On the flip side, Temple & Webster had soared 26.5 per cent to a four-month high of $12.015 after the furniture e-
retailer announced its full-year revenue was up 26 per cent to $498 million.
   "Despite significant cost-of-living pressures, Temple & Webster has once again bucked the trend with another 
great set of results for FY24," chief executive Mark Coulter said.
   In other earnings results, Netwealth had slid down 6.3 per cent after the financial services company grew net 
profit by 24.1 per cent to $83.4 billion, while Challenger rose 6.2 per cent to $7.305 after announcing its net profit 
had dropped 24 per cent to $130 million.
   All of the Big Four banks were higher, with ANZ rising 1.8 per cent, Westpac climbing 0.8 per cent, CBA up 0.9 
per cent and NAB growing 0.6 per cent.
   In the heavyweight mining sector, BHP was up 0.7 per cent, Rio Tinto had grown 1.4 per cent and Fortescue was 
up 0.4 per cent.
   Goldminers were doing well amid the surge in gold prices, with Newmont up 2.1 per cent, Northern Star rising 2.8 
per cent and mid-tier miner Ramelius Resources climbing 6.0 per cent.
   The Australian dollar was buying 65.90 US cents, from 65.84 US cents at Monday's ASX close.

  The Australian share market has edged higher in its third straight day of gains, with losses by CSL and Seek 
outweighed by gains from the big banks and retailers.
   Goldminers did particularly well after the precious metal hit a record high amid growing fears of war between Iran 
and Israel, while lithium companies lost ground.
   The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index finished Tuesday up 13.1 points, or 0.17 per cent, to 7,826.8, while the 
broader All Ordinaries gained 13.7 points, or 0.17 per cent, to 8,042.2.
   Overnight gold jumped $US35 to a record $US2,472 an ounce, while Brent crude traded at a three-week high of 
$US81.80 a barrel on the geopolitical risk of a Middle East war.
   Closer to home, there were some positive signs for the Australian economy.
   The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that average wages rose by a smaller-than-expected 0.8 per cent in 
the June quarter, in a sign that analysts said showed wage pressures were subsiding.
   Also on Tuesday, the monthly Westpac-Melbourne Institute survey of 1,200 Australian adults found consumer 
sentiment rose in August, especially around family finances, while NAB's monthly survey of 400 Australian 
businesses found business conditions rose in July for the first time in five months.
   "The survey continues to show that supply and demand in the economy are moving back into balance and that 
inflationary pressures continue to ease," NAB chief economist Alan Oster wrote.
   Seven of the ASX's 11 sectors finished higher on Tuesday and four closed lower.
   Health care was the biggest mover, dropping 2.9 per cent after CSL suffered its worst daily fall in 10 months.
   CSL shares fell 4.6 per cent to a six-week low of $294.78 after the blood products giant announced its 2023/24 
operating expenditures had been higher than expected.
   While CSL's full-year net profit rose 20 per cent to $US2.6 billion ($A3.95 billion) and chief executive Paul 
McKenzie called it a strong result, traders had a different opinion.
   Seek dropped 6.6 per cent to a one-week low of $20.66 after the job-search board reported its full-year profit had 
fallen 26 per cent to $179 million as help-wanted ad volumes fell across the APAC region.

   "This is a weaker than expected result and guidance will disappoint," E&P Capital analyst Entcho Raykovski said.

   "Despite significant cost-of-living pressures, Temple & Webster has once again bucked the trend with another 
great set of results for FY24," chief executive Mark Coulter said.
   All of the big four banks were higher, with ANZ rising 1.6 per cent to $28.68, Westpac climbing 1.1 per cent to 
$28.52, CBA adding 1.5 per cent to $132.52 and NAB increasing 0.6 per cent to $36.20.
   Netwealth and Challenger went in opposite directions after announcing earnings results, with the former sliding 
5.6 per cent to a two-month low of $20.70 and the latter rising 6.5 per cent to a 17-month high of $7.33.
   In the heavyweight mining sector, goldminers did well amid the surge in gold prices, with Newmont rising 1.5 per 
cent, Northern Star climbing 1.7 per cent and mid-tier miner Ramelius Resources finishing 5.8 per cent higher.
   Lithium miner Pilbara fell 4.4 per cent and Liontown slid 5.8 per cent.

Javelin Minerals Limited (ASX: JAV) ('Javelin') is pleased to announce that numerous compelling drill targets have 
been identified at its Coogee Gold Project in WA's Eastern Goldfields.
Javelin engaged Core Geophysics ('Core Geo') to compile all historical open file geophysical activity (includes 
gravity, magnetics, EM, IP and DHEM surveys) related directly to the Coogee Gold Project.
The new targets were identified as part of an extensive review of the geophysical data commissioned by Javelin's 
new Board and undertaken by independent geological consultants and the Javelin technical management team. 
Following these initial findings, the Company will prioritise the key exploration targets for drilling based on the 
magnetic/gravity geophysics and the known identification of historic geochemical and drilling data, and generate 
new targets. The Company has engaged OmniGeoX Pty Ltd, led by Peter Langworthy, as independent technical 
consultant to review all the existing project drilling and geophysical data and plan an exploration drilling program to 
commence shortly on the priority targets
Javelin Executive Chairman Brett Mitchell said: 'We know Coogee hosts a gold system in a world-class address on 
the edge of the famous St Ives goldfield. But despite these outstanding credentials, there has been little or no 
drilling on so much of the tenure. These geophysical results highlight the huge upside at Coogee, with numerous 
compelling targets identified below and around the Coogee deposit. With the new Board and Management team in 
place and the recent fund raising completed, we are on track to start drilling these targets in the next quarter. 'At the 
same time, we are completing an independent review and update of the existing Coogee resource, which will give 
us a solid foundation as we seek to build a substantial gold inventory within one of the world's great gold mining 
provinces
Introduction
Page 2 of 4
-Javelin Minerals Limited - Compelling gold-copper drill targets identified at Coogee Gold Project
The region is considered prospective for gold mineralisation and contains a number of historical mines and mineral 
occurrences. The project is situated in a highly fertile greenstone belt with numerous gold deposits and abundant 
gold occurrences nearby. The Coogee, Salt Creek, Daisy-Milano and Lucky Bay gold deposits, plus the major St 
Ives gold camp are specifically relevant to exploration of the project. The project tenements have undergone 
varying levels of exploration with the discovery of gold in the 1800's at Hogans Find. Modern exploration 
commenced in the 1900's by BHP who discovered the Carnilya Hill Nickel deposit. The Coogee gold deposit 
located within the project tenements was discovered in the mid-1990's by Sovereign Resources and was 
subsequently mined by Ramelius Resources (ASX : RMS) in 2013. Ramelius mined an open cut pit 
(approximately 70m deep) at Coogee in 2013, with reported production of 147,400 tonnes at 4.7 g/t Au for a 
recovered 20,400 ounces of gold. Processing was at the Burbanks Mill (conventional carbon-in-leach processing 
facility), south of Coolgardie with metallurgical recovery of 96.4%
Geology and Prospectivity
The project is located in the southern part of the Norseman - Wiluna Greenstone Belt within the Parker Domain of 
the Kalgoorlie Terrane (Griffin and Hickman, 1988a). The project is situated in a highly fertile greenstone belt with 
numerous gold deposits and abundant gold occurrences nearby. The Coogee, Salt Creek, Daisy-Milano and Lucky 
Bay gold deposits, plus the major St Ives gold camp are specifically relevant to exploration of the project. The 
Coogee Deposit is hosted within a package of intermediate to felsic volcanics and volcaniclastics, comprising 
dacite, andesite and rhyolite lithologies. The primary mineralised zone comprises a moderately southwest dipping 
shear zone at the contact between the dacitic crystal tuff unit and a locally porphyritic andesite flow. Gold is directly 
associated with pyrite, which is frequently intergrown with magnetite and high gold values coincide with increased 
percentages of pyrite and magnetite. Magnetite rich zones have also been intersected, but without pyrite, they do 
not host gold mineralisation.
COOGEE WEST E26/177 GEOPHYSICS RESULTS AND TARGETS
Located immediately west of M26/477 the southern half of this tenement covers Lake Lefroy with the northern half 
containing widows of weathered outcrop and Cenozoic cover. Historically the Exploration Licence has been 
sporadically explored with wide spaced reconnaissance aircore drilling across the salt lake completed by Ramelius 
with and RC and diamond drilling completed in the north by Terrain Minerals. The tenement is covered by 50m line 
spaced aeromagnetic data and variable gravity on 100m to 400m spaced lines with 100m stations. The magnetic 
imagery highlights variably magnetic northwest trending mafic and ultramafic units which are intruded by granitic 
intrusions and surrounded by sediments and intermediate to felsic tuffs. Filtered gravity provides complimentary 
information to the magnetics, displaying local gravity highs over ultramafic and mafic units and gravity lows over 
sediments and granitic intrusions. CG-04 Target Zone discrete untested circular magnetic anomaly of approximately 
700nT approx. 1.5km west of the Coogee Pit. This represents a higher priority drill target based on the stronger 
magnetic response compared to the CG-01 (400nT) target zone which is known to hosts gold-copper mineralisation 
north of the Coogee Pit. The top of the anomaly starts from 300 vertical metres extending down to 1km in depth - no 
drilling has tested this anomaly and represents a high-order drill Au-Cu target.

With gold trading at record highs, investors and dealmakers in and around ASX gold stocks are making hay. One 
company, however, has remained uncharacteristically quiet.
Newmont, the world's top gold producer caught headlines last year for its $26.3 billion merger with Australia's 
biggest gold miner Newcrest, forming a $US59.5 billion dual-listed gold stock and pumping its long list of advisers 
up the M&A league table.
At the time, much was also made of its intention to divest six non-core assets once the acquisition wrapped up in 
November including WA's ageing Telfer gold mine and Havieron, which Newmont operates under a joint venture 
agreement with Greatland Gold (70 per cent/30 per cent). This was aimed at generating $US2 billion-plus ($3.05 
billion) in cash.
While the sale of its Akyem gold mine in Ghana has reportedly drawn Chinese interest, investors haven't heard a 
peep about the local assets. Street Talk understands sell-side adviser Macquarie started preliminary preparation for 
a sale process earlier in the year, but iced the mooted deal after processing operations at Telfer were suspended. 
However, it is understood MacCap's resources bankers are back on the tools, and soft soundings are under way.
Telfer is a larger scale, producing asset, but it's best days are behind it. The mine hasn't made a lot of cash over the 
last several years and would require a substantial commitment to rehabilitate it. However, its interaction with 
Havieron is interesting; one has the infrastructure, the other has the orebody. As such, they'll likely be sold together 
with estimates around the $500 million mark.
Given its interest in Havieron, Greatland Gold is the obvious buyer. The London-listed firm also has pre-emptive 
rights, acquired when Newcrest and Greatland began the joint venture in 2020. Street Talk understands the Andrew 
Forrest-backed company has been meeting with fund managers for months, making no secret of the fact they're 
keen to consolidate its stake - and would use the associated raise to peg their Australian float. Investor sources told 
Street Talk the last time they heard from Greatland was May when they were told the company was still waiting on 
sale terms from Newmont. Bank of America has been mandated on Greatland's potential ASX-listing.

Northern Star Resources and Evolution have both indicated a lack of interest in Telfer and Havieron, The 
Australian Financial Review wrote in November. A mid-tier name like Genesis Minerals, Ramelius Resources, 
Capricorn Metals or Gold Road would be more likely candidates given the desire to increase market capitalisation 
and attract investors.
Red 5/Silver Lake is also a contender on the back of it M&A ambitions and sizeable cash balance sheet.

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Ramelius Resources Full Year Financial Teleconference. All 
participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. 
[Operator Instructions].
I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Mark Zeptner, Managing Director. Please go ahead.
Mark Zeptner
Thank you, Sigar. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to dial in this morning to our FY '24 
results call. Alongside me is Chief Financial Officer, Darren Millman, who will drill down into the financials after I've 
covered off on the highlights. This morning, we have uploaded to the ASX platform, along with our website a 
Page 2 of 5
Ramelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript
number of documents, including our FY '24 financial results summary and the presentation, which we'll be largely 
speaking to you this morning, and also our audited statutory financial report.
As mentioned initially discussed the high-level FY '24 results, then Darren will dive into a bit more detail, and then 
we'll talk about the FY '25 outlook and also the dividend that we announced this morning. Once we have done that, 
there will also be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions. So, in terms of the presentation, if we only hopefully 
got that handy, we jump to Slide 3, with our mining and production highlights.
Although we mined less ore tonnes in FY '24 compared to the previous year, the contained gold mined, which is 
what counts, was up on the prior year due to a higher mine grade. The primary driver of the lower tonnes was the 
completion of mining activities across the Edna May hub, most notably at Tampia, where mining activities were 
completed last year.
Increased ore from Eridanus and the introduction of Symes offset the stocking tonnes in part. The improved mine 
grade was driven by 2 factors: increased tonnages and grade from Penny, which reported a mine grade just over 12 
grams per tonne for the year, and also a strong performance from Eridanus, which saw open pit tonnages at Mt 
Magnet increased 50%, but at a 60% higher grade than the prior year. If we move on to our processing activities, 
tonnes milled were up on the prior year, mainly as a result of additional haulage capacity across the Edna May hub.
Pleasingly, this increase in tonnes milled for the group was achieved despite the interruptions to the CV01 conveyor 
repairs carried out in November, December last year at Mt Magnet. This increased throughput, combined with 
improved milled grade resulted in a 22% increase in gold production to the record number of 293,000 ounces, 
which was at the upper end of our upgraded production guidance for FY '24.
On cost sales and sustaining costs as reported in the June quarterly was $15.83 an ounce, which is one of the best 
within our industry and something we're pretty proud of here at Ramelius. It is also most pleasing that we're able to 
deliver these results with a declining TRIFR or total recordable injury frequency rate across the year and also 
achieved a 12-month LTI-free milestone in May 2024.
Before I hand over to Darren, I'd just like to note this is the second year in a row where I've been able to comment 
that the annual results on just about every metric are an improvement on the prior year. And importantly, these 
results have not only been driven by the A dollar gold price, but also our low-cost base, which I believe distinguish 
us from our peers, and we do anticipate that the positive results will continue into FY '25. Over to you, Darren.
Darren Millman
Thanks, Mark. For those following on the presentation, I'll initially speaking to Slide 4. Before moving on to the 
discussion of earnings, I'd like to highlight that I will be talking to our underlying earnings. When we refer to 
underlying earnings, we are essentially backing out the large nonrecurring items in an attempt to communicate what 
we believe is the most reflective results from our operations for the year and appropriate comparative to the prior 
year. The main difference between our underlying earnings and our statutory net profit after tax earnings for the 
current year relates to acquired tax losses.

In our underlying earnings, we removed the tax benefit of $23.9 million associated with the recognition of tax losses 
that was acquired as part of the Musgrave and Brake acquisitions made in FY '23 and early FY '24, respectively. Of 
this, $14.6 million remains on our balance sheet for utilization on future periods. Indeed, since FY '19, Ramelius 
has acquired tax losses over the years to the tune of $24.5 million. This is a true realized savings in cash tax 
payment savings.
Lastly, before moving on to the financials, we have for reference, provided a few appendices in this presentation, 
which reconciles the underlying earnings and cash flow for the statutory reports for the financial statements.Page 3 of 5
Ramelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript
I trust you'll find this useful. As a reminder for FY '24, the company achieved record production, record earnings, 
record cash flow and a record dividend with the backdrop, happy to discuss the numbers in a little bit more detail. 
We achieved a top line revenue of $882.6 million, which was 40% up from the prior year with gold sales of 293,966 
ounces at a realized price of 2,995 per ounce, a 16% increase on the prior year.
The increased revenue was not only due to higher gold price, which added $119 million, but also increased gold 
production, which added $131 million when compared to FY '23. EBITDA of $462.2 million was up 67% on the prior 
year and represents a margin of 52%, a $1,573 per ounce sold.
On both metrics, we continue to be at the top of our peer group. Net profit after tax of $200.3 million was up 166% 
on prior year, with earnings being driven by improved grades, with lower cost of production per ounce and a strong 
currency of AU gold price. Statutory earnings per share of $19.5 were up 181% on the prior year. Further analysis 
on EBITDA can be found on Slide 6, which shows the positive trend from H1 to H2 with the EBITDA margin 
increasing 40% in H1 to 60% in H2.
In addition to this, the earnings profile for Mt Magnet and Edna May can be seen with Mt Magnet being the clear 
driver in earnings recording EBITDA margin of 79% in H2.
Looking at Mt Magnet in isolation on Slide 7 shows EBITDA margin for FY '24 of 2,121 per ounce. This earning 
capacity of Mt Magnet bodes well for the future with the production center poised of further growth in FY '25.
This will be driven by increased production from Penny, the introduction of Q and the exciting upside potential from 
Eridanus to be open pit or underground. Indeed, we see FY '25 as another very strong year of cash build and 
earnings. It's worth highlighting in FY '25, we are guiding to a 50% increase in production at the Mt Magnet hub.
Moving to cash. We believe it is important -- one of the most important financial measures of our business, and 
Slide 8 and 9, you will see our key cash metrics. Our operating cash flow for the year was $445 million or 1,515 per 
ounce. Investing cash flow totaled $242.7 million, which includes investments into our existing business for plant 
equipment, mine development and exploration of $123.1 million, our acquisition of Musgrave and our strategic 
investment in Spartan.
The free cash flow being the net of operating and investing cash flow was $212.1 million after returning $17.3 
million to shareholders via our FY '23 dividend and lease payments, total cash inflow for the year was $173.3 
million.

Our low-cost production, coupled with our strong Australian gold price resulted in Ramelius returning $315.8 million 
in underlying free cash flow for FY '24. Once again, one of the best returns amongst our peers. The resulting cash 
and gold at the end of the year was $446.6 million. Turning now to Slide 10 and our cash balance sheet, which we 
consider to be one of our key strengths. Our cash and gold bullion on hand are complemented with a further 65,000 
ounces of gold contained in current stockpiles and within circuit, which we will monetize in the coming 12 months, 
leaving Ramelius with excellent liquidity.
In addition to this, in July, we executed a new finance facility for $175 million, which is an upsized replacement of 
our previous $100 million facility. Facility was undrawn at the reporting date remains as of the same to this day. As 
we mentioned in the past, we're in the process of progressively reducing our hedge book, which at 30 June 2024, 
sat at 155,000 ounces at an average price of $3,081 per ounce. The only new hedging put in place recently was 
that we put hedges of 41,500 ounces at Edna May production out to January 2025, ensuring that the cost will not be 
sold below 3,400 per ounce, locking in meaningful cash flow from the remaining Edna May stockpiles. With that, I'll 
hand it back to Mark.

Thanks, Darren. So, if we can jump to Slide 11 to 13 now touching on our portfolio and guidance for FY '25. On gold 
production, you will see we expect a higher margin that Magnet operation to make up a higher proportion of gold 
production with Edna May to be placed in care and maintenance once the existing stockpiles across that hub are 
processed. Overall, group production for FY '25 is expected to be comparable to FY '24. Our all-in sustaining cost is 
also expected to be largely in line with FY '24, but with a higher gold price, which we have assumed at $3,500 per 
ounce as per the chart on Slide 12, plus our existing hedge book, will see us deliver some 92,000 ounces at $29.45 
per ounce in FY '25.
We'll see a further increase in cash margins. Production and the result in lower all-in sustaining cost is expected to 
be weighted to H2 of FY '25. And finally, on our guidance for FY '25, I'd like to make 2 points, which we have made 
before. Whilst Edna May does have a higher all-in sustaining cost, there is approximately $500 an ounce of this -- 
that relates to noncash drawdowns of existing stockpiles. And secondly, we are expecting a notable reduction in our 
growth capital spend in FY '25, particularly in the second half.
With the development of leveraging off in the first half, leveraging off our existing Magnet plant, infrastructure, such 
as airstrips and camps, realizing true regional synergies there. We like to think we have a good reputation in the 
market for doing what we say and delivering on our promises. We see no reason for this not to continue into FY '25 
and also look forward to presenting a revised Mt Magnet mine plan in the new year once we have the optimal 
design for Eridanus open pit or underground. Turning to Slide 14. Perhaps the highlight, our declared dividend for 
FY '24.
We're proud of our track record on dividends. And today, we are not only declaring our sixth consecutive dividend 
about 150% increase in the prior year to $0.05 per share fully franked. This represents a payout ratio of 27% of free 
cash flow. In approving the final dividend, the Board gave consideration to the additional strategic investment in 
Spartan, internal growth opportunities at Eridanus, and potential mill expansions at Mt Magnet as well as potential 
capital commitment requirements for Rebecca Roe. The dividend represents a yield of 2.6% based on 30 June 
share price and a total shareholder return over the last 5 years of 21% per annum.
Our dividend reinvestment plan has now been in place for a couple of years now with last year's participation at 
22%. It is pleasing to see an increasing number of shareholders opting to take up the opportunity to use their 
dividends to purchase additional Ramelius shares. That opportunity will again be available with the price of shares 
to be calculated at a 2% discount to the 10-day VWAP from the date of election. Last year's dividend payment 
amounted to $22.3 million in cash and reinvestment this year. The return will be up to $57.2 million, which will be 
paid in October.
Last slide, moving on to Slide 15, where we're looking at our focus areas, I'll skip to the final 2 areas being 
exploration opportunities and near-term catalysts. We have budgeted to invest another $40 million to $50 million in 
exploration this year, with opportunities at Mt Magnet, Penny and Rebecca Roe areas shaping us having high 
potential to deliver additional resource ounces and further bolstering reserves. There are a number of near-term 
catalysts that we see, including the progression of drilling at Eridanus and Galaxy, which will culminate more likely 
in an upgraded Mt Magnet mine plan.
In addition to this, we look forward to providing updated mineral resource inventory for Roe, and ultimately, the 
publication of the associated PFS for the combined Rebecca Roe project. That concludes the presentation.
I'll now hand back to the operator, Sigar, you can open the line for questions, please.

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Paul Kaner from Ord Minnett.Page 5 of 5
Ramelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript
Paul Kaner
Couple here, if I may. So firstly, on tax, thanks for giving that income tax guidance for FY '25. But how should we 
think about cash tax paid for FY '24?
Darren Millman
Yes. Thanks, Paul. As I noted in the numbers there, we had that advantage in 2024, in 2025 -- or 2025 and beyond, 
we serve approximately $25 million available. In 2025, we're probably expecting around $15 million to have a 
similar tax cash benefit is our expectations for 2025.
Paul Kaner
Yes, that's great. And then maybe one for you, Mark. Just on capital returns. I think your payout was about 27% of 
free cash flow and your policy allows for up to 30%. I guess, any thoughts on changing this policy?
Or are you sort of happy capping at 30% and then, I guess, using the remainder of the free cash flow on sort of 
organic and inorganic opportunities?
Mark Zeptner
Yes. We obviously had a lengthy discussion at Board level. To summarize, we're happy with our policy. We didn't 
quite go all the way to 30%. But we like -- we have got a number of internal projects coming up.
And we felt that we struck a balance between returns to shareholders and providing cash for those projects.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand back to Mr. Zeptner for closing 
remarks.
Mark Zeptner
Thank you, Sigar. I can't remember the last time we only had one question, but we must have covered everything. 
So, to wrap up, just 3 points, a record year for earnings and cash generation in FY '24 for Ramelius, a similarly 
strong outlook for FY '25 and beyond. And a $0.05 fly-free dividend announced today being the sixth consecutive 
year of dividend payments, a 150% increase on the prior year with over $130 million potentially returned to 
shareholders. Thank you all for listening in today. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

Plenty of gold bugs are sitting on hefty 12-month gains across their Australian listed portfolios, but with US rates 
heading south shortly, plenty of brokers think the good times will roll on despite gold already changing hands near 
record prices.
Canaccord Genuity has crunched the numbers on how gold fares as interest rates ease and says that based on 
historical trends there's "more room to move".
On the rates front, Canaccord says bond markets are now pricing in a 100 per cent chance the US Fed cuts in 
September on weaker inflation and labour market numbers.
"While views are mixed on the magnitude of the cut, a pause/loosening of monetary policy will likely provide 
tailwinds for gold," Canaccord says. "The last three easing cycles (i.e. tech bubble, housing bubble/GFC and 
2019/pre-Covid easing) have resulted in gold rising an average of 40 per cent (up to 73 per cent in the GFC) in the 
12 months following the last rate cut." Gold is already trading around record highs, but Canaccord says there's 
further to go, and while equities have closed on the gap on the gains to date, there's a still a disconnect based on 
historical ratios.
"Valuations remain relatively undemanding," they say.
"While all-in sustaining costs have been trending up we continue to see margin expansion across our coverage and 
with a number of tailwinds for gold over the remainder of 2024 (rates, geopolitical risk, US debt levels, increased 
ETF flows), we see further room for equities to move." Shaw & Partners is also bullish on gold, amusingly pointing 
out that the precious metal is trading at "2000-year highs", and up 30 per cent over the past year.
"Shaw and Partners forecast gold to hit $US3000/oz in 2025 and 2026 and we expect outperformance in ASX-listed 
gold equities to continue," Shaw said. Shaw is keen on Genesis Minerals in the sector and has a price target on the 
stock of $2.75 against $2.18 currently.
Page 2 of 2
Trading at near-record highs, but gold still has 'further to go' - DATA ROOM
UBS has a target price of $2.25 on Genesis but that's assuming a long-term gold price of $US1950 per ounce and 
an Australian dollar exchange rate of US75c.
Canaccord favours Evolution Mining, Northern Star Resources, Resolute Mining and Ramelius Resources among 
the Australian gold miners. Evolution had improved balance sheet capacity and a "unique investment offering" given 
it also has copper exposure, with a dearth of quality copper names on the ASX.
Cashed up Northern Star also had plenty of room to move should attractive deals emerge, Canaccord said.
"Northern Star maintains exceptional leverage to rising gold prices, owing to the scale of its operations," the broker 
said.
"Its FY25 production profile is more than double the next biggest ASX gold producer ... "Northern Star retains 
$1.5bn in available undrawn debt facilities for total liquidity of over $2.7bn. In our view, this offers the company good 
optionality around deleveraging, special dividends and potential M&A."

Highlight: Javelin Minerals has increased the JORC resource estimate for its Coogee gold-copper project near 
Kambalda in Western Australia by a whopping 158 per cent.
Body
Javelin Minerals has increased the JORC resource estimate for its Coogee gold-copper project near Kambalda in 
Western Australia's Goldfields region by 158 per cent to 3.65 million tonnes at 1.08 grams per tonne gold and 1.01 
million tonnes at 0.41 per cent copper.
The company says the significant upgrade relates to a revised gold content of 126,685 ounces and was determined 
from an independent review of historic estimates, assumptions and drilling. Its total supergene and primary 
indicated resource is 963,242 tonnes at 1.31g/t gold for 40,562 ounces, while the complementary copper resource 
adds 4133 tonnes of the red metal.
Previous operator Ramelius Resources' 2022 estimate for Coogee put the resource at 1.43 million tonnes at an 
average grade of 1.07g/t gold for 49,034 ounces, of which 614,000 tonnes at 1.43g/t gold for 28,252 ounces lay 
within the total indicated category for supergene and primary ores.
A key consideration in the upgrade from the previous 2022 mineral resource estimate includes an increase in the 
depth of the overall resource envelope, taking it from 90m below surface - the original open-pit resource limit - to 
now include gold and copper mineralisation down to 225m. It is a significant depth increase of 135m.
'The scope for growth at Coogee is clearly immense. The mineralisation is open and we have numerous compelling 
targets.'
Javelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell
The new estimate also considers a jump in the assumed rate of recovery from the 96 per cent experienced during 
previous treatment of open-pit ores, to 96.4 per cent following metallurgical testwork by Javelin, which it says is 
consistent with processing figures from the previous owner's open-pit operation in 2013.
Javelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell said: "This is a strong result which provides a solid platform on 
which to build a very substantial gold inventory on the doorstep of the world-class St Ives Goldfield. The scope for 
growth at Coogee is clearly immense. The mineralisation is open and we have numerous compelling targets."
Page 2 of 2
Javelin rolls out 158 per cent increase in Coogee gold
The company says gold mineralisation at Coogee extends along strike for 1.2km at an average width of 350m, 
extends to more than 225m vertically and exhibits strong potential to extend along strike to the north-west and also 
down-dip.
News of the upgrade comes hard on the heels of Javelin's recent revelation that it had identified eight copper-gold 
exploration targets at its Coogee project after independent and collaborative reviews of reprocessed geophysical 
and other data. Of key significance in the present resource upgrade context is that initial interpretations of two of 
those targets point to a prevailing trend of north or north-westerly and down-dip extension gold mineralisation 
potential in the area immediately north of the old Coogee open pit.
The two recently-identified targets include a big untested magnetic anomaly just 300m north/north-east from the 
Coogee open pit, which management believes could host gold-copper mineralisation. It is the company's strongest 
anomaly in its Coogee mining lease and is its first-priority target.
The anomaly is modelled to lie at a depth of 175m below surface, directly below the main gold-copper 
mineralisation defined by previous reverse-circulation (RC) and diamond drilling. The compnay says the target has 
never been tested and could be a deep gold-copper mineralised zone.
Historic drilling within the Coogee mining lease area that also defined two magnetic mineralised copper-gold trends 
north and west of the Coogee deposit and currently remain open along strike and at depth, also support the 
modelling.
Javelin recently engaged independent geological consultancy OmniGeoX to compile, review and interpret all 
existing project drilling and geophysical data to help plan an exploration drilling program, with a view to making the 
earliest possible start on testing of priority targets.
The Coogee gold project tenements are on the north side of Lake Lefroy in WA's Eastern Goldfields, about 20km 
north-east of Kambalda, which is among the State's earliest nickel mining centres after the original deposit was 
discovered in 1954. The mine opened in 1967 and was operated by WMC Resources, which was taken over by 
BHP in 2005.
The project lies within a highly-fertile greenstone belt with multiple gold deposits and abundant gold occurrences 
nearby including Coogee, Salt Creek, Daisy-Milano and Lucky Bay, in addition to the major St Ives gold camp.
The Coogee gold deposit was discovered in the mid-1990s by Sovereign Resources and was mined by Ramelius 
in 2013 via an open pit about 70m deep, reporting 147,400 tonnes produced at 4.7g/t gold for 20,400 ounces. 
Ramelius treated its Coogee ore by conventional carbon-in-leach processing at the Burbanks Mill, south of 
Coolgardie, reporting 96.4 per cent metallurgical recovery.
Javelin believes there is the potential for a "big gold-copper system" that could lie at depth to the north-west.
That belief is further supported by company's third priority geophysical target that lies about 750m west of the 
Coogee open pit and is also associated with a magnetic trend that is open to the north-west. The anomaly has not 
been followed up, despite the encouragement of a single drillhole put in by Ramelius that jagged 23m going 0.38g/t 
gold.
Javelin is now planning its next phase of extensional drilling to the west of the new resource envelope in a bid to 
increase the mineral resource estimate.

The US dollar gold price is currently near all-time high nominal levels of $US2520 an ounce, rising about 22 per 
cent so far this calendar year, and heading for its best year since 2020. Gold has also had double-digit returns in 
most other major currencies, including the Australian dollar, where it has surged by an impressive 25 per cent.
These gains have been driven by investor optimism about upcoming US interest rate cuts and lingering geopolitical 
risks. In the past three interest rate easing -cycles in the US, the US dollar gold price has averaged an increase of 
40 per cent.
Despite the gold price being near all-time high levels, gold equities have underperformed. Since August 2020, when 
the Australian gold equities index was at its all-time high, gold equities have underperformed the gold price by about 
45 per cent. In our view, the potential for gold equities to catch up is a significant opportunity for investors, given the 
fundamentals for gold remain very strong.
To date, gold's performance has been due to significant buying from central banks and eastern investors who have 
mainly acquired physical gold. In contrast, western investors, who typically favour gold mining equities, have for the 
large part not participated in the gold run so far.
Recent figures indicate that the average investor currently holds less than 1 per cent of gold in their total portfolio, 
which is significantly less than the four-decade average of 2 per cent. This is even lower than the estimated 6 per 
cent in 1980 when the last inflation-led gold bull market occurred and the gold price reached its all-time high of 
about $US2850 per ounce on an inflation-adjusted basis. The potential entry of western investors and a higher gold 
price is likely to be a tailwind for the gold equities to rerate higher. The fight for relevance in investor portfolios has 
been challenging for the gold sector versus other more favoured sectors, such as technology. Persistent cost 
pressures have negatively impacted gold miners' ability to generate free cashflow and provide an attractive return to 
investors.
However, with gold prices now rising faster than inflation, cash margins are expanding. We estimate that the 
average cash margin for the Australian gold miners is at record levels of $1700 an ounce of gold produced. Recent 
company results indicate this is being translated into financial performance, with Australian gold miners such as 
Page 2 of 2
A golden opportunity as stocks trail the commodity's price
Northern Star and Ramelius generating strong free cashflow, allowing them to return capital to investors through 
increased dividends.
The relative valuation of gold miners versus the rest of the market is also attractive. Based on forward earnings 
multiples, Aus-tralian gold miners are trading at a 40 per cent discount to the rest of the market. In addition, the 
market consensus gold price for the next 12 months is about 10 per cent lower than the current gold price of $3780 
in Australian dollars. Should the gold price remain at these levels for an extended period, then the market will need 
to upgrade its forward earnings forecasts, making gold equities even cheaper. Gold miners' cashflow generation 
potential and attractive valuation compared to the rest of the market cannot be ignored by the market for too long.
The disconnect in equity performance is even more apparent in the gold developers and explorers. The 
outperformance of developers and explorers is typically later in the cycle when investors are looking for value 
further down the mine life cycle. At current discounted levels, it remains cheaper to acquire someone else's ounces 
than it is to discover new ounces. The potential for sector consolidation could further enhance the appeal of gold 
miners as an investment, particularly in an environment where the price of physical gold continues to rise, and more 
investors seek exposure.
The Victor Smorgon Group has been well placed in gold for some time now and has capitalised on the record run of 
the precious metal. Our Global Multi Strategy Fund and Resources Gold Fund can invest internationally, and prefer 
stocks that are attractively priced, operate in safe jurisdictions and are forecast to generate strong cashflow yields in 
the next year. Australian gold miners that we are attracted to include Ramelius and Red5. International gold miners 
that have consistently delivered include -Agnico Eagle and Alamos Gold. Cameron Judd is the portfolio manager for 
the gold strategy in the Global Multi-Strategy Fund at the Victor Smorgon Group.

  The Australian Securities Exchange's main benchmark has closed at its highest level amid hopes the Federal 
Reserve might opt for a double-sized interest rate cut in the US.
   The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index finished Monday up 21.7 points, or 0.27 per cent, to 8,121.6, nearly seven 
points better than the previous all-time high on August 1.
   The broader All Ordinaries rose 17.6 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 8,341.1.
   "Everything is giving bullish signals," Moomoo analyst Jessica Amir said.
    "Today and this week it?s probably going to be full steam risk on ahead."
   Tech, small caps and gold were pushing higher, the US dollar was falling and everything suggested the US 
Federal Reserve would cut interest rates by at least a quarter-point this week, Ms Amir said.
   Renewed hopes the Fed might opt for a super-sized half-point cut were adding "extra hot sauce to the bullish 
sentiment", she said.
   Capital.com analyst Kyle Rodda said markets believed the Fed would cut rates by a full percentage point this 
year.
   That meant even if the US central bank didn't cut rates by a half point this week, expectations of a "jumbo" cut 
would be deferred to the November or December meeting unless the Fed pushed back on that notion when it 
announced its decision early on Thursday, Australia time, Mr Rodda said.
   Six of the ASX's 11 sectors finished higher, with energy, materials, health care and utilities lower and industrials 
basically flat.
   Telecommunications was the biggest gainer, rising 1.1 per cent as Telstra added 1.3 per cent to a three-week 
high of $4.01.
   Goldminers shone as the yellow metal also set an all-time high, at $US2,589 an ounce. As a non-yield-bearing 
asset, gold tends to do well when interest rates are lower.
   Evolution Mining rose 4.2 per cent to a more than two-year high of $4.50, Newmont gained 1.2 per cent to an all-
time high of $79.64 and Northern Star added 1.5 per cent to a nearly four-year high of $15.83.

   The mid-tier goldminers mostly finished lower, however, with Ramelius Resources dropping 4.4 per cent, 
Westgold down 4.2 per cent and Red5 slipping 1.5 per cent.
   BHP edged 0.1 per cent lower at $39.55 while Rio Tinto dipped 0.6 per cent to $110.81 and Fortescue slipped 1.8 
per cent to $17.19.
   All of the big four banks were higher with Westpac climbing 2.2 per cent to $32.79, CBA adding 1.0 per cent to 
$142.99, NAB rising 1.3 per cent to $38.78 and ANZ growing 0.2 per cent at $31.20.
   In company news, Austral soared 20.5 per cent to a more than one-year high of $2.70 after its US business won a 
$US450 million ($A670 million) contract by General Dynamics Electric Boat for work on US Navy submarine 
components.
   Alcoa Corp's ASX CDIs gained 5.9 per cent to $48.89 after the aluminium giant agreed to sell its quarter-stake in 
certain Saudi Arabian mining and refinery assets to Ma'aden for US$1.1 billion.
   Immutep dropped 11.3 per cent to 35.5c despite the biotech reporting positive results from a clinical trial 
evaluating the use of its immunotherapy drug candidate to fight head and neck cancer.
   The Australian dollar was buying 67.22 US cents, from 67.16 US cents at Friday's ASX close.

Body
Constellation Resources Limited (the 'Company' or 'Constellation') is pleased to advise that the Company has 
successfully completed the acquisition of the Ularring Copper Gold Project ('Ularring' or the 'Project') in Western 
Australia from Breaker Resources NL ('Breaker'), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ramelius Resources Limited 
('Ramelius') (ASX: RMS).
Historical copper-gold ('Cu-Au') drill results and geology at Ularring indicates a highly prospective intrusion related 
CuAu system, a system style that can generate large scale deposits
HIGHLIGHTS Region is known to host several major deposits that are intrusion related, such as the Boddington 
CopperGold mine and Caravel Minerals Ltd's Caravel Copper Project (a porphyry hosted Cu-Mo-Ag-Au deposit). 
Separately, the region is host to the recently discovered Julimar Project owned by Chalice Mining Ltd. Well-
developed Cu-Au horizon identified at the Centre Forest Prospect ('Centre Forest'), interpreted to be hosted within a 
prospective regional shear corridor that follows the margins of an interpreted intrusion. Exciting opportunity to not 
only explore for higher grade Cu-Au zones at Centre Forest but also regionally along the targeted shear corridor 
(24km of strike), where minimal exploration has been undertaken to date

PROJECT BACKGROUND
Ularring, consisting of tenements E70/4686 and E70/4901 (cumulatively 187km2 ) is located 100km northeast of 
Perth. Ularring is situated within the Archaean Yilgarn Craton and borders the Southwest and Youanmi Terranes. 
Page 2 of 3
-Constellation Resources Limited - COMPLETION OF ULARRING COPPER GOLD PROJECT ACQUISITION
The Ularring tenements overlie broad acreage farms and capture the Shires of Goomalling, Cunderdin and 
Northam. A series of access agreements that allow exploration within private properties are in place. The region is 
known to host several major deposits that are intrusion related, such as the Boddington Copper-Gold mine (11Moz 
Au and 1Mt of copper produced, hosted in a sheared Intrusive related setting1 ) and Caravel Minerals' (ASX: CVV) 
Caravel Copper Project (a porphyry hosted Cu-Mo-Ag-Au deposit containing 3Mt Cu, 61Kt Mo, 895koz Au and 
46Moz Ag in Mineral Resource2 ). A separate style of deposit in the region is the recently discovered Julimar 
Project (a mafic hosted PGE-Ni deposit) owned by Chalice Mining Ltd (ASX: CHN).
CENTRE FOREST PROSPECT
Centre Forest is the most advanced and explored prospect within the Ularring Project. A welldeveloped Cu-Au 
horizon has been identified at Centre Forest which is interpreted to be hosted within a prospective regional shear 
corridor that follows the margins of an interpreted intrusion. A number of phases of drilling have been undertaken 
historically at Centre Forest by various exploration companies, however, there has been minimal programs in the 
last decade. Centre Forest represents an exciting opportunity to follow-up on previous drilling with the intention of 
identifying higher grade Cu-Au zones. The results from previous drilling programs at Centre Forest have confirmed 
a continuous, broad zone of Cu-Au mineralisation over a strike length of 1.1km and remains open when utilising a 
>0.1g/t Au cutoff. The Cu-Au mineralisation is interpreted to be best developed along a highly altered sheared 
margin of a granitoid intrusion and is hosted both in oxides (saprolite) from the surface and in the fresh rock located 
down dip. The associated mineral assemblage comprises quartz-garnet-biotite-cordierite-orthopyroxene with a 
sulphide suite comprising of pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite with trace levels of bismuthate. Other metal associations with 
the gold mineralisation include elevated levels of silver, bismuth, molybdenum and tungsten. The sheared contact is 
believed to be part of the regional Meenar Shear Corridor.

Perth brokerage Argonaut has gone bullish on gold, tipping even more joy for Australian miners riding the wave of 
surging prices for the safe-haven commodity and lifting recommendations on a host of ASX stocks.
In a note to clients this week from respected mining analysts Hayden Bairstow and Patrick Streater, the WA 
stockbroker and corporate advisory firm put a rocket under key gold names, with an 11 per cent lift in its FY25 gold 
target from $US2388/oz to $US2644/oz, close to current spot levels.
Argonauts's FY26 target has risen 26 per cent to $US2925/oz, with FY27 up 35 per cent to the magical 
$US3000/oz mark, FY28 up 26 per cent to $US2700/oz.
It comes after Goldman Sachs lifted its long-run gold forecasts to $US1950/oz this week, a prediction that placed a 
number of mid-tiers in discount territory.
"Gold prices have continued to surge, with spot prices now up close to 30 per cent since the start of 2024," 
Argonaut's Bairstow and Streater said.
"Uncertainty over the pace of forecast interest rate cuts, ongoing inflation and rising US government debt are all 
likely to continue to drive a favourable pricing environment for gold." Unsurprisingly, the price increases have led to 
material upgrades to Argonaut's group of gold stocks under coverage.
The most extreme is small producer Catalyst Metals, up 47 per cent to $4.40 a share, with Northern Star and 
Genesis Minerals price targets 8 per cent higher at $19.50 and $4, respectively.
Ramelius Resources (+13 per cent to $2.60), Westgold Resources (+15 per cent to $4.50), Capricorn Metals 
(+17 per cent to $9), Vault Minerals (+18 per cent to 53c), Gold Road Resources (+20 per cent to $2.10), Bellevue 
Gold (+23 per cent to $1.60), Regis Resources (+23 per cent to $2.70) and Ora Banda (+19 per cent to 75c) have 
also been lifted substantially.
Market leader Northern Star's earnings are up 35 per cent for FY25, 88 per cent for FY26 and 146-254 per cent for 
FY27-30. A giant new mill is currently being built at Kalgoorlie's revamped Super Pit.
Page 2 of 2
As gold bounces higher, upgrades abound among stocks
"The upgrades for the mid-cap producers are mixed. Lower cost producers Capricorn and Ramelius see modest 
upgrades of 13 per cent and 15 per cent for FY25, while Bellevue's earnings forecast rises 19 per cent," Bairstow 
and Streater say.
"Higher-cost producers and companies that have recently completed acquisitions that carry higher depreciation 
underpin higher upgrades." African producers Perseus Mining and West African Resources have seen 20 per cent 
and 13 per cent jumps in their price targets, with a number of explorers in Western Australia also seeing their price 
targets lifted. Earnings upgrades for FY25 and FY26 are 26 per cent and 35 per cent respectively for the cohort, 
with FY26-27 upgrades of 69-78 per cent for Perseus and 61-63 per cent for West African Resources.
There are some recommendation upgrades here as well. Ramelius, Bellevue and Ora Banda have all been moved 
from hold to buy, taking the bulk of the Australian gold sector into buy territory.
Spartan Resources, which has risen 225 per cent over the past year as the remarkably high grades of its Never 
Never and Peppers discoveries near Mt Magnet were revealed, has been moved from a hold to a spec buy with a 
$1.55 price target.
Bairstow and Streater say their preference is for stocks with "strong organic growth potential", led by Genesis 
Minerals, Westgold and Capricon, with Genesis and Capricorn's five-year CAGR of 20 per cent doubling the rest of 
their coverage universe.
They say there remains strong value across the sector, with De Grey Mining, and African development plays WIA 
Gold and Tolu Minerals also key picks.
"Our bullish outlook for the yellow metal and material upgrades to our earnings outlook underpins our shift to a 
positive view across all stocks in the sector," Bairstow and Streater say.
The bullish new gold sector upgrade from Argonaut comes after Streater initiated coverage on Turaco Gold on the 
back of a site visit at the Afema project in Cote d'Ivoire. Since acquiring the site in November last year, drilling has 
underpinned a maiden resource of 2.52 million ounces at 1.2 grams per tonne. Argonaut has placed a spec buy 
rating and 49c valuation on the $240m junior, which plans to complete a pre-feasibility study by the first half of 2026 
at Afema.
Formerly in the portfolio of African gold giant Endeavour Mining, Turaco purchased its majority 51 per cent stake 
last year, with the right to move to 70 per cent once the PFS is complete for the payment of $US8.75m in cash and 
$46.5m to JV partner Sodim.
Streater says Argonaut estimates $425m of pre-production capex and working capital requirements will be needed, 
with Turaco likely to move to a 100 per cent ownership level, converting Sodim's minority interest to a 2 per cent 
NSR royalty.
The Cote d'Ivoire government would take a 10 per cent free-carried interest in the project with a five-year tax 
holiday, 0.9 per cent NSR royalty to state miner Sodemi and 6.5 per cent state royalty on gold sales over 
$US2000/oz. Stockhead

Highlight: Javelin Minerals has picked up the historic Eureka open pit north of Kalgoorlie where it is seeking to 
prove up its theory that more golden riches are lurking nearby.
Body
Javelin Minerals has picked up the historic Eureka open pit north of Kalgoorlie from Delta Lithium where it is 
seeking to prove up a theory that more golden riches may be lurking nearby. The move follows the spectacular 
success of Spectrum and Spartan Resources. Both found multi-million dollar gold deposits about 300m north of 
their mothballed open pits and Javelin already has some intriguing drill holes about 300m north of Eureka 
suggesting there is more gold out there.
Perth broker Shaw and Partners already has firm commitments for $3m at $.0025 a share (including a 1 for 2 option 
exercisable at $.004 within 2 years) to fund the deal. Under the terms of the sale Delta will pick up $1.5m in cash 
and a further $1.5m in Javelin shares at A$0.003 per share.
If Javelin manages to get Eureka back into production or increase the inferred resource to 200,000 ounces of gold 
Delta will pick up another $1m in Javelin shares. Notably, Eureka already comes gift-wrapped with a 112,000 ounce 
1.42 gram per tonne starter resource.
The initial shares issued to Delta Lithium will be subject to escrow for 12 months.
The old Eureka open pit sits about 50km north-west of Kalgoorlie in the prospective sequence of mafic and 
ultramafic rocks which forms part of the more than 290km-long
Kalgoorlie-Menzies leg of the 700km-long Norseman to Wiluna Greenstone belt.
Importantly it is only 20kms north-west of the Paddington gold mine that has been mined for years and is well 
known for doing toll treating deals.
Paddington has turned out more than four million ounces during its production history from the same prospective 
rock sequence as mapped at Eureka, which is also held to be a structural setting similar to the half-million ounce 
Zoroastrian gold deposit at Bardoc Gold, only 1.4km east of the Eureka deposit.
The Eureka mine site was mined for the most part in the early 1990's and was subject to small scale tribute mining 
again in 2018 by Kalgoorlie identity Graham McGarry who pulled a bit over 5000 ounces from the old pit at 3.16 g/t 
gold. However, Javelin says prior drilling was poorly targeted at the project and was not deep enough to follow the 
interpreted structures properly.
Page 2 of 3
Javelin rolls dice to replicate Spectrum, Spartan success at Eureka
Javelin has a theory that the old-timers were too focussed on the existing pit and given the ordinary gold prices at 
the time, were not motivated to spend too much money exploring the areas around it.
Spectrum Metals and Spartan Resources both spectacularly proved this was a mistake at their respective projects. 
Spectrum stumbled across the Penny North gold deposit just 300m north of its old mined out Penny West open pit 
in WA and subsequently sold the whole company to Ramelius Resources for $230m (which increased dramatically 
on settlement day as the deal involved Ramelius shares that ran hard between the announcement of the deal and 
the settlement of the deal). The maiden resource at Penny North was just over 300,000 ounces going a whopping 
16.8 g/t gold.
More recently Spartan employed the same near mine theory when it stubbed its toe on the 1.5m ounce Never 
Never discovery lurking just 300m north of its mothballed Gilbey's open pit in WA's Murchison.
Ominously, the Eureka project already has sniffs of gold 300m north of the old Eureka pit too - some of which are in 
ounce to the tonne dirt like a 4m intercept going 32.6 g/t gold from 104m. Another previous 1m hit came in at an 
impressive 14.72 g/t gold and notably, was from surface, demonstrating the potential range of mineralisation.
About 600m north of the old pit, Javelin has even more impressive numbers to follow up on like 4m at 135 g/t gold 
from 53m and 4m grading 11 g/t gold from 42m.
In fact, the entire area is littered with old drill numbers that are begging to see the drill bit again. For example, 
directly under the old pit a 23m hit going 3.32 g/t gold from 112m and another 5m hit further up from 33m going an 
impressive 25.6 g/t gold both need more attention.
There are even hints of mineralisation about 300m to the south of Eureka which include 13m at 2.22 g/t gold from 
51m and 6m at 13.88 g/t gold from 38m.
Whilst some of the drill intersections that require follow up may seem remarkable in grade, they are perhaps not all 
that remarkable when considering the project was first mined from 1897 up to 1940 for a total 809 tonnes averaging 
a crazy 27.8 g/t gold - no doubt Javelin will be counting on some of that dirt being left behind by the old-timers.
Notably, Eureka is not Javelin's first rodeo and is an extension of the same near mine exploration theory it is 
employing at its Coogee gold project at the north end of Lake Lefroy, just east of Kambalda and about 55 km south-
east of Kalgoorlie.
The Coogee gold deposit was discovered in the mid-1990s by Sovereign Resources next to Gold Fields' world-
class St Ives gold mining complex.
Javelin acquired 100 per cent of the Coogee project in 2020 from Ramelius Resources and Serena Minerals for 
equity and both companies are now major shareholders.
Ramelius mined the Coogee open pit for gold to 70m depth until 2013, producing 20,400 ounces at a respectable 
average head grade of 4.7g/t gold. Ramelius subsequently became a major shareholder in Javelin.
The Coogee mining lease has been a key focus for Javelin's since acquisition. The Coogee open pit and its 
immediate surrounds have not been subject to any systematic exploration drilling since Ramelius ended mining at 
the site.
When Javelin acquired the project, it contained an estimated 10,600 ounce gold resource at 3.4g/t gold which, after 
a 12-month drilling program, then jumped to 49,000 ounces at 1.07g/t gold in 2022.
In August, Javelin announced the Coogee gold project hosts a recently upgraded JORC 2012 compliant mineral 
resource amounting to 3.65 million tonnes at 1.08g/t gold for 126,685 ounces of gold and 1.01 million tonnes at 
0.41 per cent copper for 4133t tonnes of the red metal in a separate inferred "copper domain", north of the old pit.Page 3 of 3
Javelin rolls dice to replicate Spectrum, Spartan success at Eureka
Once again, modelling shows gold mineralisation extending north along strike for 1.2km at an average width of 
350m and to more than 225m vertically under the old Coogee open pit and still open to the north and down-dip.
Javelin upped its drilling metreage for the greater Coogee area from 2500m to 3000m for a planned reverse-
circulation and diamond drilling program set to be launched in mid-November.
The decision came after the company identified several opportunities to extend known mineralisation below the old 
open pit and in extensions towards Coogee North and beyond to a pronounced magnetic high feature.
The proposed drilling was prompted by results from Javelin's extensive reviews of reprocessed geophysical and 
other data which had lifted Coogee's resource estimate to the current inventory figure of 126,685 ounces of gold.
Javelin's recent full data review and new magnetics reinterpretations and modelling have identified eight new 
tantalising geophysical targets.
It will now direct its focus toward testing five of the nearest priority walk-up targets at the Coogee mine - and also 
north and west of the old mine - including a prominent and curious looking ovoid magnetic anomaly in the south-
east of its exploration licence, adjacent to the mining lease.
Review work has also identified a new 3km-long potential gold trend west of and parallel to the Coogee pit structure 
and Javelin believes there is the potential there for a "big gold-copper system" that could lie at depth to the north-
west.
Javelin says previous drillholes at Coogee North were also not deep enough to test the nearby screaming magnetic 
anomaly which could represent a potential repetition of the historic Coogee lode and the company has earmarked 
ten drillholes for 1650m to test it.
Significantly, once Javelin dials in the current Eureka gold mine resource and adds on its Coogee resource it will 
now have a total resource endowment of 238,700 ounces of gold in two of the best mining addresses in Australia.
It is probably fair to say that Javelin has been in something of a slumber for a couple of years however since falling 
under the control of Executive Chairman and well known West Perth corporate finance player Brett Mitchell back in 
February, it has forged a new way forward and eked out a solid "near mine exploration strategy."
Half of that strategy came from a strategic review of Coogee instigated by Mitchell that ended in some screaming 
near mine targets that look like they are begging to be drilled. Eureka now gives Javelin a quinella of projects that 
almost look exactly the same that will likely both benefit from exactly the same brownfields near mine exploration 
strategy.
And who knows, maybe Javelin will complete the trifecta of companies that have successfully employed this "old 
riches left behind" strategy if it can emulate the success of both Spartan and Spectrum.

A sell-off in gold stocks on Thursday following the US election result could see a raft of groups that were looking to 
raise cash before Christmas pare back the size and price of their deals.
Record high gold prices have prompted Australian-listed gold miners to capitalise on their booming share prices 
trading off the back of the strong sentiment surrounding the commodity.
But on Thursday, share prices of gold companies came under substantial pressure, with groups such as Northern 
Star, Spartan, Ramelius, Evolution Mining, Regis Resources and most others in the sector down by more than 5 
per cent.
Groups that have strong cash balance sheets may try to capitalise on the opportunity by acquiring peers at their 
cheaper prices now that stocks have weakened.
The obvious play is for Ramelius Resources to move on Spartan, which saw its shares fall by more than 15 per 
cent on Thursday, taking its market value to $1.7bn. Spartan's shares closed at $1.24, after they had hit a 2024 
high last month above $1.60.
Ramelius, which is in a $455m net cash position, pounced on Spartan in June, buying an 8.9 per cent stake at 92c 
a share, so perhaps the stock needs to fall further before it becomes interested in a deal.
Northern Star is also in a strong position for a buyout, with $358m of net cash. Its most logical target is De Grey 
Mining, whose shares also fell more than 5 per cent on Thursday.
Part of the reason behind a rally in the gold price in the past two months has been expectations of geopolitical 
instability and an uncertain outcome in the US election.
But the sweeping victory of Donald Trump in the race for the White House has caught out some gold traders, with 
the result creating more certainty about US policy.
Page 2 of 2
Golden chance for miners to buy out rivals amid commodity sell-off - DATA ROOM
Also sending the gold price lower on Thursday was a rally in the US dollar following the election outcome, with the 
US economy expected to be stronger under Mr Trump.
However, while gold may be volatile for about two months as the market assesses the impact of Mr Trump's 
leadership, if he introduces trading tariffs on other countries such as China, and the US dollar remains high, that 
would lead to global inflation.
And inflation usually supports a higher gold price.
The same would be said about more geopolitical tension, should it occur under Mr Trump.
Groups that were also looking to raise equity may now have second thoughts over doing so before Christmas, or 
may raise less funds and at a lower price. Another plus for gold miners wanting to do deals following the election of 
Mr Trump is that it may be easier to come across financing for transactions at better rates, sources say.

A move by Ramelius Resources on its smaller rival Spartan could rest on the release of its feasibility study into its 
Rebecca-Roe development, expected out in the near term.
Should the results prove that the project will not be all that viable, it may propel the group more towards taking the 
mergers and acquisition route for growth.
Ramelius purchased 8.9 per cent of Spartan Resources in June and it is also known to have been eyeing up other 
targets at a time it remains cashed up with the gold price hitting record highs this year.
Currently, the Ramelius market value is close to $2.4bn whereas Spartan's market value is almost $1.5bn.
Ramelius Resources chief executive Mark Zeptner earlier said that the Spartan Resources project was "in our 
backyard".
Ramelius is developing both the Rebecca-Roe project and Cue Gold Project, 35km south of Mt Magnet, after 
buying Apollo Consolidated in 2022 and Musgrave Minerals the following year.
It owns and operates two production and processing hubs at Mt Magnet and Edna May, in Western Australia.
Spartan owns the Dalgaranga Gold Project, 65km northwest of Mt Magnet in Murchison, where Ramelius owns a 
gold processing hub. Part of that is its Never Never high-grade gold deposit on which the company is pinning its 
hopes for growth.
Spartan was previously called Gascoyne Resources and collapsed after gold ore levels being processed through 
its mill were not profitable, and it was later recapitalised after its market value fell beneath $100m.
Ramelius purchased Spartan shares at 92c in June, and they are currently trading at about $1.33, while Ramelius 
shares are trading at $2.09.

Late last year, it was known around the market that Ramelius was in search of an opportunity, preferably in WA, 
where it could add 100,000 ounces of gold per annum and wanted to add a third production hub to put its $261m 
cash pile to work.
Mr Zeptner said in August he did not feel an obligation to get bigger but was more focused on good margins and 
cashflow.
The focus on Ramelius comes after the results of Newmont's recent sales campaign shows corporate activity 
booming in the gold mining space, with Newmont achieving over $US1bn more than the market had initially 
estimated for asset sales.
Newmont has been selling assets in North America, Australia and Africa following its $24bn acquisition of Newcrest 
in 2023. Most recently, it agreed to sell its Eleonore mine in Quebec, Canada for up to $US795m to Dhilmar, which 
analysts at Macquarie said was 62 per cent higher than its valuation.
Newmont expects its final two non-core remaining assets, Porcupine and Cripple Creek & Victor Mine Gold Mine in 
Colorado, to be sold in the first quarter of next year, and they are valued at about $US1.5bn.
It had targeted returns of $US2bn from assets sales and has realised $US3.6bn, excluding two others to go A share 
buyback is expected to be on the cards. It sold its Akyem mine in Ghana to Zijin Mining for $US1bn in October and 
has also sold the Telfer asset in WA in August for $714m to Greatland Gold.

EMR Capital, the 45 per cent shareholder of 29Metals, has opted out of participating in its latest $180m equity 
raising.
It would secure $47m of the funds through a placement and the rest through an entitlement offer. The copper miner 
remained in a trading halt on Tuesday as advisers at Macquarie Capital moved to find more funds for the group.
29Metals has struggled with flooding at its Capricorn Copper project in Queensland and disappointing production 
and said the funds were being used to pay down $US18m of debt and refinance, fund its Gossan Valley 
development to first ore and reduce water levels at Capricorn Copper.
AustralianSuper's share would move to 18 per cent and. BUMA would hold 19.9 per cent after taking up their rights 
to participate in the offer. 29Metals listed at $2 a share in 2021 and its market value is now $260m.
There had been speculation that the private equity firm EMR Capital had been keen to sell out of the company and 
had tested buyer interest.
DataRoom reported in October another raising was on the cards after it tapped the market last year through 
Macquarie and Jarden.
29Metals also owns the Golden Grove copper and gold mine in Western Australia. Analysts at Jarden had forecast 
a cash balance of $30m at December, assuming all loans are full drawn, and they said they remained of the view 
that additional funds were needed.
They pointed out that its cash balance had reduced to about $60m, from $85m at June, and its liquidity had fallen to 
about $104m, from about $130m, as net debt increased to $147m.
In August last year, the company raised $151m at 69c a share, an 8 per cent discount to the last closing share price 
of 75c.

Spartan Resources Meanwhile, Ramelius Resources is believed to be participating in the Spartan Resources 
equity raising, adding to speculation it remains keen for a buyout.
The move will take its interest in the company to 19.9 per cent, say sources. Spartan entered a trading halt on 
Tuesday as it taps the market for $220m by way of a placement at $1.32 per share through Canaccord.

Gold and copper are looking good. Victor Smorgon Group's equities team, which manages in excess of $500m in 
funds across its equities strategies for members of the Smorgon family and private investors out of South Yarra in 
Melbourne, has quickly made a name for itself as a stockpicker in the resources space.
Two of the seven limbs of its global multi-strategy portfolio involve a gold and decarbonisation strategy, managed 
respectively by Cameron Judd and Ben Salter.
VSG's two big commodity bets have been playing out over the past seven years in gold, and three in 
decarbonisation, which counts its primary exposure as copper miners.
Judd and Salter came into VSG from their transaction with the Stawell gold mine in Victoria, a private operation that 
exposed the gulf between the profitability of well-run gold mines and the valuations seen in equities.
Even with the massive rise in prices to $US2650/oz and recent pullback after Donald Trump's election win in the 
US, Judd remains bullish on the fundamental outlook for gold.
"I know we've had a decent run in price, but the fundamentals for gold are very strong and I think will continue to get 
stronger," Judd says.
While it can hold bullion, shorts and a limited number of pre-IPO opportunities, VSG is happy going long on gold 
equities and investing in miners over physical gold, given inflationary pressures had eased and gold miners are 
growing their margins.
Judd says the main things VSG looks for in its gold equity portfolio are liquidity, low jurisdictional risk and especially 
cashflow.
"In the near term we're happy with development stories but we want to be able to see growth in the near term not a 
long way out," he said. "One of those investments was Red 5, now Vault Minerals. We started off back in 2018, 
looked at all the developers at the time, and Red was the one we thought had the most meat on the bones.
Page 2 of 2
Bright prospects: Why gold and copper are set to shine in the next few years
"Developers are notoriously volatile but it had more fat in that it could absorb any hiccups along the way. That's still 
a fairly large position for us, it's definitely a lot smaller than it was, but the way it's performing now and what we 
think it's going to be in the next 12 months, we're still very happy with that as cash generation and that's where 
we've positioned the -portfolio." After a merger with Silver Lake Resources, Vault is now trading at 34c with a 
market cap of over $2bn.
Other names that fill a similar mould include Regis Resources and Ramelius Resources.
"A gold mine should be printing cash, especially at these margins, so that's where we're positioned at the moment," 
Judd says. "We like Regis for the moment - it printed $85m in free cash in the last quarter and it should do a similar 
or more amount in this next quarter.
"Then we've also got the North American exposure. Calibre Mining Corp is one of those that we like that will 
significantly increase their production of gold in the second quarter, they're saying, of next year, but we think a little 
bit earlier.
"The CEO Darren Hall is an Australian with significant experience and we think that it's an interesting project. It's 
going to keep growing but also generating good cash, fully funded with a strong balance sheet." Carbon capers The 
decarbonisation strategy has grown from 3 per cent of the overall portfolio weighting in the global multi-strategy 
fund to 18 per cent today.
Most of that is in copper, with VSG sidestepping the opaque and volatile lithium market that surged to record highs 
in 2022 before crashing to loss-making levels this year.
Substitution from aluminium and scrap could cap hopes from red metal optimists that copper could surge beyond 
the $US5/lb record prices seen earlier this year to $US6, $US8 or even $US10/lb. But portfolio manager Ben Salter 
remains cautiously upbeat that supply will struggle to keep pace with demand as the electrification trend continues.
"We're probably conservatively bullish I would say," Salter says. "I'd say the market will be balanced next year but 
tight, so not a lot of room for error. You can look at what happened in Panama (where the government suddenly 
closed First Quantum's Cobre Panama mine last year).
"It took 400,000 tonnes of copper out of the market and that had a positive impact on everyone.
"Over time, we think with the electrification of everything â€¦ probably the use of copper in grid spending especially 
helped by data centres (and) China electrification, we think copper will be in demand more than can be met by 
supply. Over the medium to long term there's a strong case for copper prices' escalation, but not immediately or not 
spectacularly." Salter said that should facilitate good margins for producers and developers with good projects, with 
current prices around $US9000/tonne.
In Australia, VSG likes MAC Copper, which owns the soon to be 50,000 tonnes per annum Cobar mine in NSW. 
Internationally, NGEx Minerals is on its radar. Part of the Lundin Group that recently dealt half of the Filo Del Sol 
and Josemaria projects in Argentina to BHP for over $US3bn, NGEx owns three large copper projects in 
Argentina's Andes. Stockhead

Body
Following Northern Star's $5bn buyout of De Grey Mining, speculation is mounting that it may move to sell its 
Carosue Dam Operations to Ramelius Resources.
Carosue Dam is 120km northeast of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia and produces 248,000 ounces of gold 
annually.
Market sources estimate a price tag of about $800m.
Sources believe it would be a valuable addition for Ramelius Resources and strategic for its Rebecca-Roe project, 
150km east of Kalgoorlie.
Ramelius released a pre-feasibility study for Rebecca-Roe on Thursday. RBC analysts at RBC said it came in 
below expectations with a net present value of $332m, with higher costs and a shorter than expected mine life.
It will produce about 130,000 ounces per annum.
But others in the market say that the findings are largely in line with what many had been anticipating.
RBC analysts say that while the project fell below its expectations, it still offers a path for Ramelius to develop a 
second production hub, following the Edna May closure in the 2025 financial year.
Sources believe that Northern Star would probably be willing to part with Carosue Dam if offered the right price for 
the asset.
Its merger with gold miner Saracen Mineral Holdings meant it gained full control of the Super Pit gold mine, which 
was its key objective, and it now has a very large mill in the Kalgoorlie district.
So does it really need the far smaller processing facilities of Carosue Dam? Northern Star's mill expansion is well 
advanced - 77 per cent of engineering and design is complete and 84 per cent of procurement contracts have been 
awarded.

Construction is on schedule.
Ramelius is developing both the Rebecca-Roe project and the Cue Gold Project, 35km north of Mt Magnet, after 
buying Apollo Consolidated in 2022 and Musgrave Minerals the following year.
It owns and operates two production and processing hubs at Mt Magnet and Edna May, in Western Australia.
Ramelius purchased a 8.9 per cent stake in Spartan Resources in June. It then increased its holding to 18.3 per 
cent. It is also known to have been eyeing up other targets at a time when it is cashed up, with the gold price 
surging to record highs this year.

Highlight: Javelin Minerals has completed a 2921m maiden reverse circulation drill program at its Coogee copper-
gold project near Kambalda, WA, with assay results pending.
Body
Javelin Minerals has completed phase one of a maiden drilling program for 2921m at its Coogee copper-gold 
project near Kambalda in Western Australia, discovering key gold indicators along a 950m-long strike trend.
The 18-hole reverse circulation (RC) program recovered 1698 samples sent for assay and identified a copper-gold 
mineralised trend extending from about 270m south of the southern open pit rim to about 450m north of the 
northern rim of the pit.
The program was designed to identify possible extensions to mineralisation below the current open pit floor- about 
70m depth - at the partly flooded Coogee open pit.
Additionally, the program sought to explore the possibility of mineralisation extending south of the original Coogee 
resource, last mined by Ramelius Resources in 2013, which pulled out a reported 147,000 tonnes of ore for 
20,400 ounces of gold.
Javelin's new drilling program represents the first systematic drilling campaign since Ramelius Resources wound 
up its operations in 2014.
'We are pleased with the rapid completion of the first phase of drilling over our Coogee project. We have identified 
key gold indicators along the 950m strike from drill hole CORC154 south of the pit to CORC166 about 450m north 
of the current pit.'
Javelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell
The previous exploration by Ramelius resulted in a shallow, JORC-compliant resource estimated at 126,685 
ounces of gold - with about 4133t of copper - which Javelin is confident additional drilling will add to.
Javelin intends to scout-out possible north and north-west continuity and extensions of the Coogee pit 
mineralisation inferred from a pronounced "bullseye" magnetic anomaly - referred to as "CG-01″ - about 300m north 
of the old Coogee open pit.
Page 2 of 2
Assays pending from Javelin Coogee copper-gold drilling in WA
The company believes the extensions could reveal the deeper down-dip potential of Coogee North. Notably, a 
second new magnetic target "CG-02" exists about 400m west of CG-01 and is interpreted to be an additional 
mineralisation diving under the Coogee North zone.
The program also served to follow-up anomalous gold mineralisation identified by previous air core (AC) and RC 
drilling at various pattern densities along the trend.
The planned drill depths for the phase one program varied between 70m and 275m.
Javelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell said: "We are pleased with the rapid completion of the first phase 
of drilling over our Coogee project. We have identified key gold indicators along the 950m strike from drill hole 
CORC154 south of the pit to CORC166 about 450m north of the current pit. Once we receive the assays, which we 
expect to start coming in over the coming weeks, we will plan phase two of the program. This means we will have 
ongoing drilling activity and news flow from both Coogee and Eureka during the first half of 2025".
The phase two drilling campaign is expected to start in late January/early February when results from the phase 
one RC program are in hand and will continue to increase the mineralised footprint between the Coogee open pit 
and Coogee North.
The latter contains an estimated 2.95 million tonnes with more than 96,000 ounces of gold and more than 4000t of 
copper.
It will also define additional gold extensions below the current pit, where modelling has identified about 360,000t at 
a grade of 1.29g/t gold for a further 15,000 ounces of gold.
Drilling will also probe the new targets of the north-west trend, exploring the magnetic signatures and the north-west 
trending shear that parallels the Coogee Shear hosting the original high-grade gold mined by Ramelius.
It's tempting to say Javelin is hunting in a target-rich environment, but it seems appropriate to the company's name 
and where it finds itself in this early phase of exploration.
Indications to date show the company is identifying gold-copper potential everywhere it looks along the explored 
trend and has a solid footing based on structure and magnetics.
No doubt it will be looking forward to rolling on with the phase one results and the up-coming phase two drilling 
kicking-off early in the New Year.

Leeuwin Metals Ltd (ASX:LM1) is boosting its project portfolio via the acquisition of the Marda Gold Project in the 
Western Australian Goldfields from Ramelius Resources Ltd (ASX:RMS). 
The Marda project spans over 500 square kilometres of mining, exploration and prospecting leases, prospective for 
both gold and iron ore, and is strategically located 120 kilometres north of Southern Cross.
The project includes multiple existing pits and numerous historical workings. It offers exceptional exploration upside, 
with high-grade drill intercepts and underexplored historical prospects providing a clear path to potential resources. 
It features multiple high-priority targets requiring immediate follow-up work.

A pivotal step
Leeuwin executive chair Christopher Piggott said: "The acquisition of the Marda Gold Project is a pivotal step for 
Leeuwin Metals, delivering significant value with minimal dilution to shareholders. 
"This advanced gold project in Western Australia provides an exciting growth platform with substantial exploration 
potential. 
"Marda hosts extensive known mineralisation in and around existing pits. This mineralisation is open and 
represents low hanging fruit for our initial exploration campaign. 
Page 2 of 3
Leeuwin Metals to acquire Marda Gold Project in WA from Ramelius Resources
"There are also numerous drilling targets which have been defined by geophysics and limited drilling. There is 
immense upside at these targets which we will prioritise as part of our resource growth strategy. 
"The project's strategic location, within trucking distance of multiple gold mills and supported by excellent 
infrastructure, further enhances its viability. 
"With granted mining leases included in the acquisition, Leeuwin is well-positioned to rapidly progress discoveries 
into development. We are excited to commence work programs and look forward to sharing updates as we advance 
this opportunity into 2025."
Exploration ahead
Historical exploration at Marda has largely focused on near-mine areas and existing open pits, but Leeuwin says it 
will prioritise the vast underexplored high-grade potential across the project which remains open and requires 
immediate follow-up drilling.
There are multiple targets within the project area, with the project broken into four main areas: Marda Central, 
Marda North, Marda South and Marda West.
Targets represent various stages of exploration maturity from resource definition around existing open pits, 
historical workings, geochemical anomalies and untested concepts. 
This will enable Leeuwin to develop multiple work programs for 2025 to advance exploration within the project with 
an initial focus on more advanced target areas.

areas.
Leeuwin's strategy will focus on defining extensions to high-grade zones across key prospects, supported by 
historical un-mined intercepts such as:
  
• 2-metres at 16.75g/t gold from 12 metres (NRC043) - Evanston;  
• 3.6-metres at 16.4g/t gold from I metre (EDM003) - Evanston;  
• 8-metres at 5.76 g/t gold from 8 metres (ERC147) - Evanston;  
• 5-metres at 7.47g/t gold from 120 metres (MKC003) - Mt King;  
• 4-metres at 7.27g/t gold from 70 metres (MKC006) - Mt King;  
• 1-metre at 15.84g/t gold from 47 metres (MRC248) - Taipan; and  
• 1-metre at 27.75g/t gold from 31 metres (MAR111) - Taipan.
Marda Central prospects.
Leeuwin plans to immediately commence follow-up exploration programs to prioritise near-term drill targets across 
the project.
The acquisition
LM1 entered into a binding share sale agreement with Ramelius to acquire 100% of Marda Operations, which owns 
the Marda Gold Project.
The company believes that the acquisition represents significant value for its shareholders, with an upfront 
consideration of $500,000 in Leeuwin shares to be issued to Ramelius upon completion.
Additional milestone payments, payable in cash, include:
  
• Milestone 1: $500,000 upon the definition of a JORC-compliant resource of 500,000 ounces; and  Page 3 of 3

• Milestone 2: $1,000,000 upon the definition of a JORC-compliant resource of 1 million ounces.
Upon completion of the acquisition, Ramelius will become a strategic shareholder in Leeuwin, reinforcing alignment 
and positioning both companies for potential future collaborative growth opportunities.

It's set to be another down day for the ASX, with ASX 200 futures trading down 50 points (-0.61%) to 8,114, as of 
8:30 am.
The ASX200 closed sharply lower yesterday, shedding 141 points (-1.70%) to end at 8,168. The Information 
Technology (-2.52%), Materials (-2.02%), and Financials (-1.89%) sectors led the declines.
In contrast, the Consumer Staples (-0.65%), Industrials (-0.68%), and Utilities (-1.11%) sectors fared slightly better, 
outperforming the broader market.
Investor sentiment took a hit following a hawkish rate cut by the US Federal Reserve, just days before Christmas. 
The index plummeted 180 points in early trading before recovering slightly to finish the session down 141 points, 
erasing gains made after the US election.
"We believe the sell-off on Wall Street that inspired yesterday's carnage was more likely a position wash than the 
result of an unexpected policy shift. For that reason, we think the Santa Claus rally has been postponed rather than 
cancelled," IG Markets analyst Tony Sycamore noted. 
Wall Street flat after big selloff
US stock markets closed relatively unchanged overnight after the prior session's Fed-induced selloff. The Dow 
Jones Industrial Average rose by 14 points, breaking a ten-session losing streak.

On the economic front, the final estimate for third-quarter GDP was revised upwards to 3.1%, compared to the 
previous 2.8%. Additionally, initial jobless claims fell by 22,000 to 220,000 in the first week of December, 
outperforming market expectations of 230,000.
The data highlights the resilience of the US economy and aligns with the Federal Reserve's outlook that fewer 
interest rate cuts may be required in the coming year.
The Fed's more hawkish tones were not something that risk markets were prepared for just six days out from 
Christmas and were the catalyst to flush some of the speculative excesses that flowed into risk assets, including 
stocks and Bitcoin, following the US election," Sycamore said. "Looking ahead, attention turns to tonight's Core 
PCE inflation data, which is expected to rise to 2.9% YoY in November, up from 2.8% prior. The rates market is 
pricing in 36 bp of rate cuts for 2025 rebounding from the 31bp we saw post the FOMC meeting yesterday."
European retreat
European sharemarkets declined on Thursday as investors retreated from riskier assets following the US Federal 
Reserve's signal of a slower pace of interest rate cuts in 2024.
The real estate sector, particularly sensitive to interest rate movements, led the losses, falling 2.4%, with technology 
shares matching the decline.
The Bank of England maintained its benchmark interest rate at 4.75%, in line with expectations, though 
policymakers were divided on the decision to hold rates steady.
Meanwhile, Sweden's central bank reduced its key interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, as anticipated, and 
Norway's central bank left its policy rate unchanged at a 16-year high of 4.50%.
The continent-wide FTSEurofirst 300 index slid 1.5%, while the UK's FTSE 100 index in London declined 1.1%.
Currencies and commodities
Currencies mixed as US dollar strengthens
Currencies showed mixed movements against the US dollar in European and US trade on Thursday.

• The Japanese yen weakened from 154.99 yen per US dollar to JPY157.80, closing around JPY157.40.
Commodities retreat on cautious monetary outlook
Global oil prices fell as central bankers in the US, Europe, and Asia signalled a cautious approach to easing 
monetary policy, raising concerns about reduced economic activity impacting oil demand in 2024. 
  
• Brent crude dropped by 51 US cents, or 0.7%, to US$72.88 per barrel.  
• US Nymex crude fell by 67 US cents, or 0.9%, to US$69.91 per barrel.
Base metal prices also retreated, weighed down by a stronger US dollar, which climbed to a near two-year high 
after the US Federal Reserve indicated a slower pace of rate cuts in 2024. 
  
• Copper futures fell 1.9%.  
• Aluminium futures declined 0.8%.

ounce at the US close.  
• Iron ore futures followed suit, losing US65 cents, or 0.6%, to settle at US$104.08 a tonne, as concerns 
over demand in China and the Fed's policy outlook dampened sentiment.

Proactive's Tylah Tully breaks down 'Just the Facts' of the latest news from Leeuwin Metals Ltd (ASX:LM1).
The company has announced the acquisition of the Marda Gold Project from Ramelius Resources Ltd 
(ASX:RMS).
This acquisition includes mining, exploration and prospecting leases spanning over 500 square kilometres in the 
Western Australian Goldfields, located 120 kilometres north of Southern Cross.
The project features several existing pits, historical workings and underexplored areas with high-grade potential.
Leeuwin plans to focus on these advanced and underexplored regions to define resource extensions.
Targets are spread across four main areas: Marda Central, Marda North, Marda South, and Marda West.
The acquisition, structured via a share sale agreement, includes an upfront payment of $500,000 in Leeuwin shares 
and milestone payments of up to $1.5 million tied to resource definitions.
Upon completion, Ramelius Resources will become a strategic shareholder in Leeuwin.
Leeuwin's management emphasised the strategic value of the acquisition, citing significant exploration potential and 
the opportunity to quickly develop resources from existing mineralisation.

All that glisters seems to turn to gold for former Neighbours and 2002 "Kiss Kiss" pop star Holly Valance and now 
she and her husband, British billionaire Nick Candy are backing gold as the next way to pave their fortunes.
Overnight, a firm the two control which is listed on London's Aim Market, Metals Exploration, lobbed a Ã‚Â£67.5 
million bid for fellow Aim-listed Condor Gold. It's just the latest in a string of takeover plays in the sector both in 
Australia and abroad as companies look to size up on the back of record high gold prices.
In Australia last week two of the biggest gold companies, Northern Star Resources announced a scrip-only merger 
with De Grey Mining - which is yet to produce a bar of gold - in a proposed deal to create a $5bn miner.
Just today, West Australian gold explorer Spartan Resources announced a $220m capital raising, which it said was 
for exploration and mine development. The company is building up a war chest after itself being the target of fellow 
miner Ramelius Resources, which grabbed 17.9 per cent of its shares in a surprise raid in July.
One of the nation's biggest market makers said there "probably" will be more consolidation to take place in the short 
term. He would not be named for the article.
"We think it makes sense," the unnamed fund manager said. "There's a big premium for size. Larger companies 
trade at higher multiples." Companies such as Remelius, Genesis Minerals, and Westgold Resources are potential 
bidders of targets such as Spartan, as well as Vault Minerals and Pantoro, which his firm holds shares in.
Sharing his prediction of takeovers aplenty in the gold industry is funds firm Capital Outcomes.
"We anticipate further consolidation is likely to occur in the Australian gold market," said Capital Outcomes chief 
investment officer Emanuel Datt "We expect most of the consolidation to occur amongst the Australian mid-tier gold 
players." Mr Datt predicts the hunters will be Ramelius, Westgold and Perseus Mining and their targets could be 
Spartan Resources, Bellevue Gold and Predictive Discovery.
Gold is hot right now (as a pop starlet might say) because the global markets believe risks are rising. Gold is viewed 
as an investment safe haven in a world where the conflict in the Middle East has never looked further from ending,

the war in Ukraine continues, and as markets try to predict which countries US president-elect Donald Trump may 
choose to either punish or praise.
In addition, many central banks, like the People's Bank of China have been buying gold to diversify their holdings 
away from US bond markets.
Predicted interest rate cuts in Australia and globally may lead to a further hike in the gold prices as investors look to 
escape falling yields from bonds.
"Gold prices remain high with a strong fundamental outlook," said Mr Datt. The price of gold hit new record highs 
several times this year - reaching US$2,790 in October. Although it's eased since then, the price is still significantly 
higher than its usual trading range for the previous few years.
For gold companies looking for the scale they need to attract the attention of large investors - this bullish outlook 
gives them the confidence to make capital plays that might otherwise seem too risky.
"We have observed an increase in risk appetite amongst the acquirers, case in point being Northern Star acquiring 
De Greys, which holds a large orebody with a complex processing flowsheet," said Mr Datt.
The fact that even exploration-only miners are starting to attract greater attention also reflects the increased 
difficulty of starting new mines. Four months ago, West Australian gold miner Regis Resources, had a $1bn project 
in NSW blocked by Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek in a surprise Indigenous heritage ruling.
Goldman Sachs Australia Head of Metals & Mining Gavi Friedland, believes the balance is shifting toward 
companies that already have mines or project approvals in place.
"We may now see this materialise in an environment where Capital Outcomes chief investment officer says it is 
generally cheaper to 'buy vs. build'," said Goldman Sachs Australia Head of Metals & Mining Gavi Friedland.
It augers well for former Melbounian Ms Valance. The firm she part owns with hubby Mr Candy -- Metals 
Exploration - expects to produce 80,000 ounces of gold from its mines in the Philippines this year and its target 
company Condor owns gold mines in Nicaragua. The former actress and singer seems to have a great track record 
with timing, starring in Neighbours in its prime, sticking to just one very well timed pop album, marrying a property 
mogul and backing Donad Trump.

All that glitters seems to turn to gold for former Neighbours and 2002 Kiss Kiss pop star Holly Valance - and now 
she and her husband, British billionaire Nick Candy, are backing gold as the next way to grow their fortunes.
This month, a firm the two control which is listed on London's Aim Market, Metals Exploration, lobbed a Ã‚Â£67.5m 
($108m) bid for fellow Aim-listed Condor Gold. It's just the latest in a string of takeover plays in the sector both in

"We may now see this materialise in an environment where it is generally cheaper to 'buy versus build'," says 
Goldman Sachs Australia head of metals & mining Gavi Friedland.
"The lack of genuine 'bolt-on' growth opportunities means mid-cap miners are considering consolidation to increase 
scale and provide a platform to pursue larger M&A opportunities that may be out of reach today,' he says.
"M&A pairing brownfield and greenfield mining deposits with underutilised mills is sensible and comes with synergy 
potential." All this predicted gold consolidation relies on the idea gold prices will remain high. So where too next for 
the gold price?
IG Senior Technical Analyst Axel Rudolph believes it's likely to go up to as much as $US2900 and potentially hit 
$US3000 in the first quarter of 2025.
"The gold price is likely to trade around the $US3000 mark for several months as it represents a major 
psychological resistance level as a round number for many investors," Rudolph says. "Physical gold purchases by 
several central banks, and especially by China, are likely to continue until this threshold is reached. Were these 
purchases of gold bullion to continue beyond the $US3000.00 technical level, then $US3113.00 could be reached 
as well." It augers well for former Melburnian Valance. The firm she part owns with husband Candy - Metals 
Exploration - expects to produce 80,000 ounces of gold from its mines in The Philippines this year and its target 
Condor owns gold mines in Nicaragua. The former actress and singer seems to have a great track record with 
timing, starring in Neighbours in its prime, sticking to just one well-timed pop album, marrying a property mogul, 
becoming a very early anti-woke antagonist and backing Trump way back in 2022 when he looked more likely to go 
to jail than become the leader of the free world again.

  The local share market has crept higher and is on track to record its third straight day of gains.
   Near noon AEDT on Monday, the benchmark S&P/ASX200 index was up 9.7 points, or 0.12 per cent, to 8,260.5, 
while the broader All Ordinaries had climbed 12 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 8,523.9.
   The ASX200 had been up as many as 41 points in morning trading, reaching its highest level since its December 
19 plunge.
   The gains come after a solid session on Wall Street on Friday, where the S&P500 snapped its five-day losing 
streak with a 1.3 per cent rally following the release of US economic data pointing to a continuing recovery in 
manufacturing activity last month.
   Nine of the ASX's 11 sectors were in the green at midday, with materials and consumer staples lower.
   Tech was the biggest mover, rising 1.7 per cent as Wisetech Global climbed 2.0 per cent and Xero added 2.6 per 
cent.
   Insignia Financial had soared 12.6 per cent to a three-year high of $3.985 after the financial advice company, 
formerly known as IOOF Holdings, said it had received another takeover offer.
   US-based investment manager CC Capital Partners is offering $4.30 per share, $2.9 billion for the money 
manager, eclipsing a recent $4-per-share, $2.7 billion offer from Bain Capital.
   Insignia's board says it is considering both proposals.
   Elsewhere in the sector, all of the big four banks were higher.
   CBA had climbed 0.6 per cent, NAB had added 0.3 per cent and Westpac and ANZ had both crept 0.1 per cent 
higher.
   In the heavyweight mining sector, BHP had dropped 1.7 per cent, Fortescue had dipped 1.4 per cent and Rio 
Tinto had subtracted 1.6 per cent.
   Goldminers were mostly higher as the precious metal changed hands for $US2,644 an ounce, with Northern Star 
adding 1.4 per cent and Evolution expanding 1.0 per cent.

   But Bellevue Gold had plunged 10.3 per cent to a nearly two-year low of $1.0275 after revising its 2024/25 
production guidance, although on the flip side, Ramelius Resources had climbed 5.2 per cent to $2.225 after 
announcing it had a record free cash flow of $174.5 million in the fourth quarter.
   In the energy sector, there were more gains for uranium developers after a major mine in Kazakhstan suspended 
production last week over a permitting issue.
   Deep Yellow had grown 4.3 per cent, Boss Energy had expanded 5.0 per cent and Paladin Energy had advanced 
4.7 per cent.
   The Australian dollar had hit a one-week high against its US counterpart, buying 62.36 US cents, from 62.16 US 
cents at Friday's close.

Bellevue Gold faces questions over its ability to live up to production targets after slashing guidance for financial 
year 2025 amid teething problems at its namesake mine in Western Australia.
Perth-headquartered Bellevue on Monday slashed gold production guidance to 150,000-165,000 ounces, down 
from 165,000-180,000 ounces, blaming grade and other issues for weaker-than-expected output.
Bellevue said it would update the market on its 2024-25 cost guidance in its December quarter production report 
due before the end of the month. The company's share price closed down nearly 14 per cent at 98c.
Moelis Australia's Paul Hissey said the Bellevue update appeared to manifest concerns about the miner's ability to 
ramp up head grades and would do little to silence a growing chorus of doubters.
"There is also some abstruse disclosure in the result which a sceptic may choose to infer additional 
underperformance for the quarter," he said.
"We retain our neutral investment view ..." Bellevue said it was on track to produce 90,000 ounces from what has 
been touted as one of Australia's highest-grade gold mines in the six months to June 30. On an annualised basis, 
that would equal the top range of original 2024-25 guidance of 180,000 ounces. Bellevue also said it would reach 
an annual production rate of 200,000 ounces from early in the June quarter.
Bellevue has a five-year growth plan to produce 250,000 ounces annually by 2027-28, and said in October that it 
had completed key infrastructure upgrades and was on track to hit the original 2024-25 guidance.
On Monday, Bellevue said gold sales in the December quarter totalled 26,230 ounces at an average sale price of 
$3339 an ounce, and it had $81m in cash and gold on hand compared to $109m at the end of the September 
quarter.
Bellevue said it encountered lower grades and geological variability in mining of the outer edges of the main ore in 
the December quarter. The Bellevue update coincided with updates from two other gold producers - considered 
central players in sector consolidation.

Gold Road said its Gruyere mine, owned in partnership with Gold Fields, produced a quarterly record 91,631 
ounces in the three months to December 31.
Gruyere, operated and managed by Gold Fields, produced 287,270 ounces across 2024, below annual guidance of 
290,000-305,000 ounces.
Gold Road owns 17 per cent of De Grey Mining, the target of a $5bn takeover offer from Northern Star, and is 
shaping up as a potential king maker if a rival offer emerges.
In its December quarter update, Ramelius Resource hailed record free cash flow of $174.5m before splashing out 
$68m to increase its stake in Spartan Resources to 19.9 per cent and dividend payments of $43.4m. Ramelius, 
led by noted deal-maker Mark Zeptner, took its investment in Spartan from 18.3 per cent to the takeover brink in 
December after participating in a $220m Spartan capital raising aimed at restarting mining at the Dalgaranga 
project in WA.

State Street Global Advisors, one of the world's largest investors, says gold prices could reach $US3100 an ounce 
this year, extending a 2024 rally that pushed the precious metal to its biggest annual gain in 14 years.
Bullion rallied 27 per cent last year and peaked at a record $US2778 an ounce in October, fuelled by robust central 
bank purchases, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions in 
Ukraine and the Middle East.
And the world's fourth-largest asset manager believes those drivers remain intact this year despite indications from 
President-elect Donald Trump that his administration will enact policies to grow businesses faster, propelling the 
rally in riskier assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies.
State Street, which manages a portfolio of $US4.73 trillion ($7.6 trillion), said there was heightened anxiety about a 
return of high inflation, ballooning government debt and worsening geopolitical tensions under a Trump 
administration. That would spur gold buying as a way to protect wealth.
"We don't see this changing and expect the secular demand trends underpinning gold's price and its status as a 
safe haven to continue enhancing gold's appeal as a core portfolio asset, even if capital markets strike a risk-on 
tone in 2025," State Street's chief gold strategist George Milling-Stanley said.
While State Street's base case is for gold to trade between $US2600 an ounce and $US2900 an ounce this year, it 
assigned a 30 per cent probability to its bullish scenario where the precious metal hits $US3100 an ounce.
State Street joins the chorus of Wall Street banks that are betting on another stellar year for the precious metal.
Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citi forecast bullion will reach $US3000 an ounce by the end of this year, and UBS 
forecasts $US2900 an ounce. While Goldman Sachs pushed out its projection this week, the broker still sees prices 
hitting $US3000 an ounce by mid-2026.
The bullish forecasts assume gold will jump more than 13 per cent this year from the current spot price of 
$US2649.38 an ounce.

A stronger US dollar has weighed on gold prices since the US election on November 5, but strategists underline the 
prospect of sweeping tariffs under Mr Trump which could exacerbate trade tensions and stunt global growth.
Gold received a further boost this week on news that China's central bank expanded its gold reserves for a second 
month in December to 73.29 million fine troy ounces, from 72.96 million in the previous month. The People's Bank 
of China resumed adding to its gold reserves in November following a six-month pause when prices hovered at 
record levels.
Local gold miners revealed this week that they ramped up output in the December quarter to capitalise on the boom 
in prices.
Gold Road Resources delivered record gold production from the Gruyere mine in Western Australia, Ramelius 
Resources boosted its output by 36 per cent compared to the September quarter, and Regis Resources lifted its 
production by nearly 10 per cent in the December quarter.
But analysts are frustrated that gold stocks continue to lag the price of the precious metal; the spot price surged 27 
per cent in 2024 but the New York Stock Exchange Arca Gold Miners Index climbed just 11 per cent.
VanEck believes the disconnect can be explained by a trend that has developed where the leverage of gold stocks 
to the metal's price is weaker when gold prices are rising compared to when they are falling.
Indeed, gold prices fell 0.9 per cent from the end of 2023 to the end of February last year, while gold stocks sank 
15.3 per cent.
In contrast, from the end of February to October 22, gold was up 34.5 per cent, while the stocks surged 67.7 per 
cent.
And from October 22 to the end of November, prices fell 3.9 per cent, but the shares of gold miners dropped by 
14.8 per cent.
"We have been anecdotally making this observation, frustrated by the overly punitive impact this continues to have 
on the already oversold gold shares," VanEck strategists said.
"We think this dichotomy represents a value opportunity for gold miners as they have been potentially oversold 
when the price of gold falls and under-bought when the gold price has been appreciating."
The significant gap between gold prices and stocks had been narrowing over the last year, but weakness in the 
sector following the US election widened it once again.
And with gold producers enjoying record margins and fresh cash flow generation, VanEck expects the disconnect 
won't last forever.
"Investors looking to hedge broader market risk through gold exposure, we think should also consider an allocation 
to the gold mining sector," VanEck said. "They may be among the few equities not priced to perfection."

  The local share market has rallied after US government data showed inflation cooled more than expected in 
December, raising hopes the Federal Reserve would continue cutting interest rates in 2025.
   The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index on Thursday gained 113.7 points, or 1.38 per cent, to 8,327.0, while the 
broader All Ordinaries had climbed 112.3 points, or 1.33 per cent, to 8,569.1.
   The gains came after US core inflation cooled to 3.2 per cent in the year from December, after remaining at 3.3 
per cent for three months in a row.
   GSFM investment specialist Stephen Miller said while the readout wasn't good enough to bring a January rate cut 
back into favour, it was good enough to erase any thought the Fed might not ease in 2025, a notion that had airplay 
in recent days.
   Closer to home, a strong domestic jobs report was seen as reducing odds the Reserve Bank would cut Australian 
interest rates in February.
   Employment picked up by 56,300 in December, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Thursday and, 
while unemployment ticked it up, it was still low at 4.0 per cent.
   "Today's release reinforces our long-running position that the RBA is unlikely to make the first rate cut until later in 
the year," VanEck portfolio manager Cameron McCormack said.
   Ultimately every sector of the ASX ground, with financials the biggest gainer, rising 2.6 per cent after US banking 
giants JPMorgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs all delivered strong fourth-quarter earnings reports 
overnight.
   CBA jumped 3.0 per cent to $155.75, Westpac rose 2.5 per cent to $32.66, NAB climbed 2.8 per cent to $38.45, 
ANZ advanced 2.7 per cent to $29.98 and Macquarie gained 3.2 per cent to $231.34
   Zip soared 10 per cent to $3.09 and Afterpay owner Block rose 3.4 per cent to $138.38.
   In the heavyweight mining sector, goldminers were up as the precious metal neared a five-week high of $US2,700 
an ounce.

   Evolution was up 2.8 per cent, Newmont rose 3.0 per cent and Ramelius Resources climbed 5.0 per cent.
   BHP rose 0.5 per cent to $39.98, Fortescue added 0.3 per cent to $18.89 and Rio Tinto edged 0.1 per cent higher 
at $119.61 after releasing four-quarter production results.
   In health care, Neuren jumped 11.5 per cent to $12.28 after the Melbourne-based biotech's drug partner, Acadia 
Pharmaceuticals, asked European regulators to approve Neuren's treatment for the rare genetic disorder known as 
Rett syndrome.
   The Australian dollar was near a one-week high against the greenback, buying 62.02 US cents, from 61.88 US 
cents at close of business Wednesday.
   ON THE ASX:
   * The benchmark S&P/ASX200 index on Thursday gained 113.7 points, or 1.38 per cent, to 8,327.0
   * The broader All Ordinaries rose 112.3 points, or 1.33 per cent, at 8,569.1.

Highlight: In this edition of Bulls N' Bears Big Hits, we examine notable drill intercepts revealed on the ASX, 
including Ordell Minerals' 22.70m at 4.09g/t gold from 71.3m.
Body
In this edition of Bulls N' Bears Big Hits, we examine some notable drill intercepts revealed on the ASX, including 
Ordell Minerals' 22.70m at 4.09g/t gold intercept from 71.3m from its Barimaia project in WA's Murchison region.
We also take a close look at other interesting drill hits from around the globe last week as reported by Sierra 
Nevada Gold and Asian Battery Metals' in Mongolia.
So, let's dive in.
Ordell Minerals (ASX:ORD)
Hit: 22.7m at 4.09g/t gold from 71.3m, including 1m at 36g/t gold from 76m.
Ordell Minerals' recently completed diamond drilling program at its McNabs East prospect within its Barimaia gold 
project near Mt Magnet in WA has jagged an encouraging 22.7m going 4.09g/t gold from 71.3m, including 1m at a 
solid 36g/t gold from 76m.
The hit is supported by encouraging gold intercepts in four other holes, with one 12m intersection going 1.85g/t gold 
from 152m, including 5.78m at 3.36g/t gold from 158.2m.
The gold mineralisation has been confirmed by the company's drilling to be associated with a felsic intrusive and to 
strike east/north-east and plunge at a flat angle to the east. The drill intercepts reveal the possibility of an extensive 
zone of shallow gold mineralisation on the western side of McNabs East, which at this stage remains open at depth 
and along strike.
The company completed the five hole, 426m diamond drilling program last December as part of an ongoing 
program to systematically test the currently defined 2.5km strike extent of shallow gold mineralisation at Barimaia.
Results from the program confirm the existence of a shallow, coherent zone of potentially open-pittable gold 
mineralisation on the western side of McNabs East, within an extensive gold system that remains untested at depth 
and open along strike.

Ordell's flagship Barimaia gold project is an advanced exploration project with significant historical drilling results. 
Ordell acquired an 80.3 per cent interest in Barimaia from Genesis Minerals, which is now a major shareholder of 
Ordell with an 8 per cent interest.
However, Barimaia was never fully explored by Genesis due to its other commitments, although the company 
successfully identified an extensive gold system at the project, supported by historical RC drilling results pointing to 
good shallow open pit potential.
The project is strategically located within a stone's throw of at least three gold processing plants, including the 
adjacent Ramelius Resources' Mt Magnet mill, 70km from Spartan Resources' Dalgaranga mill and 80km from 
Westgold Resources' Tuckabianna mill.
The company is planning to launch a more extensive program of about 5000m of reverse circulation drilling at 
Barimaia in February. The upcoming program will include infill drilling at McNabs East to close up the current 100m 
drill section spacing and will also include first-pass extensional drilling in areas where previous air-core (AC) drilling 
was undertaken in 2019 and 2021.
Additionally, the new program will test depths between 100m and 200m in selected areas and will also include 
additional AC drilling east and north of the currently defined mineralisation at McNabs.
Ordell says drilling of the McNabs East western zone will comprise a significant part of the company's big drilling 
program slated for February.
------------------
Sierra Nevada Gold (ASX:SNX)
Hit: 4.88m at 481g/t silver, 0.61g/t gold, 0.6 per cent copper and 0.4 per cent antimony from 87.78m.
Sierra Nevada Gold's Phase 1 reverse-circulation (RC) drilling at its Endowment Mine within the overall Blackhawk 
epithermal project area pulled up a big silver hit while targeting a remnant ore position between the 3rd and 4th 
mine levels on the historic Endowment Vein.
The headline drill hit from the latest campaign is 4.88m at 481g/t silver, 0.61g/t gold, 0.6 per cent copper and 0.4 
per cent antimony from 87.78m
The vein was targeted based on indications from historic mine records pointing to part of the vein not having been 
mined, with drilling successfully spearing through an inter-stope zone to jag the vein which remains open down-
plunge to the east.
The Endowment Mine is the biggest of the historic mines in the locality and was initially mined in the 1860s, with 
most mining completed by the 1880s and a total production being reported of 70,000 ounces of gold equivalent.
The operation's inability to process sulphide ores and prevailing depressed economic conditions led to the 
cessation of mining in the 1920s, although mineralisation remains within reach of current infrastructure.
Notably, the area has seen little modern-day exploration before Sierra Nevada Gold acquired the ground, with the 
latest prior exploration in the area being undertaken in the mid to late 1980s by American Gold Resources.
The focus of recent exploration has been on defining shallow oxide gold and silver deposits, with two shallow oxide 
resources being estimated by AGR at Silver Gulch and Morning Star, which also lie within the overall Blackhawk 
project
Importantly, before Sierra Nevada Gold's presence, no exploration drilling was recorded within 600m of the 
Endowment Mine due to previous ownership issues.Page 3 of 4

The company's other drilling at the adjacent near-surface South Vein turned up additional silver hits, including 6.1m 
going 66.04g/t silver in one hole and 1.22m at 82.80g/t silver in a second hole.
Geochemically the South Vein is like the Endowment Vein, characterised by high silver, antimony, ore-grade lead, 
zinc and elevated copper and manganese.
Interestingly, apart from its big hit in the Endowment Vein, the headline hole also punched through a 1.22m section 
of the South Vein which assayed a serious 275g/t silver, 3.65 per cent lead, 6.47 per cent zinc, 0.40 per cent 
copper, and 0.21 per cent antimony from 37.79m.
Sierra Nevada has identified a big high-grade intermediate sulphidation epithermal (ISE) silver-gold-lead-zinc vein 
field which is related to the adjacent big Blackhawk porphyry system just south of the epithermal field.
The ISE vein system covers about 5 sq. km and is open under cover both to the north and north-east, with about 
22.5 line kilometres of veins recorded so far. Sierra Nevada is continuing its mapping and sampling and has 
identified additional veins within the ISE vein field.
------------------
Asian Battery Metals (ASX:AZ9)
Hit: 6.1m of 4.16 per cent copper, 3.51 per cent nickel, 0.93g/t 3E and 0.13 per cent cobalt from 98.2m.
Last week Asian Battery Minerals landed a 6.1m hit grading 4.16 per cent copper, 3.51 per cent nickel, 0.93g/t 3E 
and 0.13 per cent cobalt from 98.2m.
A 3E value refers typically to the combined value of assays for gold, platinum and palladium.
The result, from one of the last four holes analysed in its 2024 Phase 2 drilling program, was designed to confirm 
the extent of high-grade mineralisation in the company's Oval gabbroic intrusion.
The intercept is book-ended by two broad, lower grade mineralised zones, the first of which is a dense, 
disseminated intercept of 26.2m at 0.44 per cent copper, 0.52 per cent nickel, 0.12g/t 3E and 0.03 per cent cobalt 
from 78.2m. The second zone comprises a net-textured 15.3m assaying 1.15 per cent copper, 0.79 per cent nickel, 
0.35g/t 3E and 0.04 per cent cobalt from 104.3m.
Three of the last four drillholes analysed targeted electromagnetic (EM) conductors identified from downhole 
(DHEM) responses, which the company believes could represent base metal mineralised targets.
The headline hole probed a strongly conductive DHEM plate in the northern half of the Oval body, which is strongly 
expressed in high-resolution magnetics as a 500m long, 125m wide ovoid body oriented to the north-northwest.
The hole successfully encountered low to highly mineralised gabbroic rock from 16m depth to 142.2m, including the 
foregoing intercepts.
A second hole in the final suite of four was collared 35m east of and on an opposing azimuth to the headline hole.
It targeted a separate DHEM conductor for which the source turned out to be a broad high-grade intersection in the 
northern third of the Oval area that includes a massive sulphide intercept of 1.8m at 3.21 per cent copper, 3.32 per 
cent nickel, 0.69g/t E3, and 0.14 per cent cobalt from 105m.
The 1.8m at 3.21 copper intercept lies within a broader mineralised zone comprising 19.8m at 1.23 per cent copper, 
0.98 per cent nickel, 0.36g/t 3E and 0.05 per cent cobalt from 91.2m.
The 19.8m zone also includes three other significant intercepts of disseminated, semi-massive and massive 
mineralisation in gabbro, the best of which are 6.6m going 1.56 per cent copper from 96.0m and 2.4m at 1.52 per 
cent copper and 1.39 per cent nickel from 102.6m.Page 4 of 4
Ordell locks onto new gold zone in Mt Magnet
The third drillhole targeted an off-hole conductor plate that had been determined by DHEM surveying of a nearby 
previous hole. It intercepted 18.5m of lower grade mineralised gabbro from 13.5m to 32m, although it includes 3.2m 
running 0.50 per cent copper, 0.38 per cent nickel, 0.30g/t 3E and 0.02 per cent cobalt from 25m.
Further support was lent to the intriguing possibilities presented by the Oval body, with the fourth drillhole testing 
the southern extremity of the Oval gabbroic intrusive and the zone of contact with its enclosing sediments.
That hole was also intended to provide a vector for a subsequent DHEM survey to sniff out any new useful 
conductors within range. It intercepted disseminated mineralised gabbro with 5m going 0.17 per cent copper, 0.17 
per cent nickel, 0.03g/t 3E and 0.01 per cent cobalt from 126m.
The company's recent drilling has focused mainly on identifying high-grade mineralisation in the gabbro at the Oval 
project. It views the multiple intercepts of massive sulphide mineralisation with their varying ratios of metal 
throughout the Oval intrusion as encouraging for the possibility of finding one or more deeper sources of high-grade 
copper-nickel-platinum group mineralisation.
For its follow-up 2025 exploration program, Asian Battery Metals plans to focus on scoping out the overall scale of 
the Oval mineralisation and to target possible deeper magmatic sources at the prospect. It also plans additional 
exploration for potential extensions of Oval and nearby look-alike prospects.

Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Ramelius Resources December Quarterly Conference Call. 
[Operator Instructions]
I would now like to hand the conference over to Mark Zeptner, Managing Director. Please go ahead.
Mark Zeptner
Thank you, Travis. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to dial in this morning. In addition to the 
quarterly report, we've also released a presentation that we'll largely speak to during the call. Both documents have 
been uploaded on the ASX platform and will be available on the website shortly.

Ramelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript
Once again, I'm joined by our CFO, Darren Millman. Darren will provide some detail on the financials after I've run 
through the highlights and touched on the operational performance and our development projects. As always, there 
will be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions at the end.
For those who have downloaded the presentation deck, I'll be initially speaking to Slide 3. I'll focus on the highlights 
and key achievements for the quarter. I would like to point out that there is a large amount of detail on exploration, 
operations and project development within the quarterly report itself.
So on Slide 3, operationally and financially, the December quarter was exceptionally strong, with the business 
generating a record and also sector-leading AUD 174.5 million in underlying free cash flow. After considering our 
additional investment in Spartan during the quarter of AUD 68 million and the payment of our FY '24 AUD 0.05 per 
share dividend, our closing cash and gold position was just over AUD 500 million.
Our quarterly gold production was 85,311 ounces, which was a 37% increase on the prior quarter, noting also just 
shy of our record production, which occurred in the March 2024 quarter. The increase in production was mainly due 
to the introduction of ore from Cue, which performed extremely well during the quarter and also improved grades 
from Penny. I'll talk to these points in more detail shortly.
Looking at the costs, we saw a 25% decrease in our all-in sustaining costs down to AUD 1,491 for the quarter. Now 
whilst we were guiding for a reduction in all-in sustaining costs across the year, the all-in sustaining cost for the 
quarter was below our expectations and obviously benefited from the outperformance of Cue. Importantly, our 
guidance for FY '25 remains unchanged at 270,000 to 300,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of AUD 1,500 to 
AUD 1,700 an ounce.
Whilst we are encouraged by the indicative overperformance of Cue grades, it is still relatively early days, and we 
will continue to assess this during the March quarter as more data becomes available as mining and milling 
progresses.
Unfortunately, during the quarter, we did record our first LTI since May 2023. Whilst this is extremely disappointing, 
the incident itself, which is detailed in the quarterly report, was not of a serious nature. We do strive to ensure that 
all employees and contractors remain healthy -- safe and healthy under our watch. The total recordable injury 
frequency rate, or TRIFR, at the end of December was 8.33, which was only marginally higher than that recorded 
last quarter.

There were several milestones and advancements in our key projects across the quarter with haulage to [Cue] 
commencing mid-November following the completion of the Great Northern Highway intersection upgrade and also 
delivery of the Rebecca Roe PFS, which is demonstrating strong economic returns.
For the immediate future, our focus is on delivery of the Eridanus and Mt Magnet mill upgrade studies and 
associated mine plan in this quarter and the Rebecca Roe DFS, which is targeting a final investment decision in the 
September quarter. Exploration and resource definition activities during the quarter were largely focused on 
Eridanus, Penny West and the Lena pit at Cue.
On Slide 4, I will draw your attention on -- sorry, we're looking here at the quarterly production breakdown for the 
last 12 months. If you look at the yellow Mt Magnet bars, you can see the previous September quarter, we focused 
largely on the development of Cue. And now we see that asset in production, along with improved grades at Penny, 
has been the main driver of increased production in the December quarter. As expected, Edna May production is 
slowly winding down.
On to Slide 5, which references quarterly production stats. The standout here is the mine grade for the quarter of 
7.3 grams per tonne, which is more than double that of the September quarter and has been driven once again by 
grades at Cue and Penny, which were 7.4 and 17.9 grams per tonne, respectively.Page 3 of 6
Ramelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript
Now whilst the ore tonnes mined reduced, it needs to be highlighted that there still is a fair amount of pre-strip and 
development taking place at Cue. We expect comparable mined ore tonnes to continue into the March quarter as 
we progress development before we start to see an increase in these ore tonnes in the June 2025 quarter. Mill 
throughput levels were maintained during the quarter with the drawdown of existing stockpiles across Edna May 
and also the Eridanus stockpile at Mt Magnet.
On to Slide 6, we're showing Mt Magnet's highlights. Production from Mt Magnet totaled just over 67,000 ounces at 
an all-in sustaining cost of AUD 1,277. Open pit mining at Mt Magnet is now solely focused at Cue, with the Break 
of Day, Waratah and White Heat pits all being mined during the quarter. Productivities increased during the quarter 
with the introduction of a third excavator, which resulted in a 44% increase in material movement quarter-on-
quarter. Underground operations continue to focus on Galaxy and Penny. At Galaxy, mining was largely in line with 
the prior quarter, whilst at Penny, both tonnages and grade increased, most notably the mine grade, which is 
attributable to stoping on the 1252 level, which is central to the high-grade plunge of the Penny North load.
I would also like to highlight, the overall mill grade at Mt Magnet in the quarter was 5.1 grams. This is the highest 
grade seen under Ramelius ownership at the Mt Magnet mill. It has to be pointed out, the processing team did 
exceptionally well in managing these higher grade of ores with met recovery levels being maintained above 96%.
Before I move on from this slide, if I refer you to the pie chart, we only incorporated 20% of the high-grade material 
from Cue and Penny into Mt Magnet to generate AUD 161.3 million in cash flow at Mt Magnet, quite amazing, with 
plenty more to come.
On to Penny, Slide 7. We mined 48,000 tonnes, average grade of 17.9, as mentioned. We milled 39,000 tonnes at 
20.5 grams and produced a little over 18,000 ounces of gold. The mine itself generated operating cash flow of AUD 
73.1 million at a very nice all-in sustaining cost of AUD 790 per ounce.
Our exploration last quarter was focused on the Penny West ore body beneath the original pit with some extremely 
high-grade hits in this area, as noted on the slide. The drilling to date pretty much confirms the location and 
thickness of this load, with the additional drilling information to be used to refine stoping blocks.

On to Cue, Slide 8, the graphic shows the Break of Day pit Starlight load, which is where most of Cue's production 
from the -- in the quarter came from. A total of 101,000 tonnes was mined across Cue in the quarter at a grade of 
7.4. However, we were able to selectively stockpile and allow processing to focus on the highest grade material, 
with 48,000 tonnes being milled at an excellent grade of 15.8.
The free cash flow from Cue alone in the quarter after growth capital spend of 4.4 was AUD 56 million and an all-in 
sustaining cost actually below that of Penny of AUD 723 per ounce. The high-quality blend of Penny and Cue has 
generated these great results at Mt Magnet this quarter.
Slide 9 on Edna May. Gold production at Edna May totaled 18,261 ounces in the quarter at an all-in sustaining cost 
of AUD 2,209, which, as you can appreciate, is highly cash generative. And indeed, across operations at Edna May, 
we reported free cash flow of AUD 32.5 million. The all-in sustaining cost was lower than the previous quarter, with 
the three carried low-grade stockpiles currently being processed exceeding grade expectations.
In our mind, there is no reason to think that this outperformance on grade won't continue through to the end at Edna 
May. At the end of the quarter, there remained approximately 400,000 tonnes at a grade of 0.8 grams per tonne, 
which will provide feed for the Edna May mill through the bulk of the March 2025 quarter.
Slide 10 on guidance. We note both production cost and also capital guidance for FY '25, where there has been no 
change since our initial guidance issued in August, and we are tracking well to achieve these targets for FY '25, 
having produced a little over 50% of the ounces required in the first half.Page 4 of 6

Slide 11 doesn't normally appear in our quarterly presentation deck, but I think we needed it in this time around. 
And there's probably two key points to make on this slide.
Firstly, at Penny, we passed an important milestone in the quarter. The operation has effectively paid back our 
initial investment plus the capital and is effectively AUD 31 million in the black, courtesy of AUD 71 million in free 
cash flow, generated by that operation in the quarter.
Secondly, if you include stockpiles at the mine, Cue generated AUD 83 million in cash flow in the quarter, which 
represents an excellent start to paying back the initial investment in Cue of approximately AUD 206 million. At 
current gold prices, we expect that initial investment to be paid back in the second half of this calendar year.
That covers the highlights and operations from me. I'll hand over to you, Darren.
Darren Millman
Thank you, Mark, and it's a pleasure to be here today. I will be initially speaking to Slide 12. On Slide 12, we show 
financial highlights for the quarter.

From a financial point of view, it was an exceptional strong quarter for Ramelius with AUD 174.5 million of free 
cash flow being generated, our best on record by quite a margin. This demonstrates the increasing margins of the 
business, not only due to the gold price, but also improved mill grades. These high cash flow generating ounces will 
not only continue for the remainder of FY '25, but also into FY '26.
During the quarter, we sold 80,000 ounces at an average realized price of AUD 3,683 per ounce, which included a 
mix of spot and committed forward sales. This results in total sales revenue for the quarter of AUD 295 million. The 
Australian gold price continues to increase over the quarter, reporting 11% increase from the September 2024 
quarter. We further unwound our forward contract hedge book, which now sits under 100,000 ounces or less than 6 
months production at an average price of AUD 3,183 per ounce.
The all-in sustaining cost for the quarter was AUD 1,491 per ounce, which was down on the prior quarter, mainly 
due to the impact of stronger grades from Cue and Penny in the quarter. The resulting all-in sustaining cost margin 
of AUD 2,192 per ounce, which is the realized gold price of AUD 3,383 per ounce, less the all-in sustaining cost of 
AUD 1,491; represents an all-in sustaining cost margin of 60%.
Cost guidance for FY '25 remains unchanged at AUD 1,500 to AUD 1,700 per ounce. While this reduction in cost 
was expected, the overperformance of Cue grades did have an impact on reducing the all-in sustaining costs for the 
quarter.
As Mark mentioned earlier, it's early days at Cue. Our geological and operational teams at Mt Magnet are 
performing their reconciliations of both tonnes and grade that have been mined and milled to date at Cue 
incorporating recent grade control drilling, with final results during the March 2025 quarter.
Looking at Mt Magnet in isolation, the all-in sustaining cost was AUD 1,277 per ounce. Whilst total cost did increase 
with the planned maintenance shutdown and increased open pit mining activities, this was more than offset by 
improved grades and production. At Edna May, the all-in sustaining cost was AUD 2,209 per ounce, which is a 
decrease from the prior quarter and better than expected with the overperformance of low-grade stockpile grades.
In the past, we have made the point that Edna May all-in sustaining cost includes a noncash charge for the 
drawdown of existing stockpiles. For this quarter and going forward, this was not the case with the mill feed now 
being made up of largely low-grade stockpiles, which carry no cost on our balance sheet.
On Slide 13 and 14, we show a breakdown of free cash flow metrics for the quarter and historically. Gold sales of 
80,000 ounces generated operational cash flow of AUD 193.6 million and AUD 161.1 million coming from Magnet Page 5 of 6
Ramelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript
and AUD 32.5 million from Edna May. A total of AUD 15.9 million was reinvested into mine development, resource 
definition and exploration in the quarter, which focused on Eridanus, Cue and Penny West.
The resultant free cash flow for the quarter was AUD 174.5 million or over AUD 2,000 per ounce produced. During 
the quarter, we had two material cash flows outside operations. Firstly, Ramelius participated in the Spartan capital 
raise, increasing our position to 19.9% with the additional AUD 68 million invested.
And secondly, we paid our FY '24 final dividend of AUD 0.05 per share, which after taking into account our dividend 
reinvestment plan resulted in a cash payment of AUD 43.4 million to our shareholders. The resultant cash and gold 
position was AUD 501.7 million, which coupled with AUD 175 million debt facility and value of listed investment held 
leaves us with over AUD 1 billion in available liquidity.

On Slide 15, we summarized our key focus areas in FY '25. We want to continue to improve safety performance 
group-wide and deliver FY '25 guidance in line with our value -- our core value of we deliver and do it safely. We 
want to complete the Eridanus underground open pit studies, the Mt Magnet processing facility study on mill 
upgrades and also update our Mt Magnet mine plan, which will be delivered in the March quarter.
At Roe Rebecca, we combined definite feasibility study to be delivered in the September '25 quarter and increase 
exploration programs at Mt Magnet, Cue, Penny and Rebecca Roe.
Operator, with that, we'll now open the line for questions, if you could, please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Alex Barkley from RBC.
Alex Barkley
A question on the Cue pits. I get reconciliation is high, and that's a positive. How long do those high-grade pits 
Break of Day and White Heat last, if you could remind me? And then has that understanding changed at all since 
last year's integrated Mt Magnet plan?
Mark Zeptner
Alex, it's Mark. Just looking at the -- I suppose on the Cue, we possibly flagged that we might get a bit of 
outperformance on grade or maybe words to the effect of if we're going to get outperformance anywhere, it will be 
Cue, especially in the top parts of the pits. And the reason why we do reconciliation and we do additional work 
before jumping to conclusions that the whole camp is going to overperform is because you potentially have 
supergene enrichment in some areas.
But just looking at Break of Day, we've got 130,000 ounces, and White Heat in reserve has got 40,000 ounces. So 
we should be enjoying these grades. There's higher grades. Obviously, we're mining the highest-grade pits first for 
some time. But mind you, we are in that oxide zone. How the grades perform in the fresh rock? We're not jumping 
to conclusions on that just yet. But no, we'll be in very good grade at Cue for some time.
Darren Millman
And just adding to that, Alex, so we're looking to update the Mt Magnet entire plan, so in March. So that will also 
incorporate any changes we feel appropriate in timing of the release of that ore in that plan as well.
Alex BarkleyPage 6 of 6
Ramelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript
Okay. Just one more question on your quite ample cash and liquidity you called out. Is there any consideration to 
buying back your hedges? Or would that pend your project studies or potentially approval? Is there just a time 
frame or parameters around how you think around the hedges?
Darren Millman
You thankfully answered my question. So yes, that's right. When we put out the Mt Magnet, obviously, potential 
Eridanus larger open pit, we've got the Mt Magnet mill upgrade. And obviously, we've also got the FID decision 
around Rebecca Roe, and that's all coming in the first half of the calendar FY '25.
Subscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this
So I think once we have that full picture, then we'll be looking at all capital allocations and obviously, something that 
we may consider is reducing this hedge book. But at the moment, we're producing margins of over 60% with having 
this hedge book. So it's not a high priority, but it's definitely something we will look at, but it's coming off pretty quick 
at the back end of this year.
Mark Zeptner
Yes, we're below 100,000 ounces now. But at the moment, we're not currently minded to write a big check and buy 
it out, but we need to see the capital profile for the business, particularly over the next few years, to make good 
decisions on that, Alex.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] At this time, we're showing no further questions. I'll hand the conference back to Mark for 
any closing remarks.
Mark Zeptner
Thank you, Travis. One question, some sort of record. 22 minutes past the hour. Everyone must be happy with the 
information we've provided. Thank you for listening in. Have a great day, guys.

US President Donald Trump's decision to impose a 10 per cent tariff on imports from China, as well as concerns 
about a global trade war, led the ASX to its largest one-day loss in five months yesterday.
The S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.8 per cent, or 152.9 points, to 8379.4 points, having dropped as much as 2 per cent mid-
session. That was the index's largest intraday loss since September 4. All 11 sectors finished in the red, with 
consumer discretionary and healthcare stocks falling more than 2 per cent.
Mr Trump signed orders imposing tariffs of 25 per cent on goods from Canada and Mexico and 10 per cent on 
China at the weekend.
The acceleration in trade tensions led to rising uncertainty over everything from inflation and central bank interest 
rate decisions to Mr Trump's future policy agenda.
The US dollar strengthened following the announcement, sinking the Australian dollar to a five-year low US61¢ 
yesterday.
No blue-chip was spared as investors digested the impact of the tariffs on Australian companies. Commonwealth 
Bank closed down 1.5 per cent at $158.13. WiseTech Global dropped 2.9 per cent to $120.17.
MLC Asset Management portfolio manager Anthony Golowenko said the impact of tariffs and trade wars on stock 
prices had underscored the importance of strong earnings when companies report half-year profits later this month.
"The uncertainty today shows that for investors, things can't be any more simple than 'show me your earnings' - that 
companies are actually delivering quality, underlying resilience and growth in margins," he said.
In Singapore, the benchmark iron ore futures contract fell more than 1 per cent on fears that tariffs would hurt 
demand for China's steel.
Iron ore miner Champion Iron dropped 4.5 per cent to $5.32 and Fortescue fell 4.4 per cent to $18.29. BHP fell 1.8 
per cent to $39.24.

ASX posts big intraday loss; CBA falls 1.5pc; Equities
Online luxury retailer Cettire and healthcare conglomerate Fisher & Paykel recorded heavy losses, owing to their 
exposure to countries hit by the US tariffs. Cettire tumbled 19 per cent to $1.18, while Fisher & Paykel fell 7.4 per 
cent to $31.80.
Gold explorers were among the few stocks that closed higher, buoyed by spot gold hitting an all-time high of 
$US2798.41 an ounce on Friday. Regis Resources and Ramelius Resources both rose 2 per cent to $3.10 and 
$2.52 respectively.
Resolute Mining shares dropped 9.6 per cent to 38¢ after it announced chief executive Terry Holohan, who served 
a stint in detention with the Malian junta last year, is stepping down with immediate effect.
Westgold revised down its full-year production guidance after the ramp-up of two major assets progressed slower 
than planned. Shares tumbled 12.4 per cent to $2.26.
Magellan Financial Group posted the biggest loss on the index, tumbling 9.7 per cent to $9.49, extending its losses 
following the departure of veteran infrastructure boss Gerald Stack last week.

Highlight: Javelin Minerals' maiden drilling program at its Coogee project in WA has hit 65g/t gold and 8.5pc 
copper to extend the strike beyond 1km northward and at depth.
Body
Javelin Minerals has struck high-grade gold and copper in a maiden drilling program at its Coogee project in 
Western Australia's Eastern Goldfields, 20 kilometres northeast of Kambalda, hitting grades of up to 65 grams per 
tonne (g/t) gold and 8.5 per cent copper.
The results of the 2921-metre reverse circulation drill program have now pushed the mineralisation strike out past 
one kilometre, significantly extending the existing resource to the north. It also extended the strike at depth 
beneath the existing pit. The company says the results have reinforced Coogee's potential as a high-value mining 
opportunity.
While drilling for extensions to the north-west trend, the bit jagged high-grade mineralisation including 5 metres 
grading 14.22g/t gold from 143m with a 1m chunk running at 65g/t gold and 1.91pc copper from 145m.
Another drillhole beneath the current pit confirmed rich depth extensions with a 10m hit running at 4.55g/t gold from 
91m, including a 1m section grading 38.1g/t gold from 98m.
'This is a fantastic start to our exploration program at Coogee.'
Javelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell
Another hole drilled to the northeast confirmed lateral extensions, striking 7m grading 6.42g/t gold including 7m of 
2.54pc copper from 108m, and a 1m slice of 8.53pc copper from 109m.
To the south of the pit further mineralisation was picked up with another 4m intercept running at 2.22g/t gold from 
80m.
The Coogee resource currently stands at 3.65 million tonnes at 1.08g/t gold for a total of 126,685 ounces of gold, 
alongside 1.01mt at 0.41pc copper, containing 4133 tonnes of the red metal.
Javelin is now reviewing all the data for a potential resource upgrade.
Page 2 of 2
Javelin feasts on multiple high-grade WA gold, copper hits
Sitting in a highly prospective greenstone belt, Coogee is surrounded by significant gold deposits, including Silver 
Lake Resources' 400,000-ounce Salt Creek mine, the Daisy-Milano mine and the Gold Field Ltd-controlled St Ives 
gold camp.
Javelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell said: "This is a fantastic start to our exploration program at 
Coogee. We are focused on Coogee because we saw the potential for it to become a near-term WA brownfields 
exploration success story. The results reveal new high-grade shoots outside the existing resource, both along 
strike and below the existing open pit." 
The current campaign represents the first systematic exploration at Coogee since Ramelius Resources pulled 
stumps in 2014. After mining a 70m open pit Ramelius recovered 147,400 tonnes of material at 4.7g/t gold for 
20,400 ounces of gold.
The ore was processed at the nearby carbon-in-leach Burbanks Mill with metallurgical recoveries at the time 
running to an impressive 96.4pc.
The latest drilling campaign has potentially provided a company-defining moment for Javelin, given it designed an 
exploration program to chase lookalike nearby deposits that may have gone unnoticed.
The same near-mine theory recently massively rewarded neighbouring ASX-listed Spectrum Metals and Spartan 
Resources, both of which found multi-million-dollar gold deposits lurking just north of their old open pits.
Spectrum Metals unearthed a new 355,000-ounce deposit five years ago at Penny North grading 13.8g/t just 300m 
from the old Penny West open pit. Spartan had similar luck jagging a 721,000-ounce gold resource at its Never 
Never project, with grades of 5.85g/t, also just 300m north of its old pit.
With phase one drilling out of the way, Javelin is gearing up for a second phase to test for extensions of the newly 
identified shoots and chase a high-priority magnetic anomaly to the north, dubbed Bullseye, along with a similar 
target 1.5km to the west of the old pit.
The gold prices, currently trading close to all-time highs and just shy of US$2900 (A$4677) per ounce, are proving a 
huge fillip for junior gold miners at the moment. With the improving prospects of a new discovery seemingly just 
around the corner and with easy access to third party milling facilities, Javelin now has the bit well and truly 
between its teeth.

The rapid rise in the gold price towards $US3000 an ounce is surprising even veteran miners of the precious metal 
who had factored in buying support from Donald Trump's return to the White House.
The gold price jumped by more than $US100 an ounce last week to a record high of $US2886.62 ($4604) as 
investors looked for a safe haven amid an escalating tariff war between the US and China, combined with rising 
geopolitical tensions.
Evolution Mining chief executive Lawrie Conway said miners had anticipated higher prices in 2025 as interest rates 
started to fall, but the rate and size of the increase had been remarkable with the Trump factor at play.
"Interest rates starting to come off was going to be a main catalyst for the gold price to go up, and it was always 
expected to be around that $US2600-$US2700, but then you overlay it with everything else that's going on in the 
world," he said.
"People are sitting there with this uncertainty and saying 'I need that safe haven', and that's what's driving it.
"I wouldn't have expected it to be heading towards $US3000 and certainly not at the speed that it has. When we did 
our planning and set our guidance for this financial year, we were probably about $1000-$1200 (in Australian 
dollars) an ounce lower than what the spot price is today. That's how much it's moved in six or seven months â€¦ 
we would never have thought you would get a 25-30 per cent rise in the gold price in such a short time." The 
surging gold price has lit a fire under ASX-listed gold stocks, which rose 7 per cent across the board last week and 
are up 55 per cent over the past year.
Northern Star, the biggest Australian-domiciled gold producer after Newmont's $26bn takeover of Newcrest in 2023, 
is up 18.5 per cent since the start of 2025.
Evolution, the second biggest, is up 23.5 per cent to $5.97, with Bell Potter initiating coverage on Friday with a buy 
rating and 12-month target price of $6.65.

Surging gold price stuns veterans
"Evolution is now passing its capital expenditure peak and we forecast increasing free cashflows, deleveraging of 
the balance sheet and rising dividend distributions supported by Evolution's near-unhedged gold and copper price 
exposure," Bell Potter noted.
Other ASX 200 gold stocks enjoying the ride are Gold Road, with its share price up about 80 per cent in 12 months, 
Ramelius Resources (up 75 per cent), Perseus Mining (up 70 per cent) and US giant Newmont (up 41 per cent via 
its CHESS depositary interests listing).
The World Gold Council's 2024 gold demand trends report, released last week, says annual demand hit a record 
high of 4974 tonnes, driven by strong central bank buying and growth in investment demand. The combination of 
record high gold prices and volumes resulted in the highest ever total value of demand at $US382bn.
The council said central banks continued to buy gold at an eye-watering pace in 2024, with purchases exceeding 
1000 tonnes for the third year in a row.
Market analysts said Beijing had played a big role, with the market boosted by an increase in the People's Bank of 
China's gold holdings and a move to allow insurance funds to invest in gold.
Mr Conway said another big factor had been the volumes traded in New York through the CME Group's Comex.
JPMorgan Chase and other banks said in January that they would deliver gold bullion valued at billions of dollars 
against futures contracts due to expire in February as the threat of tariffs and a major trade war saw US investors 
move to secure gold.
"We knew when (Mr Trump) was coming into office that it would have an impact on the gold price, and we expected 
it to be positive, depending on which way he decided to take his administration," Mr Conway said.
"It was either going to be a fair number of interest rate cuts through this year, or some of the other things that are 
going on around the tariffs and his intervention in terms of the geopolitical situation in Gaza and the Ukraine.
"The most interesting thing for me when you look over the past few weeks is the amount of gold that's been coming 
into the Comex, the US exchange, as particularly retail people have been buying gold. It's like they want some 
protection against the US dollar." On the potential rerating of mining stocks as more investors look for exposure to 
gold, Mr Conway said companies had to show the market the discipline needed to make the most of the higher gold 
price.
"The thing for gold mining companies is to consistently deliver on your guidance and what you've told the market, 
and to have the discipline to put that money into the bank," he said.
"That's where you'll start to get a bit of that reward. If it's not seen to be flying through to the bank balance, I think 
that's where you'll get the investors being a little bit more sceptical.
"That's been an absolute focus of us over the last 12 months because delivering to your plan in a rising metal price 
environment is a real positive, and we've seen that with our cashflow. "What the shareholders want to see is that it's 
actually hitting the bank account. I think if we can demonstrate that as an industry, there will be more support and 
then the rerate would flow on from that."

Australian gold funds are shaping up for a bumper year as mining companies start to capitalise on record prices, 
helping the stocks to finally catch up to the performance of the precious metal.
Portfolio managers were left frustrated last year after a jump in production costs held back ASX-listed gold 
producers from riding the rally in the spot prices to record levels. The VanEck Gold Miners exchange-traded fund 
climbed nearly 20 per cent in 2024 versus a 38 per cent rally for the gold price in Australian dollars.
But easing cost inflation that has plagued the mining sector for the last three years and an ongoing surge in prices 
has seen the trend reverse course. VanEck's Gold Miners ETF is up 17 per cent already this year while the Aussie 
dollar spot price has climbed 6.3 per cent.
Local fund managers are bullish that gold has much further to run after the US dollar price climbed above $US2942 
an ounce for the first time and the Australian dollar gold price breached $4500 an ounce.
Victor Smorgon Partners' Resource Gold Fund returned a chunky 13.3 per cent in January and portfolio manager 
Cameron Judd believes the valuations of ASX gold stocks still don't reflect the outlook for the yellow metal.
"Gold's performance in times of uncertainty or crisis could see it push towards $US3600," Mr Judd said. "Despite 
the strong gold price performance and fundamentals supporting further appreciation, gold miners are trading at 
discounted valuations on the ASX."
Wall Street's biggest banks believe a $US3000 price tag is imminent. Citi said it was possible within the next three 
months, while JPMorgan has a year-end target of $US3150. Bank of America said on Thursday that gold could 
reach $US3500 an ounce if investment demand rises 10 per cent this year.
The unprecedented surge in the gold price has been fuelled by investors seeking safe haven assets as US 
President Donald Trump unleashes aggressive trade and geopolitical policies. There are fears the president will 
accelerate inflation, forcing central banks to raise rates in a way that damages global growth.

Victor Smorgon's top holdings include ASX-listed Vault Minerals and the world's largest gold miner, US-based 
Newmont, which recently acquired Newcrest. The fund also owns Australia's biggest gold miner, Northern Star, 
which agreed to buy rival De Grey in a $5 billion deal.
Mr Judd is also expecting international companies to make further plays for local miners and explorers given the 
cheaper valuations of ASX gold stocks, aided by a weak local currency.
"The lower Australian dollar makes gold miners even cheaper to buy as demand for the precious metal rises," Mr 
Judd said.
Collins St Asset Management is also finally starting to reap the benefits of the catch-up in gold stocks after taking a 
stake in a basket of miners through its flagship value fund nearly two years ago. Founder Michael Goldberg said the 
opportunity was so large that the firm launched a special situations fund in March 2023 focused solely on gold 
stocks.
He believes the sector is finally ready to realise its potential after the Collins St Special Situation Fund surged 13 
per cent, after fees, in January. It's up another 9 per cent so far in February.
"I think 2025 might be the year that we see a rapid catch-up," he said. "Not relying on higher gold prices per se, but 
just a recognition by the market of the earnings potential for those companies, in particular the early-stage 
producers."
Collins St is focused on small and mid-cap companies, which have a lower cost of production, unhedged sales 
books and an ability to ramp up sales and output in the near term. This includes Catalyst Metals, Black Cat, 
Westgold Resources and Ramelius Resources.
Argonaut's Global Gold Fund has also shown signs of a rebound following a disappointing 2024 when the portfolio 
returned just 4.5 per cent net of fees. The fund stormed back in January with an 8.8 per cent return. Its top five 
holdings - Perseus Mining, Evolution Mining, Ora Banda, Ramelius Resources and Ora Gold - represented 55 per 
cent of the portfolio.

West Australian gold miner Westgold Resources is ready to get cracking on the synergies it promised shareholders 
last year when it agreed to a $2.5 billion merger with Toronto-listed Karora Resources.
Street Talk understands Westgold is running a sale process for the Lakewood Mill gold processing facility near 
Kalgoorlie, which Karora bought in July 2022 for $80 million.
The sale is in the advanced stages, with a new owner expected to be announced next month, sources said.
The auction, which is being run in-house, is understood to have fielded interest from several ASX-listed gold juniors 
including the $174 million Astral Resources, which is in the process of acquiring Maximus Resources; Horizon 
Minerals, which has just merged with Poseidon Nickel; and Chinese-backed Norton Gold Fields and Black Cats 
Syndicate. The $20 billion Northern Star owns the nearby land.
Sources said a deal could see Lakewood valued at between $70 million and $95 million, and would be welcomed 
by investors who've watched the shares fall almost 16 per cent this year. Unlike plenty of its listed peers, Westgold 
hasn't benefited from higher gold prices given issues around digesting the Karora acquisition.
Westgold CEO Wayne Bramwell plans to use sale proceeds to increase capacity at its Higginsville mill from 1.6 
million tonnes a year to well above the 2 million mark. A spokesperson declined to comment.
The up-for-grabs Lakewood was acquired by Karora to add an extra million tonnes in capacity for its flagship Beta 
Hunt gold mine, on top of the 1.6 million tonnes capacity at its existing Higginsville mill, amid a production ramp-up.
Sources said since the merger, Westgold has narrowed its focus on fewer but bigger mills, which are fed by fewer 
but bigger mines - in a bid to finetune its cost base against movements in gold pricing. This strategy, at its Beta 
Hunt mine, means processing the ore via the lower-cost and larger Higginsville mill.
Processing a tonne of ore via the Lakewood mill costs $50, while Higginsville can handle the same amount for $30 
or more. Should Westgold expand Higginsville as expected, this cost could be brought down to the $20 range, the 
sources said.

The mooted deal comes after Westgold and rival Ramelius Resources locked horns last year over Karora, as 
revealed by Street Talk. The stoush ended when the $3 billion Ramelius decided to walk away, while Westgold 
progressed and took the keys to Karora in August. But the proceedings also outed the fact that Ramelius had 
approached Westgold with a merger proposal but was knocked back.
A fortnight ago, Westgold shares tanked after the miner cut its 2025 production guidance by as much as one-fifth 
and warned of higher costs after paying big for Karora. It said it would produce between 330,000 ounces and 
350,000 ounces this financial year, down from its previous forecast of between 400,000 ounces and 420,000 
ounces. Costs were also expected to be higher, up from a range of $2000 to $2300 per ounce to $2400 to $2600. 
The miner attributed the production cuts to teething problems in production at its two main mines Beta Hunt near 
Kambalda, and Bluebird-South Junction near Meekatharra.
