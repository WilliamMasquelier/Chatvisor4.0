The oil price was meant to soar after the Middle East hostilities erupted, but the rally quickly fizzled \nbefore a late rally.\nThe bitcoin price was meant to either collapse or hit $US100,000, but did neither.\nLithium was mean to soar on the \"stronger for longer\" battery hype, but went flat as a nightman's hat in the last \nmonths of the year.\nMore predictably, the Ukraine war grinds on - and so does Vladimir Putin, who was meant to have been poisoned or \nhave succumbed to cancer or Parkinson's disease. (Alternatively, he has been dead for some time and his role as \nglobal villain has been fulfilled by a body -double.) The hazards of predicting the unpredictable were reflected in \nyour columnist's forgettable small-cap share tips for 2023, which resulted in some steep losses among industrial \npicks such as small retailers and even some sexy battery metal plays.\nBut we did find a winner in Vysarn (ASX:VYS), which provides pumping and aquifer management systems for the \nmining sector (the stock almost -doubled).\nUranium stock 92 Energy(92E) made a late play to lift our averages by agreeing to merge with Canada's Atha Corp, \na deal that sent 92E shares up 24 per cent. We also lucked it with Breaker Resources, taken over by Ramelius \nResources (RMS) at a 40 per cent premium.\nFollowing hours of due diligence with shady broker types at Melbourne's legendary Mitre Tavern, here are our wild \nstabs at glory for 2024.\nAcusensus (ACE) The camera road enforcement mob won't win any plaudits from libertarian motorists, but if they \ncan catch more mobile phone-using idiots then good on 'em, we say. Acusensus operates transportable mobile \nPage 2 of 3\nThe stocks to watch as new year dawns\nphone and seat belt detection cameras, based on its tech that enables the cameras to peep through tinted \nwindows.\nThe company has contracts with NSW, Queensland and ACT road authorities and recently won its first US phone-\nseatbelt contract in North Carolina. Acusensus cites $154m of contracted revenue since being founded in 2018, \nwith $40m of new and varied deals over the last year.\nManagement is vague about the outlook but promises increased revenue this year based on existing contracts. In \n2022-23 Acusensus posted revenue of $42m, up 46 per cent and a slender $400,000 net profit. The past year has \ngone relatively well, with September quarter revenue of $12.1m (up 22 per cent) and $2.9m of operating cash flow. \nAcusensus shares have lost 80 per cent of their value since listing last January. But they've gained about 16 per \ncent in the December half. The company's $100m market cap is supported by cash of $25m.\nCamplify (CHL) Does this sound familiar? Spend $100,000 on a recreational vehicle (RV) for the road trip of a \nlifetime, only for the jalopy to rust in the driveway.\nThe Airbnb of the campervan world, Camplify intermediates renting deals between van owners and users. Its \npremise is that 800,000 privately owned RVs in Australia and most of them sit in the driveway for 46 weeks of the \nyear. A year ago, Camplify acquired the Berlin-based equivalent PaulCamper, adding Germany, Austria and The \nNetherlands to its operations, which already covered the Britain, Spain and New Zealand. The $47m purchase \ndoubled the size of Camplify's business overnight and bolstered its position in specialist insurance products.\nCamplify recorded total transaction value (TTV) of $146m in the year to June 2023, up 172 per cent. Revenue \nclimbed 133 per cent to $38m, with turnover in NZ surging 1100 per cent. Camplify facilitates 81,933 bookings at an \naverage fee of $1733. Camplify's clip of the ticket last year declined to 26 per cent because of the PaulCamper \npurchase but management hopes to get it back over 30 per cent.\nThe site lists 15,000 RVs here and 18,000 in Europe, a fraction of the market relative to van ownership of 790,000 \nhere and 5.6 million on the continent.\nReckon (RKN) Shareholders in the accounting software veteran thought they had their payday when the company \nsold its accountant practice management arm for $100m in mid-2022 - more than the company's market cap at the \ntime.\nIn recent years Reckon has been overshadowed by the likes of \"cloud\" accounting innovator Xero in its traditional \nSME domain. But the company is migrating customers to its own cloud Reckon One platform, which could enhance \nReckon's value as a takeover target. In the meantime, Reckon has expanded into practice management systems \nfor law firms in the US and Britain, which broker Taylor Collison dubs a \"gem in the making\".\nReckon turned over $28m in the first (June) half, for a $4m net profit and a 2.5c per share dividend. The stock \ntrades on a current year multiple of 11 times and a 4.5 per cent yield, fully franked.\nHighcom (HCL) Formerly known as Xtek, ballistics maker Highcom should be shooting the lights out, but its shares \nhave lost more than a third of their value this year.\nHighcom also produces unmanned drones and body armour and helmets, based on its proprietary tech. It has an \nOhio-based ballistics division and the company is in the throes of moving its Adelaide-based R&D division to the \nUS. Highcom generated a record $98m of revenue and made a record $5.7m profit in the 2022-23 year. The recent \nAGM was replete with talk of new contracts - notably with the local Department of Defence - and an overall $375m \npipeline of opportunities \"at various stages\".\nAs with the company's ballistic vests, why have the shares copped such flak? The answer appears to be that \ncracking the US military establishment is a hard grind and sales have not been as good as expected. Inventories \ncrept up to $25.7m from $16.4m previously. By moving to the US, the company hopes to be seen as an apple-pie \nUS supplier. In fact, it must because by law all kit for the US military must be made there.Page 3 of 3\nThe stocks to watch as new year dawns\nDimerix (DXB) Having toiled away at a kidney drug for years, in October the drug developer hit the jackpot with a \npartnering deal for its yet-to-be-approved treatment for the rare disease focal segmental glomerulo-sclerosis \n(FSGS). Dimerix shares popped more than threefold after the news of the deal with Advanz Pharma Corp. The deal \nonly pertains to European and local regions and does not cover the US, so a follow-up deal is expected. And interim \nresults from the key two-year supporting Phase 3 study are slated for March 2024. The outcome, admittedly, is \nbinary: the drug will either be approved or it won't.\n4D Medical (4DX) The lung imaging house had a bonza end to 2023 on the back of contract wins, approvals and \nreimbursement deals in the US.\nThe final stanza was last month's $38.5m purchase of US med tech outfit Imbio, funded by a $35m placement. A \nleader in lung and heart artificial intelligence, Imbio is generating revenue and will expand 4D's product reach \nbeyond its four approved products. 4D's AI and cloud-based tech enables clinicians to detect fine particles in the \nlungs, especially for the millions of US veterans suffering the effects of toxic open-air \"burn pits\" in combat zones \nsuch as Iraq.\nKogan (KGN) The pure-play online retailer's shares have lost about 80 per cent of their value since peaking at \naround $25 in the peak pandemic times of October 2020. The return to normality left Kogan with excess inventory \nand a suspicion the best times were behind Ruslan Kogan's creation, which includes brands such as Kogan Mobile, \nKogan Travel, Kogan Money and Dick Smith.\nBut Kogan's 2022-23 results showed a decent sixfold bounce in underlying earnings, with the inventory position \n\"rightsized\" to $68m. The company also has no debt and cash of $65m to support its $540m valuation.\nAnalysts are tracking the rollout of the Kogan First loyalty program, which has attracted 401,000 subscribers in its \nearly days.\nDicker Data (DDR) Most tech companies pride themselves on cutting-edge innovation and start-ups wear persistent \nlosses as a badge of pride.\nBut for Dicker Data it's a case of sticking with the simple business of selling other parties' hardware and software \nand making money from it. Over 45 years, founder David Dicker has seen all the momentous advances - such as \nthe advent of the PC and the internet - as well as the IT fads. Over that time, the business has rarely failed to \nincrease year-to-year revenue and profitability.\nAumake (AUK) With China-Australia trade relations recovering from a dismal low, some investors are pondering \nhow to ride the theme beyond going long on Treasury Wine Estates (a key beneficiary of a soon-to-be abolished \nwine tariff).\nThe low-key, Parramatta-based Aumake sells products such as health supplements and wool and skincare items \ninto China, through both online and via physical stores. Having closed its 15 Australian stores during the pandemic, \nAumake is seeking to re-establish its local presence.\nAumake posted perkily higher September quarter receipts of $6.4m with cash outflows of $630,000. The company's \nsub $10m market cap reflects plenty of upside - and oodles of risk.\nTim Boreham is a columnist with Stockhead.\nLoad-Date: December 31, 2023\nEnd of Document",

Inflation, recessions and stifled economic growth have dominated \ninvestment fundamentals, but given the swift increase of interest rates last year, Bosio reckons investors have been \nable to take advantage of cash as a genuine, no-risk investment class paying more than 5 per cent in some \ninstances.\nBut now there's a whiff of lower rates in the air, we may see investors adjust their asset allocation into higher \nrisk/return sectors.\nBeneficiaries? Bosio likes real estate investment trust funds (REITs) and listed investment companies (LICs) that \nmay have a funding cost (debt profile) that will improve in an environment where rates decline.\nAnd because he's dedicated gold bull, Bosio says the gold sector looks perfectly positioned for strength.\nHere are his three picks for the great unwind: Ramelius Resources: \"Strong balance sheet, new projects being \ndeveloped to drive production and acquisitive team/management who have executed a consistent strategy to \nacquire targets whereby they can leverage discovery success and production ounces.\" WAM Capital: WAM is a \nlisted investment company with a focus on small to medium-sized businesses and a large, diversified portfolio.\n\"Weak performance in the current environment has resulted in a lower share price. However, the yield has been \nhistorically high and a significant attraction to income-focused investors,\" Bosio says.\nCenturia Capital: An REIT with various listed alternatives including office and industrial companies. For Bosio, \nCenturia is a quality small-cap property company with a strong track record of acquiring and managing assets.\nBroker upgrades Ord Minnett likes the look of Dropsuite. Founded in Singapore in 2011, Dropsuite is a cloud-based \nsoftware platform offering back-up, archiving and recovery solutions for businesses.\nPage 2 of 2\nHow to cash in as risk returns\nThe company specialises in protecting critical data used by Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, QuickBooks and \nothers. Its products are distributed via a network of about 4000 IT reseller partners globally.\nAt the Inspire Conference 2023 in August, it copped a bit of a hit when Microsoft provided a first look at its 365 \nBackup and Archive solution. Dropsuite's price fell 22 per cent on the day and has not recovered since.\nOrd Minnett was not convinced. \"Based on our work and discussions with industry participants, we conclude that \nfears of any existential risk to DSE's business are overblown. Accordingly, we believe the market's scepticism is \nproviding an opportunity.\" Ords has initiated a buy rating on the stock with a price target of 33c, against about 28c \nat present.\nOrd Minnett believes DSE operates at the intersection of three mega-trends - the rise of cybercrime, the migration \nof on-premise hosting to the cloud, and managed service provider industry growth.\nIt is also impressed with the fact DSE management has built a $150m business on just $43m of outside capital (of \nwhich only about $18m has been spent), and delivered positive free cash flow in each of the past six quarters.\nOver at Taylor Collison, IPD Groupis on the radar.A distributor of electrical infrastructure products to major \nconstruction and renewables projects nationwide, IPD offers a \"picks and shovel\" exposure to the booming \nelectrical sector without taking on individual project or contract risks common to contractors and other listed players.\nThis is an industry that's booming, and Taylor Collison reckons there's a strong argument we are still in the early \nstages of a major infrastructure project upswing.\nIt's put a 12-month price target of $4.80 on IPD, versus a price of about $4.69 this week. \"Their capital allocation \nrecord is excellent, and there's a long runway to deploy capital to match the market leader's offering,\" it says.\nLoad-Date: January 12, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Please go ahead.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Travis. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to dial into Ramelius' December 2023 \nquarterly conference call. I'm joined this morning for the first time in a speaking role that is by acting CFO, Ben \nRingrose, who will provide some detail on the quarterly financials after I've run through the highlights.\nAs usual, there will be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions before we finish up the call. As you will have \nseen this morning we reported quarterly gold reduction of 68,524 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of AUD1,837 \nper ounce which is towards the upper end of our quarterly guidance of 60,000 to 70,000 ounces, and also in line \nwith internal forecasts that has production increasing over the course of the financial year. The increase in the \nDecember quarter was primarily attributable to a greater contribution from Penny underground and also mining at \nthe Symes' open-pit operation ramping up.\nAs I said, Ben will delve into the financials further, but I wanted to highlight upfront that the increase in production, \nwe saw a similar trend with cash generation. Operating cash flow was 68 million with underlying free cash flow \ntotaling 45.7 million, our best performance on that front for several years. Further, we anticipate strong cash flows \nwill continue over the rest of the financial year and beyond. Including the December quarter contribution, first half \nproduction totaled 12447 ounces, at an all-in sustaining cost of just under $1,900 an ounce, again ahead of our \ninternal budgets and at the upper end of guidance.\nYou may have noticed we have upgraded second half guidance to 140,000 to 155,000 ounces and consequently \nfull year guidance for this financial year has also increased to 265,000 to 280,000 ounces. By way of reminder, \noriginal guidance was 250,000 to 275,000 ounces. In terms of all-in sustaining costs, the guidance range in the \nsecond half is AUD1700 to AUD1800, which demonstrates a continuing downward trend and results in full year all-\nin sustaining costs for FY24 of AUD1750 to AUD1850. This compared to our original all-in sustaining cost guidance \nof AUD1550 to AUD 1750 with the higher costs attributable to CV01 conveyor appears carried out at Mt Magnet in \nthe quarter, which I'll expand on shortly and also an increased production contribution from Edna May, which is the \nhigher cost production hub of the two.\nThe split in production from our two houses were relatively even this quarter with Mt Magnet producing just over \n35,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of AUD1,668 and Edna May also producing just over 33,000 ounces as \nan all-in sustaining cost up to over AUD2,000 per ounce. That breakdown gives an insight into the real impact of \nPenny on costs at Mt Magnet. Although it should be noted that the Edna May all-in sustaining figure does include a \nreasonably significant non-cash component, which relates to the drawdown of existing stockpiles. I'll let Ben to \nexplain the actual unit cost detail later.\nDuring the quarter, a total of 36,829 tonnes at 12.39 grams per tonne for 14,296 recoverable ounces was hauled \nfrom Penny to Mt Magnet. At Penny with multiple stoping areas becoming available, production is expected to \nincrease significantly in the second half. On the CV01, mill throughput at Mt Magnet was impacted by repairs to the \nmain conveyor structure, which goes from the crusher to the course or stockpile referred to as CV01. They put it out \nof action for approximately nine weeks. We were however able to maintain plant feed, albeit at a slightly lower rate \nthrough the use of a mobile crushing solution. Thankfully, the conveyer outage didn't prevent us from meeting \nproduction targets, as the site team and external contractors managed the situation very well, but we did incur some \nextra costs, both sustaining capital for the repairs and operating costs associated with the mobile crushing and \nhaulage operation, which added almost AUD180 per ounce to Mt Magnet's quarterly all-in sustaining costs. The \nrepairs were completed by mid-December and we have reviewed our structural integrity regime, and have taken \nsteps to reduce the likelihood of similar unplanned repairs being required elsewhere in the plant in the future.\nThe quarter saw completion of mining operations in Marda, with rehab activities now being carried out while \nremaining stockpiles have been hauled to Edna May. At the end of the period, there was almost 450,000 tonnes \ngrading 1.71 grams per tonne in stockpiles at Marda. A similar situation is playing out at Tampia where mining \noperations ceased in the middle of last year, and there we have just over 635,000 tonnes at a grade near to 1.5 \ngrams per tonne in stockpiles at the end of the quarter.Page 3 of 8\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\nOn to exploration; highlights in the quarter include results from resource definition work undertaken at Eridanus \ntargeting high-grade mineralization for potential underground mining below and outside their plant of a current open \npit. Among the better intercepts from the [Indiscernible] RC program with 13 meters at 10.4, 12 meters at 12.8, and \n10 meters at 18.1. Important to note, all significantly better grades than what we're seeing at depths previously at \nEridanus.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nAt Galaxy underground diamond drilling targeting the Mars ore body produced results including two meters at 28.9 \nand four meters at 17.8, whilst diamond drilling at the Bombora deposit, part of the Roe Project acquired from \nBreaker Resources produced first results, which included 4.5 meters at 18.7 and 4.2 meters at 11.1, which were \nfrom the Tura underground Lode.\nLastly, in terms of the highlights, we wrapped up the acquisition of Musgrave Minerals in October having reached \nthe compulsory acquisition threshold of 90% acceptances. Infill and extensional diamond and RC drilling is \nunderway at the key project targeting the high-grade Break of Day resource, but also the nearby Waratah \nProspect. We've only received limited results at this stage. Further information on the expiration program, there's \nplenty of detail in the quarterly itself.\nNow that covers the highlights for me. So I'll now hand over to Ben.\nBen Ringrose\nThank you, Mark, and it's a pleasure to be here with you all today. December quarter was indeed a very strong one \nfinancially for Ramelius with sales revenue of 194.5 million and an associated underlying free cash flow of 47.5 \nmillion, which is after growth and exploration investment. On both metrics, the December quarter was our best since \nJune 2020. During the quarter we sold just over 68,000 ounces at an average realized gold price of AUD2,855 an \nounce, which includes a mix of spot and committed forward sales.\nAs Mark mentioned, the all-in sustaining costs for the December quarter was AUD1,837 per ounce. Pleasingly both \nproduction centers reported a low all-in sustaining cost than the prior quarter. At Mt Magnet, 8% reduction in all-in \nsustaining costs was achieved despite the increased costs associated with the one-off CV01 repairs, which, as a \nreminder, added AUD179 per announced to the Mt Magnet all-in sustaining costs for the quarter. Impact of Penny is \nevident here along with the increased tonnages and grades from Mt Magnet's own open pit operations.\nMoving on to Edna May, the improved all-in sustaining costs was the result of increased throughput and grades, \nmost notably the introduction of the high-grade ore from Symes'. Whilst Edna May is reporting a higher all-in \nsustaining costs than Mt Magnet, it is important to note that this includes a AUD227 per ounce non-cash charge for \nthe drawdown of existing Tampia stockpiles. This non-cash component of the Edna May all-in sustaining costs will \nincrease over the second half of FY24, as the existing Tampia, Marda and Symes' stockpiles continue to be drilling \ndown and monetized.\nThe resulting operating cash flow from the business was AUD68 million, from which AUD20.9 million was invested \nin growth capital exploration and resource definition. The quarter also saw Ramelius return AUD17.3 million in \ncash to shareholders by our via FY23 dividend paid in October 2023, as well as complete the Musgrave Minerals \nacquisition with a final consideration payment of AUD2.1 million. AUD10.5 million investment in growth capital for \nthe quarter mainly related to the Galaxy underground mine and the AUD10.4 million spent on exploration and \nresource definition in the quarter focused on the Rebecca and Roe Gold Project and the recently acquired Cue \nGold Project. Both capital and exploration spent is in line with our forecast and we have maintained our full-year \nguidance on capital and project development expenditure of AUD50 million to AUD60 million and exploration and \nresource definition expenditure of AUD30 [Phonetic] million.\nThe closing cash and gold position of AUD281.8 million was our best on record leaving Ramelius in a very healthy \nfinancial position. Further to this, a total of AUD9.2 million was received from the -- was due from the ATO in \nDecember. However, the late payment of this by the ATO meant these funds were only received by Ramelius in Page 4 of 8\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\nthe first week of January. Notionally, including this, the reported cash and gold at 31 December would have been \nAUD291 million. In addition to the strong cash and gold position is our AUD100 million debt facility, which remains \nin place and undrawn.\nThe Aussie dollar spot price increased 5% over the December quarter, finishing at just under AUD3,030 an ounce. \nIn fact, the Aussie dollar gold price has had a daily closing price above AUD3,000 every day since the 12th of \nOctober 2023, a trend that is continuing into the March 2024 quarter. What is even more encouraging about this is \nthat this AUD3,000 plus gold price was maintained despite the strengthening Aussie dollar pointing to a \nfundamental increase in the US dollar gold value.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to gradually rundown our fixed price contracts delivering 30,000 ounces into \nmaturing contracts and replacing 24,000 of these at an average price of AUD3,259 an ounce. At the end of the \nquarter, forward gold sales consisted of 192,000 ounces at an average price of AUD2,918 an ounce over the period \nJanuary 2024 to June 2026. As you will note, our committed ounces have decreased over the financial year and we \nexpect this trend to continue for the remainder of FY24. A disciplined hedge book maintenance over the past 12 \nmonths leaves the book in a very healthy position.\nLastly to note on gold sales is that with the increased production forecasted for H2, our exposure to the spot price \nwill increase in the second half of FY24.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nWith that I'll now hand back to Mark.\nMark Zeptner\nThanks Ben. Travis, if we could please open the line up for questions.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Hayden Bairstow from Argonaut. Please go \nahead.\nHayden Bairstow\nHi, good morning guys. Pretty impressive results at Magnet mining wise. I mean just get a field of view to the \nsecond half and obviously you push guidance a bit higher about Edna May, I mean despite that mill shut down, and \nwhat -- how are we looking second half on ounces into Magnet, looks like it's going to be a pretty sizable increase.\nMark Zeptner\nYeah. Good morning, Hayden. It's Mark. I don't have the numbers off top my head but it's driven obviously by \nincreases at Penny combined with the gradual ramp up at Galaxy but probably more importantly at Magnet is \nreducing strip ratio at Eridanus and improving grades at depth. We're saying that back into it as there was a bit of a \nlower grade section that we mined through for 12 months, but we're back into much better grades at Eridanus. So \nthe combination of those three things leads to a very strong second half at Magnet. I'm not sure if you've got the \nnumbers Ben but I won't put you on the spot with that. But yeah, we can provide some numbers Hayden.\nHayden Bairstow\nYeah, okay. And just on -- I guess more beyond 2025, just given you locking in hedging, almost 3300 an ounce and \nthen does that start to make the stage very cut back at Magnet look like a more attractive option for you guys to sort \nof deliver to production decline there?\nMark ZeptnerPage 5 of 8\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\nPotentially, you're a little bit ahead of where we're focused on right at the moment. We will be putting out this \nquarter a new Mt Magnet mine plan and then probably turning our attention to see sort of 12 months on from when \nwe made the decision to defer stage three where we stand. We're obviously seeing some things in the market labor \nwise that are starting to ease. Unfortunately, that's brought about by some closures of operations, but we think, in a \ncouple of months time, we will dust that off and see where we're at, Hayden.\nHayden Bairstow\nAnd the Magnet mine plan, that obviously incorporates all the key stuff, I presume, is that going to come with an \nupgrade to that -- or an update to that three year guidance?\nMark Zeptner\nYeah, the idea with the Mt Magnet mine plan is obviously, including any Penny extensions, which we've already \nflagged, the Q project in its entirety and then obviously, the portfolio of projects at Mt Magnet itself, including \n[Indiscernible] et cetera. There's a whole list of names there, so everything that goes into Mt Magnet out for the \nforeseeable future.\nHayden Bairstow\nAlright. Perfectly alluded. Thanks, guys.\nMark Zeptner\nThanks, Hayden.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Alex Barkley from RBC. Please go ahead.\nAlex Barkley\nThanks. Good morning Mark and Ben. Question on that strong Edna May production this year. Is that mostly \naround accelerated mining and haulage? Does that mean, it might get pulled forward from FY25 or is there some \nother component to the strong result this year? Thanks.\nMark Zeptner\nIt is Mark again. Alex, good morning. Stronger performance out of the underground definitely. Since we've \naddressed the water issues, which were prominent mid-to-late last year, the team out there has really hit some \ndecent production numbers. It's a small underground, but they are pushing towards 30,000 ton a month there. So \nthat may bring forward some production there into 2024. The haulage, I think, has been pretty consistent. The \nramping up and the inclusion of Symes' sort of has added to that. And I think some of the Symes' grades are \nprobably a little better than we might have expected in certain areas of the pit as well. So I don't think we're robbing \nPeter to pay Paul at the Edna May. I think it's better performance, the underground with better grades, and sort of \nconsistent haulage like in summer.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nAlex Barkley\nOkay. That's very helpful. Thanks very much, guys.\nMark Zeptner\nThanks, Alex.Page 6 of 8\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Dr. Richard Hatch from Topwheel [Phonetic]. \nPlease go ahead.\nRichard Hatch\nHello, Mark, and Ben. Happy New Year to you and thanks for another great performance. I thought a brilliant \nperformance, particularly with the conveyor belt problems. Obviously, I had a question about it, and may everybody \ndoes about what happens next, but I'll leave that one alone. One thing I remember talking about, I think last time \nwas your hedging of oil and I see you have hedged 5 million liters. I just wondered, how does that 0.991 price \nhedge diesel compare -- beware, I won't judge you because I'm all for hedging for insurance, but how does it \ncompare with current price?\nBen Ringrose\nHi, Richard, and thanks for the question. It's Ben here. We put that diesel hedging program in place probably 12 \nmonths ago, and it's served us quite well, I guess over the last 12 months and continue to do so and we have had \nsome cash returned on those hedges, which is good. That 91 cents, the price we're paying today is 98 cents, so it's \nmarginally in the money. It has been more in the money over the past 12 months but, yeah, it is getting closer.\nMark Zeptner\nIt's the rebated figure to have [Multiple Speakers].\nBen Ringrose\nThat's right, yeah.\nMark Zeptner\nYeah, it is not the price you see at the service station.\nBen Ringrose\nYeah.\nRichard Hatch\nNow I understand that. Well, again, congratulations. That's an interesting area for you to go into but well done being \nwinners again. Anyway, thanks for all you've done.\nMark Zeptner\nThanks, Richard.\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Ashley Chen from shareholder. Please go ahead.\nAshley Chen\nHi, Mark. Hi, Ben. Thanks again for a nice quarter and your hard work for it. I just have a question on the -- also on \nthe diesel hedging strategy. Can you give some more details on your thinking now for the next two, three, four years \nin regards to hedging? I can see production -- if production were to be 550,000 over two years, your current hedge \nbook is about 33% hedged? Are you expecting to reduce that to 25%, 20%? That is my first question. And second \nquestion are something completely different. As you probably know, the government has put a positive duty on \nemployers to prevent harassment, sexual harassment, at work and the Australian Human Rights Commission Page 7 of 8\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\nprobably spot the iron ore industry, Rio Tinto, BHP, and its sights at the moment, but eventually you'll come around \nto the gold industry. What programs or what anti-harassment programs Ramelius Resources is planning to \nimplementing or planning to implement over the next couple of years?\nBen Ringrose\nThanks, Ashley. I will take those ones. It's Ben. In terms of hedging policy, I think Tim Manners late last year \nreported that the Board is in the process of reviewing our policy and if there are any changes -- obviously, there's \nnot a lot of Board meetings through December, January, but if there is any change, then we'll obviously inform the \nmarket on that one. In the meantime, we are gradually running off our book, as we have been for some time. In \nterms of our duty to prevent harassment, it's not something that we've waited to be told that we should look at it or \nare we planning to. We've been reasonably proactive in that area. When people start with the company, they run \nthrough workplace behavior training, we have a whistleblower line. I think a lot of the goldies have a lot of these \nthings in place, we've assessed our sites for the safety and security, and we're basically taking a no tolerance \napproach to those who crossed the line. Unfortunately, there've been a few cases and those people are no longer \nworking for us or the contractors associated with that. So we've done a lot in that area and we continue to try to \nimprove.\nAshley Chen\nThank you.\nBen Ringrose\nThanks, Ashley.\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for a moment to allow parties to enter the queue. The next question \ncomes from Steven Goranson [Phonetic] from RE Funds Management. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Participant\nHi, guys. Just a quick question around Musgrave. What have you seen to date since the acquisition and when do \nyou expect to -- for us to start thinking about when we should be seeing Musgrave coming through the mill?\nMark Zeptner\nThanks for the question, Steve. I will answer that. It's Mark. Look, what we're saying is that the team at Musgrave \ndid an excellent job in terms of drilling the ore body out and preparing resources and mine plans that are pretty \nclose to production ready. Our optimizations and reruns of [Indiscernible] are very similar and very close, which is \nalways company. It's not what you'll always find, I have to add. In terms of production, we hope to be developing in \nthe second half of this calendar year with -- I'd say, or first or sort of September, August, September, obviously \nramping up through that period. So perhaps, I sent it earlier than some expect. We've already submitted our mining \nproposal and we're on like the third back and forwards with the department on that. So assuming we get approvals \nprior to June, then we should be ready to go from July onwards.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nUnidentified Participant\nThat's an great sign. Thanks very much for that, Mark.\nMark Zeptner\nThanks, Steve.Page 8 of 8\nRamelius Resources Limited ( RMLRF ) December 2023 Quarterly Conference Call Transcript\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Andrew Bowler from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Bowler\nHello, gents. Quick one from me. Obviously, handy tax refund post quarter end. Just wondering if you're expecting \nany more over the remainder of the financial year or is that what you're expecting to say?\nBen Ringrose\nHi, Andrew. It's Ben here, I'll take that one. No, that tax refund related to the 2023 tax term, it is a one-off, I guess, \nand we don't expect that to be a recurring throughout the financial year.\nAndrew Bowler\nAlright. Thanks.\nBen Ringrose\nThanks, Andrew.\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, we're showing no further questions. I'll hand the conference back to Mark for closing \nremarks.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Travis. I'd just like to make two points to wrap up. Ramelius is one of the few Aussie gold producers \nactually upgrading guidance and therefore we are expecting to deliver a very strong cash flows in the second half of \nFY24. I mean, as already mentioned, we are on track to deliver our new Mt Magnet mine plan this current quarter, \nwhich promises to include Penny, Cue, as well as all the portfolio of projects at Mt Magnet itself. Thank you for \nlistening in this morning. Enjoy the rest of your day.\nLoad-Date: January 30, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The JV is operated by Cyprium, who owns 80% of the rights to base \nmetals with 20% owned by Ramelius.\nCyprium is encouraged by a drill intercept of 15 metres at 3.26% copper, 0.70 g/t gold, 7.4 g/t silver and 151ppm \ncobalt from 70 metres downhole in drill hole 24CURC004.\nThis included a 7-metre intercept at 5.04% copper, 0.81 g/t gold, 11.4 g/t silver, 197ppm cobalt and 0.11% nickel \nfrom a depth of 71 metres.  \nA second intercept in that drill hole returned 3 metres at 1.09% copper and 0.44 g/t gold from 108 metres, including \n1 metre at 2.54% copper and 1.19 g/t gold from 109 metres. \nCyprium notes that the mineralisation remains open at depth and along strike in both directions within a lightly \ntested copper soil anomaly that extends for 2.5 kilometres along strike.\n\"Potential for economic orebody\"\nPage 2 of 3\nCyprium Metals makes shallow high-grade copper discovery at Cue JV's Heeler prospect\nCyprium executive chairman Matt Fifield said: \"While the company remains focused on delivering a robust plan for \nNifty [copper project], we continue to maintain our outstanding portfolio of exploration assets.\n\"This new Heeler discovery is a great reminder of the prospective value within the company's earlier-stage assets in \nthe Paterson and Murchison provinces.\n\"Our exploration team targeted our limited drilling budget in the Murchison around the most prospective areas and \nhit outstanding grade that shows potential for an economic orebody. It's exciting to have an unexpected shallow \nhigh-grade hit show up like this.\n\"With Nifty, Maroochydore, our Murchison portfolio and our Paterson JV with IGO, Cyprium has some of the best \nassets and exploration ground in Australia to deliver into the growing global requirements for copper.\"\nUnderexplored base metals potential\n\"With Heeler, Cyprium continues to build on its copper-gold resource inventory in the Murchison,\" said Cyprium \nCOO Milan Jerkovic.\n\"We have 203,000 tonnes of copper resource and 153,0000 ounces of gold (100% basis) at the nearby Hollandaire \nand Nanadie Well deposits and follow-up work around Heeler may well bring additional grade and scale into our \nportfolio.\n\"There are assays from this program outstanding, but we're pleased to have hit shallow high-grade mineralisation.\"\nCyprium geologist Mark Styles added: \"The Cue region is an area that's known for its gold deposits but hasn't been \nwell explored for its base metals potential.\n\"At Heeler, for example, we were attracted by the large, lightly tested +100ppm copper soil anomaly up to 400 \nmetres wide and 2.5 kilometres long, historic shallow drill results with 0.3% copper in the core of the soil anomaly \nand a coincident geophysical magnetic high. \n\"These features are suggestive of a mafic-ultramafic association with base metal mineralisation in a style distinct \nfrom the felsic-hosted Hollandaire copper-gold deposit located 10 kilometres northeast of Heeler.\"\n\"We drilled four holes in our program focusing on Heeler, following up on work in 2022. So far we have assays back \nfrom a single drillhole completed in our January 2024 program. \n\"The 24CURC004 intercept showed stacked shallow sulphide mineralisation that was visible in the drill chips. We \nalso hit sulphides in the three other holes but we're expecting lower tenor assay results, <1% copper.\" \nCyprium geologist Peter van Luyt said: \"As we've looked harder at the mineralisation and the assays, this hole \nsuggests a mafic-ultramafic orthomagmatic nickel-copper-cobalt type that would be similar to a Nova-Bollinger style \ndeposit. When we have the additional assays, we will be in a position to plan follow-up work.\" \n2024 drill holes\nThe following images show the location of the four 2024 drill holes and a preliminary conceptual cross-section \nbased on assays and visual interpretation. Drill hole 24CURC003 intersected lithologies and mineralisation similar \nto 24CURC004 but with lower levels of visible chalcopyrite (copper iron sulphide). \nDrill holes 24CURC001 and 24CURC002 were drilled towards the southern end of the Heeler anomaly and \nintersected traces of chalcopyrite over wide intervals beneath the weathered carapace in lithologies similar to the \nHeeler host rocks. \nAssay results for these three drill holes are pending.Page 3 of 3\nCyprium Metals makes shallow high-grade copper discovery at Cue JV's Heeler prospect\nLoad-Date: February 19, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Karora \nwill bring new production hubs with mills, and could help the company consolidate its position in the region. A \nRamelius spokesperson declined to comment.\nKarora's portfolio, located 60 kilometres from Kalgoorlie, includes 100 per cent ownership of the Beta Hunt mine, \nHigginsville gold operations and Spargos gold mine. It is expected to produce 170,000 to 195,000 ounces gold in \n2024. By contrast, Ramelius has told shareholders it would hit 272,500 ounces production this financial year.\nZeptner and his team are chasing the acquisition after a period of solid performance and perky gold prices. \nRamelius shares have risen nearly 48 per cent in the past year, giving it a $1.8 billion market capitalisation and a \nstrong balance sheet.\nIn particular, it has benefited from high-grade Penny ore being fed into the Mt Magnet Mill. Cash and gold reserves \nare expected to hit $400 million by year-end, while about $100 million in undrawn debt would further boost its \nliquidity profile.\nRamelius reported a 14 per cent increase in revenue to $348.5 million at its half-year results on February 20. \nEBITDA shot up 39 per cent to $140.2 million, thanks to a 12 per cent jump in realised gold price.\nRamelius' biggest asset is the Mt Magnet production centre, which it started building via a $40 million acquisition in \n2010. Now, 14 years on, Mt Magnet speaks for 62 per cent of the group's gold reserves.\nWhen combined with the Vivien gold deposit and Penny gold mine, it is 53 per cent of the total net present value, \naccording to Macquarie Capital analysts. Production is expected to reduce significantly by the 2029 financial year.\nPage 2 of 2\nRamelius in exclusive talks to buy Canada-listed gold miner; Street Talk\nBut the more pressing matter for Zeptner has been finding a replacement for Edna May, which it bought from \nEvolution Mining in 2017. It is now just 2 per cent of the reserves, with a significant production slump ahead in the \n2025 financial year.\nOther bets like the Rebecca project are still a long way from spitting out cash.\nPut that all together, and it's not surprising management has been on the prowl for acquisitions.\nSources told this column logical targets had included Spartan Resources as well as Northern Star's Carosue Dam \ngold mine. However, the former isn't operational, while the latter may have been hard to prise from its current \nowner.\nThe mooted acquisition at Karora comes after Ramelius acquired ASX-listed gold junior Musgrave Minerals in \nSeptember.\nLoad-Date: March 10, 2024\nEnd of Document",

An odd assortment of legal offices, pawnbrokers and \nimmigration agents fill in the gaps.\n\"There's probably more value in this building than any other in Australia,\" a casual conversation with a gold seller \nbehind the counter at Bullion Now, on the sixth floor, reveals. \"It's staggering.\"\nThe precious metal he is selling, bullion, is on a record run. This week, it crashed through a historic high of \n$US2200 ($3325) an ounce. Bullion is pure gold, different from 24-carat or 18-carat gold which has other alloys \nadded to strengthen if for jewellery making, diminishing its value.\nGold's almost daily ascent since mid-February has left many analysts and other market watchers looking for \nexplanations, as there is no clear catalyst for the rally.\nGold tends to spike in response to globe-shaking geopolitical or economic events, but nothing earth-shattering has \nhappened in the past few months to justify the latest surge.\nBut people are cashing in, says Michael Pepper, Bullion Now's owner. He, and other traders in the city's golden \ntower, say record high prices are prompting customers to sell rather than buy.\nPage 2 of 4\n'Speculate in bitcoin, hoard gold': Precious metal's value soars\n\"We're seeing a large number of sell backs coming through the doors at the moment. People are diversifying into \nproperty and cryptocurrencies,\" Pepper says.\nThe peaking prices are also weighing on purchasers. Custom has fallen 10 per cent to 20 per cent. \"I would also \nargue that the size of purchases has shrunk a little bit as well,\" he says.\nIn a small two-person partitioned booth on the floor above, Michael Kay, from Melbourne Gold Company, is also \nbuying more than he is selling.\n\"There wasn't much selling during COVID, although people were cashed up,\" Kay says. \"People were concerned, \nscared and had the money to buy gold.\" Now they want to exit and get Bitcoin instead. \"People like to speculate in \nBitcoin and hoard their wealth in gold.\"\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrency's volatility far outpaces gold's movements.\nBitcoin plunged from a peak of about $87,000 in November 2021 to below $24,500 two years later, before soaring \nto its current record high near $103,000. Gold, by contrast, moved from $US1500 to $US2200 over the same \ntimeframe.\nThe gold traders' clientele range from self-managed super funds owners, they often buy the largest sums, to people \nselling homes who want to transfer their equity into gold.\nFarmers, who understand of commodity markets, are also frequent buyers, as are migrants from Asia, India and \nEast Europe, the traders say.\n\"Most people do keep it under the bed, so to speak, or leave it here,\" Kay says, noting that many dealers provide \nsecure storage for a fee. \"People are maybe questioning the high price. Is it going to remain here? Will it keep \ngoing? I'm pretty bullish. Gold always shines with inflation,\" he says.\nPrices didn't have to move far before they hit record territory.\nGold has been trading for months at around the $US2000 mark. That level was viewed by many as stratospheric \njust a few years ago, but the metal pushed through the barrier in 2020 as the pandemic stormed across the globe.\nUnusually, prices are trading at elevated levels despite sky-high interest rates that are typically bad for gold, which \ndoesn't pay interest, and in defiance of a strong US dollar, which tends to keep the price of gold lower and more \ncontrolled.\nHowever, big geopolitical factors are underpinning the precious metal's stellar performance: Speculation over the \nUS Federal Reserve's pivot to looser monetary policy, Israel's unravelling Gaza crisis, the disastrous Russia and \nUkraine war, and buying by central banks, led by China, are helping spur momentum.\nLink to Image\nTrevor Collens\nGold is frequently viewed as an inflationary hedge.\n\"The reality is gold is a hedge against uncertainty. Over the last few years, that uncertainty is creeping in across a \nmyriad of factors,\" says Cameron Alexander, general manager of commercial development at The Perth Mint, one \nof the world's biggest gold refineries and mints.\n\"A combination of banking crisis, economic concerns, and geopolitical factors are driving investors to gold,\" \nCameron maintains.\nFormer US President Donald Trump's trade war with China, and the weaponizations of the US dollar following the \nWest's freeze of Russia's offshore assets, incentivised some wary central banks to buy heavily.Page 3 of 4\n'Speculate in bitcoin, hoard gold': Precious metal's value soars\nYoutube link\n\"China, over the last couple of years, has been very aggressive in building their own reserve, diversifying and \nmoving away from the US dollar,\" Cameron said. They are not alone. Other South East Asian bankers are doing the \nsame, albeit on a much smaller scale.\nThe World Gold Council's Gold Demand Trends January report shows the central bank buying streak continues at a \n\"blistering\" rate. Demand reached 1037 tonnes last year - the second-highest on record and down just 45 tonnes on \nthe previous year, it said.\nMichael Scantlebury, a resource analyst at Perth-based ASX listed broker and investment bank Euroz Hartleys, \nsays the share price of Australia's gold producing miners and ASX-listed gold-focused exchange traded funds are \nlagging gold's soaring price.\n\"It doesn't make any sense, right? We aren't too surprised, given the lack of interest over the last three years in the \ngold equities,\" he says.\n'We're very confident that this gold price increase will convert to proper margin and proper cash flow.'\nMichael Scantlebury, from investment bank Euroz Hartleys\nGold's last big run started after the pandemic's mayhem primed the world's latest inflationary surge, but investors \nwho expected gold miners' profit margins to follow the gold price upwards were disappointed.\n\"Cost inflation for gold producers basically squeezed that margin to the point where gold producers were breaking \neven, essentially, despite the gold price increases,\" Scantlebury says.\nGold equities in Australia underperformed as a result, and investors still remain sceptical. However, Scantlebury \nsays discussions with mining contractors and industry suppliers shows pressures are easing, be it wage rises or \nfuel prices.\n\"The rate of cost inflation has definitely come off, so we're very confident that this gold price increase will convert to \nproper margin and proper cash flow,\" he says.\nThat's a shift Euroz Hartleys expects to show up in the March quarterly reports of miners like Northern Star \nResources, Evolution, Ramelius, Perseus, West African and Gold Road Resources. Euroz Hartleys would expect \ninvestors to then focus on smaller producers and explorers after a re-rate in these larger miners occurs.\n\"Assuming the gold price stays equal, gold producers in Australia should definitely re-rate,\" Scantlebury says.\nANZ commodity strategists Daniel Hynes and Soni Kumari said gold's latest rally isn't being derailed by the \nmarket's expectation that the Fed may push back expected cuts in interest rates, delaying a move that would signal \nit has US inflation under control.\n\"While speculators have increased their bullish bets recently, positions are not matching the intensity of the latest \nprice rally. Moreover, disinvestment in gold-backed exchange-traded funds has been continuing,\" they said in a \nresearch note last week.\n\"A pull-back in gold prices is likely in the short term, as [the] recent rally has surpassed macroeconomic and \ngeopolitical developments,\" they maintain.\nAt Bullion Now, Pepper also anticipates things to calm down. \"We're expecting a pullback in the shorter-term,\" he \nsays. But there will always be people buying gold as a value store, and for its portability, he says.\nA kilo gold bar about the size of a mobile phone is now worth about $116,000, Pepper says. \"I can put that in my \npocket, travel to London and get for the same for it in the UK as what I paid in Australia.

So, gold is very much a contrarian investment in the current market.\" Mr Judd said \nasset allocation to gold was currently running at les than half its historical long-term average.\n\"This shows there is significant gold demand potential which could manifest into real demand should the sentiment \nof Western investors towards gold turn positive,\" Mr Judd said.\n\"In our view, this is likely to occur when there is more conviction that central banks will ease monetary policy.\" Citi \nhas also rerated its short and midterm gold price forecasts to $US2200 an ounce and $US2300 an ounce \nrespectively, against $US2165 an ounce currently.\n\"We would favour owning gold - both outright and against silver - heading into a sluggish GDP and rate cut \nenvironment,\" Citi said in a note to clients.\nPage 2 of 2\nThree winners singled out from extended gold rush - DATA ROOM\n\"Gold prices should also be supported by US dollar weakness on the eventual Fed pivot and strong physical \ndemand.\" Ramelius on Tuesday said it was \"well-placed to execute quickly on transactions\" should they present \nthemselves, \"utilising reliable due diligence methodology with a match-fit team\".\nIt pointed to seven assets it has bought and integrated over the past six years as proof of this. Red 5 is the largest \nholding in The Victor Smorgon Partners Resources Gold Fund, and Mr Judd said its recent merger with Silverlake \nResources and entry into the ASX 200 was likely to underpin a rerating in the stock.\nLoad-Date: March 26, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The dreaded \ntrifecta!\nAt its essence, the company's earnings should have infrastructure-like qualities, with the majority of earnings from \noperating public and private sector transportation services which are contracted and relatively stable, while having \ninflation protection on costs.\nIt is yet to hit full operating cadence post the disruptions from the pandemic and workforce shortages, resulting in a \nshortage of drivers and uncontracted overtime payments that aren't covered by pass-through mechanisms.\nAn improvement in labour availability, as is being reported, should flow through the better margins.

Margins have been impacted by higher operating costs, with small companies generally less well-equipped \nto pass these through, affecting earnings.\nFurthermore, small caps have greater exposure to the cyclicality of the domestic economy, with less offshore \nearnings that benefit from currency translation.\nWith inflation moderating and the local interest-rate cycle having peaked, we feel small-cap growth should once \nagain shine, which is one of the main attractions of the asset class.\nWhat's a stock you like that (most) people haven't heard of?\nEureka Group operates a pure play, specialist strategy of providing affordable seniors rental accommodation across \nAustralia.\nEureka services the growing ageing population who are under-funded for retirement and highly reliant on the \ngovernment pension assistance that underpins their revenue.\nThis is an important segment, with 57 per cent of Australia's 4.7 million 65-plus year olds relying on the pension as \ntheir primary source of income. The opportunity for sector consolidation in this area is large, with Eureka the scaled \nplayer in a highly fragmented market and the company currently pursuing avenues to unlock ways to speed up \nmergers and acquisitions. While it trades at a 16 per cent premium to net tangible assets, our view is that the NTA \nis potentially conservative with cap rates of around 8.3 per cent moving lower over time as investors grow more \ncomfortable with the model.\nAlso of note is the recently received scrip-based takeover proposal from ASX-listed Aspen Group and the \nsubsequent acquisition of just under 20 per cent of shares by a third-party corporate entity.\nWhat piece of advice/or anecdote influenced your investing approach?\nDavid Aylward, who started the small-cap fund that I co-manage, has been a mentor and imparted to me early on \nnot to overestimate the level of analysis done by the market.\nIt is so true, particularly once you come down in size from the top 20 or 30 largest stocks.\nFor those willing to put in the time to do the meetings, collate the insights and crunch the numbers, I've found there \nare always opportunities out there to make money.\nWhat's your favourite local bar or restaurant?\nNorth Bondi RSL belies its cheap and cheerful nature with one of the best views in the world.

It now has to prove itself with its ambitious \nplan to take its production level to 500,000 ounces of gold annually.\nBut if it pulls it off, it will become the third-largest gold miner in Australia.\nSo far it has impressed, with the once embattled Westgold Resources soaring in value from $300m to over $1bn \nunder Mr Bramwell's leadership.\nAnd one of the reasons it is interested is it believes Karora had been producing 170,000 ounces of gold, when it \nshould have been producing about 200,000, as it had earlier forecast.\nPage 2 of 2\nDual listing the price Westgold has to pay for deal - DATA ROOM\nGold miners are currently cashed-up on the back of the buoyant gold price. Now the question is whether Ramelius \nResources pounces on Spartan Resources (formerly Gascoyne), which is said to be on its radar given the close \nproximity of its assets to Spartan's.\nYet the speculation has been around for a while and it is still to move, leaving some to think Ramelius sees \nSpartan as over-priced for now.\nAs gold mining consolidation continues apace, the other deal some believe will play out over the medium term is an \nacquisition by Northern Star of the $2.5bn De Grey Mining.\nNorthern Star's first priority is rebuilding the processing plant of the Super Pit gold mining asset that it owns, but \nafter that attention will likely turn to De Grey.\nThis is why many found its presence at Newcrest's Telfer mine and Havieron processing facility on a site visit in \nrecent weeks curious.\nNorthern Star sources say it has no interest in Telfer, but it's very close to De Grey's assets, so perhaps it was there \nwhile on a De Grey site visit, determining whether gold could be processed there.\nMeanwhile, the terms of Westgold's deal will see Karora shareholders receiving 2.524 Westgold shares and 68c \ncash a.\nThe offer represents about $6.60 per Karora share based on Westgold's closing share price on the ASX of $2.28 on \nApril 5.\nIt represents a 10.1 per cent premium to Karora's closing share price on the TSX of $5.99 ($C5.36) on April 5.\nWestgold shareholders will own 50.1 per cent of the combined company. Westgold, advised by Argonaut and \ncurrently producing about 220,000 ounces of gold from its underground and open pit mines in Western Australia, \nsays the business is capable of producing 400,000 ounces of gold per annum from Western Australia assets and \nestimates operating synergies of $209m and estimated corporate savings of $281m.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 24\nLength: 1203 words\nByline: Alex Gluyas\nBody\nIn the eight years since Collins St Asset Management was founded, chief investment officer Vasilios Piperoglou can \nrecall only two occasions when a thematic has presented itself with enough \"significant asymmetry\" to justify a \nmajor investment.\nCollins St's value fund was an early backer of uranium, and its holdings in the sector jumped between 400 per cent \nand 500 per cent over four years. The second was offshore oil services stocks, which surged between 300 per cent \nand 350 per cent in two-and-a-half years. But Piperoglou is confident that Collins St's latest bet will produce even \nbetter returns than both those opportunities.\n\"With gold stocks, the way the asymmetry is playing out currently, I think there is a greater potential in this than the \nother two ... we're seeing the very early signs of the start of a gold bull market,\" Piperoglou says.\n\"At some stage, investors are going to get smacked in the face ... there will be a moment within months, not years, \nwhere people wake up and these quality small caps will multibag.\"\nA multibagger is every investor's dream - a stock that at least doubles in value. And while the best chance of finding \none is at the smaller end of the market, those companies also present the highest risk. But Piperoglou believes the \nlocal gold sector is filled with potential multibaggers, and it's only a matter of time before the record gold price flows \nthrough to miners.\nThat is why Collins St has spent the past 12 months undertaking its own due diligence by speaking to management \nand visiting operations to construct what Piperoglou describes as a portfolio of \"some of the best, well-run, well-\ncapitalised, pre-production plays on the ASX\".\nAmong gold sector small caps, the value fund holds Barton Gold, Brightstar Resources, Tesoro Gold, Great \nBoulder Resources, Meeka Metals and Odyssey Gold. At the larger end of the market, it holds Ramelius \nResources and West Gold Resources.\nPage 2 of 3\nTaking a shine to the gold diggers; MONDAY FUNDIE\nIndeed, Collins St's $200 million value fund has a long track record of spotting winners, and regularly appears \namong the best performers in Mercer's investment survey. It was the top-ranked Australian long-only strategy in the \nfive years to December, returning 24 per cent per annum, and also boasted a podium finish on a three-year time \nhorizon. Its strong run of form has continued over the past nine months, with the fund returning 18.6 per cent, net of \nfees, in the financial year to date, beating the S&P/ASX 200's 7.6 per cent gain over the same period.\nCollins St has also reopened its special situation fund, which is targeting the local and international small-cap gold \nsector following strong demand from clients. The firm believes that miners in North America are also looking cheap, \nparticularly small- and mid-cap companies in Canada and the US.\nMuch of the value fund's recent performance has been fuelled by an 11 per cent return in December when two of its \nkey holdings - Carnarvon Energy and Link Administration - rallied sharply. While Collins St doesn't typically engage \nin shareholder activism, the firm played a key role in rolling the board at Carnarvon in December amid frustrations \nover its handling of its major offshore gas project majority-owned by Santos.\nCollins St teamed up with Nero Resources Fund to raid Carnarvon's share register and force the company to \npledge it would not acquire new assets, would cut administrative costs and work with Santos to speed up drilling at \nthe Dorado field in which Carnarvon is a minority owner. The stock rallied nearly 44 per cent in December.\n\"Usually when we buy a new position, we have no intention of being activist because it's a lot easier to make money \nbeing passive,\" Piperoglou says.\n\"We were willing on that occasion to throw down the gauntlet of having a pretty public fight, but thankfully it was the \nquickest coup - within 24 hours they basically resigned.\"\nThe value fund also benefited from a 60 per cent surge in Link shares in December following a $1.2 billion buyout \noffer from Japanese financial services company Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. The bid ended a rollercoaster ride \nfor shareholders over the past three years, when four other suitors attempted takeovers.\nThe disastrous acquisition of a British company in 2017 also dragged Link into the messy collapse of the $7 billion \nWoodford investment fund, which triggered heavy losses and a complex exit involving the financial regulator. \"At \ntimes when we do have a significant amount of cash because we don't see much opportunity on the long end, we \nplayed what we thought at the time was a low-risk takeover arbitrage,\" Piperoglou says, referring to its initial \ninvestment in Link.\n\"But that literally blew up in our face, and we were holding a position that halved in value, so we would argue that \nwe got Link's takeover wrong.\"\nPiperoglou admits that Collins St has still lost money on that investment, adding that if the fund hadn't bought \nshares in Link, its two-year return would be at least 5 per cent higher.\nCollins St is also bullish on energy, particularly oil and gas, and believes they will be crucial for decades to come as \nthe world transitions towards renewable energy.\nWhile financial institutions and governments have increasingly shied away from investing in the sector, Piperoglou \nsays that demand for oil and gas remains robust while there is little incentive for new supply.\n\"It's one of those weird disconnects, with underlying demand still going up every year, but you're not seeing enough \ncapital expenditure on the supply side,\" he says. \"Those that are willing to participate and just be passive should \nearn some pretty good double-digit returns.\"\nThe value fund holds Beach Energy, but last month trimmed its position in the stock and reallocated that capital to \nits investment in Carnarvon.\nPiperoglou's first exposure to the sharemarket was at the ripe age of 12 years old when his father, a psychiatrist, \nraided his piggy bank and bought him about $1200 of CSR shares due to its high dividend yield.Page 3 of 3\nTaking a shine to the gold diggers; MONDAY FUNDIE\nEvery six months, Piperoglou would study the company's dividend statement while also reading everything he could \nabout Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway, which cemented in his mind that he wanted to run an investment \nfund.\nPiperoglou started investing in year 12, mainly in resources stocks, but admits he had no idea what he was doing \nand made plenty of mistakes. His biggest winner was copper and gold miner Oxiana Resources, which he bought \nat 8\u00a2 and sold at $3.50.\nFrom there, Piperoglou continued to follow financial markets and completed commerce and law degrees at Monash \nUniversity. With few contacts in the financial services industry, he joined boutique firm Leyland Private Asset \nManagement.\nIt was there he met Michael Goldberg, a like-minded value investor who also believed in fundamental stock \nanalysis. Over many lunches, the two came to the conclusion that the most efficient way to run a value-style \ninvestment house was through a fund structure that was a standalone entity.\nAfter five years at Leyland for Piperoglou and seven years for Goldberg, they established Collins St Asset \nManagement in 2015 and have put their own money into the value fund.\n\"We live and die by our stock picking ability,\" Piperoglou says.\nLoad-Date: April 24, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The Fund performance compared to a 21% sterling return \nregistered by the Gold Bugs Index and the GDXJ equity ETF. However, we anticipate that the lag in performance of \nthe smaller equities held in the Fund will catch-up with larger peers given their relatively attractive valuations.\nGold was one of the stronger commodities with the price rising over 9% during March to new all-time highs. Silver is \nlatterly starting to catch-up, registering a 10% price increase over the month. Prices held despite a more hawkish \nmove in US FED rate expectations after FOMC minutes indicated broader US labour markets were stubbornly \nresilient despite relatively tepid economic growth. Increasingly there appears to be a focus on ever growing \ngovernment debt levels which have shown little sign of reversing, as evidence by the latest US congression Budget \nOffice projections.\nRecent physical gold buying has been led by China, with a pick-up in retail demand showing in import data. This \nhas been potentially driven by broader concerns on the economy, particularly the weak regional property sector. \nAlongside this is the healthy net central bank demand: People's Bank of China (PBoC) data showed China's gold \nreserves continued to rise with the addition of 0.39 Moz in February taking official reserves to 72.6Moz (+10% year-\non-year). Physical gold ETF's showed a pick-up in buying but aggregate holdings nevertheless ended 246k ounces \nlower over the month. We believe gold hitting all-time highs despite steady ETF selling is a positive, as would also \nbe the case should ETF's turn steady buyers, further tightening the market.Page 3 of 4\nMonthly Investor Report - March 2024\nWest African Resources and Fortuna Gold and Silver were strong contributors to performance. This was closely \nfollowed by Australian gold producer Karora which received bid interest from ASX-listed Ramelius, as well as \nreports of a further interested party also in discussion with the company. While we do not focus our stock selection \nspecifically on M&A targets, we believe quality undervalued assets should result in a higher probability of them \nbecoming targets. The sector remains short of growth projects, and so we would anticipate a pick-up in M&A activity \ngoing forward. This should help close the discounts of junior miners to the larger. Calidus was the primary detractor \nto performance with the group undertaking an equity funding, in which the Fund participated, as part of a broader \nrestructuring of its debt and gold hedging.\nGross Leverage5 (%) Commitment Leverage6 (%)\nGolden Prospect Precious Metals Limited 111 11\n1\nCQS (UK) LLP\n4th Floor, One Strand, London WC2N 5HR, United Kingdom\nT: +44 (0) 20 7201 6900 | F: +44 (0) 20 7201 1200\nCQS (US), LLC\n152 West 57th Street, 40th Floor, New York, NY 10019, US\nT: +1 212 259 2900 | F: +1 212 259 2699\nTavistock Communications\n18 St. Swithin's Lane, London EC4N 8AD\nT: +44 20 7920 3150 | goldenprospect@tavistock.co.uk\nSources: 1,2 CQS as at the last business day of the month indicated at the top of this report.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Pg. 25\nLength: 855 words\nByline: Alex Gluyas\nBody\nPeter Edwards is chairman of Victor Smorgon Group and co-chief investment officer of the Global Multi-Strategy \nFund, which has returned 40.6 per cent annually since its 2019 inception. The Melbourne-based firm oversees \nmore than $1 billion in assets.\nThe global fund has returned 22.6 per cent so far this financial year. What has driven that performance? | The fund \ninvests in several themes including gold, automation, decarbonisation, and emerging markets. Over the past three \nmonths, performance has been led by investments in gold and decarbonisation.\nThe largest contributor has been Australian gold miner Red 5, which has moved from developing an asset into \ncommercial production. We've been a substantial shareholder since March 2021, and we have supported it through \nthe development financing phase to its profitable production today.\nJapanese company Hitachi has also added significant returns over the past two years. It's divested its legacy \nconstruction machinery, chemicals, and metals businesses to focus on producing higher margin products with \ngreater returns on capital, and with a higher propensity for cash flow generation. It has also sharpened its focus on \nreturning cash to shareholders and growing dividends per share at a compound annual growth rate of 13.6 per cent \nover the past five years.\nHow much further do you expect the copper price to run and which stocks do you own? | We expect that copper \ndemand will remain strong, with price upside driven by structural supply constraints.\nWe like miners with strong leadership and proven records in creating shareholder returns and value low \njurisdictional risk and higher-grade orebodies with expansion potential.\nFor producing companies, we like Canadian miners Lundin Group and Capstone Copper.\nAnother company we support is US-based mineral exploration company Ivanhoe Electric, which is developing the \nSanta Cruz project and exploring for new major copper deposits in North America.\nPage 2 of 2\nThe stocks fuelling Victor Smorgon's 40pc returns Fundie Q&A\nWe are also involved in BMC Minerals, which is developing one of the most exciting volcanogenic massive sulphide \n(sources of copper, zinc, gold, silver) districts globally.\nDo you expect the disconnect between gold prices and mining stocks to abate? Which stocks are best positioned? | \nWe have noticed that a large majority of recent gold demand has come from BRICS nations, which are increasingly \ntransacting with each other in their local currencies and settling the surplus with physical gold. This demand from \nnon-Western buyers will continue to support the gold price.\nWestern gold investors are preferring to invest in gold mining equities, and are less enthused by the gold bull \nmarket, which has created this disconnect. If this trend continues, we believe it's more likely that gold equities will \nreflect the gold price.\nHistorically, the bottom of the cycle typically sees gold mining equities trade at a discount to the spot gold price and \nhistoric average multiples. As the cycle peaks, analysts start to imply a forward price greater than spot, and a \nmarket multiple above average.\nAssuming the future rhymes with history, the greatest gains will be with smaller, higher-cost gold producers and \nexplorers. For this reason, we like Ramelius Resources and Canada's Agnico Eagle.\nWhat's a stock you're bullish on that investors might not have heard of? | Copper miner Metals Acquisition listed on \nthe ASX this year after acquiring the NSW CSA copper mine in 2023. It's run by Mick McMullen, who has a track \nrecord of turning around major mining companies globally.\nWe believe the company's inception as a US-listed special purpose acquisition company and the capital structure \ntied to its initial acquisition has turned many potential investors away. Additionally, CSA was previously owned by \nGlencore, whose exit likely led people to perceive that the asset is of low quality.\nHowever, we view Glencore's retained equity in Metals Acquisition as an endorsement of the asset and \nacknowledgement that the business will improve under a focused management team. The company has recently \ntaken several steps to simplify and improve its balance sheet which we also see as accretive.\nWhat's a stock you'd like to own but can't (for whatever reason)? | Semiconductors are a critical resource of the \nmodern world. With this view, ASML is a company that if it traded back to our target buy level, it would be added to \nthe portfolio.\nThe company has a dominant position in the semiconductor lithography market, benefiting from pricing power and \nstrong customer relationships, and is poised to continue benefiting from the increased demand for computing \npower.\nWhat is your favourite local restaurant and your go-to order? | A local favourite restaurant is Terrace cafe, inside the \nBotanic Gardens. Great place to be on a beautiful day, and the chicken avocado salad is delicious.\nAre there any podcasts that you'd recommend? | I spend a bit of time in the car, so love a good podcast. Currently, \nI'm listening to Pivot by Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway, The Grant Williams Podcast, and the Australian Strategic \nPolicy Institute have recently launched a weekly show called Stop the World.\nLoad-Date: June 2, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Auric's latest 822m campaign followed up on a \nsignificant historic drillhole by Tychean that returned 25m grading 1.67g/t gold from just 44m.\n'The Fugitive Prospect is midway between two prominent, high-grade gold deposits; Wattle Dam and Spargos \nReward at Spargoville.'\nAuric Mining managing director Mark English\nThe prospect sits in a good neighbourhood with the 185,000-ounce Spargos Reward gold deposit just 8km to the \nnorth and the 266,000-ounce Wattle Dam gold deposit only 8km to the south-east.\nAuric Mining managing director Mark English said: \"The Fugitive Prospect is midway between two prominent, high-\ngrade gold deposits; Wattle Dam and Spargos Reward at Spargoville. Our first-pass drilling has highlighted \nsimilarities with both deposits. We're looking forward to the next phase when we will get the opportunity to test that \nmodel.\"\nThe company already has plans for air-core (AC) drilling towards the centre of the Fugitive target to infill the current \n100m spacing in the area.

As part of its latest mining \nprogram, more than 30,000 dry metric tonnes were processed for its joint venture (JV) partner BML Ventures at a \nreconciled head grade of 1.44g/t at the Greenfields Mill in Coolgardie.\nThe partnership produced more than 9740 ounces during two mining campaigns last year, returning a total gold \nrevenue of $29.28 million.\nAuric plans to put its surplus cash to work by continuing with the development of its nearby Munda gold deposit, \nalongside broader exploration. That now appears likely to include follow-up drilling at Spargoville, with results from \nthe company's latest campaign at the Fugitive prospect delivering several promising new targets.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Ordell is chaired by Tommy \nMcKeith, who stepped down as Genesis chair in 2022.\nAnd Ordell's main exploration project, Barimaia, also comes from Genesis, which will emerge with a 9 per cent \nstake in the explorer after the float as part of an agreement to sell the tenements.\nBarimaia sits a stone's throw from Ramelius Resources' Mt Magnet operations, and in a district that's seen a fair \nbit of corporate interest in recent times as Ramelius and Westgold jostle for position.\nThe project was previously drilled by both IGO and Genesis, and Ordell's prospectus shows pretty solid historical \nintercepts, including 15m at 11.4 grams a tonne gold, 17m at 3.4 grams a tonne, and 70m at 0.68 grams a tonne.\nBut the company now reckons the work conducted by Ramelius at its nearby deposit offers a better geological \ninterpretation for Barimaia and hopes to have better luck hanging a resource off previous drilling by targeting the \nnext round a bit better.\nOrdell also plans to spend a bit of its exploration cash at its Goodia Project, 15km southwest of Norseman - an area \nonce best known for gold, but now the subject of lithium interest. The Goodia tenements were previously held by \nGalileo Mining, last seen selling 30 per cent of the lithium rights at its own Norseman tenements to Mineral \nResources for $7.5m.\nPage 2 of 2\nGold price offers hope for Argonaut Securities' new ASX float - DATA ROOM\nLoad-Date: June 4, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Nothing came of the talks, and Westgold has since moved on its scrip-and-cash bid for Canada-listed \nKarora Resources.\nInterestingly, another listed gold player, Ramelius Resources, has sniffed around Spartan in the past.

Another key area of focus has been the development of its CMA mine pit underground extension to the \nYaoure Gold Mine.\nMeanwhile, Chinese groups may be in the strongest contention for Akyem when it comes to price, but Newmont will \ntake into consideration whether the buyer is a responsible owner of the asset, so it may not get sold to the highest \nbidder.\nNewmont is offloading mines globally following its $24bn purchase of Australia's largest gold mining company \nNewcrest.\nIt is also working with advisory firm BMO to sell mines in Canada and North America, including the Musselwhite, \nCripple Creek (US) and Eleonore (Canada) projects, potentially worth a combined $1.5bn.\nThe contest is expected to attract North American miners.\nPage 2 of 2\nPerseus drops out of the contest for Ghana asset - DATA ROOM\nLast on the block will be Newmont's Telfer gold mine in Western Australia, which Macquarie Capital is mandated to \nsell. Greatland Gold has first right to buy the asset and there's been some market chatter that perhaps the \nnegotiations are already afoot, despite floating at Telfer's tailings dam causing production delays.\nThere was also a suggestion that Ramelius Resources could be interested. However, judging by the trading in \nSpartan Resources, it appears Ramelius's interest lies elsewhere.\nThe Australian listed gold miner that last year held merger talks with near-by rival Westgold Resources told the \nmarket on Thursday it had purchased 8.9 per cent of the $994m listed gold miner Spartan after a major holding \nfrom Tembo Capital was on offer through Citi.\nHowever, it added that it had no current intention to acquire control or make a takeover of the business that owns \nthe Dalgaranga Gold Project, 65km northwest of Mt Magnet in Murchison, Western Australia, where Ramelius \nowns a gold processing hub.\nStill, it gives Ramelius deal certainty should it be keen to move in on the target in the future.\nDataRoom reported in April that Spartan was on the radar of Ramelius. Spartan was previously called Gascoyne \nand had to undergo a string of emergency equity raisings since 2019 following losses, with a mill far bigger than its \nproduction capacity being its downfall.\nThe strategic move by Ramelius resembles Silver Lake's with Red 5, buying 11 per cent last year ahead of a scrip \nmerger deal later with the $1.2bn company.\nThe share price of Red 5 post the merger has been lagging, down about 20 per cent in the past month and taking \nits market value to $2.5bn. Some Silver Lake assets now part of Red 5 are also close to Spartan's. Australian listed \ngold mining companies are under pressure to consolidate to attract global institutional investors that want gold \nmining investment opportunities of scale.\nLoad-Date: June 27, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Any Core Lithium \nshareholders looking to indulge in a little tax-loss selling to offset taxable gains elsewhere in their portfolio will have \nbeen well-placed last week, with the company - the first major Australian victim of the lithium price plunge - finishing \nthe year down 89.7 per cent, the biggest loss on the S&P/ASX 300 Metals and Mining index.\nInvestors who jumped on the Canadian lithium bandwagon have also had a torrid time, with Sayona Mining and \nPatriot Battery Metals down 79 per cent and 67.5 per cent respectively.\nChalice Mining was the third biggest loser on the list, with a 77.3 per cent plunge for the fiscal year after delivering \nan underwhelming scoping study on its Gonneville project in WA in August last year.\nIGO was hit by falling lithium and nickel prices - while still feeling the hangover from its disastrous takeover of \nWestern Areas - and suffered a 60.6 per cent value loss for the year.\nGraphite plays Talga Group, Syrah Resources and Renascor Resources all made the top 10 loser list.\nThe list is rounded out by -Liontown Resources, which was the hottest lithium play on the market when Albemarle \nlobbed a $2.50-a-share bid in March 2023. Hancock Prospecting spoiled that takeover, however, and the falling \nlithium price - as well as cost blowouts at its Kathleen Valley project in WA - did the rest, with Liontown stock \nclosing off 68 per cent for the financial year at 90.5c.\nLoad-Date: June 30, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1144 words\nHighlight: This week's Bulls N' Bears Runner of the Week is ... the ASX itself. The ASX 200 hit a record high of \n8083.7 points as the top end of town continued to flourish.\nBody\nGreen shoots and blue skies.\nCould it be that a difficult couple of years for small-cap companies are now starting to make their way - finally - into \nthe rear-vision mirror? Well, the signs are good, at least, after stock exchange highs emerged this week.\nThe ASX 200, for example, hit an all-time record of 8083.7 points during the week, largely on a growing expectation \nthat interest rate cuts are coming in the United States on the back of the Federal Reserve's optimism that inflation is \nreturning to target levels.\nThe big companies - such as the Commonwealth Bank, which hit a record share price high of $134.25 this week - \nhave been surfing the crest of the bull wave. Major banks, tech stocks and health care companies have also been \ndonning their boardies and bikinis for their time in the sun.\nSo, is it also now time for the small-caps to start lathering up with the Reef Oil? Many would be hoping that the \nmore-than-solid ASX runs for the four companies appearing in this edition of Bulls N' Bears Runners of the Week is \na sign of better times to come for those in the shallower end of the pool.\nThis week's Runners all centre around the red and yellow metals - for the uninitiated, that means copper and gold - \nwhich, like the ASX this week, are testing all-time highs. Traders cashing in on the pending US interest rate cuts \npumped the gold price to dizzying record levels of more than US$2480 (AU$3700) an ounce, while the global glut \nfor quality copper and copper assets continues as the red metal's price also remains near all-time highs.\nSo, to our Runners and taking out top spot this week is DGR Global, which enjoyed a sharp price hike of 290 per \ncent from a previous close of 1c, launching to a 3.9c high. The company surged in valuation on the strength of its \n6.6 per cent shareholding in TSX-listed copper-gold developer SolGold.\nLate Monday night, SolGold confirmed it had secured a US$750 million (AU$1120 million) funding package to \nprogress its tier-one Cascabel copper-gold project in northern Ecuador. The company claims the project is the \nbiggest undeveloped Latin American copper asset that is not in the hands of a major.\nThe operation has a mammoth measured and indicated resource of more than 19.1 million tonnes of copper \nequivalent.\nPage 2 of 3\nASX leads way to better market times ahead\nThe funding package from North American syndicate Franco Nevada and Osisko Royalties validates an estimated \nUS$3.2 billion (AU$4.78 billion) net present value (NPV) at an after-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 24 per cent as \noutlined in SolGold's prefeasibility study (PFS) in March. Interestingly, the study is comprised of some conservative \nmetals prices for copper at US$3.85 (AU$5.75) per pound and gold at US$1750 (AU$2611) per ounce.\nThe syndicate has no doubt run some back-of-the-envelope calculations in its valuations, perhaps using the recent \nall-time price highs for copper and gold, which are more than 25 per cent and 40 per cent higher than those used in \nthe PFS, respectively.A close second placing this week goes to Labyrinth Resources, which jumped 280 per cent \nafter revealing its plan to acquire 100 per cent of two gold projects in Western Australia's Goldfields region. The \nwell-timed announcement, which saw the company's stock rise from a 0.5c close last week to 1.9c, coincided with \ngold hitting its record high.\nThe deal will see Labyrinth acquire Ramelius Resources' Vivien gold project and also affords it the option to \nacquire the remaining 49 per cent of its Comet Vale gold project.\nComet Vale, just 32km south of Menzies next to the Goldfields Highway, features a recently-updated mineral \nresource of 96,000 ounces at 4.8 grams per tonne gold. Labyrinth is aiming to bolster the high-grade resource \ninventory and capitalise on its new underexplored, high-grade mines.\nA 4.8g/t gold resource is nothing to poke a stick at by WA standards. Just last month, emerging Murchison major \nWestgold Resources penned a\"strategic alliance\" agreement with junior explorer Ora Gold to gain access to its \n240,000-ounce Crown Prince deposit that runs at an impressive 4.1g/t.\nLabyrinth has also raised $2 million through a placement and will present existing shareholders with an additional \n$2 million entitlement offer to support its endeavours to expand its high-grade resources and hopefully follow in \nOra's footsteps.\nTaking out bronze, a fitting alloy for a story with a majority copper flavour, is Miramar Resources. The company's \nshare price jumped almost 188 per cent - from 0.8c to 2.3c - after revelations of promising high-grade copper, lead \nand silver samples from its Joy Helen prospect within its new Chain Pool project in WA's Gascoyne region.\nThe project, while still not granted, shows plenty of potential after returning rock chip assays going up to 5.49 per \ncent copper, 42 per cent lead and 73.48g/t silver. Despite the impressive at-surface numbers, management says \nthe Joy Helen prospect has seen no modern and systematic exploration, nor drilling.\nThe mineralisation style is interpreted to be \"Mississippi Valley-type\" and shows some intriguing similarities to its \nneighbouring Abra lead-zinc-silver deposit that is also hosted in the Irregully rock formation.\nBut Miramar will be hoping this story doesn't turn out like that of Abra owner Galena Mining, which ran aground \nearlier this year with debts totalling some $160 million to international lenders because of a poor lead-zinc \nenvironment. Fortunately for Miramar, copper seems to be the ticket this week and maybe that's what Galena's \ndeposit was missing.\nOur final Runner for the week is Stelar Metals, which shot up more than 101 per cent this week on ... yep, you \nguessed it, copper rock chip samples.\nHigh-grade copper findings were sampled along a 3km strike at its Baratta project in South Australia, returning \ngrades of up to 28.7 per cent. It is a region Stelar says shows similarities to the prolific Central African Copper Belt \n(CACB) - the biggest and most prolific mineralised sediment-hosted copper province known on Earth.\nThe company reported 21 of the 72 samples exceeding grades of 10 per cent copper, underscoring the potential of \nthe historically-productive Baratta site featuring a mine that produced copper ore between 1896 and 1904.\nRather unfortunately for Stelar, the traditional owners in the Adnyamathanha native title organisation remains in \nadministration. The company says it will continue to monitor the native title situation and will lodge applications for \ndrilling at Baratta when the traditional owner organisation comes out of administration.Page 3 of 3\nASX leads way to better market times ahead\nIf copper is the flavour of the month, then it seems rock chip samples were this week's tipple of the week. Now, we'll \njust have to wait and see if the all-time highs for the index will overlap with a return of interest to the small end of \ntown.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

The shares will be exchanged on a one-for-four basis, giving Brightstar a circa 66.6 per cent \nownership of the combined entity.\nAs part of the deal, Canaccord Genuity and Argonaut will seek to raise about $20 million from investors, sources \nsaid.\nAlto's Sandstone project in Western Australia has been producing gold since the 19th century and has a 17.6 \nmillion tonne mineral resource estimate at 1.5 grams per tonne. It is next door to Westgold's Big Bell mine and \nRamelius' Mount Magnet. The small-cap had long been seen as a takeover target - the now $1.2 billion Westgold \nResources held a 14 per cent stake in 2022, while China's Shandong Goldsea Group Co tabled a bid in 2020.\nMerger partner Brightstar is led by Alex Rovira, who was previously a banker at Canaccord. It is drilling at the Cork \nTree Well deposit in WA's Laverton. Sources said the company has been hunting for acquisitions.\nThe tie-up comes as ASX-listed gold stocks remain a reliable source of M&A activity for bankers and investors, at a \ntime when deals have dried up in lithium and nickel amid a slump in commodity prices. Established gold players are \nbeing driven by a need to replace ageing mines, while juniors are exploring combinations to secure their future.\nAt the bigger end of the town, Westgold has acquired Toronto-listed Karora Resources - despite attempts from \nRamelius Resources to kibosh the deal. Earlier in the year, Red5 and Silver Lake agreed to a $2.2 billion merger.\nRamelius, for its part, has been scoping out targets. Recently it raided WA explorer Spartan Resources' register \nfor a 17.94 per cent stake after an unsuccessful tilt at Karora.\nLoad-Date: August 3, 2024\nPage 2 of 2\nBrightstar, Alto Metals agree to merge; kick off $20m raise Street Talk\nEnd of Document",

Some sidestep the event, instead using the build-up as an \nopportunity to schedule meetings in Perth, but it still attracts over 2000 delegates.\nLithium miners stole the show last year. Producers of the battery material were in favour because of the expected \nramp-up in electric vehicle manufacturing. But the lithium price has come off the boil while gold is striking record \nhighs.\n\"If you went back last year or the year before, what was remarkable was lithium, which had been a small \ncommodity, had really come to dominate the proceedings at Diggers and Dealers,\" Morgan says.\n\"The Australian-dollar gold price is high, and lithium and nickel are having a tough time of it and not likely to be as \nfocused on growth. Nickel and lithium are battening down the hatches.\" Domestic gold production growth has \nslowed over the past decade as mines approach the end of their productive lives, says IBISWorld, but it's set to \nreturn to growth as project expansions come online, capitalising on the weaker Australian dollar.\nThe industry's annual revenue is about $27.9bn and growing at a rate of 4.4 per cent as the metal continues to act \nas an inflation hedge and benefits from central bank purchases.\nAustralia is the third-largest producer globally with 293.8 tonnes in 2023, behind China and Russia, according to the \nWorld Gold Council.\nLithium miners dominated the mergers and acquisitions landscape in the resources industry last year, with \nAlbemarle bidding for Liontown Resources (it later abandoned the deal), SQM acquiring Azure Minerals, Chalice \nMining looking for a backer and speculation about a move on Patriot Battery Metals by Pilbara Minerals, which was \nsitting on a $3bn cash pile. But investment bankers have turned their attention to gold.\nHeading into Diggers and Dealers, there has been talk Regis and Gold Road Resources might merge. Ramelius \nResources is also in focus with an 8.9 per cent stake in Spartan Resources, West Gold and Ramelius have held \ntakeover talks and there's the perennial takeover target De Grey Mining.\nGenesis Minerals boss Raleigh Finlayson has emphasised his focus is on operations rather than deals, but the \ncompany is surrounded by consolidation opportunities in Western Australia's Leonora gold district, while it's \nexpected Northern Star will return to deal making to gain further scale after the country's largest gold miner \nNewcrest was taken over by Newmont.\nDriving M&A, Bramwell says, will be producers with cash. \"This is a time when the producers are cashed-up and \nthe explorers and the people in the middle are cash-strapped.\" Also of interest this year will be uranium miners like \nBoss Energy and Paladin, as the fuel remains at the centre of the energy debate and demand grows, with a lack of \nsupply to the West from Russia. \"There's a lot of enthusiasm towards the sector. Its prospects are still high and \nhave not dimmed as much as lithium or nickel or rare earths have,\" Morgan says.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: COMPANIES AND MARKETS; Pg. 24\nLength: 1326 words\nByline: Brad Thompson\nBody\nKalgoorlie postcard The high hopes of last year have faded.\nDarren Stralow and Simon Lawson shook hands and said their goodbyes. The young gold bulls had just met and \nthought they were about to die together in a plane crash.\nIt was 2011, the gold price was about $1300 an ounce and Northern Star Resources was starting its rise from the \nranks of penny dreadful to where it sits today, the biggest ASX-listed producer.\nThe plane, its engines dead after sucking in dirty fuel, eventually glided to an emergency landing in Paraburdoo, \nWestern Australia.\n\"Everyone was looking out of the window, you could see the fire engines rushing to the side of the runway for the \nlanding to make sure that we weren't going to burst into flames,\" recalls Stralow.\nLawson and Stralow, working for Northern Star at the time, bonded over the near-death experience and shared a \nfew cold beers that night in town.\nThese days, Stralow is chief executive of Bellevue Gold. Lawson is the managing director of Spartan Resources.\nSpartan shares soared from 22\u00a2 to as high as $1.33 in the past 12 months on the back of the Never Never \ndiscovery about 800 kilometres south of their emergency landing. Bellevue has been as high as $2.10, although it \nnow hovers near a 12-month low of $1.25.\nLawson and Stralow were two of the star attractions at the Diggers & Dealers mining conference in Kalgoorlie, \nwhere gold was centre stage. The critical minerals presenters did their best to sound upbeat but were a reminder of \nfickle commodity markets and how quickly high-flyers can crash.\nKalgoorlie is relying on gold as it deals with the fallout from the collapse of the nickel industry and failures to launch \nin lithium in the wider Goldfields region.\nPage 2 of 3\nGold saves the day as Diggers deals with the rout\nSmoke still pours from the 150-metre-high main chimney stack at the BHP nickel smelter outside the town, but it will \nstop soon after 51 years.\nAbout 10 kilometres away, on the edge of town, Northern Star is investing $1.5 billion on a giant crusher to boost \noutput from the fabled Superpit and underground mines. Those operations cover ground that has already produced \nabout 65 million ounces of gold worth about $222 billion at today's spot price of $US2398 ($3700) an ounce.\nStralow reminds everyone of how tough it can be to get new mines into production and running, even with price \ntailwinds.\nHe needed to do so as an explanation of Bellevue's decision to raise $150 million last month, a move that caught \nthe market by surprise. At least Bellevue could raise money. Commodity analysts Citi and others have predicted the \ngold price could reach $US3000 an ounce by this time next year under a bullish scenario.\nRaising money appears a forlorn hope for lithium projects, with benchmark prices for the concentrate produced in \nWA slumping to $US870 a tonne this week. Liontown Resources managing director Tony Ottaviano, who has just \ndefied the odds to bring the Kathleen Valley mine to life, told the conference it was now impossible to fund a lithium \nproject with equity alone.\nLithium veteran Ken Brinsden, who piloted Pilbara Minerals through near ruin, suggested the federal government \ncreate something akin to the former Australian Wheat Board to help fund strategically important rare earths \nprojects.\nWhile the Kalgoorlie pubs did a roaring trade, the BHP stand inside the conference's main marquee stood almost \nempty. All it had to offer was advice on where there might be other jobs after the mothballing of the nickel smelter \nand mines that were the lifeblood of towns such as Leinster and Kambalda.\nLawson brought his gold company back to life after a triple bypass. It failed twice when known as Gascoyne \nResources. He was sacking workers two years ago but has had remarkable success with the drill bit since then \nunder the Spartan moniker.\nSpartan's most exciting discovery is Never Never, part of the Dalgaranga project. And it is one reason that mid-tier \nminer Ramelius Resources has grabbed a near 18 per cent stake in the company amid a flurry of M&A in the WA \ngold sector. The Diggers organisers showed a sense of theatre when Spartan boss Lawson and Ramelius boss \nMark Zeptner spoke back-to-back on Wednesday. Lawson has stirred the pot by suggesting that with a market \ncapitalisation of $1.2 billion, Spartan might now be too much to bite off for $2.16 billion Ramelius.\nLess than a year ago, he was hoping Ramelius, Westgold or Silver Lake would come knocking about a deal and \nbemoaning a timid approach to M&A in the gold sector.\n\"I stand by that,\" Lawson said this week. \"There was a little confusion about why no one had moved on me earlier. \nWhy did [Ramelius] wait until it cost them $185 million to get less than 20 per cent of my company? I'm still \nconfused as to why cashed-up gold producers, who are actually running at a pretty good premium and with \npremium gold prices, are not more active in that M&A space.\"\nNorthern Star, valued at $16.3 billion, made many of its acquisitions at times when the gold price was in the \ndoldrums.\nBoth Northern Star boss Stuart Tonkin and Evolution Mining executive chairman Jake Klein said this week that they \nwere less inclined to make acquisitions at a high gold price.\nDespite the impressive size and grade of Never Never, one hurdle for Lawson has been the stigma associated with \nGascoyne. \"One particular fund manager said he hated Gascoyne, it had torched $35 million of his fund and that it \nreally left a bad taste in his mouth,\" Lawson says. \"He said he wasn't interested in hearing our story, but he turned \nup, sat in a corner and pretended not to listen. Eight minutes later he wanted 5 per cent.\"Page 3 of 3\nGold saves the day as Diggers deals with the rout\nLawson is also backing his mate Stralow to deliver with Bellevue despite some grumblings about the capital raising \nat a big discount. \"There's more money in the tank now [at Bellevue], and he's running the highest-grade gold mine \nin Australia. It's going to be very profitable,\" he adds.\nLast year at Diggers, lithium was all the rage, with Albemarle about to up its bid for Liontown to $6.6 billion and Gina \nRinehart and Chile's SQM working up to a joint $1.7 billion takeover offer for explorer Azure Minerals.\nAndrew Forrest-backed Wyloo had just completed its $760 million acquisition of nickel miner Mincor. BHP was \nplanning to build a 1000-bed village at Kalgoorlie to accommodate the workforce needed for a major overhaul and \nupdate of its nickel smelter.\nA year later, the Wyloo mines are mothballed and BHP has written down the value of its nickel business by $5.4 \nbillion. Glencore and IGO Limited have the only nickel mines still standing in WA - and they are just hanging on.\nIGO sold its 30 per cent stake in Tropicana, one of WA's biggest gold mines, to Regis Resources in 2021 as part of \na big punt on battery minerals that involved acquiring stakes in the Greenbushes lithium mine and a still mis-firing \nlithium hydroxide refinery.\nThe same green metals strategy led to the disastrous acquisition of nickel miner Western Areas.\nThose deals were done before Ivan Vella arrived as chief executive. He remains optimistic on lithium but isn't so \nsure about a nickel revival in the face of growing supply from Chinese-backed producers in Indonesia.\n\"What we do know is a lot of WA nickel mines are actually quite old. As you get further into the mine life, it does get \nharder and more costly,\" he says.\nGlenn Wilson, the mayor of Kalgoorlie, says the town is feeling the impact of the nickel collapse and BHP workers \nleaving.\n\"We're starting to see houses hit the market. We're starting to see some of the effect of people moving on to \ndifferent roles with BHP [BHP has offered workers redundancies or jobs in its iron ore and copper mines elsewhere \nin Australia],\" he says.\nBut Wilson, who is chairman of the Australian Mining Cities Alliance that includes places like Broken Hill, Mount Isa \nand Karratha, says the strong gold sector was a saving grace for Kalgoorlie.\n\"There is a silver lining to nickel ... the gold sector now can have a workforce ready to go in some instances,\" he \nsaid.\nLoad-Date: August 12, 2024\nEnd of Document",

The \nCoogee Deposit is hosted within a package of intermediate to felsic volcanics and volcaniclastics, comprising \ndacite, andesite and rhyolite lithologies. The primary mineralised zone comprises a moderately southwest dipping \nshear zone at the contact between the dacitic crystal tuff unit and a locally porphyritic andesite flow. Gold is directly \nassociated with pyrite, which is frequently intergrown with magnetite and high gold values coincide with increased \npercentages of pyrite and magnetite. Magnetite rich zones have also been intersected, but without pyrite, they do \nnot host gold mineralisation.\nCOOGEE WEST E26/177 GEOPHYSICS RESULTS AND TARGETS\nLocated immediately west of M26/477 the southern half of this tenement covers Lake Lefroy with the northern half \ncontaining widows of weathered outcrop and Cenozoic cover. Historically the Exploration Licence has been \nsporadically explored with wide spaced reconnaissance aircore drilling across the salt lake completed by Ramelius \nwith and RC and diamond drilling completed in the north by Terrain Minerals. The tenement is covered by 50m line \nspaced aeromagnetic data and variable gravity on 100m to 400m spaced lines with 100m stations. The magnetic \nimagery highlights variably magnetic northwest trending mafic and ultramafic units which are intruded by granitic \nintrusions and surrounded by sediments and intermediate to felsic tuffs. Filtered gravity provides complimentary \ninformation to the magnetics, displaying local gravity highs over ultramafic and mafic units and gravity lows over \nsediments and granitic intrusions. CG-04 Target Zone discrete untested circular magnetic anomaly of approximately \n700nT approx. 1.5km west of the Coogee Pit. This represents a higher priority drill target based on the stronger \nmagnetic response compared to the CG-01 (400nT) target zone which is known to hosts gold-copper mineralisation \nnorth of the Coogee Pit. The top of the anomaly starts from 300 vertical metres extending down to 1km in depth - no \ndrilling has tested this anomaly and represents a high-order drill Au-Cu target.\nContact:\nBrett Mitchell Paul Armstrong\nExecutive Chairman Investor Relations\nJavelin Minerals Limited Read Corporate\nEmail: info@javelinminerals.com.auPage 3 of 4\n-Javelin Minerals Limited - Compelling gold-copper drill targets identified at Coogee Gold Project\nCompetent Persons Statement\nThe information in this report that relates to Exploration Targets and Exploration Results is based on information \ncompiled by Pedro Kastellorizos.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nSection: MARKET WRAP; Street Talk; Pg. 14\nLength: 455 words\nByline: Sarah Thompson, Kanika Sood and Emma Rapaport\nBody\nWith gold trading at record highs, investors and dealmakers in and around ASX gold stocks are making hay. One \ncompany, however, has remained uncharacteristically quiet.\nNewmont, the world's top gold producer caught headlines last year for its $26.3 billion merger with Australia's \nbiggest gold miner Newcrest, forming a $US59.5 billion dual-listed gold stock and pumping its long list of advisers \nup the M&A league table.\nAt the time, much was also made of its intention to divest six non-core assets once the acquisition wrapped up in \nNovember including WA's ageing Telfer gold mine and Havieron, which Newmont operates under a joint venture \nagreement with Greatland Gold (70 per cent/30 per cent). This was aimed at generating $US2 billion-plus ($3.05 \nbillion) in cash.\nWhile the sale of its Akyem gold mine in Ghana has reportedly drawn Chinese interest, investors haven't heard a \npeep about the local assets. Street Talk understands sell-side adviser Macquarie started preliminary preparation for \na sale process earlier in the year, but iced the mooted deal after processing operations at Telfer were suspended. \nHowever, it is understood MacCap's resources bankers are back on the tools, and soft soundings are under way.\nTelfer is a larger scale, producing asset, but it's best days are behind it. The mine hasn't made a lot of cash over the \nlast several years and would require a substantial commitment to rehabilitate it. However, its interaction with \nHavieron is interesting; one has the infrastructure, the other has the orebody. As such, they'll likely be sold together \nwith estimates around the $500 million mark.\nGiven its interest in Havieron, Greatland Gold is the obvious buyer. The London-listed firm also has pre-emptive \nrights, acquired when Newcrest and Greatland began the joint venture in 2020. Street Talk understands the Andrew \nForrest-backed company has been meeting with fund managers for months, making no secret of the fact they're \nkeen to consolidate its stake - and would use the associated raise to peg their Australian float. Investor sources told \nStreet Talk the last time they heard from Greatland was May when they were told the company was still waiting on \nsale terms from Newmont. Bank of America has been mandated on Greatland's potential ASX-listing.\nPage 2 of 2\nNewmont asset sales pegged for year end; Street Talk\nNorthern Star Resources and Evolution have both indicated a lack of interest in Telfer and Havieron, The \nAustralian Financial Review wrote in November. A mid-tier name like Genesis Minerals, Ramelius Resources, \nCapricorn Metals or Gold Road would be more likely candidates given the desire to increase market capitalisation \nand attract investors.\nRed 5/Silver Lake is also a contender on the back of it M&A ambitions and sizeable cash balance sheet.\nLoad-Date: August 25, 2024\nEnd of Document",

All \nparticipants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. \n[Operator Instructions].\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Mark Zeptner, Managing Director. Please go ahead.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Sigar. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to dial in this morning to our FY '24 \nresults call. Alongside me is Chief Financial Officer, Darren Millman, who will drill down into the financials after I've \ncovered off on the highlights. This morning, we have uploaded to the ASX platform, along with our website a \nPage 2 of 5\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\nnumber of documents, including our FY '24 financial results summary and the presentation, which we'll be largely \nspeaking to you this morning, and also our audited statutory financial report.\nAs mentioned initially discussed the high-level FY '24 results, then Darren will dive into a bit more detail, and then \nwe'll talk about the FY '25 outlook and also the dividend that we announced this morning. Once we have done that, \nthere will also be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions. So, in terms of the presentation, if we only hopefully \ngot that handy, we jump to Slide 3, with our mining and production highlights.\nAlthough we mined less ore tonnes in FY '24 compared to the previous year, the contained gold mined, which is \nwhat counts, was up on the prior year due to a higher mine grade. The primary driver of the lower tonnes was the \ncompletion of mining activities across the Edna May hub, most notably at Tampia, where mining activities were \ncompleted last year.\nIncreased ore from Eridanus and the introduction of Symes offset the stocking tonnes in part. The improved mine \ngrade was driven by 2 factors: increased tonnages and grade from Penny, which reported a mine grade just over 12 \ngrams per tonne for the year, and also a strong performance from Eridanus, which saw open pit tonnages at Mt \nMagnet increased 50%, but at a 60% higher grade than the prior year. If we move on to our processing activities, \ntonnes milled were up on the prior year, mainly as a result of additional haulage capacity across the Edna May hub.\nPleasingly, this increase in tonnes milled for the group was achieved despite the interruptions to the CV01 conveyor \nrepairs carried out in November, December last year at Mt Magnet. This increased throughput, combined with \nimproved milled grade resulted in a 22% increase in gold production to the record number of 293,000 ounces, \nwhich was at the upper end of our upgraded production guidance for FY '24.\nOn cost sales and sustaining costs as reported in the June quarterly was $15.83 an ounce, which is one of the best \nwithin our industry and something we're pretty proud of here at Ramelius. It is also most pleasing that we're able to \ndeliver these results with a declining TRIFR or total recordable injury frequency rate across the year and also \nachieved a 12-month LTI-free milestone in May 2024.\nBefore I hand over to Darren, I'd just like to note this is the second year in a row where I've been able to comment \nthat the annual results on just about every metric are an improvement on the prior year. And importantly, these \nresults have not only been driven by the A dollar gold price, but also our low-cost base, which I believe distinguish \nus from our peers, and we do anticipate that the positive results will continue into FY '25. Over to you, Darren.\nDarren Millman\nThanks, Mark. For those following on the presentation, I'll initially speaking to Slide 4. Before moving on to the \ndiscussion of earnings, I'd like to highlight that I will be talking to our underlying earnings. When we refer to \nunderlying earnings, we are essentially backing out the large nonrecurring items in an attempt to communicate what \nwe believe is the most reflective results from our operations for the year and appropriate comparative to the prior \nyear. The main difference between our underlying earnings and our statutory net profit after tax earnings for the \ncurrent year relates to acquired tax losses.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nIn our underlying earnings, we removed the tax benefit of $23.9 million associated with the recognition of tax losses \nthat was acquired as part of the Musgrave and Brake acquisitions made in FY '23 and early FY '24, respectively. Of \nthis, $14.6 million remains on our balance sheet for utilization on future periods. Indeed, since FY '19, Ramelius \nhas acquired tax losses over the years to the tune of $24.5 million. This is a true realized savings in cash tax \npayment savings.\nLastly, before moving on to the financials, we have for reference, provided a few appendices in this presentation, \nwhich reconciles the underlying earnings and cash flow for the statutory reports for the financial statements.Page 3 of 5\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\nI trust you'll find this useful. As a reminder for FY '24, the company achieved record production, record earnings, \nrecord cash flow and a record dividend with the backdrop, happy to discuss the numbers in a little bit more detail. \nWe achieved a top line revenue of $882.6 million, which was 40% up from the prior year with gold sales of 293,966 \nounces at a realized price of 2,995 per ounce, a 16% increase on the prior year.\nThe increased revenue was not only due to higher gold price, which added $119 million, but also increased gold \nproduction, which added $131 million when compared to FY '23. EBITDA of $462.2 million was up 67% on the prior \nyear and represents a margin of 52%, a $1,573 per ounce sold.\nOn both metrics, we continue to be at the top of our peer group. Net profit after tax of $200.3 million was up 166% \non prior year, with earnings being driven by improved grades, with lower cost of production per ounce and a strong \ncurrency of AU gold price. Statutory earnings per share of $19.5 were up 181% on the prior year. Further analysis \non EBITDA can be found on Slide 6, which shows the positive trend from H1 to H2 with the EBITDA margin \nincreasing 40% in H1 to 60% in H2.\nIn addition to this, the earnings profile for Mt Magnet and Edna May can be seen with Mt Magnet being the clear \ndriver in earnings recording EBITDA margin of 79% in H2.\nLooking at Mt Magnet in isolation on Slide 7 shows EBITDA margin for FY '24 of 2,121 per ounce. This earning \ncapacity of Mt Magnet bodes well for the future with the production center poised of further growth in FY '25.\nThis will be driven by increased production from Penny, the introduction of Q and the exciting upside potential from \nEridanus to be open pit or underground. Indeed, we see FY '25 as another very strong year of cash build and \nearnings. It's worth highlighting in FY '25, we are guiding to a 50% increase in production at the Mt Magnet hub.\nMoving to cash. We believe it is important -- one of the most important financial measures of our business, and \nSlide 8 and 9, you will see our key cash metrics. Our operating cash flow for the year was $445 million or 1,515 per \nounce. Investing cash flow totaled $242.7 million, which includes investments into our existing business for plant \nequipment, mine development and exploration of $123.1 million, our acquisition of Musgrave and our strategic \ninvestment in Spartan.\nThe free cash flow being the net of operating and investing cash flow was $212.1 million after returning $17.3 \nmillion to shareholders via our FY '23 dividend and lease payments, total cash inflow for the year was $173.3 \nmillion.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nOur low-cost production, coupled with our strong Australian gold price resulted in Ramelius returning $315.8 million \nin underlying free cash flow for FY '24. Once again, one of the best returns amongst our peers. The resulting cash \nand gold at the end of the year was $446.6 million. Turning now to Slide 10 and our cash balance sheet, which we \nconsider to be one of our key strengths. Our cash and gold bullion on hand are complemented with a further 65,000 \nounces of gold contained in current stockpiles and within circuit, which we will monetize in the coming 12 months, \nleaving Ramelius with excellent liquidity.\nIn addition to this, in July, we executed a new finance facility for $175 million, which is an upsized replacement of \nour previous $100 million facility. Facility was undrawn at the reporting date remains as of the same to this day. As \nwe mentioned in the past, we're in the process of progressively reducing our hedge book, which at 30 June 2024, \nsat at 155,000 ounces at an average price of $3,081 per ounce. The only new hedging put in place recently was \nthat we put hedges of 41,500 ounces at Edna May production out to January 2025, ensuring that the cost will not be \nsold below 3,400 per ounce, locking in meaningful cash flow from the remaining Edna May stockpiles. With that, I'll \nhand it back to Mark.\nMark ZeptnerPage 4 of 5\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\nThanks, Darren. So, if we can jump to Slide 11 to 13 now touching on our portfolio and guidance for FY '25. On gold \nproduction, you will see we expect a higher margin that Magnet operation to make up a higher proportion of gold \nproduction with Edna May to be placed in care and maintenance once the existing stockpiles across that hub are \nprocessed. Overall, group production for FY '25 is expected to be comparable to FY '24. Our all-in sustaining cost is \nalso expected to be largely in line with FY '24, but with a higher gold price, which we have assumed at $3,500 per \nounce as per the chart on Slide 12, plus our existing hedge book, will see us deliver some 92,000 ounces at $29.45 \nper ounce in FY '25.\nWe'll see a further increase in cash margins. Production and the result in lower all-in sustaining cost is expected to \nbe weighted to H2 of FY '25. And finally, on our guidance for FY '25, I'd like to make 2 points, which we have made \nbefore. Whilst Edna May does have a higher all-in sustaining cost, there is approximately $500 an ounce of this -- \nthat relates to noncash drawdowns of existing stockpiles. And secondly, we are expecting a notable reduction in our \ngrowth capital spend in FY '25, particularly in the second half.\nWith the development of leveraging off in the first half, leveraging off our existing Magnet plant, infrastructure, such \nas airstrips and camps, realizing true regional synergies there. We like to think we have a good reputation in the \nmarket for doing what we say and delivering on our promises. We see no reason for this not to continue into FY '25 \nand also look forward to presenting a revised Mt Magnet mine plan in the new year once we have the optimal \ndesign for Eridanus open pit or underground. Turning to Slide 14. Perhaps the highlight, our declared dividend for \nFY '24.\nWe're proud of our track record on dividends. And today, we are not only declaring our sixth consecutive dividend \nabout 150% increase in the prior year to $0.05 per share fully franked. This represents a payout ratio of 27% of free \ncash flow. In approving the final dividend, the Board gave consideration to the additional strategic investment in \nSpartan, internal growth opportunities at Eridanus, and potential mill expansions at Mt Magnet as well as potential \ncapital commitment requirements for Rebecca Roe. The dividend represents a yield of 2.6% based on 30 June \nshare price and a total shareholder return over the last 5 years of 21% per annum.\nOur dividend reinvestment plan has now been in place for a couple of years now with last year's participation at \n22%. It is pleasing to see an increasing number of shareholders opting to take up the opportunity to use their \ndividends to purchase additional Ramelius shares. That opportunity will again be available with the price of shares \nto be calculated at a 2% discount to the 10-day VWAP from the date of election. Last year's dividend payment \namounted to $22.3 million in cash and reinvestment this year. The return will be up to $57.2 million, which will be \npaid in October.\nLast slide, moving on to Slide 15, where we're looking at our focus areas, I'll skip to the final 2 areas being \nexploration opportunities and near-term catalysts. We have budgeted to invest another $40 million to $50 million in \nexploration this year, with opportunities at Mt Magnet, Penny and Rebecca Roe areas shaping us having high \npotential to deliver additional resource ounces and further bolstering reserves. There are a number of near-term \ncatalysts that we see, including the progression of drilling at Eridanus and Galaxy, which will culminate more likely \nin an upgraded Mt Magnet mine plan.\nIn addition to this, we look forward to providing updated mineral resource inventory for Roe, and ultimately, the \npublication of the associated PFS for the combined Rebecca Roe project. That concludes the presentation.\nI'll now hand back to the operator, Sigar, you can open the line for questions, please.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Paul Kaner from Ord Minnett.Page 5 of 5\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript\nPaul Kaner\nCouple here, if I may. So firstly, on tax, thanks for giving that income tax guidance for FY '25. But how should we \nthink about cash tax paid for FY '24?\nDarren Millman\nYes. Thanks, Paul. As I noted in the numbers there, we had that advantage in 2024, in 2025 -- or 2025 and beyond, \nwe serve approximately $25 million available. In 2025, we're probably expecting around $15 million to have a \nsimilar tax cash benefit is our expectations for 2025.\nPaul Kaner\nYes, that's great. And then maybe one for you, Mark. Just on capital returns. I think your payout was about 27% of \nfree cash flow and your policy allows for up to 30%. I guess, any thoughts on changing this policy?\nOr are you sort of happy capping at 30% and then, I guess, using the remainder of the free cash flow on sort of \norganic and inorganic opportunities?\nMark Zeptner\nYes. We obviously had a lengthy discussion at Board level. To summarize, we're happy with our policy. We didn't \nquite go all the way to 30%. But we like -- we have got a number of internal projects coming up.\nAnd we felt that we struck a balance between returns to shareholders and providing cash for those projects.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now hand back to Mr. Zeptner for closing \nremarks.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Sigar. I can't remember the last time we only had one question, but we must have covered everything. \nSo, to wrap up, just 3 points, a record year for earnings and cash generation in FY '24 for Ramelius, a similarly \nstrong outlook for FY '25 and beyond. And a $0.05 fly-free dividend announced today being the sixth consecutive \nyear of dividend payments, a 150% increase on the prior year with over $130 million potentially returned to \nshareholders.

This was attributed to improved mine grades and increased throughput, resulting in a significant revenue increase of 40% to $882.6 million.\n\n2. **Strong Cash Flow and Dividend Declaration**: The company reported a free cash flow of $315.8 million for FY '24, with a declared dividend of $0.05 per share, representing a 150% increase from the prior year. This reflects a commitment to returning value to shareholders while maintaining a balance for future investments.\n\n3. **Operational Challenges and Strategic Focus**: Despite achieving record results, Ramelius faced operational challenges, including the completion of mining activities at the Edna May hub. The company plans to place Edna May in care and maintenance, focusing on increasing production at the Mt Magnet hub, which is expected to see a 50% production increase in FY '25.\n\n4. **Future Growth and Exploration Investments**: Ramelius has budgeted $40 million to $50 million for exploration in FY '25, targeting high-potential areas such as Mt Magnet and Penny. The company anticipates further growth driven by the development of the Eridanus project and the potential for additional resource ounces.\n\n5. **Hedging Strategy and Market Position**: The company is progressively reducing its hedge book, with 155,000 ounces hedged at an average price of $3,081 per ounce. This strategy aims to lock in cash flow while navigating market fluctuations, positioning Ramelius favorably within the competitive landscape of the gold mining industry.",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 927 words\nHighlight: Javelin Minerals has increased the JORC resource estimate for its Coogee gold-copper project near \nKambalda in Western Australia by a whopping 158 per cent.\nBody\nJavelin Minerals has increased the JORC resource estimate for its Coogee gold-copper project near Kambalda in \nWestern Australia's Goldfields region by 158 per cent to 3.65 million tonnes at 1.08 grams per tonne gold and 1.01 \nmillion tonnes at 0.41 per cent copper.\nThe company says the significant upgrade relates to a revised gold content of 126,685 ounces and was determined \nfrom an independent review of historic estimates, assumptions and drilling. Its total supergene and primary \nindicated resource is 963,242 tonnes at 1.31g/t gold for 40,562 ounces, while the complementary copper resource \nadds 4133 tonnes of the red metal.\nPrevious operator Ramelius Resources' 2022 estimate for Coogee put the resource at 1.43 million tonnes at an \naverage grade of 1.07g/t gold for 49,034 ounces, of which 614,000 tonnes at 1.43g/t gold for 28,252 ounces lay \nwithin the total indicated category for supergene and primary ores.\nA key consideration in the upgrade from the previous 2022 mineral resource estimate includes an increase in the \ndepth of the overall resource envelope, taking it from 90m below surface - the original open-pit resource limit - to \nnow include gold and copper mineralisation down to 225m. It is a significant depth increase of 135m.\n'The scope for growth at Coogee is clearly immense. The mineralisation is open and we have numerous compelling \ntargets.'\nJavelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell\nThe new estimate also considers a jump in the assumed rate of recovery from the 96 per cent experienced during \nprevious treatment of open-pit ores, to 96.4 per cent following metallurgical testwork by Javelin, which it says is \nconsistent with processing figures from the previous owner's open-pit operation in 2013.\nJavelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell said: \"This is a strong result which provides a solid platform on \nwhich to build a very substantial gold inventory on the doorstep of the world-class St Ives Goldfield. The scope for \ngrowth at Coogee is clearly immense. The mineralisation is open and we have numerous compelling targets.\"\nPage 2 of 2\nJavelin rolls out 158 per cent increase in Coogee gold\nThe company says gold mineralisation at Coogee extends along strike for 1.2km at an average width of 350m, \nextends to more than 225m vertically and exhibits strong potential to extend along strike to the north-west and also \ndown-dip.\nNews of the upgrade comes hard on the heels of Javelin's recent revelation that it had identified eight copper-gold \nexploration targets at its Coogee project after independent and collaborative reviews of reprocessed geophysical \nand other data. Of key significance in the present resource upgrade context is that initial interpretations of two of \nthose targets point to a prevailing trend of north or north-westerly and down-dip extension gold mineralisation \npotential in the area immediately north of the old Coogee open pit.\nThe two recently-identified targets include a big untested magnetic anomaly just 300m north/north-east from the \nCoogee open pit, which management believes could host gold-copper mineralisation. It is the company's strongest \nanomaly in its Coogee mining lease and is its first-priority target.\nThe anomaly is modelled to lie at a depth of 175m below surface, directly below the main gold-copper \nmineralisation defined by previous reverse-circulation (RC) and diamond drilling. The compnay says the target has \nnever been tested and could be a deep gold-copper mineralised zone.\nHistoric drilling within the Coogee mining lease area that also defined two magnetic mineralised copper-gold trends \nnorth and west of the Coogee deposit and currently remain open along strike and at depth, also support the \nmodelling.\nJavelin recently engaged independent geological consultancy OmniGeoX to compile, review and interpret all \nexisting project drilling and geophysical data to help plan an exploration drilling program, with a view to making the \nearliest possible start on testing of priority targets.\nThe Coogee gold project tenements are on the north side of Lake Lefroy in WA's Eastern Goldfields, about 20km \nnorth-east of Kambalda, which is among the State's earliest nickel mining centres after the original deposit was \ndiscovered in 1954. The mine opened in 1967 and was operated by WMC Resources, which was taken over by \nBHP in 2005.\nThe project lies within a highly-fertile greenstone belt with multiple gold deposits and abundant gold occurrences \nnearby including Coogee, Salt Creek, Daisy-Milano and Lucky Bay, in addition to the major St Ives gold camp.\nThe Coogee gold deposit was discovered in the mid-1990s by Sovereign Resources and was mined by Ramelius \nin 2013 via an open pit about 70m deep, reporting 147,400 tonnes produced at 4.7g/t gold for 20,400 ounces. \nRamelius treated its Coogee ore by conventional carbon-in-leach processing at the Burbanks Mill, south of \nCoolgardie, reporting 96.4 per cent metallurgical recovery.\nJavelin believes there is the potential for a \"big gold-copper system\" that could lie at depth to the north-west.\nThat belief is further supported by company's third priority geophysical target that lies about 750m west of the \nCoogee open pit and is also associated with a magnetic trend that is open to the north-west. The anomaly has not \nbeen followed up, despite the encouragement of a single drillhole put in by Ramelius that jagged 23m going 0.38g/t \ngold.\nJavelin is now planning its next phase of extensional drilling to the west of the new resource envelope in a bid to \nincrease the mineral resource estimate.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Gold has also had double-digit returns in \nmost other major currencies, including the Australian dollar, where it has surged by an impressive 25 per cent.\nThese gains have been driven by investor optimism about upcoming US interest rate cuts and lingering geopolitical \nrisks. In the past three interest rate easing -cycles in the US, the US dollar gold price has averaged an increase of \n40 per cent.\nDespite the gold price being near all-time high levels, gold equities have underperformed. Since August 2020, when \nthe Australian gold equities index was at its all-time high, gold equities have underperformed the gold price by about \n45 per cent. In our view, the potential for gold equities to catch up is a significant opportunity for investors, given the \nfundamentals for gold remain very strong.\nTo date, gold's performance has been due to significant buying from central banks and eastern investors who have \nmainly acquired physical gold. In contrast, western investors, who typically favour gold mining equities, have for the \nlarge part not participated in the gold run so far.\nRecent figures indicate that the average investor currently holds less than 1 per cent of gold in their total portfolio, \nwhich is significantly less than the four-decade average of 2 per cent. This is even lower than the estimated 6 per \ncent in 1980 when the last inflation-led gold bull market occurred and the gold price reached its all-time high of \nabout $US2850 per ounce on an inflation-adjusted basis. The potential entry of western investors and a higher gold \nprice is likely to be a tailwind for the gold equities to rerate higher. The fight for relevance in investor portfolios has \nbeen challenging for the gold sector versus other more favoured sectors, such as technology. Persistent cost \npressures have negatively impacted gold miners' ability to generate free cashflow and provide an attractive return to \ninvestors.\nHowever, with gold prices now rising faster than inflation, cash margins are expanding. We estimate that the \naverage cash margin for the Australian gold miners is at record levels of $1700 an ounce of gold produced. Recent \ncompany results indicate this is being translated into financial performance, with Australian gold miners such as \nPage 2 of 2\nA golden opportunity as stocks trail the commodity's price\nNorthern Star and Ramelius generating strong free cashflow, allowing them to return capital to investors through \nincreased dividends.\nThe relative valuation of gold miners versus the rest of the market is also attractive. Based on forward earnings \nmultiples, Aus-tralian gold miners are trading at a 40 per cent discount to the rest of the market. In addition, the \nmarket consensus gold price for the next 12 months is about 10 per cent lower than the current gold price of $3780 \nin Australian dollars. Should the gold price remain at these levels for an extended period, then the market will need \nto upgrade its forward earnings forecasts, making gold equities even cheaper. Gold miners' cashflow generation \npotential and attractive valuation compared to the rest of the market cannot be ignored by the market for too long.\nThe disconnect in equity performance is even more apparent in the gold developers and explorers. The \noutperformance of developers and explorers is typically later in the cycle when investors are looking for value \nfurther down the mine life cycle. At current discounted levels, it remains cheaper to acquire someone else's ounces \nthan it is to discover new ounces. The potential for sector consolidation could further enhance the appeal of gold \nminers as an investment, particularly in an environment where the price of physical gold continues to rise, and more \ninvestors seek exposure.\nThe Victor Smorgon Group has been well placed in gold for some time now and has capitalised on the record run of \nthe precious metal. Our Global Multi Strategy Fund and Resources Gold Fund can invest internationally, and prefer \nstocks that are attractively priced, operate in safe jurisdictions and are forecast to generate strong cashflow yields in \nthe next year.

Well-\ndeveloped Cu-Au horizon identified at the Centre Forest Prospect ('Centre Forest'), interpreted to be hosted within a \nprospective regional shear corridor that follows the margins of an interpreted intrusion. Exciting opportunity to not \nonly explore for higher grade Cu-Au zones at Centre Forest but also regionally along the targeted shear corridor \n(24km of strike), where minimal exploration has been undertaken to date\nContact:\nPeter Woodman\nTel: +61 8 9322 6322\nPROJECT BACKGROUND\nUlarring, consisting of tenements E70/4686 and E70/4901 (cumulatively 187km2 ) is located 100km northeast of \nPerth. Ularring is situated within the Archaean Yilgarn Craton and borders the Southwest and Youanmi Terranes. \nPage 2 of 3\n-Constellation Resources Limited - COMPLETION OF ULARRING COPPER GOLD PROJECT ACQUISITION\nThe Ularring tenements overlie broad acreage farms and capture the Shires of Goomalling, Cunderdin and \nNortham. A series of access agreements that allow exploration within private properties are in place. The region is \nknown to host several major deposits that are intrusion related, such as the Boddington Copper-Gold mine (11Moz \nAu and 1Mt of copper produced, hosted in a sheared Intrusive related setting1 ) and Caravel Minerals' (ASX: CVV) \nCaravel Copper Project (a porphyry hosted Cu-Mo-Ag-Au deposit containing 3Mt Cu, 61Kt Mo, 895koz Au and \n46Moz Ag in Mineral Resource2 ). A separate style of deposit in the region is the recently discovered Julimar \nProject (a mafic hosted PGE-Ni deposit) owned by Chalice Mining Ltd (ASX: CHN).\nCENTRE FOREST PROSPECT\nCentre Forest is the most advanced and explored prospect within the Ularring Project. A welldeveloped Cu-Au \nhorizon has been identified at Centre Forest which is interpreted to be hosted within a prospective regional shear \ncorridor that follows the margins of an interpreted intrusion. A number of phases of drilling have been undertaken \nhistorically at Centre Forest by various exploration companies, however, there has been minimal programs in the \nlast decade. Centre Forest represents an exciting opportunity to follow-up on previous drilling with the intention of \nidentifying higher grade Cu-Au zones. The results from previous drilling programs at Centre Forest have confirmed \na continuous, broad zone of Cu-Au mineralisation over a strike length of 1.1km and remains open when utilising a \n>0.1g/t Au cutoff. The Cu-Au mineralisation is interpreted to be best developed along a highly altered sheared \nmargin of a granitoid intrusion and is hosted both in oxides (saprolite) from the surface and in the fresh rock located \ndown dip. The associated mineral assemblage comprises quartz-garnet-biotite-cordierite-orthopyroxene with a \nsulphide suite comprising of pyrrhotite-chalcopyrite with trace levels of bismuthate. Other metal associations with \nthe gold mineralisation include elevated levels of silver, bismuth, molybdenum and tungsten. The sheared contact is \nbelieved to be part of the regional Meenar Shear Corridor.\nCOMPETENT PERSONS STATEMENT\nThe information in this announcement that relates to exploration results has been extracted from an ASX \nAnnouncement dated 12 September 2024 which is available to view at www.constellationresources.com.au.

A giant new mill is currently being built at Kalgoorlie's revamped Super Pit.\nPage 2 of 2\nAs gold bounces higher, upgrades abound among stocks\n\"The upgrades for the mid-cap producers are mixed. Lower cost producers Capricorn and Ramelius see modest \nupgrades of 13 per cent and 15 per cent for FY25, while Bellevue's earnings forecast rises 19 per cent,\" Bairstow \nand Streater say.\n\"Higher-cost producers and companies that have recently completed acquisitions that carry higher depreciation \nunderpin higher upgrades.\" African producers Perseus Mining and West African Resources have seen 20 per cent \nand 13 per cent jumps in their price targets, with a number of explorers in Western Australia also seeing their price \ntargets lifted. Earnings upgrades for FY25 and FY26 are 26 per cent and 35 per cent respectively for the cohort, \nwith FY26-27 upgrades of 69-78 per cent for Perseus and 61-63 per cent for West African Resources.\nThere are some recommendation upgrades here as well. Ramelius, Bellevue and Ora Banda have all been moved \nfrom hold to buy, taking the bulk of the Australian gold sector into buy territory.\nSpartan Resources, which has risen 225 per cent over the past year as the remarkably high grades of its Never \nNever and Peppers discoveries near Mt Magnet were revealed, has been moved from a hold to a spec buy with a \n$1.55 price target.\nBairstow and Streater say their preference is for stocks with \"strong organic growth potential\", led by Genesis \nMinerals, Westgold and Capricon, with Genesis and Capricorn's five-year CAGR of 20 per cent doubling the rest of \ntheir coverage universe.\nThey say there remains strong value across the sector, with De Grey Mining, and African development plays WIA \nGold and Tolu Minerals also key picks.\n\"Our bullish outlook for the yellow metal and material upgrades to our earnings outlook underpins our shift to a \npositive view across all stocks in the sector,\" Bairstow and Streater say.\nThe bullish new gold sector upgrade from Argonaut comes after Streater initiated coverage on Turaco Gold on the \nback of a site visit at the Afema project in Cote d'Ivoire. Since acquiring the site in November last year, drilling has \nunderpinned a maiden resource of 2.52 million ounces at 1.2 grams per tonne. Argonaut has placed a spec buy \nrating and 49c valuation on the $240m junior, which plans to complete a pre-feasibility study by the first half of 2026 \nat Afema.\nFormerly in the portfolio of African gold giant Endeavour Mining, Turaco purchased its majority 51 per cent stake \nlast year, with the right to move to 70 per cent once the PFS is complete for the payment of $US8.75m in cash and \n$46.5m to JV partner Sodim.\nStreater says Argonaut estimates $425m of pre-production capex and working capital requirements will be needed, \nwith Turaco likely to move to a 100 per cent ownership level, converting Sodim's minority interest to a 2 per cent \nNSR royalty.\nThe Cote d'Ivoire government would take a 10 per cent free-carried interest in the project with a five-year tax \nholiday, 0.9 per cent NSR royalty to state miner Sodemi and 6.5 per cent state royalty on gold sales over \n$US2000/oz.

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 1485 words\nHighlight: Javelin Minerals has picked up the historic Eureka open pit north of Kalgoorlie where it is seeking to \nprove up its theory that more golden riches are lurking nearby.\nBody\nJavelin Minerals has picked up the historic Eureka open pit north of Kalgoorlie from Delta Lithium where it is \nseeking to prove up a theory that more golden riches may be lurking nearby. The move follows the spectacular \nsuccess of Spectrum and Spartan Resources. Both found multi-million dollar gold deposits about 300m north of \ntheir mothballed open pits and Javelin already has some intriguing drill holes about 300m north of Eureka \nsuggesting there is more gold out there.\nPerth broker Shaw and Partners already has firm commitments for $3m at $.0025 a share (including a 1 for 2 option \nexercisable at $.004 within 2 years) to fund the deal. Under the terms of the sale Delta will pick up $1.5m in cash \nand a further $1.5m in Javelin shares at A$0.003 per share.\nIf Javelin manages to get Eureka back into production or increase the inferred resource to 200,000 ounces of gold \nDelta will pick up another $1m in Javelin shares. Notably, Eureka already comes gift-wrapped with a 112,000 ounce \n1.42 gram per tonne starter resource.\nThe initial shares issued to Delta Lithium will be subject to escrow for 12 months.\nThe old Eureka open pit sits about 50km north-west of Kalgoorlie in the prospective sequence of mafic and \nultramafic rocks which forms part of the more than 290km-long\nKalgoorlie-Menzies leg of the 700km-long Norseman to Wiluna Greenstone belt.\nImportantly it is only 20kms north-west of the Paddington gold mine that has been mined for years and is well \nknown for doing toll treating deals.\nPaddington has turned out more than four million ounces during its production history from the same prospective \nrock sequence as mapped at Eureka, which is also held to be a structural setting similar to the half-million ounce \nZoroastrian gold deposit at Bardoc Gold, only 1.4km east of the Eureka deposit.\nThe Eureka mine site was mined for the most part in the early 1990's and was subject to small scale tribute mining \nagain in 2018 by Kalgoorlie identity Graham McGarry who pulled a bit over 5000 ounces from the old pit at 3.16 g/t \ngold. However, Javelin says prior drilling was poorly targeted at the project and was not deep enough to follow the \ninterpreted structures properly.\nPage 2 of 3\nJavelin rolls dice to replicate Spectrum, Spartan success at Eureka\nJavelin has a theory that the old-timers were too focussed on the existing pit and given the ordinary gold prices at \nthe time, were not motivated to spend too much money exploring the areas around it.\nSpectrum Metals and Spartan Resources both spectacularly proved this was a mistake at their respective projects. \nSpectrum stumbled across the Penny North gold deposit just 300m north of its old mined out Penny West open pit \nin WA and subsequently sold the whole company to Ramelius Resources for $230m (which increased dramatically \non settlement day as the deal involved Ramelius shares that ran hard between the announcement of the deal and \nthe settlement of the deal). The maiden resource at Penny North was just over 300,000 ounces going a whopping \n16.8 g/t gold.\nMore recently Spartan employed the same near mine theory when it stubbed its toe on the 1.5m ounce Never \nNever discovery lurking just 300m north of its mothballed Gilbey's open pit in WA's Murchison.\nOminously, the Eureka project already has sniffs of gold 300m north of the old Eureka pit too - some of which are in \nounce to the tonne dirt like a 4m intercept going 32.6 g/t gold from 104m. Another previous 1m hit came in at an \nimpressive 14.72 g/t gold and notably, was from surface, demonstrating the potential range of mineralisation.\nAbout 600m north of the old pit, Javelin has even more impressive numbers to follow up on like 4m at 135 g/t gold \nfrom 53m and 4m grading 11 g/t gold from 42m.\nIn fact, the entire area is littered with old drill numbers that are begging to see the drill bit again. For example, \ndirectly under the old pit a 23m hit going 3.32 g/t gold from 112m and another 5m hit further up from 33m going an \nimpressive 25.6 g/t gold both need more attention.\nThere are even hints of mineralisation about 300m to the south of Eureka which include 13m at 2.22 g/t gold from \n51m and 6m at 13.88 g/t gold from 38m.\nWhilst some of the drill intersections that require follow up may seem remarkable in grade, they are perhaps not all \nthat remarkable when considering the project was first mined from 1897 up to 1940 for a total 809 tonnes averaging \na crazy 27.8 g/t gold - no doubt Javelin will be counting on some of that dirt being left behind by the old-timers.\nNotably, Eureka is not Javelin's first rodeo and is an extension of the same near mine exploration theory it is \nemploying at its Coogee gold project at the north end of Lake Lefroy, just east of Kambalda and about 55 km south-\neast of Kalgoorlie.\nThe Coogee gold deposit was discovered in the mid-1990s by Sovereign Resources next to Gold Fields' world-\nclass St Ives gold mining complex.\nJavelin acquired 100 per cent of the Coogee project in 2020 from Ramelius Resources and Serena Minerals for \nequity and both companies are now major shareholders.\nRamelius mined the Coogee open pit for gold to 70m depth until 2013, producing 20,400 ounces at a respectable \naverage head grade of 4.7g/t gold. Ramelius subsequently became a major shareholder in Javelin.\nThe Coogee mining lease has been a key focus for Javelin's since acquisition. The Coogee open pit and its \nimmediate surrounds have not been subject to any systematic exploration drilling since Ramelius ended mining at \nthe site.\nWhen Javelin acquired the project, it contained an estimated 10,600 ounce gold resource at 3.4g/t gold which, after \na 12-month drilling program, then jumped to 49,000 ounces at 1.07g/t gold in 2022.\nIn August, Javelin announced the Coogee gold project hosts a recently upgraded JORC 2012 compliant mineral \nresource amounting to 3.65 million tonnes at 1.08g/t gold for 126,685 ounces of gold and 1.01 million tonnes at \n0.41 per cent copper for 4133t tonnes of the red metal in a separate inferred \"copper domain\", north of the old pit.Page 3 of 3\nJavelin rolls dice to replicate Spectrum, Spartan success at Eureka\nOnce again, modelling shows gold mineralisation extending north along strike for 1.2km at an average width of \n350m and to more than 225m vertically under the old Coogee open pit and still open to the north and down-dip.\nJavelin upped its drilling metreage for the greater Coogee area from 2500m to 3000m for a planned reverse-\ncirculation and diamond drilling program set to be launched in mid-November.\nThe decision came after the company identified several opportunities to extend known mineralisation below the old \nopen pit and in extensions towards Coogee North and beyond to a pronounced magnetic high feature.\nThe proposed drilling was prompted by results from Javelin's extensive reviews of reprocessed geophysical and \nother data which had lifted Coogee's resource estimate to the current inventory figure of 126,685 ounces of gold.\nJavelin's recent full data review and new magnetics reinterpretations and modelling have identified eight new \ntantalising geophysical targets.\nIt will now direct its focus toward testing five of the nearest priority walk-up targets at the Coogee mine - and also \nnorth and west of the old mine - including a prominent and curious looking ovoid magnetic anomaly in the south-\neast of its exploration licence, adjacent to the mining lease.\nReview work has also identified a new 3km-long potential gold trend west of and parallel to the Coogee pit structure \nand Javelin believes there is the potential there for a \"big gold-copper system\" that could lie at depth to the north-\nwest.\nJavelin says previous drillholes at Coogee North were also not deep enough to test the nearby screaming magnetic \nanomaly which could represent a potential repetition of the historic Coogee lode and the company has earmarked \nten drillholes for 1650m to test it.\nSignificantly, once Javelin dials in the current Eureka gold mine resource and adds on its Coogee resource it will \nnow have a total resource endowment of 238,700 ounces of gold in two of the best mining addresses in Australia.\nIt is probably fair to say that Javelin has been in something of a slumber for a couple of years however since falling \nunder the control of Executive Chairman and well known West Perth corporate finance player Brett Mitchell back in \nFebruary, it has forged a new way forward and eked out a solid \"near mine exploration strategy.\"\nHalf of that strategy came from a strategic review of Coogee instigated by Mitchell that ended in some screaming \nnear mine targets that look like they are begging to be drilled. Eureka now gives Javelin a quinella of projects that \nalmost look exactly the same that will likely both benefit from exactly the same brownfields near mine exploration \nstrategy.\nAnd who knows, maybe Javelin will complete the trifecta of companies that have successfully employed this \"old \nriches left behind\" strategy if it can emulate the success of both Spartan and Spectrum.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Spartan's shares closed at $1.24, after they had hit a 2024 \nhigh last month above $1.60.\nRamelius, which is in a $455m net cash position, pounced on Spartan in June, buying an 8.9 per cent stake at 92c \na share, so perhaps the stock needs to fall further before it becomes interested in a deal.\nNorthern Star is also in a strong position for a buyout, with $358m of net cash. Its most logical target is De Grey \nMining, whose shares also fell more than 5 per cent on Thursday.\nPart of the reason behind a rally in the gold price in the past two months has been expectations of geopolitical \ninstability and an uncertain outcome in the US election.\nBut the sweeping victory of Donald Trump in the race for the White House has caught out some gold traders, with \nthe result creating more certainty about US policy.\nPage 2 of 2\nGolden chance for miners to buy out rivals amid commodity sell-off - DATA ROOM\nAlso sending the gold price lower on Thursday was a rally in the US dollar following the election outcome, with the \nUS economy expected to be stronger under Mr Trump.\nHowever, while gold may be volatile for about two months as the market assesses the impact of Mr Trump's \nleadership, if he introduces trading tariffs on other countries such as China, and the US dollar remains high, that \nwould lead to global inflation.\nAnd inflation usually supports a higher gold price.\nThe same would be said about more geopolitical tension, should it occur under Mr Trump.\nGroups that were also looking to raise equity may now have second thoughts over doing so before Christmas, or \nmay raise less funds and at a lower price. Another plus for gold miners wanting to do deals following the election of \nMr Trump is that it may be easier to come across financing for transactions at better rates, sources say.\nLoad-Date: November 7, 2024\nEnd of Document",

Calibre Mining Corp is one of those that we like that will \nsignificantly increase their production of gold in the second quarter, they're saying, of next year, but we think a little \nbit earlier.\n\"The CEO Darren Hall is an Australian with significant experience and we think that it's an interesting project. It's \ngoing to keep growing but also generating good cash, fully funded with a strong balance sheet.\" Carbon capers The \ndecarbonisation strategy has grown from 3 per cent of the overall portfolio weighting in the global multi-strategy \nfund to 18 per cent today.\nMost of that is in copper, with VSG sidestepping the opaque and volatile lithium market that surged to record highs \nin 2022 before crashing to loss-making levels this year.\nSubstitution from aluminium and scrap could cap hopes from red metal optimists that copper could surge beyond \nthe $US5/lb record prices seen earlier this year to $US6, $US8 or even $US10/lb. But portfolio manager Ben Salter \nremains cautiously upbeat that supply will struggle to keep pace with demand as the electrification trend continues.\n\"We're probably conservatively bullish I would say,\" Salter says. \"I'd say the market will be balanced next year but \ntight, so not a lot of room for error. You can look at what happened in Panama (where the government suddenly \nclosed First Quantum's Cobre Panama mine last year).\n\"It took 400,000 tonnes of copper out of the market and that had a positive impact on everyone.\n\"Over time, we think with the electrification of everything \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 probably the use of copper in grid spending especially \nhelped by data centres (and) China electrification, we think copper will be in demand more than can be met by \nsupply. Over the medium to long term there's a strong case for copper prices' escalation, but not immediately or not \nspectacularly.\" Salter said that should facilitate good margins for producers and developers with good projects, with \ncurrent prices around $US9000/tonne.\nIn Australia, VSG likes MAC Copper, which owns the soon to be 50,000 tonnes per annum Cobar mine in NSW. \nInternationally, NGEx Minerals is on its radar. Part of the Lundin Group that recently dealt half of the Filo Del Sol \nand Josemaria projects in Argentina to BHP for over $US3bn, NGEx owns three large copper projects in \nArgentina's Andes.

We have identified \nkey gold indicators along the 950m strike from drill hole CORC154 south of the pit to CORC166 about 450m north \nof the current pit.'\nJavelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell\nThe previous exploration by Ramelius resulted in a shallow, JORC-compliant resource estimated at 126,685 \nounces of gold - with about 4133t of copper - which Javelin is confident additional drilling will add to.\nJavelin intends to scout-out possible north and north-west continuity and extensions of the Coogee pit \nmineralisation inferred from a pronounced \"bullseye\" magnetic anomaly - referred to as \"CG-01\u2033 - about 300m north \nof the old Coogee open pit.\nPage 2 of 2\nAssays pending from Javelin Coogee copper-gold drilling in WA\nThe company believes the extensions could reveal the deeper down-dip potential of Coogee North. Notably, a \nsecond new magnetic target \"CG-02\" exists about 400m west of CG-01 and is interpreted to be an additional \nmineralisation diving under the Coogee North zone.\nThe program also served to follow-up anomalous gold mineralisation identified by previous air core (AC) and RC \ndrilling at various pattern densities along the trend.\nThe planned drill depths for the phase one program varied between 70m and 275m.\nJavelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell said: \"We are pleased with the rapid completion of the first phase \nof drilling over our Coogee project. We have identified key gold indicators along the 950m strike from drill hole \nCORC154 south of the pit to CORC166 about 450m north of the current pit. Once we receive the assays, which we \nexpect to start coming in over the coming weeks, we will plan phase two of the program. This means we will have \nongoing drilling activity and news flow from both Coogee and Eureka during the first half of 2025\".\nThe phase two drilling campaign is expected to start in late January/early February when results from the phase \none RC program are in hand and will continue to increase the mineralised footprint between the Coogee open pit \nand Coogee North.\nThe latter contains an estimated 2.95 million tonnes with more than 96,000 ounces of gold and more than 4000t of \ncopper.\nIt will also define additional gold extensions below the current pit, where modelling has identified about 360,000t at \na grade of 1.29g/t gold for a further 15,000 ounces of gold.\nDrilling will also probe the new targets of the north-west trend, exploring the magnetic signatures and the north-west \ntrending shear that parallels the Coogee Shear hosting the original high-grade gold mined by Ramelius.\nIt's tempting to say Javelin is hunting in a target-rich environment, but it seems appropriate to the company's name \nand where it finds itself in this early phase of exploration.\nIndications to date show the company is identifying gold-copper potential everywhere it looks along the explored \ntrend and has a solid footing based on structure and magnetics.\nNo doubt it will be looking forward to rolling on with the phase one results and the up-coming phase two drilling \nkicking-off early in the New Year.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Additionally, initial jobless claims fell by 22,000 to 220,000 in the first week of December, \noutperforming market expectations of 230,000.\nThe data highlights the resilience of the US economy and aligns with the Federal Reserve's outlook that fewer \ninterest rate cuts may be required in the coming year.\nThe Fed's more hawkish tones were not something that risk markets were prepared for just six days out from \nChristmas and were the catalyst to flush some of the speculative excesses that flowed into risk assets, including \nstocks and Bitcoin, following the US election,\" Sycamore said. \"Looking ahead, attention turns to tonight's Core \nPCE inflation data, which is expected to rise to 2.9% YoY in November, up from 2.8% prior. The rates market is \npricing in 36 bp of rate cuts for 2025 rebounding from the 31bp we saw post the FOMC meeting yesterday.\"\nEuropean retreat\nEuropean sharemarkets declined on Thursday as investors retreated from riskier assets following the US Federal \nReserve's signal of a slower pace of interest rate cuts in 2024.\nThe real estate sector, particularly sensitive to interest rate movements, led the losses, falling 2.4%, with technology \nshares matching the decline.\nThe Bank of England maintained its benchmark interest rate at 4.75%, in line with expectations, though \npolicymakers were divided on the decision to hold rates steady.\nMeanwhile, Sweden's central bank reduced its key interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, as anticipated, and \nNorway's central bank left its policy rate unchanged at a 16-year high of 4.50%.\nThe continent-wide FTSEurofirst 300 index slid 1.5%, while the UK's FTSE 100 index in London declined 1.1%.\nCurrencies and commodities\nCurrencies mixed as US dollar strengthens\nCurrencies showed mixed movements against the US dollar in European and US trade on Thursday. \n  \n\u2022 The euro declined from US$1.0421 to US$1.0354 and settled near US$1.0360 at the US close.   \n\u2022 The Australian dollar rose from 62.13 US cents to 62.63 US cents before finishing near 62.40 US cents.   \n\u2022 The Japanese yen weakened from 154.99 yen per US dollar to JPY157.80, closing around JPY157.40.\nCommodities retreat on cautious monetary outlook\nGlobal oil prices fell as central bankers in the US, Europe, and Asia signalled a cautious approach to easing \nmonetary policy, raising concerns about reduced economic activity impacting oil demand in 2024. \n  \n\u2022 Brent crude dropped by 51 US cents, or 0.7%, to US$72.88 per barrel.  \n\u2022 US Nymex crude fell by 67 US cents, or 0.9%, to US$69.91 per barrel.\nBase metal prices also retreated, weighed down by a stronger US dollar, which climbed to a near two-year high \nafter the US Federal Reserve indicated a slower pace of rate cuts in 2024. \n  \n\u2022 Copper futures fell 1.9%.  \n\u2022 Aluminium futures declined 0.8%.  \n\u2022 Gold prices slid as US economic data reinforced expectations of cautious monetary policy from the Federal \nReserve.

This transaction highlights Ramelius's strategic focus on divesting non-core assets while potentially enhancing Leeuwin's portfolio.\n\n2. **Market Sentiment Impacting Gold Prices**: The article notes a significant decline in gold prices, with futures dropping by 1.7% to US$2,608.10 an ounce. This downturn is attributed to cautious monetary policy signals from the US Federal Reserve, which could affect Ramelius Resources' operational profitability and investor sentiment in the gold sector.\n\n3. **Broader Market Decline**: The ASX200 experienced a sharp decline, with the Materials sector, which includes gold mining companies like Ramelius, falling by 2.02%. This broader market trend may reflect investor concerns about economic conditions and could impact Ramelius's stock performance and market positioning.\n\n4. **Speculative Excesses in Risk Assets**: The article discusses a sell-off in risk assets, including gold, following the US Federal Reserve's hawkish stance. This environment may lead to increased volatility for Ramelius Resources as it navigates market fluctuations and investor expectations in the gold mining sector.\n\n5. **Future Outlook for Gold Mining**: With the Federal Reserve indicating a slower pace of interest rate cuts, the outlook for gold mining companies, including Ramelius Resources, may be challenged. The cautious monetary policy could dampen demand for gold as a safe-haven asset, impacting future exploration and drilling activities in the Australian market.",

That would spur gold buying as a way to protect wealth.\n\"We don't see this changing and expect the secular demand trends underpinning gold's price and its status as a \nsafe haven to continue enhancing gold's appeal as a core portfolio asset, even if capital markets strike a risk-on \ntone in 2025,\" State Street's chief gold strategist George Milling-Stanley said.\nWhile State Street's base case is for gold to trade between $US2600 an ounce and $US2900 an ounce this year, it \nassigned a 30 per cent probability to its bullish scenario where the precious metal hits $US3100 an ounce.\nState Street joins the chorus of Wall Street banks that are betting on another stellar year for the precious metal.\nBank of America, JPMorgan and Citi forecast bullion will reach $US3000 an ounce by the end of this year, and UBS \nforecasts $US2900 an ounce. While Goldman Sachs pushed out its projection this week, the broker still sees prices \nhitting $US3000 an ounce by mid-2026.\nThe bullish forecasts assume gold will jump more than 13 per cent this year from the current spot price of \n$US2649.38 an ounce.\nPage 2 of 2\n$7.6trn manager says gold could hit $US3100 Portfolio asset\nA stronger US dollar has weighed on gold prices since the US election on November 5, but strategists underline the \nprospect of sweeping tariffs under Mr Trump which could exacerbate trade tensions and stunt global growth.\nGold received a further boost this week on news that China's central bank expanded its gold reserves for a second \nmonth in December to 73.29 million fine troy ounces, from 72.96 million in the previous month.

The drill intercepts reveal the possibility of an extensive \nzone of shallow gold mineralisation on the western side of McNabs East, which at this stage remains open at depth \nand along strike.\nThe company completed the five hole, 426m diamond drilling program last December as part of an ongoing \nprogram to systematically test the currently defined 2.5km strike extent of shallow gold mineralisation at Barimaia.\nResults from the program confirm the existence of a shallow, coherent zone of potentially open-pittable gold \nmineralisation on the western side of McNabs East, within an extensive gold system that remains untested at depth \nand open along strike.\nPage 2 of 4\nOrdell locks onto new gold zone in Mt Magnet\nOrdell's flagship Barimaia gold project is an advanced exploration project with significant historical drilling results. \nOrdell acquired an 80.3 per cent interest in Barimaia from Genesis Minerals, which is now a major shareholder of \nOrdell with an 8 per cent interest.\nHowever, Barimaia was never fully explored by Genesis due to its other commitments, although the company \nsuccessfully identified an extensive gold system at the project, supported by historical RC drilling results pointing to \ngood shallow open pit potential.\nThe project is strategically located within a stone's throw of at least three gold processing plants, including the \nadjacent Ramelius Resources' Mt Magnet mill, 70km from Spartan Resources' Dalgaranga mill and 80km from \nWestgold Resources' Tuckabianna mill.\nThe company is planning to launch a more extensive program of about 5000m of reverse circulation drilling at \nBarimaia in February. The upcoming program will include infill drilling at McNabs East to close up the current 100m \ndrill section spacing and will also include first-pass extensional drilling in areas where previous air-core (AC) drilling \nwas undertaken in 2019 and 2021.\nAdditionally, the new program will test depths between 100m and 200m in selected areas and will also include \nadditional AC drilling east and north of the currently defined mineralisation at McNabs.\nOrdell says drilling of the McNabs East western zone will comprise a significant part of the company's big drilling \nprogram slated for February.\n------------------\nSierra Nevada Gold (ASX:SNX)\nHit: 4.88m at 481g/t silver, 0.61g/t gold, 0.6 per cent copper and 0.4 per cent antimony from 87.78m.\nSierra Nevada Gold's Phase 1 reverse-circulation (RC) drilling at its Endowment Mine within the overall Blackhawk \nepithermal project area pulled up a big silver hit while targeting a remnant ore position between the 3rd and 4th \nmine levels on the historic Endowment Vein.\nThe headline drill hit from the latest campaign is 4.88m at 481g/t silver, 0.61g/t gold, 0.6 per cent copper and 0.4 \nper cent antimony from 87.78m\nThe vein was targeted based on indications from historic mine records pointing to part of the vein not having been \nmined, with drilling successfully spearing through an inter-stope zone to jag the vein which remains open down-\nplunge to the east.\nThe Endowment Mine is the biggest of the historic mines in the locality and was initially mined in the 1860s, with \nmost mining completed by the 1880s and a total production being reported of 70,000 ounces of gold equivalent.\nThe operation's inability to process sulphide ores and prevailing depressed economic conditions led to the \ncessation of mining in the 1920s, although mineralisation remains within reach of current infrastructure.\nNotably, the area has seen little modern-day exploration before Sierra Nevada Gold acquired the ground, with the \nlatest prior exploration in the area being undertaken in the mid to late 1980s by American Gold Resources.\nThe focus of recent exploration has been on defining shallow oxide gold and silver deposits, with two shallow oxide \nresources being estimated by AGR at Silver Gulch and Morning Star, which also lie within the overall Blackhawk \nproject\nImportantly, before Sierra Nevada Gold's presence, no exploration drilling was recorded within 600m of the \nEndowment Mine due to previous ownership issues.Page 3 of 4\nOrdell locks onto new gold zone in Mt Magnet\nThe company's other drilling at the adjacent near-surface South Vein turned up additional silver hits, including 6.1m \ngoing 66.04g/t silver in one hole and 1.22m at 82.80g/t silver in a second hole.\nGeochemically the South Vein is like the Endowment Vein, characterised by high silver, antimony, ore-grade lead, \nzinc and elevated copper and manganese.\nInterestingly, apart from its big hit in the Endowment Vein, the headline hole also punched through a 1.22m section \nof the South Vein which assayed a serious 275g/t silver, 3.65 per cent lead, 6.47 per cent zinc, 0.40 per cent \ncopper, and 0.21 per cent antimony from 37.79m.\nSierra Nevada has identified a big high-grade intermediate sulphidation epithermal (ISE) silver-gold-lead-zinc vein \nfield which is related to the adjacent big Blackhawk porphyry system just south of the epithermal field.\nThe ISE vein system covers about 5 sq. km and is open under cover both to the north and north-east, with about \n22.5 line kilometres of veins recorded so far. Sierra Nevada is continuing its mapping and sampling and has \nidentified additional veins within the ISE vein field.\n------------------\nAsian Battery Metals (ASX:AZ9)\nHit: 6.1m of 4.16 per cent copper, 3.51 per cent nickel, 0.93g/t 3E and 0.13 per cent cobalt from 98.2m.\nLast week Asian Battery Minerals landed a 6.1m hit grading 4.16 per cent copper, 3.51 per cent nickel, 0.93g/t 3E \nand 0.13 per cent cobalt from 98.2m.\nA 3E value refers typically to the combined value of assays for gold, platinum and palladium.\nThe result, from one of the last four holes analysed in its 2024 Phase 2 drilling program, was designed to confirm \nthe extent of high-grade mineralisation in the company's Oval gabbroic intrusion.\nThe intercept is book-ended by two broad, lower grade mineralised zones, the first of which is a dense, \ndisseminated intercept of 26.2m at 0.44 per cent copper, 0.52 per cent nickel, 0.12g/t 3E and 0.03 per cent cobalt \nfrom 78.2m. The second zone comprises a net-textured 15.3m assaying 1.15 per cent copper, 0.79 per cent nickel, \n0.35g/t 3E and 0.04 per cent cobalt from 104.3m.\nThree of the last four drillholes analysed targeted electromagnetic (EM) conductors identified from downhole \n(DHEM) responses, which the company believes could represent base metal mineralised targets.\nThe headline hole probed a strongly conductive DHEM plate in the northern half of the Oval body, which is strongly \nexpressed in high-resolution magnetics as a 500m long, 125m wide ovoid body oriented to the north-northwest.\nThe hole successfully encountered low to highly mineralised gabbroic rock from 16m depth to 142.2m, including the \nforegoing intercepts.\nA second hole in the final suite of four was collared 35m east of and on an opposing azimuth to the headline hole.\nIt targeted a separate DHEM conductor for which the source turned out to be a broad high-grade intersection in the \nnorthern third of the Oval area that includes a massive sulphide intercept of 1.8m at 3.21 per cent copper, 3.32 per \ncent nickel, 0.69g/t E3, and 0.14 per cent cobalt from 105m.\nThe 1.8m at 3.21 copper intercept lies within a broader mineralised zone comprising 19.8m at 1.23 per cent copper, \n0.98 per cent nickel, 0.36g/t 3E and 0.05 per cent cobalt from 91.2m.\nThe 19.8m zone also includes three other significant intercepts of disseminated, semi-massive and massive \nmineralisation in gabbro, the best of which are 6.6m going 1.56 per cent copper from 96.0m and 2.4m at 1.52 per \ncent copper and 1.39 per cent nickel from 102.6m.Page 4 of 4\nOrdell locks onto new gold zone in Mt Magnet\nThe third drillhole targeted an off-hole conductor plate that had been determined by DHEM surveying of a nearby \nprevious hole. It intercepted 18.5m of lower grade mineralised gabbro from 13.5m to 32m, although it includes 3.2m \nrunning 0.50 per cent copper, 0.38 per cent nickel, 0.30g/t 3E and 0.02 per cent cobalt from 25m.\nFurther support was lent to the intriguing possibilities presented by the Oval body, with the fourth drillhole testing \nthe southern extremity of the Oval gabbroic intrusive and the zone of contact with its enclosing sediments.\nThat hole was also intended to provide a vector for a subsequent DHEM survey to sniff out any new useful \nconductors within range. It intercepted disseminated mineralised gabbro with 5m going 0.17 per cent copper, 0.17 \nper cent nickel, 0.03g/t 3E and 0.01 per cent cobalt from 126m.\nThe company's recent drilling has focused mainly on identifying high-grade mineralisation in the gabbro at the Oval \nproject. It views the multiple intercepts of massive sulphide mineralisation with their varying ratios of metal \nthroughout the Oval intrusion as encouraging for the possibility of finding one or more deeper sources of high-grade \ncopper-nickel-platinum group mineralisation.\nFor its follow-up 2025 exploration program, Asian Battery Metals plans to focus on scoping out the overall scale of \nthe Oval mineralisation and to target possible deeper magmatic sources at the prospect. It also plans additional \nexploration for potential extensions of Oval and nearby look-alike prospects.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

Please go ahead.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Travis. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to dial in this morning. In addition to the \nquarterly report, we've also released a presentation that we'll largely speak to during the call. Both documents have \nbeen uploaded on the ASX platform and will be available on the website shortly.\nPage 2 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nOnce again, I'm joined by our CFO, Darren Millman. Darren will provide some detail on the financials after I've run \nthrough the highlights and touched on the operational performance and our development projects. As always, there \nwill be an opportunity for listeners to ask questions at the end.\nFor those who have downloaded the presentation deck, I'll be initially speaking to Slide 3. I'll focus on the highlights \nand key achievements for the quarter. I would like to point out that there is a large amount of detail on exploration, \noperations and project development within the quarterly report itself.\nSo on Slide 3, operationally and financially, the December quarter was exceptionally strong, with the business \ngenerating a record and also sector-leading AUD 174.5 million in underlying free cash flow. After considering our \nadditional investment in Spartan during the quarter of AUD 68 million and the payment of our FY '24 AUD 0.05 per \nshare dividend, our closing cash and gold position was just over AUD 500 million.\nOur quarterly gold production was 85,311 ounces, which was a 37% increase on the prior quarter, noting also just \nshy of our record production, which occurred in the March 2024 quarter. The increase in production was mainly due \nto the introduction of ore from Cue, which performed extremely well during the quarter and also improved grades \nfrom Penny. I'll talk to these points in more detail shortly.\nLooking at the costs, we saw a 25% decrease in our all-in sustaining costs down to AUD 1,491 for the quarter. Now \nwhilst we were guiding for a reduction in all-in sustaining costs across the year, the all-in sustaining cost for the \nquarter was below our expectations and obviously benefited from the outperformance of Cue. Importantly, our \nguidance for FY '25 remains unchanged at 270,000 to 300,000 ounces at an all-in sustaining cost of AUD 1,500 to \nAUD 1,700 an ounce.\nWhilst we are encouraged by the indicative overperformance of Cue grades, it is still relatively early days, and we \nwill continue to assess this during the March quarter as more data becomes available as mining and milling \nprogresses.\nUnfortunately, during the quarter, we did record our first LTI since May 2023. Whilst this is extremely disappointing, \nthe incident itself, which is detailed in the quarterly report, was not of a serious nature. We do strive to ensure that \nall employees and contractors remain healthy -- safe and healthy under our watch. The total recordable injury \nfrequency rate, or TRIFR, at the end of December was 8.33, which was only marginally higher than that recorded \nlast quarter.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nThere were several milestones and advancements in our key projects across the quarter with haulage to [Cue] \ncommencing mid-November following the completion of the Great Northern Highway intersection upgrade and also \ndelivery of the Rebecca Roe PFS, which is demonstrating strong economic returns.\nFor the immediate future, our focus is on delivery of the Eridanus and Mt Magnet mill upgrade studies and \nassociated mine plan in this quarter and the Rebecca Roe DFS, which is targeting a final investment decision in the \nSeptember quarter. Exploration and resource definition activities during the quarter were largely focused on \nEridanus, Penny West and the Lena pit at Cue.\nOn Slide 4, I will draw your attention on -- sorry, we're looking here at the quarterly production breakdown for the \nlast 12 months. If you look at the yellow Mt Magnet bars, you can see the previous September quarter, we focused \nlargely on the development of Cue. And now we see that asset in production, along with improved grades at Penny, \nhas been the main driver of increased production in the December quarter. As expected, Edna May production is \nslowly winding down.\nOn to Slide 5, which references quarterly production stats. The standout here is the mine grade for the quarter of \n7.3 grams per tonne, which is more than double that of the September quarter and has been driven once again by \ngrades at Cue and Penny, which were 7.4 and 17.9 grams per tonne, respectively.Page 3 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nNow whilst the ore tonnes mined reduced, it needs to be highlighted that there still is a fair amount of pre-strip and \ndevelopment taking place at Cue. We expect comparable mined ore tonnes to continue into the March quarter as \nwe progress development before we start to see an increase in these ore tonnes in the June 2025 quarter. Mill \nthroughput levels were maintained during the quarter with the drawdown of existing stockpiles across Edna May \nand also the Eridanus stockpile at Mt Magnet.\nOn to Slide 6, we're showing Mt Magnet's highlights. Production from Mt Magnet totaled just over 67,000 ounces at \nan all-in sustaining cost of AUD 1,277. Open pit mining at Mt Magnet is now solely focused at Cue, with the Break \nof Day, Waratah and White Heat pits all being mined during the quarter. Productivities increased during the quarter \nwith the introduction of a third excavator, which resulted in a 44% increase in material movement quarter-on-\nquarter. Underground operations continue to focus on Galaxy and Penny. At Galaxy, mining was largely in line with \nthe prior quarter, whilst at Penny, both tonnages and grade increased, most notably the mine grade, which is \nattributable to stoping on the 1252 level, which is central to the high-grade plunge of the Penny North load.\nI would also like to highlight, the overall mill grade at Mt Magnet in the quarter was 5.1 grams. This is the highest \ngrade seen under Ramelius ownership at the Mt Magnet mill. It has to be pointed out, the processing team did \nexceptionally well in managing these higher grade of ores with met recovery levels being maintained above 96%.\nBefore I move on from this slide, if I refer you to the pie chart, we only incorporated 20% of the high-grade material \nfrom Cue and Penny into Mt Magnet to generate AUD 161.3 million in cash flow at Mt Magnet, quite amazing, with \nplenty more to come.\nOn to Penny, Slide 7. We mined 48,000 tonnes, average grade of 17.9, as mentioned. We milled 39,000 tonnes at \n20.5 grams and produced a little over 18,000 ounces of gold. The mine itself generated operating cash flow of AUD \n73.1 million at a very nice all-in sustaining cost of AUD 790 per ounce.\nOur exploration last quarter was focused on the Penny West ore body beneath the original pit with some extremely \nhigh-grade hits in this area, as noted on the slide. The drilling to date pretty much confirms the location and \nthickness of this load, with the additional drilling information to be used to refine stoping blocks.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nOn to Cue, Slide 8, the graphic shows the Break of Day pit Starlight load, which is where most of Cue's production \nfrom the -- in the quarter came from. A total of 101,000 tonnes was mined across Cue in the quarter at a grade of \n7.4. However, we were able to selectively stockpile and allow processing to focus on the highest grade material, \nwith 48,000 tonnes being milled at an excellent grade of 15.8.\nThe free cash flow from Cue alone in the quarter after growth capital spend of 4.4 was AUD 56 million and an all-in \nsustaining cost actually below that of Penny of AUD 723 per ounce. The high-quality blend of Penny and Cue has \ngenerated these great results at Mt Magnet this quarter.\nSlide 9 on Edna May. Gold production at Edna May totaled 18,261 ounces in the quarter at an all-in sustaining cost \nof AUD 2,209, which, as you can appreciate, is highly cash generative. And indeed, across operations at Edna May, \nwe reported free cash flow of AUD 32.5 million. The all-in sustaining cost was lower than the previous quarter, with \nthe three carried low-grade stockpiles currently being processed exceeding grade expectations.\nIn our mind, there is no reason to think that this outperformance on grade won't continue through to the end at Edna \nMay. At the end of the quarter, there remained approximately 400,000 tonnes at a grade of 0.8 grams per tonne, \nwhich will provide feed for the Edna May mill through the bulk of the March 2025 quarter.\nSlide 10 on guidance. We note both production cost and also capital guidance for FY '25, where there has been no \nchange since our initial guidance issued in August, and we are tracking well to achieve these targets for FY '25, \nhaving produced a little over 50% of the ounces required in the first half.Page 4 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nSlide 11 doesn't normally appear in our quarterly presentation deck, but I think we needed it in this time around. \nAnd there's probably two key points to make on this slide.\nFirstly, at Penny, we passed an important milestone in the quarter. The operation has effectively paid back our \ninitial investment plus the capital and is effectively AUD 31 million in the black, courtesy of AUD 71 million in free \ncash flow, generated by that operation in the quarter.\nSecondly, if you include stockpiles at the mine, Cue generated AUD 83 million in cash flow in the quarter, which \nrepresents an excellent start to paying back the initial investment in Cue of approximately AUD 206 million. At \ncurrent gold prices, we expect that initial investment to be paid back in the second half of this calendar year.\nThat covers the highlights and operations from me. I'll hand over to you, Darren.\nDarren Millman\nThank you, Mark, and it's a pleasure to be here today. I will be initially speaking to Slide 12. On Slide 12, we show \nfinancial highlights for the quarter.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nFrom a financial point of view, it was an exceptional strong quarter for Ramelius with AUD 174.5 million of free \ncash flow being generated, our best on record by quite a margin. This demonstrates the increasing margins of the \nbusiness, not only due to the gold price, but also improved mill grades. These high cash flow generating ounces will \nnot only continue for the remainder of FY '25, but also into FY '26.\nDuring the quarter, we sold 80,000 ounces at an average realized price of AUD 3,683 per ounce, which included a \nmix of spot and committed forward sales. This results in total sales revenue for the quarter of AUD 295 million. The \nAustralian gold price continues to increase over the quarter, reporting 11% increase from the September 2024 \nquarter. We further unwound our forward contract hedge book, which now sits under 100,000 ounces or less than 6 \nmonths production at an average price of AUD 3,183 per ounce.\nThe all-in sustaining cost for the quarter was AUD 1,491 per ounce, which was down on the prior quarter, mainly \ndue to the impact of stronger grades from Cue and Penny in the quarter. The resulting all-in sustaining cost margin \nof AUD 2,192 per ounce, which is the realized gold price of AUD 3,383 per ounce, less the all-in sustaining cost of \nAUD 1,491; represents an all-in sustaining cost margin of 60%.\nCost guidance for FY '25 remains unchanged at AUD 1,500 to AUD 1,700 per ounce. While this reduction in cost \nwas expected, the overperformance of Cue grades did have an impact on reducing the all-in sustaining costs for the \nquarter.\nAs Mark mentioned earlier, it's early days at Cue. Our geological and operational teams at Mt Magnet are \nperforming their reconciliations of both tonnes and grade that have been mined and milled to date at Cue \nincorporating recent grade control drilling, with final results during the March 2025 quarter.\nLooking at Mt Magnet in isolation, the all-in sustaining cost was AUD 1,277 per ounce. Whilst total cost did increase \nwith the planned maintenance shutdown and increased open pit mining activities, this was more than offset by \nimproved grades and production. At Edna May, the all-in sustaining cost was AUD 2,209 per ounce, which is a \ndecrease from the prior quarter and better than expected with the overperformance of low-grade stockpile grades.\nIn the past, we have made the point that Edna May all-in sustaining cost includes a noncash charge for the \ndrawdown of existing stockpiles. For this quarter and going forward, this was not the case with the mill feed now \nbeing made up of largely low-grade stockpiles, which carry no cost on our balance sheet.\nOn Slide 13 and 14, we show a breakdown of free cash flow metrics for the quarter and historically. Gold sales of \n80,000 ounces generated operational cash flow of AUD 193.6 million and AUD 161.1 million coming from Magnet Page 5 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nand AUD 32.5 million from Edna May. A total of AUD 15.9 million was reinvested into mine development, resource \ndefinition and exploration in the quarter, which focused on Eridanus, Cue and Penny West.\nThe resultant free cash flow for the quarter was AUD 174.5 million or over AUD 2,000 per ounce produced. During \nthe quarter, we had two material cash flows outside operations. Firstly, Ramelius participated in the Spartan capital \nraise, increasing our position to 19.9% with the additional AUD 68 million invested.\nAnd secondly, we paid our FY '24 final dividend of AUD 0.05 per share, which after taking into account our dividend \nreinvestment plan resulted in a cash payment of AUD 43.4 million to our shareholders. The resultant cash and gold \nposition was AUD 501.7 million, which coupled with AUD 175 million debt facility and value of listed investment held \nleaves us with over AUD 1 billion in available liquidity.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nOn Slide 15, we summarized our key focus areas in FY '25. We want to continue to improve safety performance \ngroup-wide and deliver FY '25 guidance in line with our value -- our core value of we deliver and do it safely. We \nwant to complete the Eridanus underground open pit studies, the Mt Magnet processing facility study on mill \nupgrades and also update our Mt Magnet mine plan, which will be delivered in the March quarter.\nAt Roe Rebecca, we combined definite feasibility study to be delivered in the September '25 quarter and increase \nexploration programs at Mt Magnet, Cue, Penny and Rebecca Roe.\nOperator, with that, we'll now open the line for questions, if you could, please.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Alex Barkley from RBC.\nAlex Barkley\nA question on the Cue pits. I get reconciliation is high, and that's a positive. How long do those high-grade pits \nBreak of Day and White Heat last, if you could remind me? And then has that understanding changed at all since \nlast year's integrated Mt Magnet plan?\nMark Zeptner\nAlex, it's Mark. Just looking at the -- I suppose on the Cue, we possibly flagged that we might get a bit of \noutperformance on grade or maybe words to the effect of if we're going to get outperformance anywhere, it will be \nCue, especially in the top parts of the pits. And the reason why we do reconciliation and we do additional work \nbefore jumping to conclusions that the whole camp is going to overperform is because you potentially have \nsupergene enrichment in some areas.\nBut just looking at Break of Day, we've got 130,000 ounces, and White Heat in reserve has got 40,000 ounces. So \nwe should be enjoying these grades. There's higher grades. Obviously, we're mining the highest-grade pits first for \nsome time. But mind you, we are in that oxide zone. How the grades perform in the fresh rock? We're not jumping \nto conclusions on that just yet. But no, we'll be in very good grade at Cue for some time.\nDarren Millman\nAnd just adding to that, Alex, so we're looking to update the Mt Magnet entire plan, so in March. So that will also \nincorporate any changes we feel appropriate in timing of the release of that ore in that plan as well.\nAlex BarkleyPage 6 of 6\nRamelius Resources Limited (RMLRF) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript\nOkay. Just one more question on your quite ample cash and liquidity you called out. Is there any consideration to \nbuying back your hedges? Or would that pend your project studies or potentially approval? Is there just a time \nframe or parameters around how you think around the hedges?\nDarren Millman\nYou thankfully answered my question. So yes, that's right. When we put out the Mt Magnet, obviously, potential \nEridanus larger open pit, we've got the Mt Magnet mill upgrade. And obviously, we've also got the FID decision \naround Rebecca Roe, and that's all coming in the first half of the calendar FY '25.\nSubscribe to Seeking Alpha for more content like this\nSo I think once we have that full picture, then we'll be looking at all capital allocations and obviously, something that \nwe may consider is reducing this hedge book. But at the moment, we're producing margins of over 60% with having \nthis hedge book. So it's not a high priority, but it's definitely something we will look at, but it's coming off pretty quick \nat the back end of this year.\nMark Zeptner\nYes, we're below 100,000 ounces now. But at the moment, we're not currently minded to write a big check and buy \nit out, but we need to see the capital profile for the business, particularly over the next few years, to make good \ndecisions on that, Alex.\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] At this time, we're showing no further questions. I'll hand the conference back to Mark for \nany closing remarks.\nMark Zeptner\nThank you, Travis. One question, some sort of record. 22 minutes past the hour. Everyone must be happy with the \ninformation we've provided. Thank you for listening in. Have a great day, guys.\nLoad-Date: January 29, 2025\nEnd of Document",

Limited All Rights Reserved\nLength: 684 words\nByline: James Pearson\nHighlight: Javelin Minerals' maiden drilling program at its Coogee project in WA has hit 65g/t gold and 8.5pc \ncopper to extend the strike beyond 1km northward and at depth.\nBody\nJavelin Minerals has struck high-grade gold and copper in a maiden drilling program at its Coogee project in \nWestern Australia's Eastern Goldfields, 20 kilometres northeast of Kambalda, hitting grades of up to 65 grams per \ntonne (g/t) gold and 8.5 per cent copper.\nThe results of the 2921-metre reverse circulation drill program have now pushed the mineralisation strike out past \none kilometre, significantly extending the existing resource to the north. It also extended the strike at depth \nbeneath the existing pit. The company says the results have reinforced Coogee's potential as a high-value mining \nopportunity.\nWhile drilling for extensions to the north-west trend, the bit jagged high-grade mineralisation including 5 metres \ngrading 14.22g/t gold from 143m with a 1m chunk running at 65g/t gold and 1.91pc copper from 145m.\nAnother drillhole beneath the current pit confirmed rich depth extensions with a 10m hit running at 4.55g/t gold from \n91m, including a 1m section grading 38.1g/t gold from 98m.\n'This is a fantastic start to our exploration program at Coogee.'\nJavelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell\nAnother hole drilled to the northeast confirmed lateral extensions, striking 7m grading 6.42g/t gold including 7m of \n2.54pc copper from 108m, and a 1m slice of 8.53pc copper from 109m.\nTo the south of the pit further mineralisation was picked up with another 4m intercept running at 2.22g/t gold from \n80m.\nThe Coogee resource currently stands at 3.65 million tonnes at 1.08g/t gold for a total of 126,685 ounces of gold, \nalongside 1.01mt at 0.41pc copper, containing 4133 tonnes of the red metal.\nJavelin is now reviewing all the data for a potential resource upgrade.\nPage 2 of 2\nJavelin feasts on multiple high-grade WA gold, copper hits\nSitting in a highly prospective greenstone belt, Coogee is surrounded by significant gold deposits, including Silver \nLake Resources' 400,000-ounce Salt Creek mine, the Daisy-Milano mine and the Gold Field Ltd-controlled St Ives \ngold camp.\nJavelin Minerals executive chairman Brett Mitchell said: \"This is a fantastic start to our exploration program at \nCoogee. We are focused on Coogee because we saw the potential for it to become a near-term WA brownfields \nexploration success story. The results reveal new high-grade shoots outside the existing resource, both along \nstrike and below the existing open pit.\" \nThe current campaign represents the first systematic exploration at Coogee since Ramelius Resources pulled \nstumps in 2014. After mining a 70m open pit Ramelius recovered 147,400 tonnes of material at 4.7g/t gold for \n20,400 ounces of gold.\nThe ore was processed at the nearby carbon-in-leach Burbanks Mill with metallurgical recoveries at the time \nrunning to an impressive 96.4pc.\nThe latest drilling campaign has potentially provided a company-defining moment for Javelin, given it designed an \nexploration program to chase lookalike nearby deposits that may have gone unnoticed.\nThe same near-mine theory recently massively rewarded neighbouring ASX-listed Spectrum Metals and Spartan \nResources, both of which found multi-million-dollar gold deposits lurking just north of their old open pits.\nSpectrum Metals unearthed a new 355,000-ounce deposit five years ago at Penny North grading 13.8g/t just 300m \nfrom the old Penny West open pit. Spartan had similar luck jagging a 721,000-ounce gold resource at its Never \nNever project, with grades of 5.85g/t, also just 300m north of its old pit.\nWith phase one drilling out of the way, Javelin is gearing up for a second phase to test for extensions of the newly \nidentified shoots and chase a high-priority magnetic anomaly to the north, dubbed Bullseye, along with a similar \ntarget 1.5km to the west of the old pit.\nThe gold prices, currently trading close to all-time highs and just shy of US$2900 (A$4677) per ounce, are proving a \nhuge fillip for junior gold miners at the moment. With the improving prospects of a new discovery seemingly just \naround the corner and with easy access to third party milling facilities, Javelin now has the bit well and truly \nbetween its teeth.\nIs your ASX-listed company doing something interesting?

The Coogee project, previously explored by Ramelius Resources until 2014, has seen a resurgence in interest due to Javelin Minerals' recent high-grade drilling results, indicating the potential for significant resource upgrades in the area.\n\n2. Ramelius Resources' earlier operations at Coogee yielded 20,400 ounces of gold from a 70m open pit, but the current exploration by Javelin suggests that there may be additional high-grade mineralization that was previously overlooked.\n\n3. The successful drilling campaign by Javelin at Coogee, which has extended the mineralization strike, highlights the competitive landscape in the gold mining sector, where former sites like Coogee are being re-evaluated for their untapped potential.\n\n4. The ongoing exploration at Coogee, which has been dormant since Ramelius Resources ceased operations, underscores the evolving dynamics in the gold mining industry, particularly as gold prices approach record highs, creating renewed interest in previously mined areas.",

When we did \nour planning and set our guidance for this financial year, we were probably about $1000-$1200 (in Australian \ndollars) an ounce lower than what the spot price is today. That's how much it's moved in six or seven months \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 \nwe would never have thought you would get a 25-30 per cent rise in the gold price in such a short time.\" The \nsurging gold price has lit a fire under ASX-listed gold stocks, which rose 7 per cent across the board last week and \nare up 55 per cent over the past year.\nNorthern Star, the biggest Australian-domiciled gold producer after Newmont's $26bn takeover of Newcrest in 2023, \nis up 18.5 per cent since the start of 2025.\nEvolution, the second biggest, is up 23.5 per cent to $5.97, with Bell Potter initiating coverage on Friday with a buy \nrating and 12-month target price of $6.65.\nPage 2 of 2\nSurging gold price stuns veterans\n\"Evolution is now passing its capital expenditure peak and we forecast increasing free cashflows, deleveraging of \nthe balance sheet and rising dividend distributions supported by Evolution's near-unhedged gold and copper price \nexposure,\" Bell Potter noted.\nOther ASX 200 gold stocks enjoying the ride are Gold Road, with its share price up about 80 per cent in 12 months, \nRamelius Resources (up 75 per cent), Perseus Mining (up 70 per cent) and US giant Newmont (up 41 per cent via \nits CHESS depositary interests listing).\nThe World Gold Council's 2024 gold demand trends report, released last week, says annual demand hit a record \nhigh of 4974 tonnes, driven by strong central bank buying and growth in investment demand. The combination of \nrecord high gold prices and volumes resulted in the highest ever total value of demand at $US382bn.\nThe council said central banks continued to buy gold at an eye-watering pace in 2024, with purchases exceeding \n1000 tonnes for the third year in a row.\nMarket analysts said Beijing had played a big role, with the market boosted by an increase in the People's Bank of \nChina's gold holdings and a move to allow insurance funds to invest in gold.\nMr Conway said another big factor had been the volumes traded in New York through the CME Group's Comex.\nJPMorgan Chase and other banks said in January that they would deliver gold bullion valued at billions of dollars \nagainst futures contracts due to expire in February as the threat of tariffs and a major trade war saw US investors \nmove to secure gold.\n\"We knew when (Mr Trump) was coming into office that it would have an impact on the gold price, and we expected \nit to be positive, depending on which way he decided to take his administration,\" Mr Conway said.\n\"It was either going to be a fair number of interest rate cuts through this year, or some of the other things that are \ngoing on around the tariffs and his intervention in terms of the geopolitical situation in Gaza and the Ukraine.\n\"The most interesting thing for me when you look over the past few weeks is the amount of gold that's been coming \ninto the Comex, the US exchange, as particularly retail people have been buying gold. It's like they want some \nprotection against the US dollar.\" On the potential rerating of mining stocks as more investors look for exposure to \ngold, Mr Conway said companies had to show the market the discipline needed to make the most of the higher gold \nprice.\n\"The thing for gold mining companies is to consistently deliver on your guidance and what you've told the market, \nand to have the discipline to put that money into the bank,\" he said.\n\"That's where you'll start to get a bit of that reward. If it's not seen to be flying through to the bank balance, I think \nthat's where you'll get the investors being a little bit more sceptical.\n\"That's been an absolute focus of us over the last 12 months because delivering to your plan in a rising metal price \nenvironment is a real positive, and we've seen that with our cashflow. \"What the shareholders want to see is that it's \nactually hitting the bank account. I think if we can demonstrate that as an industry, there will be more support and \nthen the rerate would flow on from that.\"\nLoad-Date: February 9, 2025\nEnd of Document",

The VanEck Gold Miners exchange-traded fund \nclimbed nearly 20 per cent in 2024 versus a 38 per cent rally for the gold price in Australian dollars.\nBut easing cost inflation that has plagued the mining sector for the last three years and an ongoing surge in prices \nhas seen the trend reverse course. VanEck's Gold Miners ETF is up 17 per cent already this year while the Aussie \ndollar spot price has climbed 6.3 per cent.\nLocal fund managers are bullish that gold has much further to run after the US dollar price climbed above $US2942 \nan ounce for the first time and the Australian dollar gold price breached $4500 an ounce.\nVictor Smorgon Partners' Resource Gold Fund returned a chunky 13.3 per cent in January and portfolio manager \nCameron Judd believes the valuations of ASX gold stocks still don't reflect the outlook for the yellow metal.\n\"Gold's performance in times of uncertainty or crisis could see it push towards $US3600,\" Mr Judd said. \"Despite \nthe strong gold price performance and fundamentals supporting further appreciation, gold miners are trading at \ndiscounted valuations on the ASX.\"\nWall Street's biggest banks believe a $US3000 price tag is imminent. Citi said it was possible within the next three \nmonths, while JPMorgan has a year-end target of $US3150. Bank of America said on Thursday that gold could \nreach $US3500 an ounce if investment demand rises 10 per cent this year.\nThe unprecedented surge in the gold price has been fuelled by investors seeking safe haven assets as US \nPresident Donald Trump unleashes aggressive trade and geopolitical policies. There are fears the president will \naccelerate inflation, forcing central banks to raise rates in a way that damages global growth.\nPage 2 of 2\nGold funds burst out of the blocks with rocketing returns; Commodities\nVictor Smorgon's top holdings include ASX-listed Vault Minerals and the world's largest gold miner, US-based \nNewmont, which recently acquired Newcrest. The fund also owns Australia's biggest gold miner, Northern Star, \nwhich agreed to buy rival De Grey in a $5 billion deal.\nMr Judd is also expecting international companies to make further plays for local miners and explorers given the \ncheaper valuations of ASX gold stocks, aided by a weak local currency.\n\"The lower Australian dollar makes gold miners even cheaper to buy as demand for the precious metal rises,\" Mr \nJudd said.\nCollins St Asset Management is also finally starting to reap the benefits of the catch-up in gold stocks after taking a \nstake in a basket of miners through its flagship value fund nearly two years ago. Founder Michael Goldberg said the \nopportunity was so large that the firm launched a special situations fund in March 2023 focused solely on gold \nstocks.\nHe believes the sector is finally ready to realise its potential after the Collins St Special Situation Fund surged 13 \nper cent, after fees, in January. It's up another 9 per cent so far in February.\n\"I think 2025 might be the year that we see a rapid catch-up,\" he said. \"Not relying on higher gold prices per se, but \njust a recognition by the market of the earnings potential for those companies, in particular the early-stage \nproducers.\"\nCollins St is focused on small and mid-cap companies, which have a lower cost of production, unhedged sales \nbooks and an ability to ramp up sales and output in the near term. This includes Catalyst Metals, Black Cat, \nWestgold Resources and Ramelius Resources.\nArgonaut's Global Gold Fund has also shown signs of a rebound following a disappointing 2024 when the portfolio \nreturned just 4.5 per cent net of fees.

The $20 billion Northern Star owns the nearby land.\nSources said a deal could see Lakewood valued at between $70 million and $95 million, and would be welcomed \nby investors who've watched the shares fall almost 16 per cent this year. Unlike plenty of its listed peers, Westgold \nhasn't benefited from higher gold prices given issues around digesting the Karora acquisition.\nWestgold CEO Wayne Bramwell plans to use sale proceeds to increase capacity at its Higginsville mill from 1.6 \nmillion tonnes a year to well above the 2 million mark. A spokesperson declined to comment.\nThe up-for-grabs Lakewood was acquired by Karora to add an extra million tonnes in capacity for its flagship Beta \nHunt gold mine, on top of the 1.6 million tonnes capacity at its existing Higginsville mill, amid a production ramp-up.\nSources said since the merger, Westgold has narrowed its focus on fewer but bigger mills, which are fed by fewer \nbut bigger mines - in a bid to finetune its cost base against movements in gold pricing. This strategy, at its Beta \nHunt mine, means processing the ore via the lower-cost and larger Higginsville mill.\nProcessing a tonne of ore via the Lakewood mill costs $50, while Higginsville can handle the same amount for $30 \nor more. Should Westgold expand Higginsville as expected, this cost could be brought down to the $20 range, the \nsources said.\nPage 2 of 2\nWestgold shops gold mill acquired in $2.5b Karora merger; Street Talk\nThe mooted deal comes after Westgold and rival Ramelius Resources locked horns last year over Karora, as \nrevealed by Street Talk. The stoush ended when the $3 billion Ramelius decided to walk away, while Westgold \nprogressed and took the keys to Karora in August. But the proceedings also outed the fact that Ramelius had \napproached Westgold with a merger proposal but was knocked back.\nA fortnight ago, Westgold shares tanked after the miner cut its 2025 production guidance by as much as one-fifth \nand warned of higher costs after paying big for Karora. It said it would produce between 330,000 ounces and \n350,000 ounces this financial year, down from its previous forecast of between 400,000 ounces and 420,000 \nounces. Costs were also expected to be higher, up from a range of $2000 to $2300 per ounce to $2400 to $2600. \nThe miner attributed the production cuts to teething problems in production at its two main mines Beta Hunt near \nKambalda, and Bluebird-South Junction near Meekatharra.\nLoad-Date: February 21, 2025\nEnd of Document",
