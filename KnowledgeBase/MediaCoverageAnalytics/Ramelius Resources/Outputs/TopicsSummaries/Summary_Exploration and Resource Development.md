# 4. Exploration and Resource Development  

<a name="4-1-overview-"></a>

## 4.1. Overview  

The media coverage on Ramelius Resources' exploration and resource development activities highlights a dynamic and evolving landscape, characterized by strategic acquisitions, divestitures, and renewed interest in previously mined sites. The company has been involved in multiple projects across Western Australia, including the Cue Joint Venture, Coogee, Vivien, Comet Vale, and Marda gold projects. Over time, Ramelius has shifted its focus, selling certain assets while maintaining a presence in key gold-producing regions. The coverage also underscores the competitive nature of the gold mining sector, with other companies such as Javelin Minerals, Auric Mining, and Leeuwin Metals capitalizing on opportunities in areas previously explored or mined by Ramelius. Additionally, the increasing demand for copper, driven by renewable energy technologies, has influenced exploration strategies, as seen in the Cue JV and Ularring Copper Gold Project transactions.

## 4.2. Chronological Analysis  

<a name="4-2-1-early-coverage-"></a>

### 4.2.1 Early Coverage  

In early 2024, Ramelius Resources was involved in the Cue Joint Venture with Cyprium Metals, where a high-grade copper discovery was made at the Heeler prospect. This discovery, which also contained significant gold and silver values, positioned Ramelius to potentially benefit from the growing demand for copper, particularly in renewable energy applications. The mineralization at Heeler was reported to be open at depth and along strike, suggesting further exploration potential [Proactive Investors, February 20, 2024].  

Around the same time, historical drilling by Ramelius at the Fugitive prospect in the WA Goldfields was highlighted in media coverage. The prospect, located between two high-grade gold deposits, had previously been explored by Ramelius, and its findings laid the groundwork for Auric Mining’s current exploration efforts. Auric’s recent drilling results showed promising gold grades, which could put pressure on Ramelius to enhance its exploration strategies in the region [The Sydney Morning Herald, June 4, 2024].

### 4.2.2 Developing Trends  

By mid-2024, Ramelius Resources was actively managing its asset portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures. The company sold its Vivien gold project to Labyrinth Resources, which led to a surge in Labyrinth’s stock price, reflecting strong investor interest in high-grade gold assets. Additionally, Ramelius was involved in the Comet Vale gold project, where Labyrinth had the option to acquire the remaining 49% stake. These transactions suggested that Ramelius was strategically repositioning itself in the market amid rising gold prices [The Sydney Morning Herald, July 19, 2024].  

Meanwhile, Javelin Minerals identified new drill targets at the Coogee Gold Project, a site previously mined by Ramelius in 2013. The project, located in a highly prospective greenstone belt, had seen limited drilling activity since Ramelius ceased operations. Javelin’s exploration efforts aimed to capitalize on under-explored areas, potentially challenging Ramelius’ past assessments of the site’s resource potential [ENP Newswire, August 19, 2024].  

In September 2024, Javelin announced a 158% increase in the Coogee gold resource estimate, significantly surpassing Ramelius’ previous assessment. The new estimate extended the resource depth from 90m to 225m, suggesting that Ramelius may have underestimated the deposit’s potential. Javelin also identified new exploration targets, including an untested magnetic anomaly near the Coogee open pit, raising questions about the thoroughness of Ramelius’ past exploration efforts [The Sydney Morning Herald, September 9, 2024].  

Further divestitures followed in October 2024, with Ramelius selling the Ularring Copper Gold Project to Constellation Resources. The project, located in a region known for significant copper-gold deposits, had shown promising historical drill results. The sale indicated a strategic shift in Ramelius’ asset portfolio, possibly reallocating resources to more promising projects [ENP Newswire, October 7, 2024].

### 4.2.3 Recent Developments  

By late 2024 and early 2025, Javelin Minerals continued to make significant progress at Coogee, with new high-grade gold and copper drilling results. The company’s systematic exploration efforts, the first since Ramelius ceased operations in 2014, suggested that additional high-grade mineralization had been overlooked. Javelin’s findings reinforced the competitive nature of the gold mining sector, where former sites were being re-evaluated for untapped potential [The Sydney Morning Herald, December 16, 2024; The Sydney Morning Herald, February 10, 2025].  

In January 2025, Ordell Minerals reported promising drill results at the Barimaia gold project, located near Ramelius’ Mt Magnet mill. The project, previously owned by Genesis Minerals, had not been fully explored, and Ordell’s extensive drilling program could lead to significant discoveries. This development indicated potential competition for gold processing in the region, which could impact Ramelius’ operations [The Age, January 23, 2025].  

Additionally, Leeuwin Metals announced the acquisition of the Marda Gold Project from Ramelius Resources, backed by a successful A$3.25 million fundraising. The acquisition, expected to be completed in early 2025, highlighted the importance of strategic asset transactions in the gold mining industry. Leeuwin’s planned drilling programs could increase competition in the region, potentially affecting Ramelius’ market position [Proactive Investors, January 28, 2025].

## 4.3. Stakeholder Perspectives  

<a name="4-3-1-ramelius-resources-"></a>

### 4.3.1 Ramelius Resources  

Ramelius Resources has been actively managing its asset portfolio, engaging in both acquisitions and divestitures. The company’s sale of the Vivien, Ularring, and Marda projects suggests a strategic shift, possibly focusing on core assets or new exploration opportunities. However, the significant resource upgrades at Coogee by Javelin Minerals raise questions about whether Ramelius fully capitalized on the site’s potential. Additionally, increased competition from companies like Auric Mining and Ordell Minerals may pressure Ramelius to enhance its exploration strategies.  

<a name="4-3-2-javelin-minerals-"></a>

### 4.3.2 Javelin Minerals  

Javelin Minerals has emerged as a key player in the re-evaluation of previously mined sites, particularly at Coogee. The company’s exploration efforts have significantly expanded the resource base, challenging Ramelius’ past assessments. Javelin’s success underscores a broader industry trend of revisiting historical mining sites for untapped potential.

### 4.3.3 Auric Mining and Ordell Minerals  

Auric Mining’s exploration at the Fugitive prospect, based on historical drilling by Ramelius, highlights the competitive nature of the WA Goldfields. Similarly, Ordell Minerals’ activities at Barimaia, near Ramelius’ Mt Magnet mill, suggest potential competition for gold processing infrastructure. These developments indicate that Ramelius may need to reassess its exploration and development strategies to maintain its market position.

### 4.3.4 Leeuwin Metals and Constellation Resources  

Leeuwin Metals’ acquisition of the Marda Gold Project and Constellation Resources’ purchase of the Ularring Copper Gold Project reflect the ongoing asset reshuffling in the gold and copper mining sectors. These transactions suggest that Ramelius is strategically repositioning itself, though the long-term impact on its exploration and development activities remains to be seen.  

<a name="4-4-implications-and-future-outlook-"></a>

## 4.4. Implications and Future Outlook  

The media coverage suggests that Ramelius Resources is at a critical juncture in its exploration and resource development strategy. While the company has successfully managed its asset portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures, the significant resource upgrades at Coogee and increased competition in key gold-producing regions indicate potential challenges.  

Looking ahead, Ramelius may need to enhance its exploration efforts to remain competitive, particularly as companies like Javelin Minerals and Auric Mining capitalize on opportunities in areas previously explored by Ramelius. Additionally, the growing demand for copper, as seen in the Cue JV and Ularring transactions, may influence future exploration priorities.  

Overall, the evolving landscape of the gold and copper mining sectors suggests that Ramelius Resources will need to strategically navigate asset management, exploration, and competitive pressures to maintain its market position in the coming years.
