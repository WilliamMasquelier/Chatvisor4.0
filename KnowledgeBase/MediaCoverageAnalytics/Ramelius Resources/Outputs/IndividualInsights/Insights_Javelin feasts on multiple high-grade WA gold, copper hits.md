1. The Coogee project, previously explored by Ramelius Resources until 2014, has seen a resurgence in interest due to Javelin Minerals' recent high-grade drilling results, indicating the potential for significant resource upgrades in the area.

2. Ramelius Resources' earlier operations at Coogee yielded 20,400 ounces of gold from a 70m open pit, but the current exploration by Javelin suggests that there may be additional high-grade mineralization that was previously overlooked.

3. The successful drilling campaign by Javelin at Coogee, which has extended the mineralization strike, highlights the competitive landscape in the gold mining sector, where former sites like Coogee are being re-evaluated for their untapped potential.

4. The ongoing exploration at Coogee, which has been dormant since Ramelius Resources ceased operations, underscores the evolving dynamics in the gold mining industry, particularly as gold prices approach record highs, creating renewed interest in previously mined areas.
