1. Ramelius Resources' Mt Magnet mill is strategically located near Ordell Minerals' Barimaia gold project, which has recently reported promising drill results, indicating potential competition for gold processing in the region.

2. The Barimaia project, now under Ordell Minerals, was previously owned by Genesis Minerals, which had not fully explored the site due to other commitments, suggesting that Ramelius Resources may face increased exploration activity and potential resource competition in the Mt Magnet area.

3. The upcoming extensive drilling program by Ordell Minerals at Barimaia, which includes infill and extensional drilling, could lead to significant discoveries that may impact the operational landscape for Ramelius Resources and its nearby processing facilities.

4. The historical context of the Barimaia project, with its significant drilling results and proximity to Ramelius Resources' operations, highlights the potential for increased exploration and development pressures in the gold mining sector in Western Australia.
