1. Ramelius Resources has acquired a nearly 18% stake in Spartan Resources, indicating a strategic move amidst a flurry of mergers and acquisitions in the Western Australian gold sector, highlighting its active role in the market.

2. The CEO of Spartan Resources, Tony Lawson, expressed confusion over why Ramelius waited until it cost them $185 million to acquire less than 20% of his company, suggesting a missed opportunity for earlier engagement in M&A activities.

3. Despite the bullish outlook for gold prices, with predictions of reaching $US3000 an ounce, both Ramelius and other gold producers are reportedly cautious about making acquisitions at high price levels, reflecting a more conservative approach in the current market.

4. The article notes that Ramelius Resources is facing challenges in the M&A space, as other gold producers are hesitant to act, which could impact its growth strategy and market positioning in the competitive landscape of gold mining.
