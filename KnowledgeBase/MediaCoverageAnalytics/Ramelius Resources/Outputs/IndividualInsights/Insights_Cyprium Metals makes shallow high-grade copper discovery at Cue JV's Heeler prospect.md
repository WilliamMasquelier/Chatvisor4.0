1. Ramelius Resources holds a 20% stake in the Cue joint venture with Cyprium Metals, which is currently focused on exploring the Heeler prospect, indicating its involvement in the exploration of base metals alongside gold.

2. The recent high-grade copper discovery at Heeler, which includes significant gold and silver values, highlights the potential for Ramelius Resources to benefit from the growing interest in base metals, particularly as the market shifts towards copper due to its demand in renewable energy technologies.

3. The exploration activities at Heeler are part of a broader strategy by Cyprium Metals to enhance its resource inventory in the Murchison region, which may indirectly impact Ramelius Resources' positioning and future exploration strategies in the area.

4. The mineralization at Heeler is described as being open at depth and along strike, suggesting that further exploration could yield additional resources, which could be advantageous for Ramelius Resources if successful in expanding the joint venture's asset base.
