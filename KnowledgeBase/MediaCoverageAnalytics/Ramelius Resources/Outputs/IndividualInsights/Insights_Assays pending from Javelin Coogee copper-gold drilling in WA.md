1. Javelin Minerals' recent drilling program at the Coogee copper-gold project is the first systematic exploration since Ramelius Resources ceased operations in 2014, highlighting a significant shift in activity at a site previously mined by Ramelius, which extracted 147,000 tonnes of ore for 20,400 ounces of gold.

2. The exploration efforts by Javelin aim to identify extensions of mineralization south of the original Coogee resource, which was last mined by Ramelius, indicating potential for further gold and copper discoveries in an area previously operated by Ramelius.

3. Ramelius Resources had established a JORC-compliant resource of 126,685 ounces of gold and 4,133 tonnes of copper at Coogee, and Javelin's current drilling program is expected to build upon this foundation, suggesting that Ramelius' past operations may have left untapped potential.

4. The upcoming phase two drilling campaign by Javelin, set to commence in early 2025, will further explore the mineralized footprint and new magnetic targets, indicating a proactive approach to expanding on the groundwork laid by Ramelius Resources in the region.
