1. Northern Star is considering selling its Carosue Dam Operations to Ramelius Resources, with a potential price tag of around $800 million, following its recent $5 billion acquisition of De Grey Mining.

2. The acquisition of Carosue Dam would strategically benefit Ramelius Resources, particularly in relation to its Rebecca-Roe project, which has recently shown disappointing pre-feasibility study results with a net present value of $332 million.

3. Despite the underwhelming findings from the Rebecca-Roe project, RBC analysts suggest that the project still provides Ramelius with an opportunity to establish a second production hub, especially after the anticipated closure of the Edna May operation in the 2025 financial year.

4. Ramelius Resources has been actively expanding its portfolio, having acquired Apollo Consolidated and Musgrave Minerals in recent years, and is currently in a strong financial position to pursue further acquisitions amidst rising gold prices. 

5. The ongoing developments at Northern Star, including its mill expansion in the Kalgoorlie district, raise questions about the necessity of retaining the smaller Carosue Dam processing facilities, indicating a potential willingness to divest if the right offer is made.
