1. **Record Free Cash Flow**: Ramelius Resources reported a record underlying free cash flow of AUD 174.5 million for the December quarter, driven by strong operational performance and improved gold grades, particularly from the Cue and Penny mines.

2. **Increased Gold Production**: The company achieved a quarterly gold production of 85,311 ounces, marking a 37% increase from the previous quarter, primarily due to successful ore introduction from Cue and enhanced grades from Penny.

3. **Cost Management Success**: Ramelius saw a 25% reduction in all-in sustaining costs to AUD 1,491 per ounce, outperforming initial expectations. This was attributed to the high-grade ore from Cue and Penny, with guidance for FY '25 remaining unchanged at 270,000 to 300,000 ounces.
