1. Ramelius Resources experienced a significant decline in its stock price, dropping 7.3% to $1.91, amidst broader market pressures following an inflation report that raised concerns about potential interest rate hikes in Australia.

2. The drop in Ramelius Resources' share price is linked to the company's recent merger discussions with Westgold, which soured after Westgold opted to acquire Toronto-listed Karora Resources instead.

3. The overall performance of the gold sub-sector was mixed, with Ramelius Resources' decline contrasting with Westgold's 6.5% increase, highlighting competitive dynamics within the mid-tier mining segment.

4. The market's reaction to inflation data has implications for the mining sector, as rising costs and potential interest rate changes could affect operational expenses and investment strategies for companies like Ramelius Resources.
