1. Ramelius Resources previously mined the Coogee gold deposit in 2013, producing 20,400 ounces of gold from an open cut pit, indicating the site's historical significance and potential for future exploration.

2. The Coogee Gold Project, where Ramelius Resources operated, is situated in a highly fertile greenstone belt known for numerous gold deposits, suggesting a competitive landscape for gold exploration in the region.

3. Despite the promising geological setting, there has been limited drilling activity on much of the Coogee tenure, highlighting an opportunity for Javelin Minerals to capitalize on the under-explored areas previously associated with Ramelius Resources.

4. The identification of new drill targets at Coogee, based on comprehensive geophysical data analysis, may pose a challenge for Ramelius Resources as Javelin Minerals aims to enhance its gold inventory in a region with established mining history.
