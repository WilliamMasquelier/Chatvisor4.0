1. **Record Production and Financial Performance**: Ramelius Resources achieved record gold production of 293,000 ounces in FY '24, marking a 22% increase from the previous year. This was attributed to improved mine grades and increased throughput, resulting in a significant revenue increase of 40% to $882.6 million.

2. **Strong Cash Flow and Dividend Declaration**: The company reported a free cash flow of $315.8 million for FY '24, with a declared dividend of $0.05 per share, representing a 150% increase from the prior year. This reflects a commitment to returning value to shareholders while maintaining a balance for future investments.

3. **Operational Challenges and Strategic Focus**: Despite achieving record results, Ramelius faced operational challenges, including the completion of mining activities at the Edna May hub. The company plans to place Edna May in care and maintenance, focusing on increasing production at the Mt Magnet hub, which is expected to see a 50% production increase in FY '25.

4. **Future Growth and Exploration Investments**: Ramelius has budgeted $40 million to $50 million for exploration in FY '25, targeting high-potential areas such as Mt Magnet and Penny. The company anticipates further growth driven by the development of the Eridanus project and the potential for additional resource ounces.

5. **Hedging Strategy and Market Position**: The company is progressively reducing its hedge book, with 155,000 ounces hedged at an average price of $3,081 per ounce. This strategy aims to lock in cash flow while navigating market fluctuations, positioning Ramelius favorably within the competitive landscape of the gold mining industry.
