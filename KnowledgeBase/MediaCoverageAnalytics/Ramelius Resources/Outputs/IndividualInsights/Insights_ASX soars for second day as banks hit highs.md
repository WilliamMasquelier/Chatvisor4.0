1. Ramelius Resources has entered a trading halt at a share price of $1.545, following reports of its intention to bid between $700 million to $1 billion for Karora Resources, a Toronto-listed gold miner based in Western Australia.

2. The gold mining sector, including Ramelius Resources, has been experiencing a week-long rally as gold prices reached a record high of $US2168.10 per ounce, driven by demand from China and Russia.

3. Despite the rising gold prices, local gold stocks, including Ramelius Resources, have lagged behind due to operational challenges and significant increases in cost bases, which have negatively impacted earnings.

4. The overall sentiment in the gold mining industry is cautious, as analysts note that while gold prices are high, the performance of local miners like Ramelius has been hindered by recent mishaps and rising costs.
