1. Ramelius Resources previously estimated the Coogee gold-copper resource at 1.43 million tonnes at an average grade of 1.07g/t gold, which has now been significantly surpassed by Javelin Minerals' new estimate of 3.65 million tonnes at 1.08g/t gold, indicating a substantial increase in the project's potential.

2. The upgrade in resource estimation by Javelin Minerals highlights a critical shift in the depth of the resource envelope, extending from 90m to 225m below the surface, which suggests that Ramelius Resources may have previously underestimated the depth potential of the Coogee deposit.

3. Javelin's findings indicate that the mineralisation at Coogee is open along strike and down-dip, suggesting that Ramelius Resources may have missed opportunities for further exploration and resource expansion during its operational period.

4. The article notes that Javelin has identified new exploration targets, including a significant untested magnetic anomaly near the Coogee open pit, which could indicate additional gold-copper mineralisation that Ramelius Resources did not explore, raising questions about the thoroughness of their previous exploration efforts. 

5. Ramelius Resources' past operations at Coogee, which included a successful open-pit mining phase, are now being overshadowed by Javelin's advancements, potentially impacting Ramelius' reputation in the competitive gold mining sector in Australia.
