1. Ramelius Resources is currently engaged in exclusive due diligence to acquire Karora Resources, a Toronto-listed gold miner, with an estimated acquisition cost between $700 million to $1 billion, aimed at establishing a new production center to replace the declining Edna May asset.

2. The acquisition of Karora, which includes significant production assets such as the Beta Hunt mine and Higginsville gold operations, is expected to enhance Ramelius's production capacity, with Karora projected to produce between 170,000 to 195,000 ounces of gold in 2024.

3. Ramelius has experienced a strong financial performance, with a 14% increase in revenue to $348.5 million and a 39% rise in EBITDA to $140.2 million, attributed to favorable gold prices and high-grade ore from the Mt Magnet Mill, which has contributed to a nearly 48% rise in share value over the past year.

4. The urgency for Ramelius to secure new assets is underscored by the anticipated production slump from the Edna May asset, which now represents only 2% of the company's reserves, and the need to replace it as production is expected to decline significantly by the 2025 financial year.

5. Ramelius's strategic acquisition efforts follow its previous purchase of Musgrave Minerals in September, indicating a proactive approach to consolidating its position in the gold mining sector amidst challenges related to aging assets and future production sustainability.
