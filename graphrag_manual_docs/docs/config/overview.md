# Configuring GraphRAG Indexing

## Default Configuration Mode

The GraphRAG system is highly configurable. This page provides an overview of the configuration options available for the GraphRAG indexing engine.

The default configuration mode is the simplest way to get started with the GraphRAG system. It is designed to work out-of-the-box with minimal configuration. The primary configuration sections for the Indexing Engine pipelines are described below. The main ways to set up GraphRAG in Default Configuration mode are via:

- Init command (recommended)
- Using YAML for deeper control
- Purely using environment variables (not recommended)
