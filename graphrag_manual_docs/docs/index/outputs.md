The default pipeline produces a series of output tables that align with the conceptual knowledge model. This page describes the detailed output table schemas. By default we write these tables out as parquet files on disk.

All tables have two identifier fields:

This is a list of the final communities generated by Leiden. Communities are strictly hierarchical, subdividing into children as the cluster affinity is narrowed.

This is the list of summarized reports for each community.

(Optional) If claim extraction is turned on, this is a list of the extracted covariates. Note that claims are typically oriented around identifying malicious behavior such as fraud, so they are not useful for all datasets.

List of document content after import.

List of all entities found in the data by the LM.

List of all entity-to-entity relationships found in the data by the LM. This is also the edge list for the graph.

List of all text chunks parsed from the input documents.
